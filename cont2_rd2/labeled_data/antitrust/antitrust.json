    "summary": "1. **Summary**: In this case, GovernmentGPT (“GovGPT”), an AI-focused startup, sued Axon Enterprise, Microsoft, and Safariland for alleged antitrust violations and false advertising. GovGPT claimed that these companies engaged in illegal acquisitions and anticompetitive actions, particularly alleging that Microsoft's exclusive cloud service agreement with Axon and Safariland's sale of a subsidiary to Axon harmed competition. The court dismissed the case against all defendants, citing lack of personal jurisdiction over Safariland, and finding GovGPT failed to sufficiently allege an antitrust injury or state a claim for relief.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: The main legal issues include whether the court has personal jurisdiction over the defendants, especially Safariland, and whether GovGPT had sufficiently alleged antitrust injuries to establish standing under the Sherman and Clayton Acts.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court dismissed the case against Safariland due to lack of personal jurisdiction and dismissed the claims against Microsoft and Axon for failure to allege plausible antitrust injuries and articulate a valid legal claim. The court allowed GovGPT an opportunity to file an amended complaint to address these deficiencies.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine if three big companies, who are like the popular kids on the playground, were accused by a new kid, GovGPT, of unfairly teaming up and not letting anyone else join their games. The new kid says this stops others from playing and having fun. But when they went to the playground referee, the referee didn’t see enough evidence or bad behavior from the popular kids. So, the referee told the new kid to go try again, but he needs a better reason and more proof next time to even consider doing something about it.",

No. CV-24-01869 -PHX -SMB  \n \nORDER  \n \n  \n Before the Court are Microsoft Corporation (“Microsoft”), Axon Enterprise Inc. \n(“Axon”) , and Safariland LLC’s  (“Safariland”)  separate Motions to Dismiss ( Doc. 90; Doc. \n106; Doc. 110; Doc. 111)  Plaintiff GovernmentGPT Inc.’s (“GovGPT”) First Amended \nComplaint  (“FAC”)  (Doc. 74) .  The briefing is complete , and the Motions  are ripe.  Having \nreviewed the briefing and the relevant case law, the Court will grant  Axon’s Motion , grant  \nMicrosoft’s Motion, and grant  Safariland’s Motion  to Dismiss for Lack of Personal \nJurisdiction (Doc. 110 ) but  deny  Safariland’s  Motion to Dismiss for Failure to State a \nClaim (Doc. 111) as moot . \nI. BACKGROUND  \nDespite the FAC clocking in at just under one -hundred and ten pages, the \nbackground of this case is rather straightforward.  In capsule form , this action  arises from  \na series of alleged illegal acquisitions and anticompetitive agreements occurring between  \nthe named Defendants.   (See Doc. 74.)   Now, b efore describing  the background o f those \nclaims , the Court will briefly discuss the procedural history of this case . Case 2:24-cv-01869-SMB     Document 146     Filed 03/07/25     Page 1 of 40 \n- 2 -  \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n A. Procedural History  \nGovGPT  and a group of now -excised Plaintiffs  filed their Initial  Complaint on July \n29, 2024.  (Doc. 1.)  They concurrently filed  a Motion for Preliminary Injunction titled:  \n“Emergency Motion for Immediate Order to Prohibit use of Axon Body 4 Cameras at \nPolitical Events,” citing the potential danger Quectel “chips” housed in the  Axon Body 4 \n(the “AB4”) .  (Doc. 2  at 2.)  Shortly after the filings, this  Court set a telephonic status \nconference to discuss the Motion (Doc. 23) .  At that conference, the Court a nnounced that \nit would  forego a hearing and  take the Motion under advisement.  (Doc. 51.)  \nWhile the Court was considering the request for a preliminary injunction, Axon and \nMicrosoft filed Motions to Dismiss the Initial Complaint.  (Doc. 66; Doc. 67; Doc. 68.) \nShortly thereafter, the Court  denied GovGPT’s Motion for Preliminary Injunction (Doc. \n2), finding that the Motion , the supporting memoranda, and the initial Complaint failed to \nsupport ordering the requested relief.  ( See Doc. 71.)  In that Order , the Court scrutinized \nGovGPT’s allegations about  the Quectel “chips ,” finding them to be unsu bstantiated.  (See \nid.)  There, the  Court also ordered GovGPT and former Plaintiff Raj Abhyanker to appear \nfor a hearing  in which they needed to (1) justify the filing of the “emergency motion” \nabsent any actual testing of the AB4 and  (2) to support the repeated allegations that a \nhackable Quectel “chip” is used in the AB4.  ( Id. at 11.)   \nAt the hearing, the Court asked Mr. Abhyanker whether he had  tested or specifically \nidentified the presence of a Quectel “chip”  in the AB4 that was  susceptible to hacking by \nthe Chinese Communist Party.  (Doc. 105 at  25–26.)  Mr. Ab hyanker responded, stating : \nThey are unidentified chips, not all of them are identified. Some of them are \nfrom Qualcomm, some are not identified, but there is an ESMT chip which \nhas a label on that directly. If you look that up, directly up right now, it is a \nchip that’s made in the People’s Republic of China and Taiwan. And so it’s \nnot true to say they’re all Quectel chips. There is a whole bunch of other \nsmaller chips underneath there — \n. . . . \nWell, an integrated circuit board is what I called a chip, an integrated circuit \nboard having chips thereon. I should have called it a module,  \n. . . . \nTaiwan is the People’s Republic of China, isn’t it?  Case 2:24-cv-01869-SMB     Document 146     Filed 03/07/25     Page 2 of 40 \n- 3 -  \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n (Id. at 26, 30.)  T hese statements, among others, led the  Court  to find  that the Quectel chip \nallegations and Emergency Motion were  brought in bad faith .  (Id. at 31–32.)  \nConsequently , the Court sanctioned Mr. Abhyanker.  ( Id.) \nThen, o n September 22, 2024, GovGPT filed its FAC , which added  Safariland as a \nDefendant  and regurgitated many of the allegations in the Initial Complaint.  (Doc. 74.)   \nSafariland has filed two Motions to Dismiss the FAC, one for lack of personal jurisdiction \nand the other for failure to state a claim.  (Doc. 110; Doc. 111.)  Axon and Microsoft also \nfiled new Motions to Dismiss for failure to state claim.  (Doc. 106; Do c. 90.)  \nOn December 20, 2024, GovGPT gave notice to the Court and Defendants of its \nintent to “Seek Motion before the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation to Consolidate \nand Transfer the Cases to One District ,” (Doc. 123 ; Doc. 124 ), and sought a stay pending \na panel decision (Doc. 144).  The Court denied issuing a stay.   (Doc. 144 .)  Defendants \nhave oppose d consolidating the case and have requested  expedite d consideration of the \npending Motions to Dismiss .  (Doc. 127; Doc. 131.)   This Order follows Defendant s’ \nrequest.  (Doc. 14 4.)  \nB. The FAC  \n1. The Parties  \nGovGPT is a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business in California.  \n(Doc. 74 ¶  4.)  It is an early -stage startup that develops and markets artificial intelligence \ntechnologies, such as 360 -degree body camera vests.  (Doc. 74 ¶  4.)  The company also \noffers a digital evidence management system  (“DEMS”) , hostable on “AWS, Microsoft, \nGoogle Cloud,  private storage,  or other vendors. ”  (Id. ¶ 25.)  It seeks to compete with \nAxon in the market for body -worn cameras  (“BWC s”) and DEMS.  ( See generally id. )  \nAlthough, GovGPT does not operate in the “Public Safety Video Integration and \nManagement Platforms ,” market but intends to compete directly with Axon at some \nundesignated future time.  ( Id. ¶ 25 n.2.)  \nDefendants in this case include Axon, Microsoft, and Safariland.  Axon is a publicly \ntraded Delaware Corporation with its principal place of business in Arizona.  ( Id. ¶ 5.)  Case 2:24-cv-01869-SMB     Document 146     Filed 03/07/25     Page 3 of 40 \n- 4 -  \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n Axon designs, manufactures, and sells, among other things, BWCs  and DEMS.  ( Id.)  The \nFAC claims that  Axon supplies over 94% of American law enforcement agencies.  ( Id. ¶ \n2.)  Axon’s DEMS, Evidence.com, is an integrated software product that works in \nconjunction with Axon’s BWCs , including the AB4.  ( Id. ¶¶ 2, 109, 175.)  Microsoft is a \npublicly traded technology company incorporated in Washington and maintains \ndatacenters in El Mirage and Goodyear, Arizona.  ( Id. ¶ 6.)  The FAC  allege s that Axon \nexclusivel y uses Microsoft’s cloud platform, Microsoft Azure, to store footage uploaded \nto Axon’s Evidence.com platform .  (Doc. 13 ¶  5; Doc. 74 ¶  41.)  Safariland is a \nDelaware -organized limited liability company headquartered in Florida.  ( Doc. 74 ¶ 7.)  \nThe antitrust violations asserted against it in this case center around the 2018 sale  to Axon  \nof former  Safariland  subsidiary, VieVu, LLC (“VieVu”).  ( Id. ¶ 27.) \n2. The Claims  \nGovGPT asserts  the following claims for relief: (1) false advertising under the \nLanham Act; (2) violation of Section  7 of the Clayton Act; (3) conspiracy to retrain trade \nin violation of Section  1 of the Sherman Act; (4) monopolization in violation of Section  2 \nof the Sherman Act; (5) attempted monopolization in violation of Section  2 of the Sherman \nAct; (6) conspiracy to monopolize in violation of Section 2 of the Sherman Act; and (7) \nviolation of California Unfair Competition Law (the “UCL”) .  (See Doc. 74.)    \nFor the Lanham Act and UCL claims, GovGPT alleges that Axon makes several \nfalse or misleading statements on its “Responsibility” and “Principles” webpages.  ( See id. \n¶¶ 152–191, 310 –317.)  Regarding the antitrust claims , GovGPT alleges that Axon violated \nthe Clayton and Sherman Acts when it acquired Fusus, a real -time crime center (“RTCC”) \ncompany.  ( See Doc. 74 ¶¶  200–205, 267 –283.)  Similarly, GovGPT alleges that  both Axon \nand Safariland violated the Clayton and Sherman Acts when  Safariland sold VieV u to \nAxon.  ( See id. ¶¶ 192 –266, 284 –309.)  Additionally, GovGPT alleges that Axon and \nMicrosoft violated the Sherman Act by enter ing an anticompetitive cloud services \nagreement in 2018.  ( See id. ¶¶ 231 –248, 284–309.)   Axon ’s alleged violations are also \nbased on  the acquisitions and agreements having created a self -contained BWC and DEMS Case 2:24-cv-01869-SMB     Document 146     Filed 03/07/25     Page 4 of 40 \n- 5 -  \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n ecosystem that prevents competitors from meaningfully participating the market.  ( See \ngenerally id. ) \nThe FAC also asserts many of the same claims regarding the Quectel “chips” but \nnow labels them “modules” and “components.”  ( See, e.g. , id. ¶¶ 53–55, 58, 61, 154 –157, \n213.)  These claims echo the same concern s about the Chinese Community Party being \nable to exploit  the Quectel “components” or “modules”  to compromise national security.   \n(See, e.g. , id ¶¶ 154 –157, 164, 167, 213, 265, 311.)  Like the Initial Complaint , the FAC \ndoes not  allege that GovGPT has tested the “components” or “modules.”  ( See id. )  Instead, \nGovGPT generally alleges that several congresspersons and persons testifying before \nCongress have noted the danger of Quectel IoT Modules  (See id.  ¶¶ 78–79), and that \nGovGPT  “warned” Axon about the danger of Quectel chips.  ( Id. ¶ 85.) \nII. LEGAL STANDARD  \nA. Rule 12(b)(2)  \nPersonal jurisdiction refers to the power that a court has over the parties.  This \njurisdiction is proper when it is provided for by law and the exercise of jurisdiction \ncomports with due process.  Walden v. Fiore , 571 U.S. 277, 28 3 (2014).  “Federal courts \nordinarily follow state law in determining the bounds of their jurisdiction over persons.” \nDaimler AG v. Bauman , 571 U.S. 117, 125 (2014).  Arizona has authorized its courts to \nexercise jurisdiction over persons “to the maximum extent permitted by  . . . the United \nStates Constitution.”  Ariz. R. Civ. P. 4.2(a).  \nDue process requires that a  defendant have at least “minimum contacts” with the \nforum state so that “maintenance of the suit does not offend traditional notions of fair play \nand substantial justice.”  Int’l Shoe Co. v. Wash ., 326 U.S. 310, 316 (1945)  (internal \nquotations omitted) .  “[T]he defendant’s conduct and connection with the forum State \n[must be] such that he should reasonably anticipate being haled into court there.”  \nWorld -Wide Volkswagen Corp. v. Woodson , 444 U.S. 286, 297 (1980).  When analyzing  \nsufficient minimum contacts, courts distinguish between general jurisdiction and specific \njurisdiction.  General jurisdiction exists when the defendant has “continuous and Case 2:24-cv-01869-SMB     Document 146     Filed 03/07/25     Page 5 of 40 \n- 6 -  \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n systematic” contacts with the forum state, whereas specific jurisdiction exists when the \ncontroversy arises from or is related to the defendant’s contact with the forum state.  See \nHelicopteros Nacionales de Colombia , S.A.  v. Hall , 466 U.S. 408, 414 –16 (1984).   The \ncourt “employ[s] a three -part test to assess whether a defendant has sufficient contacts with \nthe forum state ” to establish specific personal jurisdiction:  \n(1) The non -resident defendant must purposefully direct his activities or \nconsummate some transaction with the forum or resident thereof; or perform \nsome act by which he purposefully avails himself of the privilege of \nconducting activities in the forum, th ereby invoking the benefits and \nprotections of its laws;  \n(2) the claim must be one which arises out of or relates to the defendant’s \nforum -related activities; and  \n(3) the exercise of jurisdiction must comport with fair play and substantial \njustice, i.e. it must be reasonable.  \nPicot v. Weston , 780 F.3d 1206, 1211 (9th Cir. 2015).   “The plaintiff bears the burden of \nsatisfying the first two prongs of the test.”  Schwarzenegger  v. Fred Martin Motor Co. , 374 \nF.3d 797, 802 (9th Cir. 2004) .  If the plaintiff satisfies the first two prongs, “the burden \nthen shifts to the defendant to ‘present a compelling case’ that the exercise of jurisdiction \nwould not be reasonable.”  Id. (quoting Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz , 471 U.S. 4 62, \n477 (1985)).  \nB. Rule 12(b)(6)  \nTo survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion for failure to state a claim, a complaint must meet \nthe requirements of Rule 8(a)(2).  Rule 8(a)(2) requires a “short and plain statement of the \nclaim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief,” so that the defendant has “fair notice \nof what the  . . . claim is and the grounds upon which it rests.”  Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly , \n550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007) (quoting Conley v. Gibson , 355 U.S. 41, 47 (1957)).  This exists \nif the pleader sets forth “factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable \ninference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged .”  Ashcroft v. Iqbal , 556 \nU.S. 662, 678 (2009).  “Threadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of action, supported \nby mere conclusory statements, do not suffice.”  Id. \nDismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) “can be based on the lack of a cognizable legal theory Case 2:24-cv-01869-SMB     Document 146     Filed 03/07/25     Page 6 of 40 \n- 7 -  \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n or the absence of sufficient facts alleged under a cognizable legal theory.”  Balistreri v. \nPacifica Police Dep’t , 901 F.2d 696, 699 (9th Cir. 1988).  A complaint that sets forth a \ncognizable legal theory will survive a motion to dismiss if it contains sufficient factual \nmatter, which, if accepted as true, states a claim to relief that is “plausible on its face.”  \nIqbal , 556 U.S. at 678 (quoting Twombly , 550 U.S. at 570).   Plausibility does not equal \n“probability,” but requires “more than a sheer possibilit y that a defendant has acted \nunlawfully.”  Id.  “Where a complaint pleads facts that are ‘merely consistent with’ a \ndefendant’s liability, it ‘stops short of the line between possibility and plausibility .’”  Id. \n(quoting Twombly , 550 U.S. at 557).  \nIn ruling on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, the well -pled factual allegations are \ntaken as true and construed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.  Cousins v. \nLockyer , 568 F.3d 1063, 1067 (9th Cir. 2009).  However, legal conclusions couched as \nfactual allegations are not given a presumption of truthfulness, and “conclusory allegations \nof law and unwarranted inferences are not sufficient to defeat a motion to dismiss.”  Pareto \nv. FDIC , 139 F.3d 696, 699 (9th Cir. 1998).  A court ordinarily  may not consider evidence \noutside the pleadings in ruling on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss.  See United States v. \nRitchie , 342 F.3d 903, 907 (9th Cir. 2003).  “A court may, however, consider \nmaterials —documents attached to the complaint, documents incorporated by reference in \nthe complaint, or matters of judicial notice —without converting the motion to dismiss into \na motion for summary judgment.”  Id. at 908.  \nC. Rule 9(b)  \nClaims sounding in fraud or mistake are subject to the heightened pleading \nrequirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b), which requires that a plaintiff \nalleging fraud “must state with particularity the circumstances constituting fraud.”   Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 9(b); see also Kearns v. Ford Motor Co. , 567 F.3d 1120, 1124 (9th Cir.  2009).  To \nsatisfy Rule 9(b), the allegations must be “specific enough to give defendants notice of the \nparticular misconduct which is alleged to constitute the fraud charged so that they can \ndefend against the charge and not just deny that they have done anything wrong.”  Semegen Case 2:24-cv-01869-SMB     Document 146     Filed 03/07/25     Page 7 of 40 \n- 8 -  \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n v. Weidner , 780 F.2d 727, 731 (9th Cir.  1985).  Thus, claims sounding in fraud must allege \n“an account of the ‘time, place, and specific content of the false representations as well as \nthe identities of the parties to the misrepresentations.’”  Swartz v. KPMG LLP , 476 F.3d \n756, 764 (9th Cir.2007) (per curiam).   The plaintiff must set forth “what is false or \nmisleading about a statement, and why it is false.”  In re Glenfed, Inc. Sec. Litig. , 42 F.3d \n1541, 1548 (9th Cir.  1994) (en banc), superseded by statut e on other grounds as stated in \nRonconi v. Larkin , 253 F.3d 423, 429 n. 6 (9th Cir.2001).  \nIII. DISCUSSION  \nA. Judicial Notice  \nIn ruling on a motion to dismiss, the Court may consider “matters of judicial notice,” \nsee United States v. Ritchie , 342 F.3d 903, 908 (9th Cir. 2003), including information that \nis “generally known within the trial court’s territorial jurisdiction; or can be accurately and \nreadily determined from sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned,” Fed. \nR. Evid. 2 01(b); but see Khoja v. Orexigen Therapeutics, Inc. , 899 F.3d 988, 999 (9th Cir. \n2018) (“[A] court cannot take judicial notice of disputed fa cts contained in . . . public \nrecords.”).  Importantly, considering matters of judicial notice does not transmute a motion \nto dismiss into one for summary judgment.  See Ritchie , 342 F.3d at  908.  Moreover, a \ncourt should not accept as true “allegations that contradict matters properly subject to \njudicial notice,” nor “allegations that are merely conclusory, unwarranted deductions of \nfact, or unreasonable inferences.”  In re Gilead Scis. Sec. Litig. , 536 F.3d 1049, 1055 (9th \nCir. 2008) (citation omitted).  Proper subjects of judicial notice include judgments and \nother court documents.  See, e.g. , United States v. Black , 482 F.3d 1035, 1041 (9th Cir. \n2007); see also Khoja , 899 F.3d  at 999 (“Just because the document itself is susceptible to \njudicial notice does not mean that every assertion of fact within that document is judicially \nnoticeable for its truth.”).  \n GovGPT asks the Court to take judicial notice of an opinion issued in a case \ninvolving Axon’s acquisition of Vie Vu in the District Court of New Jersey.  (Doc. 145.)   \nSince the time of the request, the case  has been made available on Westlaw.  See In re Axon Case 2:24-cv-01869-SMB     Document 146     Filed 03/07/25     Page 8 of 40 \n- 9 -  \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n Vievu Antitrust Litig ., No. 23 -7182 (RK) (RLS), 2025 WL 366751, at *1 (D.N.J.  Jan. 31, \n2025).  Seeing no objection, the Court will grant  GovGPT’s Motion (Doc. 145)  and take \njudicial notice of the opinion . \nB. Safariland’s Motions to Dismiss (Doc. 110; Doc. 111)  \nIn its first Motion to Dismiss, Safariland  offers two arguments for why this Court \nlacks personal jurisdiction over it: (1) Section 12 of the Clayton Act does not apply to \nlimited liability companies (“LLCs”), like Safariland; and (2) Safariland lacks sufficient \nminimum contacts with Arizona.   (Doc. 110 at  6.)  Unsurprisingly, GovGPT  disagrees.  \n(See generally Doc. 117.)  \n1. Section 12 of the Clayton Act  \nSection 12 provides:  \nAny suit, action, or proceeding under the antitrust laws against a corporation \nmay be brought not only in the judicial district whereof it is an inhabitant, \nbut also in any district wherein it may be found or transacts business; and all \nprocess in such cas es may be served in the district of which it is an inhabitant, \nor wherever it may be found.  \n15 U.S.C. § 22.  With respect to corporations, the Ninth Circuit has held that “the \nworldwide service provision of [ Section] 12 justifies [the] conclusion that personal \njurisdiction may be established in any district, given the existence of sufficient national \ncontacts.”  Go-Video, Inc. v. Akai Elec. Co. , 885 F.2d 1406, 1415 (9th Cir. 1989).   Here, \nas with other cases, the parties’ fervently dispute whether Section 12 applies to LLCs .  By \nits plain  terms, the statute governs service upon “corporations.”  See 15 U.S.C. §  22.   \nFaced with whether Section 12  applied to a “voluntary association,” one district \ncourt reasoned:  \n“Persons, ” as defined in the Clayton Act, are “deemed to  include \ncorporations and associations ”; yet section 12 of the  same act, which \nauthorizes extraterritorial service, specifies  only “corporation. ” This \nspecificity necessarily excludes  individuals and voluntary associations from \nthose amenable  to extraterritorial service.  \nMcManus v. Tato , 184 F. Supp. 958 , 959  (S.D.N.Y. 1959) (cleaned up).  Safariland \ncontends that this reasoning  also applies to LLCs because Congress has not extended  \nSection 12 to unincorporated entities.  (Doc. 110 at  7.)  Th e Court agrees.

(Doc. 117 at  5 (citing Keeton v. Hustler Magazine, \nInc., 465 U.S. 770 (1984) ).)  In the same breath, however, GovGPT admits that its offered \nauthority is “not directly related to Section 12.”  ( Id.)  Indeed, Keeton  dealt with the \napplication of one state’s long arm state and the traditional minimum contacts analy sis to \nassert jurisdiction in a libel action.  465 U.S. at  770.  Despite offering no apposite authority, \nGovGPT posits that the Court ought to extend its jurisdiction based on “the functional \ninvolvement of entities in relevant conduct affecting the forum state.”  ( Doc. 117 at  5.)  \nThis approach not only comes before the Court without support, but also contravenes the \nwealth of well -reasoned, persuasive case law offered by Safariland.  Therefore, the Court \nrejects GovGPT’s arguments.  Case 2:24-cv-01869-SMB     Document 146     Filed 03/07/25     Page 10 of 40 \n- 11 -  \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n  Based upon the statute’s plain language, and the supporting persuasive case law, \nthere is no question that Section 12 does not apply to Safariland.  As an LLC, and not a \ncorporation, it is not subject to the jurisdictional hook that 15 U.S.C. §  22 provide s.  \nTherefore, whether the Court has personal jurisdiction over Safariland must be determined \nthrough a traditional minimum contacts analysis.  \n2. Minimum Contacts  \nSafariland argues that this Court lacks personal jurisdiction over it because (1) it \ndoes not have continuous or systematic contacts with Arizona; and (2) it does not \npurposefully direct activities at Arizona residents such that litigation would arise out of \nthose activities.  (Doc. 110 at  8–11.)  To support this argument, Safariland points out that \nit owns no property in Arizona, employs one remote employee in the state, and its sales in \nthe state are not related to BWCs or DEMS.  (Doc. 110 at  9–10.)  In  response, GovGPT \ncontends that Safariland’s sale of VieVu to Axon in 2018, coupled with extensive \nnon-compete agreements, satisfies minimum contacts such that the Court has jurisdiction \nover Safariland.  (Doc. 117 at  5–8.) \nThe traditional minimum contacts analysis requires the  Court to determine whether \nit has “general” or “specific” personal jurisdiction over Safariland.  See Bristol -Myers \nSquibb Co. v. Super. Ct. of Cal. , 582 U.S. 255, 262 (2017).   General jurisdiction exists over \nentities where its forum state “affiliations” are “so continuous and systematic as to render \n[it] essentially at home.”  Daimler , 571 U.S. at  139.  Generally, an entity is “at home” in \nits place of organization and its principal place of business .  Id. at 134.  Safariland is an \nLLC  organized in Delaware and headquartered in Florida.  (Doc. 74 ¶  7; Doc. 110 at  9.)  \nTherefore, under the traditional “at home” view, the Court would not have general \njurisdiction over Safariland.  See Daimler , 571 U.S. at  139.  Safariland further posits that \nthe Court lacks general jurisdiction over it because it owns no real property in Arizona, \nemploys a single remote employee in the state, and does not sell BWCs or DEMS in \nArizona .  (See Doc. 110 at  9; Doc. 110 -1 at 2 ¶¶ 6–9.)  GovGPT seemingly does not attempt \nto rebut this argument.  At bottom,  Court agrees that Safariland’s limited contacts with Case 2:24-cv-01869-SMB     Document 146     Filed 03/07/25     Page 11 of 40 \n- 12 -  \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n Arizona precludes finding that the Court possesses general personal jurisdiction over the \ncompany.  \nSpecific jurisdiction exists when an out -of-state defendant (1) purposefully directs \nhis activities at residents of the forum state, or purposefully avails himself of the privilege \nof conducting activities in the forum; (2) the asserted claim must be one arising out of the \ndefendant’s forum related activities; and (3) exercising jurisdiction must be reasonable.  \nPicot , 780 F.3d at 1211 .  GovGPT “ bears the burden of satisfying the first two prongs of \nthe test.”  See Schwarzenegger , 374 F.3d at 802. \nRegarding prong one and two, GovGPT asserts that Safariland’s intentional act was \nselling  VieVu to Axon and executing  the related non -compete agreements.  (Doc. 117 \nat 5–6.)  According to GovGPT, Safariland knew that selling VieVu to Axon would “have \nsubstantial effects in Arizona.”  ( Id. at 6.)  Further, GovGPT contends that the Court “must \nlook beyond” Safariland’s incorporation and headquarters, and instead consider that \nSafariland holds a vested financial interest in Axon’s Arizona -based monopoly thr ough \nstock arrangements and Axon’s monopolistic pricing.  (Doc. 117 at  6–7.) \nGovGPT’s muddled allegations and argument misunderstand what “purposeful \ndirection” requires.   To show that Safariland purposefully directed its acts at Arizona, \nGovGPT must show that Safariland has “(1) committed an intentional act, (2) expressly \naimed at the forum state, (3) causing harm that the defendant knows is likely to be suffered \nin the forum state.”  Wash . Shoe Co. v. A -Z Sporting Goods, Inc. , 704 F.3d 668, 673 (9th \nCir. 2012).  The only relevant intentional act that GovGPT contends Safariland di rected at \nArizona was enter a contract to sell VieVu to Axon.  However, “a contract alone does not \nautomatically establish minimum contacts in the plaintiff ’s home forum.”  Boschetto v. \nHansing , 539 F.3d 1011, 1017  (9th Cir. 2008) .  Rather, there must be “actions by the \ndefendant himself that create a ‘substantial connection’ with the forum State.”  Burger \nKing , 471 U.S. at 475  (quoting McGee v. Int ’l Life Ins. , 355 U.S. 220, 223  (1957)) .  Further \nattenuating Safariland’s alleged contacts to Arizona is the argument that the sale of VieVu \nin 2018 was governed by Delaware law without reference to Arizona or its laws.  ( See Doc. Case 2:24-cv-01869-SMB     Document 146     Filed 03/07/25     Page 12 of 40 \n- 13 -  \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n 110 at  11.)  To be sure, as Safariland contends, that transaction involved Safariland, \nDelaware -organized LLC headquartered in Florida, selling VieVu, a \nWashington -organized LLC headquartered in Washington, to Axon, a Delaware -organized \ncorporation headquartered in Arizona.  ( Id.)  Thus, to some degree, Arizona is implicated \nin the sale of VieVu.  However, given the specific facts of this case show that the sale was \nnot purposefully directed at the forum state, nor did Safariland avail itself of Arizona  law \nto affect the transaction.   (See id.) \nThe remainder of GovGPT’s argument is seemingly directed at the fallout from the \nsale of VieVu to Axon.  ( See, e.g. , Doc. 117 at  6 ¶ 13.)  Whether the sale VieVu impacted \n“Arizona’s law enforcement agencies and GovGPT” is not the standard.  Rather, GovGPT \nmust show that Safariland undertook an “external manifestation of  [will]” to direct actions \nat Arizona without rely ing on such act’s “results, even the most direct, immediate, and \nintended.”  Morill v. Scott Fin. Corp. , 873 F.3d 1136, 1142 (9th Cir. 2017).   To affect the \nforum state is not  always  enough, there must be a showing of an intentional act expressly \naimed at it.  Washington Shoe , 704 F.3d at  673.  As Safariland puts it, GovGPT must show \nmore than the alleged effects that the sale of VieVu had on the location of the ultimate \npurchaser —Axon.  (Doc. 12 at  5); see also Helicopteros Nacionales de  Colombia , 466 \nU.S. at 417 (“ [The] u nilateral activity of another party or a third person is not an appropriate \nconsideration when determining whether a defend ant has sufficient contacts with a forum \nState to justify an assertion of jurisdiction.”) . \nTherefore, the Court finds that GovGPT has failed to carry its burden to show that \nSafariland (1) purposefully directs its activities at Arizona; and (2) that the asserted claim \narose from Safariland’s forum related activities.  See Picot , 780 F.3d at 1211 .  As a result, \nSafariland lacks the minimum contacts required for this Court to have personal jurisdiction \nover it.1  Therefore, the Court will grant Safariland’s Motion to Dismiss (Doc. 110) and \n \n1  The FAC alleges that Safariland’s contacts arise from substantial business in this district, \nincluding the sale of BWCs.  (Doc. 74 ¶  22.)  In response, Safariland provided an affidavit  \nfrom its Vice President of Legal and Compliance, who averred that Safariland does not \nmake sales for BWCs or DEMS in Arizona , casting doubt on the plausibility of GovGPT’s \nallegation .  (Doc. 110 -1 at 2 ¶ 9.)  GovGPT does not engage with its own allegation or the \naffidavit in its Response, and instead directs its argument at Safariland’s sale of VieVu to Case 2:24-cv-01869-SMB     Document 146     Filed 03/07/25     Page 13 of 40 \n- 14 -  \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n dismiss it from this case with prejudice.   With this dismissal, Safariland’s other Motion to \nDismiss (Doc. 111) is now moot .  Therefore, the Court will deny that Motion (Doc. 111).  \nC. Microsoft’s Motion to Dismiss (Doc. 90)  \nMicrosoft argues that GovGPT’s FAC must be dismissed because: (1) the claims \nare time barred; (2) GovGPT  has not pleaded an antitrust injury and therefore lacks \nstanding; and (3) the FAC does not plausibly allege an unlawful agreement.2  (Doc. 90 \nat 6–7.)  For the reasons set forth, the Court agrees with Microsoft.  \n1. The Statute of Limitations and Antitrust Standing  \nUnder federal antitrust laws, an action must be commenced within four years after \nthe cause of action accrues.  See Zenith Radio Corp. v. Hazeltine Rsch., Inc. , 401 U.S. 321, \n338 (1971); see also In  re Animation Workers Antitrust Litig. , 87 F. Supp. 3d 1195, 12 11 \n(N.D. Cal. 2015) (dismissing antitrust claims as time barred).  “A cause of action in \nantitrust accrues each time a plaintiff is injured by an act of the defendant and the statute \nof limitations runs from the commission of the act.”  See Pace Indus., Inc. v. Three Phx . \nCo., 813 F.2d 234, 237 (9th Cir. 1987) (citation omitted).   A plaintiff may plead that a \ndefendant’s acts constitute a continuing violation, in which case allegations of “an ov ert \nact by the defendant is required to restart the statute of limitations and the statute runs from \nthe last overt act.”  Id.; see also Klehr v. A.O. Smith Corp. , 521 U.S. 179, 189 (1997).   \nHere, GovGPT  alleges that Microsoft injured it by entering into an unlawful \nagreement with Axon in 2018, which was then extended in 2022 (the “2022 Extension”).  \n(Doc. 74 ¶¶  26–27, 40, 44, 208 –212.)  Because GovGPT’s claims accrued when Microsoft \nand Axon executed the 2018 agreement, the inquiry becomes whether the 2022 Extension \nwas a continuing violation.  See Pace Indus tries, 813 F.2d at  237. \nCourts in the Ninth Circuit have explained that pleading a continuing violation \n \nAxon.  ( See Doc. 117.)   The Court, therefore, finds that GovGPT has conceded the \nallegation regarding Safariland’s sale of BWCs in Arizona.  See Morgan v. Kalaco \nScientific, Inc. , No. CV -07-0786 -PHX -SRB, 2008 WL 11449239, at *2 (D. Ariz. Mar. 5, \n2008) (“ Generally, where a party fails to respond to a non -frivolous legal argument raised \nby opposing counsel in a dispositive motion, that argument is deemed conceded. ”). \n2  Microsoft also moves to dismiss Plaintiff’s Clayton Act claim.  Plaintiff states that it has \nnot alleged such a claim against Microsoft.  (Doc. 94 at  10.)  Therefore, the Court will not \naddress the parties’ arguments on the Clayton Act claim.  Case 2:24-cv-01869-SMB     Document 146     Filed 03/07/25     Page 14 of 40 \n- 15 -  \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n requires more than “bald assertion[s]” that a defendant adhered to, enforced, and reaffirmed \nthe alleged anticompetitive agreements.  See, e.g. , Garrison v. Oracle Corp. , 159 F. Supp. \n3d 1044, 1070 –71 (N.D. Cal. 2016); Ryan v. Microsoft Corp. , 147 F. Supp. 3d 868, 884 \n(N.D. Cal. 2015) (finding allegations that defendant had non -solicitation agreements it \n“maintained and renewed” to be “insufficient to quality for the continuing violation \ndoctrine”).  For a continuing violation to restart the limitations p eriod, GovGPT must plead \nan overt act that (1) “[is] a new and independent act that is not merely a reaffirmation of a \nprevious act”; and (2) “[the overt act] must inflict [a] new and accumulating injury on the \nplaintiff.”  See Pace Indus. , 813 F.2d at  238. \nGovGPT ’s allegations regarding the 2022 Extension are inconsistent and difficult \nto follow.  For example, it alleges that the 2022 Extension “grant[ed] Microsoft continued \nexclusive access to the extensive law enforcement data.”  (Doc. 74 ¶  208.)  And “[t]hrough \nthe 2022 extension, Microsoft maintained  exclusive control over Axon’s body camera \ndata,” (Doc. 74 ¶  209), which “enabled Microsoft to monopolize AI development  . . . by \nproviding it with unparallelled access to data that competitors could not obtai n, (Id. ¶ 210).  \nThen, however, GovGPT seemingly asserts that only after the 2022 Extension did the \nagreement require Axon’s Evidence.com platform “to work exclusively with Microsoft \nAzure.”  ( Id. ¶ 41.)  In his Response  to the Motion , GovGPT explains that the 2022 \nExtension “included new terms granting Microsoft ongoing  exclusive access to Axon’s \nbody camera data and related AI technologies.”  (Doc. 94 at  3 (emphasis added).); cf. \nSamsung Elecs. Co. v. Panasonic Corp. , 747 F.3d 1199, 1204 (9th Cir. 2014) ( expanding \na license agreement in 2006 to include products not covered by the previous 2003 license \nagreement was an overt act because the “2003 license did not contemplate future \nexpansion”).  \nOn one hand, GovGPT seems to  allege that Microsoft and Axon extended, \nmaintained, and reinforced its existing agreement, which would not amount to an overt act.  \nSee Pace Indus tries, 813 F.2d at  238.  On the other, GovGPT’s  allegations suggest that the \n2022 Extension added “exclusivity” terms that were not part of the 2018 cloud storage Case 2:24-cv-01869-SMB     Document 146     Filed 03/07/25     Page 15 of 40 \n- 16 -  \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n contract, including a term that “requires [Axon’s] Evidence.com platform to work \nexclusively with Microsoft Azure.”  (Doc. 74 ¶ 41; see also id. ¶¶ 40, 42, 44.)  However, \nGovGPT has not expressly pleaded what terms in the 2022 Extension are “new” to satisfy \nthe continuing violation requirement of a new and independent act that inflicts a new and \naccumulating injury.  See Ryan 147 F. Supp. 3d at  884 (“[W]here the defendant entered \ninto an allegedly unlawful contract prior to the limitations period, the defe ndant still must \ntake an unlawful new and independent act that is not merely a reaffirmation of a previous \nact during the limitations period.” (quotation marks omitted)).  And, reading the allegations \nin the light most favorable to GovGPT , the Court cannot determine what aspect of any \ncognizable “new” allegations materially changed the agreement such that the 2022 \nExtension was an overt act by Microsoft.  See id.  \n GovGPT does draw the Court’s attention to the following allegation, which it \nbelieves shows an overt act:  \nMicrosoft has been known to offer better pricing and incentives, like cloud \ncredits, to entice companies to move more data to Azure. Microsoft ’s \npreferential  pricing strategy, such as offering $500 million in Azure credits \nexclusively to OpenAI, gives preferential pricing or better terms to select \npartners. Upon information and belief, this preferential pricing was extended \nto Axon.  \n(Doc. 74 ¶  40; Doc. 94 at  3–4.)  According to GovGPT , Microsoft’s pricing strategy \n“reinforced the barriers to entry for competitors,” and has ostensibly cost GovGPT \nopportunities and profit.  (Doc. 94 at  4.)  Even assuming that this allegation is true, it has \nnothing to do with the 2022 Extension that GovGPT so fervently believes reset the statute \nof limitations.   And, as Microsoft has pointed out, offering discounts or incentives  \ngenerally cannot support a separate antitrust claim.  (Doc. 90 at  18 (citin g Brooke Grp. Ltd. \nv. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp. , 509 U.S. 209, 223 –24 (1993) (analyzing a \npredatory pricing claim under §  2 of the Sherman Act requires showing “prices complained \nof are below an appropriate measure of its rival’s costs  . . . . [And] demonstrat[ing] that the \ncompetitor had a reasonable prospect  . . . of re couping its investment in below -cost \nprices”).  As it stands, Plaintiff has done no more than allege that Microsoft use s an \neffective pricing model to entice business es to use its Azure cloud service rather than Case 2:24-cv-01869-SMB     Document 146     Filed 03/07/25     Page 16 of 40 \n- 17 -  \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n competing  services.   Thus , GovGPT has failed to plead  an overt act.  See, e.g. , Garrison , \n159 F. Supp. 3d at  1070 –71; Ryan , 147 F. Supp. 3d at  884. \nEven if GovGPT had pleaded a new and individual act, the FAC fails to allege that \nsuch an act caused a cognizable antitrust injury.  Antitrust laws were designed to redress \ninjuries suffered by plaintiffs “injur[ed] in the market where competition is being \nrestrained.”  Am. Ad Mgmt., Inc. v. Gen. Tele. Co. of Cal. , 190 F.3d 1051, 1057 (9th Cir. \n1999) (“As a broker for the advertisements whose prices are allegedly retrained, [plaintiff] \nis a participant in the relevant market and it has suffered an injury in that market, the loss \nof commissions on advertisement purcha ses.”).3  In other words, the injured party “must \nbe a participant in the same market as the alleged malefactors.”  In re Dynamic Access \nMemory (DRAM) Antitrust Litig. (“DRAM II ”), 536 F. Supp. 2d 1129, 1137 (N.D. Cal. \n2008) (internal quotation marks omitted).  \nHere, GovGPT alleges that the relevant market is “body -worn cameras, digital \nevidence management systems, and public safety video integration and management \nplatforms.”  (Doc. 74 ¶¶  125–28.)  Somewhat troubling, however, is GovGPT’s contention \nthat it “intends  to enter and compete in the digital evidence management market,” (Doc. 94 \nat 10), which calls into question the veracity of its market allegations, ( see Doc. 74  \n¶¶ 125–128.)  If GovGPT has not entered the market, claims that it was injured in such \nmarket are merely speculative, which does not suffice to show injury for an antitrust claim \nor standing purposes.  See DRAM II , 536 F. Supp. 2d at  1137;  Clapper v. Amnesty Int’l \nUSA, 568 U.S. 398, 414 (2013) (finding that a “speculative chain of possibilities” cannot \nestablish an actual or imminent injury in fact); see also City of Oakland v. Oakland Raiders , \n20 F.4th 441, 458 (9th Cir. 2021) (“The harm may not  be derivative and indirect or \nsecondary, consequential, or remote.” (quotation marks omitted)).  T hat concern aside, \nconspicuously absent from the FAC are any allegations of the market in which Microsoft \ncompetes.  ( See generally id. )  Thus, on its face, the FAC does not set forth any allegation \n \n3  An antitrust injury has four requirements: (1) unlawful conduct, (2) causing an injury to \nthe plaintiff, (3) that flows from that which makes the conduct unlawful, and (4) that is of \nthe type that antitrust laws were intended to prevent.  Id.at 1055 –57. \n Case 2:24-cv-01869-SMB     Document 146     Filed 03/07/25     Page 17 of 40 \n- 36 -  \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n competition for them.”).   Although , the Ninth Circuit has found that a competitor who may \ngain from a defendant ’s alleged anticompetitive conduct is not completely precluded from \nshowing an  antitrust injury . Cf. Ellis v. Salt River Proj. Improvement and Power Dist. , 24 \nF.4th 1262,  1274 –75 (9th Cir. 2022).  Although, the Ninth Circuit’s finding  does not \nchange the fact that the plaintiff must plead  a cognizable injury, it may not, as GovGPT \nhas done here, cobble together a mix of consumer, competitor, and conspiracy -based injury \nallegations  related to an acquisition , and hope that the Court pieces the puzzle together.  See \nAtl. Richfield , 495 U.S. at  334. \nGovGPT’s allegations of high barriers to market entry are similarly insufficient.  \n(Doc. 74 ¶  198.)  Aside from declaring that Axon’s anticompetitive  conduct made it \n“infeasible for a competitor” to enter the market, GovGPT provides no factual \nenhancement to demonstrate  that it has been  foreclosed  or impeded  from the opportunity \nof competing in the relevant product market  because of the VieVu acquisition .  (See \ngenerally id. ); cf. Novation Ventures , 156 F. Supp. 3d at  1102 .  Again, the law requires \nGovGPT to  demonstrate that it has suffered an injury the antitrust laws were designed to \nprevent, which requires more than regurgitating the elements in myriad  allegations.  ( See \nDoc. 74 ¶¶  198, 205.)  \nGovGPT also alleges that the acquisition restrained trade because “conceal[ed] \ncritical information about the security vulnerabilities  . . . [of] Quectel modules, and thereby \nmisleading [customers] into buying Axon products.”  ( Id. ¶ 213); Glen Holly En t., 352 F.3d \nat 374  (explaining that antitrust injury may result from “ [c]oercive activity that prevents its \nvictims from making free choices between market alternatives.” )  According to GovGPT, \nbut for Axon’s deception, law enforcement agencies would have bought from c ompeting \nfirms, and this failure to disclose “has distorted the competitive landscape . . . at the expense \nof competitors like Plaintiff.”  ( Id.)  This allegation, however, does not stand up to even \nmodest scrutiny.  First, the procedural history of this case casts some doubt on the \nplausibility of GovGPT’s allegations regarding the Quectel “chips,” “components,” or \n“modules.”  ( See Doc. 7 1; Doc. 105.)  Second, GovGPT’s FAC is unclear as to whether it Case 2:24-cv-01869-SMB     Document 146     Filed 03/07/25     Page 36 of 40 \n- 37 -  \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n is even a competitor.  ( See Doc. 74 ¶¶  88, 133,  163, 177, 202.)  Third, GovGPT alleges no \nmore than bald conclusions that the presence of the Quectel parts actually  led to it losing \nbusiness.  ( See id. ¶ 213.)  And fourth , the link between the acquisition of VieVu, the \nQuectel parts, and GovGPT’s alleged injury is tenuous and nearly incomprehensible.   (See \nid.)  In other words, the FAC not only fails to allege an antitrust injury  for a Section 7 \nclaim , but also fails to comply with the fundamental requireme nt of Rule 8: “a short and \nplain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. \n8(a)(2).   The facts alleged concerning the Quectel parts  do little to enhance GovGPT’s  \ngeneralized allegations of “substantially lessened competition” and “monopolization. ” \nInterestingly included in the Section 7 allegations is the following: “Plaintiff have \n[sic] been injured and have [sic] paid artificially inflated prices for the Products.”  ( Doc. \n74 ¶¶ 228, 233, 253, 261 .)  The same  or similar  allegations of injury are present in Counts \nIII and VI as well.  The FAC is having an identity crisis, as it has failed to the draw the line \nbetween consumer -based injury and competitor -based injury.  GovGPT’s has not pleaded \nan antitrust injury that would confer standing upon it for a Section 7 Clayton Act claim.  \nGovGPT similarly fails to plead an antitrust injury for its Sherman Act claims.  In \nCount III, which alleges a conspiracy to restrain trade, GovGPT contends that Axon entered \ninto several agreement s with Safariland and Microsoft that have reduced competition in \nviolation of Section 1.  (Doc. 74 ¶ 233.)  GovGPT does not plead specific allegations \nregarding the conspiracy to restrain trade as it relates to the VieVu Acquisition.  (See id. )  \nInstead, this  section is largely directed at Axon and Microsoft’s agr eements and hosting of \nbodycam footage.  ( See id.  ¶¶ 231 –248.)  The Court has previously explained that  the \nstatute of limitations bars GovGPT’s  antitrust claims based on the 2018 Microsoft \nagreement.   Additionally, as alleged, it is unclear how the agreements with Safariland \nestablish an injury, as the non -compete provisions have been rescinded.  ( Id. ¶¶ 134, 233 .) \nTo the extent that the injury is premised on the Quectel modules, GovGPT’s claim \nis no more successful.  As explained, those allegations lack plausibility  and factual \nenhancement, making them  at most, an attempt to further support an already rejected Case 2:24-cv-01869-SMB     Document 146     Filed 03/07/25     Page 37 of 40 \n- 38 -  \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n conspiracy theory about the AB4.  Unfortunately, the  allegations in Count III, like most of \nthe FAC, is rife with ultimate, conclusory facts about GovGPT’s alleged  injurie s.  (See, \ne.g., id.  ¶ 238 (“Defendants’ conduct has caused Plaintiff to suffer damages in the form of \ninjuries to their business or property.).)  \nCount IV, which alleges monopolization of the BWC and DEMS markets, GovGPT \ncontends that the VieVu acquisition has resulted in “substantial anticompetitive effects” \nsuch as higher prices in the product markets and injured competition.  (Doc. 74 ¶ 253.)  \nGovGPT goes on to allege that Axon’s conduct has caused it to suffer i njuries to its \nbusiness and property  due to the acquisition and  because of “Axon’s deliberate \nconcealment of the security risks associated with the Quectel Modules . . . mislead \n[consumers ] into adopting Axon’s technology.”  ( Id. ¶ 265.)  Like the preceding Counts, \nthe FAC lacks any factual enhancement to show how the VieVu Acquisition resulted in \ninjurious conduct that has or will injure GovGPT.  ( See id. )  Instead, GovGPT peddles its \nconspiracy theory about the potential danger of Quectel modules and Axon’s deceptive \nsales practices.  ( Id.) \n Similarly, Count VI, which alleges conspiracy to monopolize, does not set forth how \nAxon’s illegal conduct related to the VieVu Acquisition injured GovGPT as a competitor.7  \n(See id. ¶¶ 284–309.)  Even if GovGPT successfully established standing for this claim, it \nwould otherwise fail because it is premised upon a “dual monopoly” theory, upon which a \nSection 2 claim cannot be based.  See Standfacts Credit Serv’s Inc. v. Experian Info. Sol., \nInc., 405 F. Supp. 2d 1141, 1152 –53 (C.D. Cal. 2005) (“[A]n allegation of conspiracy to \ncreate a shared monopoly does not plead a claim of conspiracy under section 2.”); (Doc. \n74 ¶  292 (“[T]he collaboration between Microsoft and Axon establ ished a dual \nmonopoly.”) .) \n Earlier, the Court afforded GovGPT Lanham Act claim some analysis after finding \nthat it lacked standing to bring it.  The same benefit will not be afforded to GovGPT \n \n7 In Count VI, GovGPT contends that competitors are unable to compete in part because \nAxon will not provide competitors with footage from its Evidence.com repository.  ( Id. \n¶ 288.)  Or in other words, GovGPT’s claim is partly based on its issue with the fact that, \nwithout a court order, it cannot utilize Axon’s work for its own gain.  ( See id. ) Case 2:24-cv-01869-SMB     Document 146     Filed 03/07/25     Page 38 of 40 \n- 39 -  \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n regarding its antitrust cl aims, as the FAC and its Response to Axon’s Motion are near \nindecipherable regarding these claims.   GovGPT has consistently misrepresented and \nattempted to rewrite the allegations in its FAC and the precedent upon which it relies.   (See, \ne.g., Doc. 121 at  22 (citing In re Lithium Ion Batteries Antitrust Litigation , \nNo.:13 -MD-2420 YGR, 2024 WL 309192 , at *1 (N.D. Cal. Jan. 21, 2014) ).)   \nOn its face , the FAC is confusing, inconsistent, and as a result, fail s to properly \nplead antitrust injury.  Similarly, the FAC  fails to state a claim for relief under the Lanham \nAct or the UCL.  Consequently, the entire FAC will be dismissed without prejudice as to \nAxon . \nIV. LEAVE TO AMEND  \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(a) requires that leave to amend be “freely give[n] \nwhen justice so requires.”  Leave to amend should not be denied unless “the proposed \namendment either lacks merit or would not serve any purpose because to grant it would  be \nfutile in saving the plaintiff’s suit.”  Universal Mortg. Co. v. Prudential Ins. Co. , 799 F.2d \n458, 459 (9th Cir. 1986).  Therefore, “a district court should grant leave to amend even if \nno request to amend the pleading was made, unless it determines t hat the pleading could \nnot possibly be cured by the allegation of other facts.”  Lopez v. Smith , 203 F.3d 1122, \n1127 (9th Cir. 2000) (cleaned up).  \nHere, GovGPT filed an Initial Complaint, a Proposed Amended Complaint (Doc. \n69) which it later withdrew, and now the FAC (Doc. 74).  Each iteration of the Complaint \nin this case has asserted similar claims, including those claims regarding the potential \ndanger of Quectel “chips,” “components,” or “modules.”   (See Doc. 1; Doc. 69; Doc. 74.)   \nAxon contends that the FAC ought to be dismissed with prejudice because GovGPT has \nhad ample opportunities to cure its deficient allegations and has failed to do so.  (D oc. 106 \nat 32 (citing McHenry v. Renne , 84 F.3d 1172 (9th Cir. 1996)).)  \nThe Court agrees that GovGPT’s FAC fails to state a claim, but it does not believe \nthat all claims in this case should be dismissed with prejudice at this time.   Although the \nCourt can say with certainty that GovGPT has not buried a cognizable claim somewhere Case 2:24-cv-01869-SMB     Document 146     Filed 03/07/25     Page 39 of 40 \n- 40 -  \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n in his 110 -page FAC.  Indeed, the FAC is so long, dense, and inconsistent that GovGPT’s \nclaims often collapse in on themselves.   That notwithstanding, the Court will allow \nGovGPT an additional attempt at amendment.  However, the Court warns GovGPT that its \nSecond Amended Complaint must comply with Rule 8(a).  The Court will not pronounce \na hard -and-fast page limit, but the Court notes that 110 -pages is excessive in a case wherein \na great deal of the alleged facts more to do with supporting a conspiracy theory than \nsubstantiating Lanham Act or antitrust claim s.  It is not lost on the Court that the very \nnature of antitrust actions typically begets a detailed complaint.  However, pleadings in \nsuch cases ought to (1) avoid alleging  a horde of irrelevant, conspiratorial facts; and (2) \ncomport with the requirements that pleadings in federal court be “short and plain.”   See \nFed. R. Civ. P. (8)(a)(2).   Failure to comply with this directive will result in  the dismissal \nof GovGPT’s amended pleading.   If GovGPT wishes to have another bite at the apple, it \nwill file a Second Amended Complaint within thirty (30) days of the date of this Order.  \nV. CONCLUSION  \nAccordingly,  \nIT IS HEREBY ORDERED  granting Safariland’s Motion to Dismiss for Lack of \nPersonal Jurisdiction (Doc. 110) and denying as moot Safariland’s Motion to Dismiss for \nFailure to State a Claim (Doc. 111).  Because the Court cannot exercise jurisdiction over \nSafariland, it will be dismissed from this case with prejudice.  \nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED  granting Microsoft’s Motion to Dismiss  (Doc. 90)  \nand dismissing Microsoft from this case without prejudice.  \nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED  granting Axon’s Motion to Dismiss (Doc. 106) and \ndismissing Axon from this case without prejudice.  \nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED instructing GovGPT that if it wishes to file a \nSecond Amended Complaint, it must do so within thirty (30) days of the date of this Order.  \n Dated this 7th day of March, 2025.  \n \n \nCase 2:24-cv-01869-SMB     Document 146     Filed 03/07/25     Page 40 of 40",

    "summary": "1. Summary:\nPercipient.AI, Inc. challenged the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency's (NGA) decision to award a government contract to CACI Inc., claiming that its own artificial intelligence (AI) platform could meet the required contractual obligations. The appeal to the Federal Circuit was dismissed for lack of standing, as Percipient was not considered an \"interested party\" under 28 U.S.C. § 1491(b)(1), a status reserved for actual or prospective bidders with a direct economic interest in the contract. The case emphasizes the role of AI in government procurement contracts and the legal standing required to challenge such awards.\n\n2. Key Legal Issue:\nThe primary legal issue revolves around determining the standing of Percipient.AI, specifically whether it qualifies as an \"interested party\" with the legal right to object to the contract award under 28 U.S.C. § 1491(b)(1).\n\n3. Court's Holding:\nThe court held that to be considered an \"interested party\" under § 1491(b)(1), a party must be an actual or prospective bidder with a direct economic interest affected by the contract award or non-award. Hence, Percipient did not have standing as it was not a bidder or offeror on the contract in question.\n\n4. ELI5 Explanation:\nImagine a school is looking for someone to run their cafeteria, and they ask different chefs to show what they can cook. In this story, only those chefs who say they want the job and show their work (like an actual dish) can complain if the school chooses someone else. Percipient, like a chef who only says they might have cooked something great but didn't actually try, isn't allowed to complain about the school’s choice. The law says only those who try to get the job and could have won it can go to the court to say something's wrong.",

Case: 23-1970      Document: 106     Page: 2     Filed: 08/28/2025PERCIPIENT .AI, INC. v. US 3 \nI \nA \nIn 2020, the National Geospatial -Intelligence Agency \n(NGA) issued the SAFFIRE2 solicitation  seeking to im-\nprove its collection, interpretation, and storage of visual in-\ntelligence data. J.A. 57.3 The solicitation sought bids to \nbuild and operate a “ [Structured Observation Manage-\nment ] Enterprise Repository”  (SER)  to store, disseminate, \nand regulate access to data. J.A. 58. NGA also sought \n“Computer Vision” (CV) capabilities ; CV is a type of artifi-\ncial intelligence technology that trains and uses computers \nto derive geospatial intelligence data from imagery. J.A. 56.  \nNGA awarded t he SAFFIRE contract to CACI, \nInc.-Federal  in January 2021.  J.A. 70. The contract was  a \nsingle -award indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity con-\ntract  that defined a general procurement goal and conte m-\nplated the issuance of multiple task orders and the use of \nsubcontractors  to handle specific tasks related to the goal . \nJ.A. 38. The contract also  incorporated the clause found in \nthe Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) at sec-tion 52.244 -6, which  required CACI to  use commercial or \nnon-developmental items to the maximum extent practica-\nble in executing its contractual obligations . J.A. 38 , 857 . \nNGA simultaneously issued Task Order 1  under the \n \n2 SAFFIRE  stands for the Structured Observation \nManagement , Automation, Augmentation and Artificial \nIntelligence Framework f or Integrated Reporting and Ex-\nploitation. J.A. 38.  \n3 Because th is case was dismissed by the trial court  \nat the motion to dismiss stage, we assume all undisputed \nfacts in the complaint are true and draw all reasonable in-\nferences in the non -movant , Percipient’s,  favor.

US 4 \nSAFFIRE contract , which directed CACI to develop and de-\nliver the CV systems  described in the solicitation . J.A. 24.  \nPercipient offers a commercial CV platform that it con-\ntends could have met  NGA’s CV requirements. Appellant’s \nOpening Br. 7 –8; J.A. 59 –60. But Percipient did  not have \nthe capabilities to meet the SER component of the solicita-\ntion. Appellant’s Opening Br. 7; J.A. 43. Percipient states \nthat, for this reason,  it “could not and did not bid on the \nSAFFIRE contract.” Appellant’s Opening Br.  8. Percipient \nalso does not allege that it attempted to team  up with an-\nother company to submit an offer. Percipient states that it \ninstead “awaited the market research where it could \ndemonstrate its ability to meet NGA’s CV needs.” Id.   \nAfter the contract was awarded to CACI , Percipient \nreached out to NGA and asked for an evaluation of Percip-ient’s commercial CV product for the SAFFIRE contract. \nJ.A. 71. NGA directed Percipient to contact CACI . J.A. 7 2. \nAfter Percipient’s initial demonstration of its CV product  \nand much back and forth between NGA, CACI , and Percip-\nient, CACI did not follow up  regarding further evaluation . \nSee J.A. 130.  Percipient  then reached out to NGA, and NGA  \nentered into a bailment agreement with Percipient to eval-uate Percipient’s product’s capabilities. J.A.  80. Percipient \nalleges that NGA only tested Percipient’s product as a ma-\nchine learning platform, but not as an analytical tool —\nwhich is what the SAFFIRE contract required. J.A. 85. Per-\ncipient concluded that NGA “deliberately failed” to evalu-\nate Percipient’s product to meet the SAFFIRE CV system \nrequirements. Id.; Appellant’s Opening Br. 12. NGA then \ncommunicated  that there would be no further evaluation of \nPercipient’s product. J.A. 85.  \nPercipient contacted NGA  and “ask[ed] that NGA com-\nply with its obligations under [ 10 U.S.C.]  § 3453,” J.A. 88 , \nwhich is entitled “ Preference for commercial products and \ncommercial services ” and requires agency heads to “ acquire \ncommercial services, commercial products, or Case: 23-1970      Document: 106     Page: 4     Filed: 08/28/2025PERCIPIENT .AI, INC. v. US 5 \nnondevelopmental items other than commercial products \nto meet the needs of the agency ” “to the maximum extent \npracticable ,” 10  U.S.C. § 3453(b)(1).  Percipient states that \nNGA’s response “ignored the substance of Percipient’s alle-\ngations .” Appellant’s Opening Br.  13.  \nIn January 2023, Percipient filed its bid protest in  the \nCourt of Federal Claims  contending , as relevant to this en \nbanc proceeding , that NGA had violated its obligations un-\nder § 3453.  J.A. 94. Percipient alleged that the trial court \nhad jurisdiction over this challenge to the ongoing SAFFIRE procurement under § 1491(b)(1) . J.A. 46.  The \ngovernment and  intervenor -defendant  CACI moved to dis-\nmiss Percipient’s complaint  on multiple grounds, including  \nfor lack of subject matter jurisdiction and lack of standing.  \nJ.A. 152–73, 175 –99. The trial court initially denied the \nmotion to dismiss, Percipient.ai, Inc. v. United States, \n165 Fed. Cl. 331, 340 (2023) , but then granted the appel-\nlees’ motion for reconsideration and dismissed the case ,\n4 \nPercipient.ai, Inc. v. United States, No. 23 -28C, 2023 WL \n3563093, at  *3 (Fed. Cl. May  17, 2023) . Percipient ap-\npealed.  \nA panel of this court reversed and remanded to the trial \ncourt  with a dissent  by Judge Clevenger arguing that the \npanel’s holding as to 28  U.S.C. §  1491 (b)(1) was incon-\nsistent with the text, history, and purpose of the statute . \nPercipient.ai, Inc. v. United States, 104 F.4th 839 \n \n4 The trial court granted the motion to dismiss be-\ncause it determined that the Federal Acquisition Stream-\nlining Act of 1994 (FASA) task order bar, 10  U.S.C.  \n§ 3406(f)(1),  applied to Percipient’s protest and removed \nthe case from coverage by the Tucker Act. Th is task order \nbar ruling exceeds the scope of the rehearing that was \ngranted, and we accordingly do not address it in this opin-\nion. See Percipient.ai, Inc. v. U nited States. , 121 F.4th \n1311, 1312  (Fed. Cir. 2024) . Case: 23-1970      Document: 106     Page: 5     Filed: 08/28/2025PERCIPIENT .AI, INC. v. US 6 \n(Fed.

We granted the government ’s petition and ordered \nbriefing and argument on the following standing issue: \n“Who can be ‘ an interested party objecting to  . . . any al-\nleged violation of statute or regulation in connection with a procurement or a proposed procurement ’ under 28  U.S.C.  \n§ 1491(b)(1) ?”\n5 Id. We received two amicus briefs and heard \noral argument on June  9, 2025. We have jurisdiction under \n28 U.S.C. § 1295(a)(3) . \nB \nWe begin with a review of the relevant history under-\nlying § 1491(b)(1) . Our predecessor court, the United \nStates Court of Claims ,6 first recognized a type of bid \n \n5 We noted that we would “ not revisit [or]  . . . require \nadditional briefing on the issues of task bar under the Fed-eral Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994 (FASA), 10 U.S.C. § 3406(f) ; subject matter jurisdiction under \n28 U.S.C. § 1491(b)(1) ; and timeliness of claims under Blue \n& Gold Fleet, L.P. v.

In that case, the \nplaintiff, Heyer, had submitted a bid on a government con-\ntract, but the government awarded the contract to a differ-\nent bidder who had submitted a higher bid. Heyer believed \nthat the government’s failure to award the contract  to \nHeyer  was the result of deliberate retaliation against \nHeyer. The government moved to dismiss the petition for lack of standing. The Court of Claims acknowledged that the law at the time recognized no cause of action in bid pro-\ntest cases, stating:  \nIt has been settled beyond controversy that most \nstatutes governing the awarding of bids by govern-mental agencies are enacted for the benefit of the \npublic who are served by these agencies,  and not \nfor the benefit of the bidders, and, therefore, that \nbidders have no right to sue on the ground that the \nprovisions of such an Act have been violated, in \nthat the contract had not been let to the lowest bid-der. . . . [I]t is only the public who has a cause for \ncomplaint, and not an unsuccessful bidder.  \nId. at 412 (collecting cases). But the court nonetheless rec-\nognized a cause of action arising out of an implied contract theory, over which it has jurisdiction pursuant to the \nTucker Act. Id . at 412–13; 28 U.S.C. § 1491(a) . The court \nexplained that “[i] t was an implied condition of the request \nfor offers that each of them would be honestly considered, \nand that that offer which in the honest opinion of the con-\ntracting officer was most advantageous to the Government would be accepted.” Heyer, 140 F.

Id.  at 413.  \nThe Court of Claims imposed certain restrictions on \nthis type of cause of action, limiting recovery to instances in which there was clear and convincing proof that there \nhad been a fraudulent inducement for bids and that the \ngovernment intended to disregar d all the bids except from \nthe parties to which it had intended to give the contract. \nId. at 414. Essentially, a plaintiff had to show that the bids \n“were not invited in good faith. ” Id. \nA cause of action in the district courts was first recog-\nnized in Scanwell Lab oratories, Inc. v. Shaffer , 424 F.2d \n859 (D.C.  Cir. 1970) . There, the U nited States  Court of Ap-\npeals for the District of Columbia Circuit considered,  as a \nmatter of first impression , “[w]hether a frustrated bidder \nfor a government contract has standing to sue, alleging il-\nlegality in the manner in which the contract was let .” Id. \nat 861. The court examined early landmark federal stand-\ning cases and determined that Congress had legislatively \nreversed the Supreme Court’s decision in Perkins v. Lukens Steel Co ., 310  U.S. 113 (1940), “ in which the Public Con-\ntracts Act was interpreted to be an enactment for the pro-tection of the government rather than for those contracting with the government ,” with the enactment of the Adminis-\ntrative Procedure Act. Scanwell , 424 F.2d at 866–67. The \ncourt held that “ one who makes a prima facie showing al-\nleging [arbitrary or capricious abuses of discretion]  on the \npart of an agency or contracting officer has standing to sue under section  10 of the Administrative Procedure Act. ” Id. \nat 869.  \nSoon thereafter, the Court of Claims similarly ex-\npanded its own interpretation of its bid protest jurisdiction \nin Keco Industries, Inc. v. U nited States, 428 F.2d 1233 \n(Ct. Cl. 1970) . The court stated: “[A] s a result of Scanwell  \na party, who can make a prima facie showing of arbitrary and capricious action on the part of the Government in the Case: 23-1970      Document: 106     Page: 8     Filed: 08/28/2025PERCIPIENT .AI, INC. v. US 9 \nhandling of a bid situation, does have standing to sue. ” Id. \nat 779. The court also determined that Heyer was not lim-\nited to instances where “ there was strong evidence of  bad \nfaith and intentional fraud on the part of the Government ;” \ninstead, it stated a “broad general rule which is that every \nbidder has the right to have his bid honestly considered by \nthe Government, and if this obligation is breached, then \nthe injured party has the right to come into court to try and \nprove his cause of action. ” Id. at 779–80.   \nIn 1982, Congress enacted the Federal Courts Improve-\nment Act (FCIA) , which amended the Tucker Act and gave \nthe Court of Federal Claims the statutory authority to de-cide certain bid protest matters. Pub. L. No. 97 -164, § 133, \n96 Stat. 25 , 40 (1982)  (codified before repeal  at 28 U.S.C.  \n§ 1491(a)(3) ), repealed by  Administrative Dispute Resolu-\ntion Act of 1996  (ADRA) , Pub. L. No. 104 -320, sec. 12, \n110 Stat. 3870, 3874– 76. Specifically, “[t] o afford complete \nrelief on any contract claim brought  before the contract is \nawarded ,” the Court of Federal Claims was granted  “exclu-\nsive jurisdiction  to grant declaratory judgments and such \nequitable and extraordinary relief as it deems proper, in-cluding but not limited to injunctive relief. ” Id. (emphas es \nadded).  But FCIA did not alter jurisdiction in the district \ncourts to hear post -award challenges. The House Commit-\ntee Report stated: “It is not the intent of the Committee to \nchange existing caselaw as to the ability of parties to pro-\nceed in the district court pursuant to the provisions of the \nAdministrative Procedure Act in instances of illegal agency action. ” H.R.

In 1990, Congress di-\nrected the Department of Defense to establish an advisory \npanel and evaluate the acquis ition laws applicable to the \nDepartment of Defense.  National Defense Authorization \nAct for Fiscal Year 1991 , Pub. L. 101 -510, Title  VIII, \nsec. 800, 104  Stat. 1485, 1587 (1990)  (codified before repeal  \nat 10 U.S.C. §  2301) , repealed by  Federal Acquisition \nStreamlining Act of 1994,  Pub. L. 103 -355, Title  I, \n§ 1501(a), 108 Stat. 3243, 3296.  The resulting panel report \nand recommendations stated that “protests in the Court of \nFederal Claims have been enmeshed in an endless web of jurisdictional issues .” Streamlining Defense Acquisition \nLaws , Report of the Acquisition Law Advisory Panel to the \nUnited States Congress , at 1-258 (1993)  (Panel Report) . \nThe Panel Report highlighted two problems: (1)  “whether \nthe C ourt of Federal Claims has exclusive jurisdiction over \npre-award bid protests or whether its pre -award jurisdic-\ntion is concurrent with the district courts ”; and \n(2) “whether the Court of Federal Claims has jurisdiction \nover the type of agency wrongdoing for which the [Govern-ment Accountability Office  (GAO) ] and the [General Ser-\nvices Administration Board of Contract Appeals  (GSBCA) ] \ncustomarily grant relief .” Id. As to the first issue, the Panel \nReport noted that there were “ unresolved conflicts between \nthe courts in different parts of the country on whether the Case: 23-1970      Document: 106     Page: 10     Filed: 08/28/2025PERCIPIENT .AI, INC. v. US 11 \nCourt of Federal Claims is the exclusive judicial forum to \nconsider pre -award bid protests. ” Id. As to the second issue, \nthe GAO and GSBCA were two other venues that could \nhear bid protests , and it was unclear whether the Court of \nFederal Claims had concurrent jurisdiction to consider the types of cases heard by these forums too. Id. at 1-259.  \nThe Competition in Contracting Act of 1984 (CICA) au-\nthorized an “interested party ” to file some bid protests be-\nfore the GSBCA (i.e., those under the Brooks Act) that challenged “ any decision by a contracting officer alleged to \nviolate a statute  or regulation ” “in connection with any pro-\ncurement. ” Pub. L. No. 98-369, tit. VII, sec. 2713, 98  Stat. \n1175, 1182 –84 (amending the Brooks Act, Pub. L.

L. No. 104 -106, sec. 5101, 110 Stat. \n186, 680.  CICA expressly defined “interested party” as “ an \nactual or prospective bidder or offeror whose direct eco-\nnomic interest would be affected by the award of the con-\ntract or by failure to award the contract.”  Id. sec. 2713, \n98 Stat. at  1183 –84.  \nCICA also provided that an “interested party” could file \nprotests with  the GAO, and the Comptroller General had \nauthority to decide “[a]  protest concerning an alleged viola-\ntion of a procurement statute or regulation .” Id. sec. 2741, \n98 Stat. at 1199 –203 (codified at 31  U.S.C.  §§ 3551– 56). \nHere too, “interested party” was defined as “an actual or prospective bidder or offeror whose direct economic interest \nwould be affected by the award of the contract or by failure \nto award the contract.” Id.   \nThe Panel Report noted that it was unclear whether \nthe Court of Federal Claims had subject matter jurisdiction \nto consider the types of agency wrongdoing that the \nGSBCA and GAO could grant relief for.  See Panel Report Case: 23-1970      Document: 106     Page: 11     Filed: 08/28/2025PERCIPIENT .AI, INC. v. US 12 \nat 1-259. It also  noted that the jurisdiction of the Court of \nFederal Claims was “severely limited by the need to find \nthat the Government breached [an] implied contract .” Id. \nBecause the implied contract arose only when bids or pro-\nposals were submitted, the Panel Report stated that many \nprotests that were considered by other forums could not be heard by the Court of Federal Claims. Id. In an effort to \nreduce the complexities and delays arising out of having disparate judicial systems, the Panel Report recommended \nthat the “[t]he Court of Federal Claims should be the single \njudicial forum with jurisdiction to consider all bid protests \nthat can now be considered by any of the dis trict courts or \nby the Court of Federal Claims .” Id. at 1-261 (emphasis \nomitted) . The Panel Report also recommended that the \nCourt of Federal Claims’ “ jurisdiction should , as much as \npossible, parallel that of the GAO and the GSBCA in order \nto avoid both the forum shopping and type of confusion that \nhas occurred in the past.” Id.  at 1-265. The Panel Report  \nspecifically recommended that “[t] he statute should be \namended to provide that only interested parties, as defined by [CICA] , can file protests. ” Id. at 1-266. \nIn 1996, Congress , aware of the Panel Report’s recom-\nmendations,  amended the Tucker Act again with the enact-\nment of ADRA. Pub. L. No. 104 -320, sec. 12, 110 Stat. \nat 3874;  see AFGE , 258 F.3d at 1300.  As part of the amend-\nment, Congress enacted § 1491(b), which gave the Court of \nFederal Claims a new independent jurisdictional grant specifically for bid protest claims. ADRA sec. 12(a), \n110 Stat. at 3874 (provision titled “Bid Protests”) . ADRA \nprovided the Court of Federal Claims and the district courts with concurrent jurisdiction over bid protest actions , \nid. sec. 12(a), §  1491(b)(1), 110 Stat. at 3874,  but included \na sunset provision so that the district courts’ jurisdiction over bid protests would term inate on January  1, 2001 , id. \nsec. 12(d), 110 Stat. at 3875. See Impresa Construzioni , \n238 F.3d at 1332. It also eliminated the pre - and post -\naward dichotomy between the Court of Federal Claims and Case: 23-1970      Document: 106     Page: 12     Filed: 08/28/2025PERCIPIENT .AI, INC. v.

Further, at the time of ADRA’s enactment, the \nBrooks Act included language giving the GSBCA the au-thority to review “ any decision by a contracting officer that \nis alleged to violate a statute, a regulation, or  the condi-\ntions of a delegation of procurement authority ,” which is \nsimilarly reflected in the language of  § 1491(b) .

He also quoted the recom-\nmendations from the Panel Report that urged adoption of one judicial system t o consider bid protests. Id.  at S1184 9. \nThe goal of the amendment was therefore, in essence, to \nclose a procedural loophole and consolidate both pre - and \npost- award bid protests into one forum —the Court of Fed-\neral Claims.

Section  1491(b)(1) reads:  \nBoth the Unite [d] States Court of Federal Claims \nand the district courts of the United States shall \nhave jurisdiction to render judgment on an action \nby an interested party  objecting to a solicitation by \na Federal agency for bids or proposals for a pro-\nposed contract or to a proposed award or the award of a contract or any alleged violation of statute or regulation in connection with a procurement or a \nproposed procurement. B oth the  United States \nCourt of Federal Claims  and the district courts of \nthe United States shall have jurisdiction to enter-\ntain such an action without regard to whether suit \nis instituted before or after the contract is awarded.

US 15 \n28 U.S.C. § 1491(b)(1) (emphasis added).7 \nWe have long held that  the term “interested party” for \nbid protests should be limited to actual or prospective bid-\nders or offerors whose direct economic interest would be af-fected by the award of the contract or by failure to award \nthe contract.  In AFGE , we explained that , in enacting \nADRA,  “Congress intended to extend the jurisdiction of the \nCourt of Federal Claims to include post -award bid protest \ncases brought under the APA by disappointed bidders .” \n258 F.3d at 1302  (emphasis added) . We see no reason to \ndepart from this settled interpretation.   \nEven Percipient does not contend that “interested \nparty” should be reinterpreted for § 1491(b) as a whole , but \nonly for a part of the provision. Percipient argues that this \nstatutory provision  should be read as containing three \n“prongs”  which each provide a n independent basis for ob-\njection,  namely : (i) a solicitation by a federal agency for \nbids or proposals for a proposed contract , (ii)  a proposed \naward or the award of a contract , and (iii) any alleged vio-\nlation of statute or regulation in connection with a procure-\nment or a proposed procureme nt. Appellant’s Opening \nBr. 25. Percipient contends that the definition of “inter-\nested party” should change based on the “prong”  under \nwhich  a party brings a challenge. See i d. at 30–31, 34 –35.  \nWe disagree that the definition of “interested party” \nshould change in this way. We see no statutory support for assigning a different meaning to this single term depend-\ning on how a claimant chooses to style or bring its claim . \n \n7 The sunset provision provided that “[t]he jurisdic-\ntion of the district courts of the United States over the ac-tions described in section 1491(b)(1) of title 28, United States Code (as amended by subsection (a) of this section) \nshall terminate on January 1, 2001 unless extended by \nCongress. ”  ADRA, sec. 12(d) , 110 Stat. at 3874–75. Case: 23-1970      Document: 106     Page: 15     Filed: 08/28/2025PERCIPIENT .AI, INC. v. US 16 \nSection 1491(b) is not written with multiple interested \nparty provisions; it has one singular interested party. Per-\ncipient’s construction would have the same term mean dif-ferent things in the same sentence. That is not the way \nstatutory construction is done. Our definition is supported \nby the plain text, statutory history, and longstanding in-terpretation of this term within the judicial system.  \nA plain reading counsels that a single term carries  the \nsame meaning  throughout a single sentence . See  Brown v. \nGardner, 513 U.S. 11 5, 118 (1994) (“[T]here is a presump-\ntion that a given term is used to mean the same thing \nthroughout a statute  . . . . ”). “[W]here Congress includes \nparticular language in one section of a statute but omits it \nin another section of the same Act, it is generally presumed \nthat Congress acts intentionally and purposely in the dis-\nparate inclusion or exclusion.” Barry v. McDonough , \n101 F.4th 1348, 1356 ( Fed. Cir. 2024) (quoting Russello v. \nUnited States, 464 U.S. 16, 23 (1983)). Congress could have \nindicated that “interested party” should be read differently and have different meanings throughout this single statu-\ntory sentence. But it did not. W ithout express  guidance \nfrom Congress, it contradicts the pla in text of the statute \nto alter the meaning of a single antecedent term within a \nsingle sentence in the way Percipient proposes . \nFurther, despite Percipient’s wish to divide  the statute \ninto three “prongs,” there is no indication that the s tatute \nis separable in this manner —especially since § 1491(b)(1)  \nis not so divided. Congress used a single, unbroken, and \nundivided sentence. Dividing this single sentence and im-\nparting different definitions for a single term with in each \nartificial division contravenes the plain text of the statute. \nAdditionally , Percipient’s proposed interpretation is not \nsupported by the statutory history.  \nIV \n“Where Congress employs a term of art obviously \ntransplanted from another legal source, it brings the old Case: 23-1970      Document: 106     Page: 16     Filed: 08/28/2025PERCIPIENT .AI, INC. v. US 17 \nsoil with it.” George v. McDonough , 596 U.S. 740, 746 \n(2022) (cleaned up) . “Congress was not writing on a blank \nslate when it enacted § 1491(b)(1) ,” Government’s Re-\nsponse Br. 25 , but against the backdrop of decades of gov-\nernment contract law developed by  the Court of Federal \nClaims  or its predecessor,  the district courts , and relevant \ngovernment agencies . The term “interested party” carries \nthe context imparted by the history of bid protest cases and \nprior statutes .  \nIn AFGE , we interpreted §  1491(b) and considered \n“whether Congress intended to expand the class of parties \nwho can bring bid protest actions in the Court of Federal Claims ,” 258 F.3d at 1300,  and determined that “interested \nparty” carried forward the definition from CICA and is \ntherefore limited to “actual or prospective bidders or offe-\nrors whose direct economic interest would be affected by the award of the contract or by failure to award the con-tract .” Id. at 1302; see id. at 1301 –02.  \nIndeed, the now -repealed Brooks Act, which was in ef-\nfect while § 1491(b) was being drafted, gave the GSBCA ju-\nrisdiction over bid protests related to automated data \nprocessing equipment procurements by “ an interested \nparty  in connection with any procurement  . . . subject to \nthis section ,” 40 U.S.C. §  759(f)(1) (repealed 1996) , and in-\ncluded the same definition for “interested party” as in \nCICA, compare id. § 759(f)( 9)(B) (repealed 1996) ( defining \n“interested party” as “an actual or prospective bidder or of-\nferor whose direct economic interest would be affected by \nthe award of the contract or by failure to award the con-tract.”) , with CICA, sec. 2741(a), §  3551(2), 98 Stat. at  1199 \n(same definition for purposes of bid protests before the GAO) . This evinces a consistent usage of the term “inter-\nested party” throughout the statutory scheme as to the \nCourt of Federal Claims and its predecessor the Court of \nClaims and indicates that the context of the term “inter-\nested party” had a specific understood meaning in the pro-\ncurements sphere  at the time that § 1491(b) was drafted.

CICA’s  “interested party” definition \nexpressly confines  its application to —i.e. , the definition \nstates it is “with respect to”—“ a contract or a solicitation or \nother request for offers ,” 31 U.S.C. §  3551(2)(A),  and thus \nis limited on its fac e to less than the class of challenges au-\nthorized by prong  (3).  See also 31 U.S.C. § 3551(1) , (2) \n(1994 ed.) (“with respect to a contract or proposed contract \ndescribed in paragraph  (1)”).2  So, f or the general category \nof agency actions that are covered only by  prong  (3), there \nwas—and still is —nothing to borrow from CICA .  Indeed, \napplying CICA’s definition of “ interested party ” in chal-\nlenges that can be made under just prong  (3) would be in-\ncompatible with the evident breadth of the  language of \nprong  (3).  This is critically important, as  it effectively elim-\ninate s judicial review of alleged violations of the statutory \nprovisions invoked by Percipient here , enacted by Congress \njust two years before ADRA.  The majority’s h olding im-\nproperly reads the language from prongs  (1) and  (2) into \nprong  (3).  Had  Congress intended for  only a bidder or pro-\nspective bidder to  be an interested party under prong  (3), \nCongress could have written prong  (3) to say something \nlike “any alleged violation of statute or regulation in con-\nnection with a proposed award or award of a contract .”  In-\nstead, it wrote prong  (3) more broadly to include “any \nalleged violation of statute or regulation in connection with \n \n2 The majority asserts that the use of CICA’s  defini-\ntion of “interested party”  in the now-repealed Brooks Act \n(40 U.S.C. § 759  (repealed 1996))  reinforces that Congress \nintentional ly brought that definition into ADRA.  Maj . Op. \nat 17–18.  We disagree.  T he Brooks Act define d “interested \nparty” only “with respect to a contract or proposed con-\ntract.”   40 U.S.C. §  759(f)(9)(A)– (B).  Accordingly, as is true \nfor CICA, the Brooks Act did  not define  who can be  an “in-\nterested party” to bring all the claim s authorized under \nprong  (3) of § 1491(b)(1) . Case: 23-1970      Document: 106     Page: 35     Filed: 08/28/2025PERCIPIENT .AI, INC. v. US 6 \na procurement or a proposed procurement .”  28 U.S.C. \n§ 1491(b)(1)  (emphasis added) . \nUnder the plain language of § 1491(b)(1) , an agency ac-\ntion that is not  a solicitation for bids or a proposed or actual \ncontract award may be challenged under prong  (3) as a “vi-\nolation of statute or regulation in connection with a pro-\ncurement or a proposed procurement.”   Id.  Where that is \nso, the  aforementioned justifications  for limiting an “inter-\nested party” to an actual or would- be bidder do not apply.  \nThe language for prong  (3) is not tied to a solicitation or \ncontract , and thus an “interested party” f or the third type \nof challenge  under § 1491(b)(1)  should not be limited to \nparties who would bid on a solicitation or be awarded the \ncontract.  Accordingly, f or prong  (3) cases like this one , in-\nstead of asking whether a party has a direct economic in-terest in a solicitation, proposed award, or award, the court must ask whether a party has a direct economic interest in \nthe agency’s violation of a statute or regulation in connec-\ntion with a procurement or proposed procurement .  Con-\nsistently d efining “interested party ” as someone with a \n“direct economic interest [that] would be affected by the [challenged § 1491(b)(1) action] ,” see AFGE , 258  F.3d \nat 1302, gives real and consistent meaning to the entire \nstatutory phrase in §  1491(b)(1) , not just prongs  (1) \nand (2).\n3 \nThe majority further errs by prioritizing  legislative his-\ntory of various statutes and ignoring the language  of \n \n3 We agree with the majority that a single term  gen-\nerally  carries the same meaning throughout a single sen-\ntence.  Maj . Op. at 16.  Here, t he phrase “ interested party ” \nhas one meaning —having a direct economic interest that \nwould be affected by the challenged § 1491(b)(1) action .  \nThis definition properly recognizes that what constitutes \nsuch a direct interest differs according to what precise \nagency action is challenged.  Case: 23-1970      Document: 106     Page: 36     Filed: 08/28/2025PERCIPIENT .AI, INC. v. US 7 \n§ 1491(b)(1) .  See Exxon Mobil Corp. v.  Allapattah Servs., \nInc., 545  U.S. 546, 568 (2005)  (“[T]he authoritative state-\nment is the statutory text, not the legislative history  . . . .”).  \nEven so, the legislative history  of § 1491(b)(1)  supports a \nbroader interpretation  of “interested party” here.  \nBefore ADRA, the Court of Federal Claims and federal \ndistrict courts shared jurisdiction over bid protests, with \nthe former having jurisdiction over pre -award protests and \nthe latter having jurisdiction over post -award protests.   “It \n[was] the intention of [ADRA’s] Managers to give the Court of Federal Claims exclusive jurisdiction over the full range \nof procurement protest cases previously subject to review \nin the federal district courts and the Court of Federal Claims.”  H.R. Co nf. Rep. No.  104-841, at  10 (1996) .  As ex-\nplained in Scanwell Laboratories, Inc. v.  Shaffer , 424 F.2d \n859, 869 (D.C.  Cir. 1970), the district courts  assessed stat-\nutory standing under the Administrative Procedure Act \n(APA).   The  Scanwell  court held that “ one who makes a \nprima facie showing alleging [ arbitrary or capricious ] ac-\ntion on the part of an agency or contracting officer has \nstanding to sue under  [the APA] .”  Id. \nWe acknowledge  that the vast majority of cases \nbrought under  Scanwell  were by disappointed bidders .  But \nADRA, which g ave the Court of Federal Claims exclusive \njurisdiction over the full range  of procurement protest \ncases , “cannot reasonably be construed to have wholly abol-\nished APA procurement claims that might otherwise have \nbeen brought under Scanwell .”  Validata Chem. Servs. \nv. U.S. Dep’t of Energy , 169  F. Supp.  3d 69, 84– 85 (D.D.C. \n2016)  (“It is . . . a mistake to equate the ‘ vast majority of \ncases bro ught pursuant to Scanwell ,’ with all Scanwell  \ncases. ”).  Congress intended for ADRA to “consolidate [] fed-\neral court jurisdiction for procurement protest cases ,” not \neliminate part of it.   H.R. Conf. Rep. No.  104-841, at  9 \n(1996) .  Congress is presumed to be aware of Scanwell  and \nits progeny when it enacted ADRA, see Merck & Co. \nv. Reynolds , 559 U.S. 633, 648 (2010), and Congress chose Case: 23-1970      Document: 106     Page: 37     Filed: 08/28/2025PERCIPIENT .AI, INC. v. US 8 \nnot to adopt the limit ed definition of  “interested party ” \nfrom  CICA when it enacted §  1491(b)(1), even though it \nknew how to do so.   See Simmons v.  Himmelreich , 578 U.S. \n621, 627 (2016) ( “[W]e presume Congress says what it \nmeans and means what it says. ”).4 \nIt is telling that Congress chose not to include CICA’s  \ndefinition  for “interested party ” in § 1491(b)( 1).  That \nchoice reflects the broader scope of § 1491(b)( 1) due to its \ninclusion of prong  (3), and the goal of expanding the Court \nof Federal Claims’ jurisdiction to include the district courts’ \njurisdiction under the APA.5  That choice permit s inter-\npreting  “interested party ” in § 1491(b)(1)  the same as in \nCICA where the object of interest is the same (awards, pro-\nposed awards, and solicitations, as in AFGE ).  But that \nchoice  leaves  interpretation of “ interested party ” in \nprong  (3) situations, which are not covered by CICA, to in-\nclude parties who  have a direct economic interest that \nwould be affected by the alleged “violation of statute or reg-\nulation in connection with a procurement or a proposed \nprocurement.”  28 U.S.C. §  1491(b)(1).  \nBecause the parallel ism between CICA and ADRA \nbreaks down where a plaintiff’s protest falls under only  \nprong  (3), CICA’s definition of “interested party” should not \n \n4 Indeed, in  2008 when Congress  added §  1491(b)(5), \nit defined interested party by expressly referencing \nCICA:   “an interested party described in section  3551(2)(B) \nof title  31 shall be entitled to intervene in [this  type of ] ac-\ntion.”   28 U.S.C. §  1491(b)(5).   Had Congress intended to \nincorporate CICA’s definition of “ interested party ” into \nADRA, it would have used similar language to expressly do \nso. \n5 The inclusion  of prong  (3) challenges in \n§ 1491(b)(1) opens the door to new types of challengers hav-\ning the requisite interest in those challenges .

    "summary": "1. **Summary:** This case involves Percipient.AI, Inc.'s appeal against the United States and CACI, Inc.-Federal regarding alleged violations of procurement law in connection with a contract involving the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA). Percipient, which offers an AI-based computer vision platform, challenged the government’s failure to consider commercial products like its platform in the SAFFIRE project, arguing this violated statutory provisions requiring preference for commercial products. The Federal Circuit reversed the lower court's dismissal of the case for lack of jurisdiction, asserting the claims were not barred by the statutory prohibition against protests concerning task orders.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue:** Whether the Court of Federal Claims has subject matter jurisdiction to hear a case alleging statutory violations related to procurement preferences for commercial products, despite the task order bar established by the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act (FASA).\n\n3. **Court's Holding:** The Federal Circuit held that the Court of Federal Claims does have jurisdiction over Percipient's protest concerning statutory violations because the protest is not \"in connection with the issuance or proposed issuance of a task or delivery order\" and thus not subjected to the FASA task order bar. Therefore, the lower court's dismissal was reversed, and the case was remanded for further proceedings.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation:** Percipient.AI wanted the government to consider using their fancy AI product for a project, as the law says they should consider commercial technology. But the government didn't do this, and Percipient complained. The first court said they couldn't even hear this complaint because it's about task orders, which are generally protected from protests. But the appeals court said, \"Hold on, this isn't just about task orders,\" so now Percipient can go back and get another chance to argue their case.",

Percipi-\nent.ai , Inc.  appeals the decision of the United States Court \nof Federal Claims granting the Government ’s and interve-\nnor CACI, Inc .-Federal ’s (collectively, “Defendants ”) mo-\ntions to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction  under \nRule 12(b)(1) of the Rules of the U.S. Court of Federal Claims .  The trial court  erred in holding that the F ederal \nAcquisition Streamlining Act of 1994 (FASA)  task order \nbar, 10 U.S.C. §  3406(f)(1), applie s to Percipient’s protest, \nthereby removing the case  from coverage by the Tucker \nAct.  Separately , we reject Defendants’ alternative argu-\nments  for affirming  the trial court , which are based on the \nTucker Act itself , standing , and timeliness.   We thus re-\nverse and remand.   Case: 23-1970      Document: 46     Page: 2     Filed: 06/07/2024PERCIPIENT .AI, INC. v. US 3 \nBACKGROUND  \nThe National Geospatial -Intelligence Agency (NGA) \nprovides intelligence data to the federal government by an-\nalyzing images and geospatial information .  NGA issued a \nsolicitation, referred to as SAFFIRE, t o sustain and im-\nprove its processes for obtaining and storing visual intelli-gence data , and integrating those capabilities with \ncomputer vision (CV), a form of artificial intelligence .\n1  Per-\ncipient’s complaint sets forth the relevant facts.   \nSAFFIRE sought a single aw ard Indefinite Delivery, \nIndefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract .  This type of contract  \n“allow s an agency to issue  a broad solicitation for a general \nprocurement goal and then  more detailed solicitations for \nindividual task orders as specific needs arise. ”  See, e.g ., \n22nd Century Techs., Inc. v.  United States , 57 F.4th 993, \n996 (Fed.  Cir. 2023) .  The SAFFIRE solicitation required, \nbroadly, (1) “an enterprise repository backbone for storing, \nmanaging, and disseminating data ,” known as “SOM En-\nterprise Repository” or “SER”;  and (2) a user -facing CV \nSystem.  J.A.  38–39 ¶ 6.  Task Order 1, solicited simulta-\nneously  with the SAFFIRE solicitation , directed the con-\ntractor to, among other things, develop and deliver the CV  \nsuite of systems .  The NGA awarded both the SAFFIRE \ncontract and the Task Order 1 to CACI.  \nPercipient offers a commercial CV platform, “Mirage,” \nthat c ould meet NGA’s CV System requirements.  But Per-\ncipient was unable to meet the SER component of the \nSAFFIRE solicitat ion.  It also expected NGA and CACI to \n \n1  The facts are largely taken from Percipient’s com-\nplaint.  When a party moves to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, the court assumes that the undisputed facts in the complaint are true and draws reasonable infer-\nences in the plaintiff’s favor.   Acevedo v.  United States , \n824 F.3d 1365, 1368 (Fed.  Cir. 2016).  Case: 23-1970      Document: 46     Page: 3     Filed: 06/07/2024PERCIPIENT .AI, INC. v. US 4 \ncomply  with  10 U.S.C. § 3453, which establish es a prefer-\nence for commercial services, and consider Mirage for the \nCV System .  With these expectations , Percipient did not bid \nfor the SAFFIRE contract or challenge the SAFFIRE solic-itation or award.   \nPercipient contacted NGA and explained that “in addi-\ntion to being legally required  [to consider commercial prod-\nucts under §  3453] , using commercial software  [like \nMirage] would save hundreds of millions of dollars[  and] \nallow immediate mission impact potentially years ahead of government developed software.”  J.A.  71–72 ¶ 91.  It also \nrequested a meeting to discuss why NGA “appeared to be pursuing the develop ment of government software without \na thorough test and evaluation process of commercially \navailable software.”  Id.  NGA informed Percipient that if \nit wanted to take part  in SAFFIRE, it c ould contact  CACI.  \nAt the resulting meeting , Percipient asked CACI  to evalu-\nate Mirage for SAFFIRE  and CACI responded:   “That ship \nhas sailed.”  J.A.  72 ¶ 93.  Percipient then asked NGA to \nindependently evaluate Mirage as a commercial solution \nfor SAFFIRE ’s CV System.  NGA confirmed that commer-\ncial products would be evaluated once CACI finished re-\nviewing NGA’s legacy system and that the “t hat ship has \nsailed” statement was an “unfortunate miscommunica-tion.”  J.A. 74 ¶¶ 98–100. \nAbout two months later, Percipient demonstra ted Mi-\nrage to CACI, received positive feedback, and was told that \nCACI should do a more technical “deep dive” into Mirage —\nan analysis that never occurred.  J.A.  76–77 ¶¶ 107– 09.  In-\nstead, five months passed, and Percipient learned, at the \n2021 GEOINT Sympo sium, that CACI intended to build its \nown software to meet SAFFIRE’s requirements.   \nPercipient then approached NGA, sharing its concern \nabout whether  CACI could objectively evaluate Mirage’s \nCV capabilities (given its stated intention to develop soft-\nware itself ) and requesting the opportunity to demonstrate Case: 23-1970      Document: 46     Page: 4     Filed: 06/07/2024PERCIPIENT .AI, INC. v. US 5 \nMirage’s capabilities  to NGA directly .  NGA agreed to set \nup a demonstration, stated the agency’s intent to evaluate \ncommercial alternatives before building software inhouse, and asked that Percipient “ ease up on the legal pressure.”  \nJ.A. 79 ¶¶  117–18. \nIn December  2021, Percipient demonstrated Mirage to \nNGA representatives, one of whom stated after the demon-stration that Mirage “meets all of NGA’s analytic transfor-\nmation requirements.”  J.A.  79–80 ¶¶  119– 20.  Over \nseveral months NGA and Percipient worked to reach an agreement for NGA to test Mirage with live data, which \nPercipient agreed to do for free.  After some back -and-forth \nabout whether to use live data  at all , NGA relented and \nfinally finished it s testing in October  2022.  \nBut the testing, according to Percipient’s complaint , \nwas subpar —with NGA running  only four searches on Mi-\nrage over a twelve- week testing period.  Percipient offered, \nfree-of-charge, to extend the testing period.  But a month \nlater NGA explained that it evaluated Mirage as a “Ma-\nchine Learning (ML) Platform” rather than an “Analytical \ntool,” which Percipient took as confirmation that NGA had \n“deliberately failed to evaluate Mirage’s ability to meet SAFFIRE’s CV System requirements,” and thus failed to evaluate whether Mirage could be an alternative to C ACI’s \ndevelopment of SAFFIRE’s CV System  inhouse.  J.A.  85 \n¶ 137.  NGA confirmed that there would be no broader eval-\nuation of Mirage.  Percipient then filed a n action  in the \nCourt of Federal Claims  under what is commonly called the \n“bid protest” provision of the Tucker Act, 28  U.S.C. \n§ 1491(b)(1).  \nIn its complaint, Percipient asked the court  to enjoin \nNGA’s alleged violation of its obligations under 10  U.S.C. \n§ 3453, titled “Preference for commercial products and \ncommercial services,” which requires heads of agencies to \nensure their contractors conduct market research to deter-\nmine if commercial or nondevelopmental items are Case: 23-1970      Document: 46     Page: 5     Filed: 06/07/2024PERCIPIENT .AI, INC. v. US 6 \navailable that can meet the agency’s procurement require-\nments.  This procurement statute requires, “to the maxi-\nmum extent practicable,” a preference for commercial or nondevel opmental items or services.  See 10 U.S.C. \n§ 3453(a).  \nThe Government and CACI filed motions to dismiss \nPercipient’s complaint, arguing that (1) the Court of Fed-\neral Claims  lacked subject matter jurisdiction  based on the \nFASA task order bar and, separately, the Tucker Act ; \n(2) Percipient lacked standing; and (3)  Percipient’s  com-\nplain t was untimely.   \nThe Tucker Act, in pertinent part, provides the Court \nof Federal Claims  with jurisdiction:  \nto render judgment on an action by an interested party  objecting to [1]  a solicitation by a Federal \nagency for bids or proposals for a proposed contract \nor to [2] a proposed award or the award of a con-\ntract or [3] any alleged violation of statute or regu-\nlation in connection with a procurement or a \nproposed procurement . \n28 U.S.C. §  1491(b)(1) (emphases added).  Percipient  as-\nserted that it was an interested party and that the Court \nof Federal Claims  had jurisdiction under the third prong of \nthe Tucker Act  provision .   \nThe FASA task order bar provides that:  \n(1)  A protest is not authorized in connection with \nthe issuance or proposed issuance of a task or deliv-ery order except for — \n. . . . \n(B) a protest of an order valued in excess of \n$25,000,000.  Case: 23-1970      Document: 46     Page: 6     Filed: 06/07/2024PERCIPIENT .AI, INC. v. US 7 \n(2)  . . .  [T]he Comptroller General of the United \nStates shall have exclusive jurisdiction of a protest \nauthorized under paragraph (1)(B).  \n10 U.S.C. §  3406(f)  (emphasis added).2 \nWhile the trial court  initially denied the motions to dis-\nmiss, Percipient.ai, Inc. v . United States, 165 Fed. Cl. 331,  \n340 (2023) , it later vacated its opinion .3  After  additional \nbriefing, the court  held that the FASA task order bar ap-\nplied  and granted the motions to dismiss for  lack of subject \nmatter jurisdiction.  Percipient.ai, Inc. v.  United States, \nNo. 23-28C, 2023 WL 3563093, at  *3 (Fed.  Cl. May  17, \n2023) . \nPercipient appeals.  We have jurisdiction under \n28 U.S.C. §  1295(a)(3).  \nDISCUSSION  \n“We review a decision by the [Court of Feder al Claims]  \nto dismiss a case  for lack of subject matter jurisdiction de \nnovo.”   Diversified Grp. Inc. v.  United States , 841  F.3d 975, \n980 (Fed.  Cir. 2016) .  We may affirm the court’s  judgment  \non any ground supported by the record.   El-Sheikh \nv. United States, 1 77 F.3d 1321, 1326 (Fed.  Cir. 1999).  And  \nwe assume all facts alleged in a complaint as true and  draw \n \n2  There is a FASA task order bar that applies to pub-\nlic contracts generally, 41  U.S.C. §  4106(f)(1), and one that \napplies to the Department of Defense in particular, \n10 U.S.C. §  3406(f)(1).   The text of the two provisions is \nsimilar, except for the different monetary thresholds over \nwhich task order protest s may be heard by the Comptroller \nGeneral .  Here, 10 U.S.C. §  3406(f)(1) is applicable because \nNGA operates under the oversight of the Department of \nDefense.   \n3  The trial court’s vacated opinion addressed subject \nmatter jurisdiction , standing, and timeliness.   Case: 23-1970      Document: 46     Page: 7     Filed: 06/07/2024PERCIPIENT .AI, INC. v. US 8 \nall reasonable inferences in favor of the plaintiff.  Henke \nv. United States, 60  F.3d 795, 797, 79 9 (Fed.  Cir. 1995) .   \nPercipient argues that its protest is not “in connection \nwith the issuance or proposed issuance of a task or delivery order” and thus falls outside the FASA task order bar .  See \nAppellant’s Br.  28–48.  Defendants  disagree, arguing that \nthe trial court  correctly determined that the FASA task or-\nder bar divests the Court of Federal Claims of jurisdiction \nover Percipient’s protest.   See Government’s Br.  13–28; \nCACI’s Br.  23–38.  Defendants  also assert alternative \ngrounds for affirmance, including that the trial court  lacks \nsubject matter jurisdiction because Percipient’s protest is \nnot “in connection with a procurement or a proposed pro-curement ,” a requirement under the  third prong of the \nTucker Act.   See Government’s Br.  30–33; CACI’s Br.  50–\n52.  T he Government also alternatively argues that we \nshould affirm the trial court ’s dismissal because Percipient \nlacks standing and , separately,  argues that one of Percipi-\nent’s claims challenges terms of the SAFFIRE solicitation \nand is thus untimely.  See Government’s Br.  34–38.  We \naddress each issue in turn.  \nI \nFirst, we turn to subject matter jurisdiction.  For the \nCourt of Federal Claims  to have jurisdiction, Percipient’s \nprotest mus t be outside  the FASA task order bar and \nwithin the jurisdictional limits of the Tucker Act.   For the \nreasons below, w e hold that  the Court of Federal Claims  \nhas subject matter jurisdiction  over Percipient’s protest . \nA \nWe begin by addressing the FASA task order bar and \nwhether the Court of Federal Claims erred by dismissing Percipient’s complaint for raising claims  in connection with \nthe issuance of a task order .  FASA provides that a “protest \nis not authorized in connection with the issuance or pro-posed issuance of a task or delivery order.”  10 U.S.C. Case: 23-1970      Document: 46     Page: 8     Filed: 06/07/2024PERCIPIENT .AI, INC. v. US 9 \n§ 3406(f)(1).  Consistent with the statutory focus on “issu-\nance ” and this court’s decision in SRA International, I nc. \nv. United States , 766 F.3d 1409, 1413 (Fed.  Cir. 2014), we \ninterpret this language to mean that a protest is barred if \nit challenges the issuance of the task order directly or by \nchallenging  a government action (e.g., waiver of an organi-\nzational confli ct of interest) whose wrongfulness would \ncause the task order’s issuance to be improper.  To d eter-\nmine  whether the Court of Federal Claims erred in dis-\nmissing Percipient’s complaint , we analyze each of the \nclaims in the complaint .  In doing so it becomes c lear that \nthe FASA task order bar does not preclude the Court of \nFederal Claims from exercising jurisdiction over Percipi-\nent’s protest , which  does not assert the wrongfulness of, or \nseek to set aside , any task order. \nIn Count One , Percipient alleges that NGA violated, \nand will continue to violate, 10  U.S.C. §  3453 and related \nregulations by refusing to ensure that its contractor for the \nongoing SAFFIRE procurement incorporates commercial or nondevelopmental items “to the maximum extent prac-\nticable.”  J.A.  94–96.  There is no mention of —or challenge \nto—the  issuance of the  task order.  Rather, drawing all rea-\nsonable inferences in favor of Percipient, Henke, 60  F.3d \nat 799, we conclude that the claim is directed to NGA’s vi-\nolation of § 3453 and re lated regulations after issuance of \nthe task order.  In particular, t he claim asserts that “Per-\ncipient has specifically requested on several occasions that \nNGA and SAFFIRE’s contractor evaluate Mirage for inte-gration into the SAFFIRE procurement, but both have re-\nfused to do so in favor of launching a developmental \neffort  . . . . NGA therefore has failed to meet its obliga-\ntion[s]”  under §  3453.  J.A. 95 ¶ 165.  Continuing, the claim \nasserts that “[i]f NGA complies with its legal obligations and conducts a full and fair evaluation of Mirage’s capabil-ities, it and its contractor will conclude —or at a minimum \nare substantially likely to conclude —that Mirage can mee t \ntheir CV  System needs for SAFFIRE and should be Case: 23-1970      Document: 46     Page: 9     Filed: 06/07/2024PERCIPIENT .AI, INC. v. US 10 \nincorporated into the SAFFIRE procurement.”  J.A. 96 \n¶ 167.  In Count One, Percipient  thus seeks NGA’s compli-\nance with §  3453 and related regulations to ensure that \nNGA’ s contractor incorporates commercial or nondevelop-\nmental items “to the maximum extent practicable ,” with-\nout challenging  the issuance of Task Order 1  to CACI .   \nCount Two likewise involves alleg ation s that “NGA is \nviolating 10  U.S.C. §  3453 and related regulations by refus-\ning to take steps to require its contractor to engage in mar-\nket research and make determinations as to whether its needs could be met by commercial or nondevelopmental \nitems.”  J.A.  96–98 (cleaned up).  Percipient cites \n§ 3453(c)(1)(C) and (c)(5), which require the agency head  to \n“conduct market research  . . . before awarding a task or-\nder,” and “take appropriate steps to ensure that any prime \ncontractor of a contract (or task order or delivery or-der) . . . engages in such market research as may be neces-\nsary to carry out the req uirements of subsection (b)(2)”—\ni.e., “to incorporate commercial services  . . . or nondevelop-\nmental items ” to the “maximum extent practicable.”  \n10 U.S.C. §  3453(b)(2).  The phrase  “task order” is  present \nin Count Two.  And the language  “conduct market re-\nsearch  . . . before awarding a task order or delivery order” \ncould in some cases be interpreted as “in connection with \nthe issuance or proposed issuance of a task or delivery or-der.”  But that’s not the allegation here.   \nRather, Percipi ent’s allegation is that NGA violated \n10 U.S.C. §  3453 because of its failure to require  CACI,  its \ncontractor, to engage in market research.  The claim \nstates:   “NGA’s contractor failed to conduct the necessary \nmarket research before proceeding to launch a n effort to \ndevelop the CV system  . . . .”  J.A. 97 ¶  173.  This alleged \ninaction is not in connection with NGA’s issuance or Case: 23-1970      Document: 46     Page: 10     Filed: 06/07/2024PERCIPIENT .AI, INC. v. US 11 \nproposed issuance of the task order.4  Rather, the focus is \non CACI’s actions after issuance of Task Order 1 and its \nfailure to evaluate Mirage for integration into the \nSAFFIRE’s CV system .   \nIn Count Three , Percipient  alleges that “NGA improp-\nerly delegated inherently governmental authority”  by al-\nlowing its contractor to build software to meet SAFFIRE’s computer vision software requirements before conducting \nmarket research.   J.A.  98–99 (cleaned up).  Specifically, \nPercipient alleges that NGA improperly allowed CACI to \ndecide  agency policy for developing artificial intelligence \ntechnology.  J.A.  99 ¶¶ 179–80.  Again, Percipient does not \nchallenge the Government’s issuance of Task Order 1 to \nCACI.  Task Order 1 is not mentioned ; nor does this alle-\ngation more broadly relate to N GA’s issuance of  Task Or-\nder 1 .   \nLastly, Percipient alleges  in Count Four  that “NGA en-\ngaged in arbitrary, capricious, and unlawful conduct by re-sisting innovation, by insisting on the wasteful approach of \nsoftware development, and by engaging in bad faith con-duct.”  J.A.  99–101 (cleaned up).  Specifically, Percipient \nalleges that while NGA knows that Mirage meets the CV \nSystem requirements, it “is deliberately failing to conduct \nwhatever additional evaluation it claims to be necessary to \nconfirm Mirage’s ab ility to meet SAFFIRE’s CV System re-\nquirements.”  J.A. 100 ¶  185.  And Percipient details the \nrelated representations and actions by NGA that it alleges \nare evidence of “malicious, bad faith conduct toward \n \n4  See also Oral Arg . at 2:30–3:16 (Percipient’s attor-\nney stating that “[t]here may be an a llusion in our com-\nplaint” to insufficient market research prior to the issuance \nof the task order, “but our complaint, our claims don’t de-pend on that”  insufficient market research ), \nhttps://oralarguments.cafc.uscourts.gov/default.aspx?fl=2  \n3-1970_11082023.mp3.

None of these allegations relates \nto the issuance of a task order, or even mention task orders.  \nIn sum, none of Percipient’s counts  is “in connection \nwith the issuance or proposed issuance of a task or delivery \norder.”  10 U.S.C. §  3406(f)(1).  Percipient does not chal-\nlenge the  issuance of Task Order 1  to CACI.  Moreover, n o \nallegation asserts that the language of Task Order 1  was \ndeficient or forced the alleged statutory violations to occur.  \nOnly one C ount mentions the phrase  “task order,” but no  \nallegation  deals with  how NGA  worded,  issued , or proposed \nto issue its task order.   See also  Oral Arg . at 0:30–0:58 (Per-\ncipient’s attorney saying , “We do not challenge the task or \ndelivery order.  We do not seek to set aside a task or deliv-ery order that’s been issued.  We do not challenge an action \nthat directly or immediately led to a task or delivery order.  \nWe do not challenge an action on which the validity of a task or delivery order depends  . . . . ”). \nThe Government disagrees because it interprets the \nlanguage “in connection with” in §  3406(f) to bar all pro-\ntests that relate  to work performed under a task order.  See \nGovernment’s Br.  16.  It argues that whatever results \nfrom , i.e., follows or comes after,  a task order fall s under \nthe task order bar.  Id.   To support its interpretation, the \nGovernment relies on a sentence in SRA , 766  F.3d at 1413, \nwhich described the challenged waiver of an organizational conflict of interest as an action that was “directly and caus-\nally conne cted to issuance of [a task order]” in holding that \nthe challenge to that waiver (which if accepted would have undermined the task order) came within the task order bar and therefore was outside the Court of Federal Claims’ ju-\nrisdiction .  See Government’s Br. 14, 21– 22.  The dissent \nagrees with the Government, asserting that “in connection \nwith the issuance or proposed issuance of a task or delivery \norder” means anything that stems from, is tied to, or re-\nsults from the issuance of a task order , including chal-\nlenges to work performed under Task Order 1 .  We are \nunpersuaded.   Case: 23-1970      Document: 46     Page: 12     Filed: 06/07/2024PERCIPIENT .AI, INC. v. US 13 \nWe find the G overnment’s interpretation far too broad.  \nThe statutory language refers to protests “in connection \nwith the issuance or proposed issuance” of a task order.  As Percipient n otes, the Government’s interpretation gives no \nmeaning to the words “issuance or proposed issuance.”   \nSpecifically , the Government reads the statute as if it \nbroadly bars all protests made in connection with a task  \norder—including work performed by a proper awardee  af-\nter issuance of a proper task order—rather than  just those \nprotests made “in connection with the issuance or proposed \nissuance of  a task” order.   Reply Br.  6 (citing 10  U.S.C. \n§ 3406(f)) (emphasis added).   This flouts the well -estab-\nlished principle that “we should  construe  the statute,  if at \nall possible, to give effect and meaning to all the  terms. ”  \nBausch & Lomb, Inc. v.  United States , 148 F.3d 1363, 1367 \n(Fed.  Cir. 1998) .  In our view, the plain meaning of \n§ 3406(f) precludes the G overnment’s interpretation, which \ncasts a far larger net than what the statute prescribes .  \nWe also find the G overnment’s interpretation unsup-\nported by precedent. The SRA  opinion cited by the Govern-\nment and the dissent does not support the Government’s \nbroad interpretation .\n5  The “directly and causally con-\nnected to issuance of [a task order]” language in SRA  is \nnarrower than the interpretation sought by the Govern-\nment and , moreover,  must be understood in light of the \nfacts at issue there.  S ee, e.g. , Arkansas Game & Fish \nComm’n v.  United States, 568 U.S. 23, 36 (2012) (“Chief \nJustice Marshall [] sage[ly] observ [ed] that ‘general \n \n5  The dissent misunderstands our language here .  \nWe do not “ see[] the ‘directly and causally connected to is-\nsuance’ test a s ‘far too broad ,’” generally.   Dissent  Op. \nat 10.  Rather, a s is cl ear from our language, it is our posi-\ntion that the Government ’s and dissent’s interpretation of \nthe “ directly and causally connected to issuance ” language \nin SRA  is far too broad.

US 14 \nexpressions, in every opinion, are to be taken in connection \nwith the case in which those expressions are used.  If they \ngo beyond the case, they may be respected, but ought not to control the judgment in a subsequent suit when the very \npoint is presented for decision.’”  (citation omitted) ); R.A.V. \nv. St. Paul , 505  U.S. 377, 386 –87 n.5 (1992) (“It is of course \ncontrary to all traditions of our jurisprudence to consider \nthe law on [a] point conclusively resolved by broad lan-\nguage in cases where the issue was not presented or even envisioned. ”).  Read in context, we understand SRA’s refer-\nence to “directly and causally connected to issuance of [a \ntask order]” to refer to government action in the direct \ncausal chain sustaining the issuance of a task order , not to \nall actions taken  under or after issuance of a proper task \norder.   \nSRA filed a bid pro test in the Court of Federal Claims \nalleging that the General Services Administration (GSA) \nviolated various laws when it waiv ed an organizational \nconflict of interest  (OCI) after awarding a task order to \nComputer Sciences Corporation (CSC) .  SRA , 766 F.3d \nat 1410 –11.  There , unlike here,  SRA asked the Court of \nFederal Claims to set aside the issuance of the task order \nto CSC  because of CSC’s OCI .  This is a significant differ-\nence.  Here, Percipient does not challenge the issuance of Task Order 1 to CACI.   \nNotwithstanding it s specific challenge to the issuance \nof the task order to CSC, SRA asserted that the task order \nbar did not apply.  SRA’s principal argument against  the \napplication of the task order bar  was a temporal one.  SRA \nacknowledged that had GSA waive d the alleged OCI  before  \nissuance of the task order, the task order bar would apply.  \nId. at 1413.  But because GSA executed the waiver after  \nissuing the task order, SRA argued that the task order bar \ndid not apply because the alleged violation was “temporally separated” from issuance of the task order.  Id.  at 1412.  \nAddressing SRA’s argument on appeal, we held that “the \nOCI waiver was directly and causally connected to issuance Case: 23-1970      Document: 46     Page: 14     Filed: 06/07/2024PERCIPIENT .AI, INC. v. US 15 \nof [the task order], despite being executed after issuance” \nbecau se “GSA issued the waiver in order to go forward with \nCSC on [ the task order]. ”  Id. at 1413.   We explained that \n“although a temporal disconnect may, in some circum-stances, help to support the non -application of the FASA \nbar, it does not help SRA here.”  Id.   We further explained \nthat GSA ’s delay in  executing the waiver was “inconse-\nquential” since (1) the delay occurred because GSA was un-\naware of the organizational conflict earlier; (2)  GSA “could \nhave executed a waiver prior to awarding [the task order] ”; \nand (3)  “SRA acknowledges that , had GSA waived the al-\nleged OCI prior to issuance, FASA would have barred its \nprotest.”  Id.  Read in context , the court’s statement that \nthe OCI waiver was “directly and causally connected to is-\nsuance” does not broadly refer to work performed under,  or \nevents caused by the task order  as asserted by the Govern-\nment here .  Indeed, if the G overnment’s view of the SRA  \nlanguage were right, the court would have found the be-fore-after distinction not even worth the trouble of explain-\ning away as it did.  Instead, the language refers to an actual \nchallenge to  the issuance of the task order  regardless of \nwhether the alleged violation occurred after issuance of the task order.\n6 \nHere, Percipient does not challenge the issuance or pro-\nposed issuance of a task order.  Percipient’s requested relief \nwould not alter NGA’s  issuance of Task Order 1 to CACI.  \nRather, Percipient largely challenges the failure of NGA \n \n6  Our decision in 22nd Century Technologies, Inc. \nv. United States, 57  F.4th 993 (Fed.  Cir. 2003) , is con-\nsistent.  There, we affirmed the Court of Federal Claim ’s \nholding that the task order bar applied “because 22nd Cen-\ntury’s challenge is to the alleged failure of the task order to require bidders to recertify as small busin esses.”  22nd \nCentury , 57 F.4th  at 999–1000.  T he challenge was to the \nlanguage of the task order itself . Case: 23-1970      Document: 46     Page: 15     Filed: 06/07/2024PERCIPIENT .AI, INC. v. US 16 \nand its contractor to properly review its Mirage product \nand thereby conduct the necessary research required by \nstatute before developing the CV system.  We thus r everse \nthe trial court’s decision that the FASA task order bar ap-\nplies.  \nB \nNext, we turn to whether the statutory  and regulatory  \nviolations alleged by Percipient fall within the Court of Federal Claims’ jurisdiction under the Tucker Act .  Percip-\nient assert ed jurisdiction under the third prong of the \nTucker Act:   “any alleged violation of statute or regulation \nin connection with a procurement or a proposed procure-\nment.”  28 U.S.C. §  1491(b)(1).   We hold that Percipient’s \nprotest —alleging a violation of 10  U.S.C. §  3453 and re-\nlated regulations , which establish a preference for commer-\ncial services —is in connection with the SAFFIRE \nprocurement, and thus falls within the Court of Federal \nClaims’ jurisdiction.    \nDefendants  argue that Percipient’s protest falls outside \nthe third prong  because it is not “in connection with a pro-\ncurement or a proposed procurement.”  Government’s \nBr. 30–33; CACI’s Br.  50–52.  To this end , they character-\nize Percipient’s protest as challenging contract perfor-mance and administrative activities.   Specifically, the \nGovernment argues that the only “procurement” actions af-\nter the issuance of an IDIQ contract are “the issuance of a task order and the acquisition -related decisions that are \nconnected t o the issuance of that task order.”  Govern-\nment’s Br.  33.  Everything else  is contract administration \nor performance.  Id.   And because the IDIQ contract incor-\nporates Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 52.244 -6, \nJ.A. 857, which mirrors 10 U.S.C. § 3453, Defendants  also \nargue that Percipient’s complaint is about CACI’s adher-ence to the contract terms, i.e., its performance.  See Gov-\nernment’s Br.  33; CACI’s Br.  52.  We are not persuaded.  Case: 23-1970      Document: 46     Page: 16     Filed: 06/07/2024PERCIPIENT .AI, INC. v. US 17 \nWe have held that “in connection with a procurement \nor proposed procurement” involves “a connection with any \nstage of the federal contracting acquisition process, includ-ing ‘the process for determining a need for property or ser-\nvices.’”  Distributed Sols., Inc. v.  United States, 539 F.3d \n1340, 1346 (Fed.  Cir. 2008).  As we h ave previously ex-\nplained, “in connection with” is “very sweeping in scope.”  RAMCOR Servs. Grp., Inc. v.  United States, 185 F.3d 1286, \n1289 (Fed.  Cir. 1999).   And “procurement” encompass es \n“all stages of the process of acquiring property or services, beginning with the process for determining a need for prop-\nerty or services and ending with contract completion and closeout.”  Distributed Sol s., 539 F.3d at  1345 –46 (quoting \n41 U.S.C. §  403(2) )\n7.  Naturally, the definition includes \nstages between issuance of a contract award and contract completion, i.e., actions after issuance of a contract award.   \nAccordingly, “in connection with a procurement or pro-posed procurement” encompasses more than “ the issuance \nof a task order and the acquisition -related decisions that \nare connected to the issuance of that task order,” the nar-rowed subset D efendants would like us to adopt.  This is \nimportant in the context of § 3453, whose requirements to \nmaximize acquisition of commercial items suitable to meet \nthe agency’s needs continue and can be violated well after \nthe contract’s award.  Defendants’ argument would allow \nagencies to ignore § 3453 by deferring decisions about com-\nmercial products until after the contract award.  \nWe also reject Defendants ’ argument that because the \nSAFFIRE contract incorporates FAR 52.244 -6, which mir-\nrors §  3453, Percipient’s protest is tethered to contract per-\nformance  and excludes  Tucker Act jurisdiction .  The \nTucker Act  allows for “ any alleged violation of statute or \nregulation in connection with a procurement or a proposed \n \n7  In 2011,  41 U.S.C.  § 403(2) was recodified at \n41 U.S.C. §  111.

Certain Brooks Act possible amendments \nthat would have opened the door to Brooks Act protests by \nsubcontractors were rejected, and the reasons for excluding \nsubcontractor standing were recognized in hearings on \nS. 1587, the final version of FASA , including  § 3453.  For \nexample, these hearings noted that “[e]stablishing a sub-\ncontractor’s right to protest would greatly expand the num-\nber of protests and, consequently the delays in the procurement process[, and i]t would also establish prece-\ndent that privity of  contract exists between the government \nand subcontractors, thereby opening the possibility for di-\nrect subcontractor claims under the Contract Disputes \nAct.”  To Revise and Streamline the Acquisition Laws of the \nFederal Government, and for Other Purposes: Hearing on S. 1587 Before the S. Comm . on Governmental Affs. and the \nS. Comm . on Armed Servs. , 103rd Cong. 293 (1994).  \nRegarding the legislative history of ADRA, this court \nin AFGE extensively relied on the statute’s legislative his-\ntory to support adoptio n of CICA’s standing test for \n§ 1491(b)(1).  See AFGE , 258 F.3d at 1299– 1302.  Rather \nthan quote four pages of the AFGE  opinion, it is enough \nhere to note that the legislative history confirmed that con-\ntractors (not potential subcontractors)  should have \n§ 1491(b)(1) standing and that to construe the statute more \nbroadly would violate the sovereign immunity canon.  \nADRA consolidated pre -award and  post-award contract lit-\nigation in the Claims Court and created a contractor stand-\ning test for the new statute.  Congress  did its ADRA work \nfully aware of its experience in enacting CICA and the Brooks Act, in which it created a contractor standing test that expressly excluded potential subcontractors from \nstanding.  To use the majority’s test, isn’t it difficult to con-clude that Congress in ADRA meant to open the door to protests by potential subcontractors in §  1491(b)(1) when it \nknowingly closed that door in CICA and the Brooks Act , \nespecially when there’s no evidence that Congress was Case: 23-1970      Document: 46     Page: 55     Filed: 06/07/2024PERCIPIENT .AI, INC. v. US 25 \nconcerned with la x enforcement of § 3453 when enacting \nADRA? \nThe majority’s reference to the legislative history of the \nnow repealed Brooks Act deserves comment .  The major ity \nreferences the part of the legislative history that I have \nhighlighted, in which Congress pointed out that granting \nstanding to subcontractors under the Brooks Act might be viewed to suggest that subcontractors would have privity \nwith the government  for direct subcontractor claims under \nthe Contract Disputes Act —despite  the general view that \nsuch privity is required to sue the government under the Tucker Act.  See Merritt v. United States, 267 U.S. 338, \n340– 41 (1925).   \nPrivity is a matter of fact, and under our precedent ac-\ntual subcontractors are absolutely denied standing to sue \nthe government under the Contract Disputes Act.  See Win-\nter v. Floorpro, Inc., 570 F.3d 1367 (Fed. Cir. 2009).  Actual \nsubcontractors are also denied standing under 28 U.S.C. \n§ 1491(a) unless the subcontractor can establish that it is a \nthird- party beneficiary to the underlying prime contract \nwith the government.  See G4S Tech. LLC v. United States, \n779 F.3d 1337 (Fed. Cir. 2015).  \nThus, it is no t surprising that Congress was concerned \nthat granting standing to subcontractors to protest under \nthe Brooks Act would allow a nonparty to a contract to sue \nthe government and thus create a false privity of contract \nwhere none exists.  Interestingly, the majority sees this leg-islative history as supporting denial of standing to poten-\ntial subcontractors for protests under prongs one and two \nof § 1491(b)(1), while at the same time having no effect on  \nstanding for potential subcontractor protests  under prong \nthree of the statute.  Majority Op. at 28 –29.  The majority \nreasons that because prong one and two protests by poten-\ntial subcontractors challenge a contract, proposed contract \nor solicitation, it m akes sense to insist on  privity and thus \ndeny potential subcontractor standing under prongs one Case: 23-1970      Document: 46     Page: 56     Filed: 06/07/2024PERCIPIENT .AI, INC. v. US 26 \nand two.  But because prong three protests do not directly \nchallenge terms of a contract, proposed contract or solicita-\ntion, and instead challenge unlawful cond uct arising in \nperformance of a contract, the m ajority argues that privity \nconcerns evaporate.  This does not make sense.  The re-\nquirement of privity does not care about the nature of the challenge a nonparty wishes to bring against the govern-\nment  on one o f its contracts .  Privity in government con-\ntract law exists to prevent nonparties from challenging the \ngovernment regarding the contracts it forms with parties.  \nA challenge to performance of a contract is no less a chal-\nlenge to a contract than a specific challenge to a particular line item in a solicitation.  Suits brought under the CDA \nand §  1491(a) challenge performance under a contract, and \nprivity of contract bars actual subcontractor standing to \nsue under those provisions.  The m ajority’s attempt to a r-\ngue that privity concerns are neutral for potential  subcon-\ntractor standing under prong three while prohibiting standing under prongs one and two is unconvincing.  \nIt is clear that Percipient, as a potential subcontractor, \nis not in privity of contract with  the government.  The par-\nties have not argued that we need to consider privity of con-tract to decide Percipient’s standing under §  1491(b)(1) , but \nto the extent that privity concerns lurk in the background, those concerns clearly suggest that Percipient should be de-nied standing under all three prongs of the statute.   \nIn sum, Congress considered the legislation resulting \nin § 1491(b)(1) in the light of its previous experience in en-\nacting C ICA, the Brooks Act , and FASA.  Congress under-\nstood the benefits and detriments of subcontractor \nstanding and considered subcontractor standing “wholly \nunnecessary , given that current law authorizes the filing \nof a protest by ‘an actual or prospective bidder or offeror. ’”  \nH.R. Rep. No. 102-364, at 80 –81.  Congress enacted \nADRA’s “interested party” standing test knowing it had al-ready used the same “interested party” standing test in \nCICA and the Brooks Act , in each instance with the Case: 23-1970      Document: 46     Page: 57     Filed: 06/07/2024PERCIPIENT .AI, INC. v. US 27 \nintention of barring subcontractor standing.  The majority \npoints  to no ev idence that Congress, in enacting ADRA, \nmeant to allow standing for potential subcontractors spe-\ncifically to bring § 3453 prong three protests, while barring \nstanding  for other potential subcontractor protests under \nprongs one and two.  \nOther than its unfou nded prediction that the goals of \n§ 3453 are illusory and that the statute will be unenforced \nunless potential subcontractors are granted standing to \nbring prong three protests, the majority has no reason to \nsidestep away from AFGE  and create potential subcontrac-\ntor standing for prong three §  3453 protests.  Were Percip-\nient to survive the task order bar, the court should apply the AFGE  standing test to this case and deny Percipient \nstatutory standing for its complaint.  \nC\nONCLUSION   \nThe decision in this case will have an enormous impact \non government procurements.  \nFor government contracts implemented through issu-\nance of task or delivery orders, the decision significantly \nnarrows the existing reach of the task order bar, which de-\nfeats Tucker Act jurisdiction f or otherwise permissible \n§ 1491(b)(1) protests.  The majority interprets the task or-\nder bar to be limited to protests that allege legal flaw s in \nthe task order, but does so by discarding the binding deci-sion in SRA , which interpreted the task order bar to reach \nbroader alleged violations of law arising in connection with the issuance of a task order.  Whether the SRA  interpreta-\ntion of the scope of the task order bar is “far too broad” as \na policy matter, as the majority asserts, can  be addressed \nby the court sitting en banc, but this panel is bound by \nSRA , and under its test, Percipient’s protest is task order \nbarred.  \nFor protests under §  1491(b)(1), the majority grants po-\ntential subcontractors standing to protest for the first time  Case: 23-1970      Document: 46     Page: 58     Filed: 06/07/2024PERCIPIENT .AI, INC. v.

That t he majority limits potential \nsubcontractor standing to prong three protests involving \nalleged violations of §  3453 may suggest to some  that the \ndecision is not a big deal.  But §  3453 and its sister statute \n41 U.S.C. §  3307  apply  to all government contracts  for \nproducts and services , so it is fair to expect that potential \nsubcontractors will soon flood the Claims Court with \n§ 1491(b)(1) protests.  Think of all the products and ser-\nvices that go into government contracts for a battl eship, or \nairplane, or new headquarters for an agency, and the vast number of potential subcontractors who can so easily allege \npossession of a suitable off- the-shelf product or service and \ninadequate agency attention to §  3453’s requirements.  \nAnd further, the majority’s driving rationale, i.e. , that \nsome laws are so important (here, § 3453) that they require \nrelaxed standing tests to promote compliance , will in time \nlikely  apply to alleged violations of other important laws , \nrequiring specially tailored s tanding requirements.  The \nmajority accomplishes its goal of enhancing  vigilance for  \n§ 3453 by discarding the AFGE  precedent as irrelevant to \nthis case.  As I have demonstrated above, AFGE  binds this \npanel, and Percipient lacks standing under §  1491(b)(1).   \nAnd as a matter of independent consideration, there is no \nsupport for the majority’s new prong three standing test, and there is ample statutory history  evidence that Con-\ngress would object to granting p otential subcontractors \n§ 1491(b)(1) standing of any kind.  As with the task order \nbar issue in this case, the court sitting en banc might con-\nsider additional standing tests for §  1491(b)(1) beyond \nAFGE’s, but this panel cannot . \nFor the many reasons set forth above, I respectfully dis-\nsent.  \n Case: 23-1970      Document: 46     Page: 59     Filed: 06/07/2024",

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: 22nd Century Technologies, Inc. brought a protest against a decision by the Department of the Interior (the \"Agency\") related to the awarding of blanket purchase agreements (BPAs) for IT services. The protest involved the Agency's evaluation of the plaintiff's proposal in a two-phase bidding process, which 22nd Century argued was arbitrary and capricious. The court agreed with 22nd Century, finding the Agency's evaluation was flawed, and ordered a remand for re-evaluation. The involvement of AI in the proposal came up in the context of the plaintiff's use of artificial intelligence to improve cybersecurity and IT efficiency, which was a point of contention in the Agency’s evaluation.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the Agency's decision to exclude 22nd Century Technologies from a set of BPAs was arbitrary and capricious, particularly concerning the evaluation process and how AI/technology implementations were considered.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court held that the Agency’s evaluation process for 22nd Century’s proposal was arbitrary and capricious, specifically noting errors in the evaluation of management and staffing responses. The court granted 22nd Century’s motion for judgment on the administrative record, denied the government’s motion, and remanded the matter back to the Agency for further proceedings, enjoining the Agency from moving forward with the current awards until they comply with the court's order.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine you are in a competition to win a contract to help a government office with computer services, and your plan uses some smart technology like AI. The organizers wrongly judged your plan without really understanding it, and as a result, you lost out. A judge found they didn’t properly review your plan, so now they have to look at it again, and you're getting another shot at winning.",

Compl. at 31 (ECF \n1); Am. Compl. at 17 (ECF 38) ; see Administrative Record 14 (“AR” ). Plaintiff argues \nthat the Agency’s review of two aspects of its proposal was arbitrary and capricious . \nAm. Compl. at 8 –14. The parties have filed cross -motions for judgment on the \nadministrative record, and I have heard oral argument.1 For the reasons discussed \nbelow, Plaintiff’s motion is GRANTED , and Defendant’s motion is  DENIED . The \nmatter is REMANDED  to the Agency, and the Agency is ENJOINED  as described \nbelow.  \nBACKGROUND  \nI.  The Solicitation  \nThe Agency  issued a solicitation,  No. 140D0424Q0045 , requesting proposals to \nperform IT services pursuant to blanket purchase agreements . AR 302  (third \nsolicitation amendment) . Recipients of blanket purchase agreements would have the \nopportunity to compete for assignment of  task orders. See AR 302–03; Federal \nAcquisition Regulation (“FAR”) § 8.405 -3 (codified at 48 C.F.R. § 8.405 -3). The \nsolicitation contemplated between four and eight awards, but the Agency reserved \nthe right to select more or fewer  awarde es. AR 302–03, 311.  \n \n Pursuant to the protective order in this case, the Court initially filed this opinion under seal on \nMarch  10, 2025,  for the parties to propose redactions of confidential or proprietary information. The \nparties were directed to propose redactions by April 9, 2025 . Plaintiff and Defendant submitted \nproposed redactions and supporting memoranda.  No proposed redactions were received from the  \nDefendant -Intervenors . Plaintiff consents to the redactions proposed by the Defendant.  The Court \nproposed additional redactions, which the parties have approved.  The Court has incorporated all \nredactions , and makes them with bracketed ellipses (“[. . .]” below.  \n1 Pl.’s Mot . for J. on the Admin . R. (“Pl.’s MJAR”) (ECF 39); Def.’s Cross -Mot. for J. on the Admin .

Case 1:24-cv-01227-SSS     Document 63     Filed 04/30/25     Page 2 of 16- 3 - \n The solicitation provided for  review of proposals in two phases, based on four \nevaluation factors. In Phase I, the Agency would review “Factor 1: Technical \nExperience.” AR 306.  That factor required offerors to describe their competence in the \n“capability areas” of “ Cyber Infrastructure ,” “Software Engineering ,” “Cyber \nSecurity ,” and “Data Management and Analytics. ” AR 306–07. Based on the Phase I \nreview, t he Agency would advise offerors whether it recommended that they proceed \nto Phase II. AR 304.2 \nIn Phase II, offerors were directed to submit information responsive to “Factor \n2: Management,” “Factor 3: Staffing,” and “Factor 4: Price.” AR 308, 311–12. Factor \n2 and Factor 3, as amended, consisted  primarily  of sets of prompts calling for \nresponses. AR 309 –10. Although the parties have not pointed to a formal rubric for \nhow the Agency rated Factor 2 and Factor 3, the Agency appears to have reviewed \nthe submission s for a combination of “sufficiency” ( i.e., “insufficient,” “minimally \nsufficient,” and so f orth) and performance risk ( i.e., “low confidence,” “moderate \nconfidence,” and “high confidence”). See AR 5110 –21. The Agency planned to make \naward decisions based on a “best value trade -off methodology .” AR 311. Factor 1 \nwould be considered more important than Factor 2 and  Factor  3. AR 311–12. Factor \n1, Factor 2, and Factor 3 combined would be considered significantly more  important \nthan price . Id. \nII.  Evaluation of Plaintiff’s Proposal  \nThe Agency reviewed Plaintiff’s Phase I proposal, rated it “Low Confidence,” \nand recommended that Plaintiff proceed to Phase II. AR 3889 , 5048 , 5109 . This case \nconcerns Plaintiff’s response to two of the Phase II prompts.  See Am. Compl. at 9 , 14. \nA. Factor 2: Management  \nFactor 2, prompt 2 read as follows:  \nDescribe how your company evolved an IT organization’s management \nand process methodologies to meet the increasing demands of \nproductivity and delivery times amid flat or shrinking resources. \nProvide an example of your company’s experience driving organiza tional \nchange, including the approach used and the outcomes achieved, as well \nas the key roles instrumental in your company’s approach.  \nAR 309.   \nPlaintiff interpreted the first and second sentences  of the prompt as calling for \ntwo separate responses: one addressing how it “ evolved an IT organization’s \n \n2 Those recommendations were advisory only; offerors could proceed to Phase II even if the Agency \nrecommended against it. AR 304. Case 1:24-cv-01227-SSS     Document 63     Filed 04/30/25     Page 3 of 16- 4 - \n management and process methodologies ,” and one about its “ experience driving \norganizational change .” See Pl.’s R&R at 5.  \nPlaintiff  accordingly used those two sentences as the headings for separate \nsubsections of its response — 3.2. and 3.2.1.  AR 4051 –52. In subsection 3.2 ., Plaintiff \ndescribed how it used “[. . .] ” at the  [. . .]  to achieve a reduction in IT service tickets. \nAR 4051. It explained how it used artificial intelligence at the  [. . .]  to improve \ncybersecurity. Id. And it stated that it supported  [. . .] through “ [. . .]” at the  [. . .].  Id. \nIn subsection 3.2.1., Plaintiff described its work modernizing IT for  the [. . .].  AR 4052.  \nThe Agency, in its consensus technical evaluation, found th e response to \nprompt 2 “insufficient.” AR 4889. The Agency found it “unclear” whether the  [. . .]  \nproject involved “an evolution of the organization’s management and process \nmethodologies .” Id. In the Agency’s view, the project appeared to be “a technology \nimplementation” rather than the “evolution” the prompt called for. AR 4890. The [. . \n.] project, again, was described in Plaintiff’s subsection 3.2.1., while the prompt’s \nsentence calling for disc ussion of “evolv[ing]  an IT organization’s management and \nprocess methodologies ” appeared in the heading of Plaintiff’s subsection 3.2.  AR \n4051 –52. \nThe Agency did not mention the [. . .] , [. . .] , or [. . .] projects mentioned in \nPlaintiff’s subsection 3.2. Compare  AR 4889 –90 with AR 405 1. The Agency also said, \nhowever, that Plaintiff’s response “lacks details to demonstrate” how the  [. . .] project \n“achieved organizational change .” AR 4890   \nPlaintiff’s other answers to Factor 2 prompts were rated “sufficient” and \n“minimally sufficient.” AR 4888 –90, 5114.  \nB. Factor 3: Staffing  \nFactor 3, prompt 3 read as follows:  \nQuoters shall describe potential challenges with staffing work under \nthese capability areas based on its understanding of the job market and \noutline corresponding mitigation strategies to help ensure successful \nstaffing.  \nAR 310.  \nIn response, Plaintiff identified two challenges: “ [. . .] ” and “ [. . .] .” AR 4061. \nPlaintiff proposed addressing those challenges by [. . .] , as well as through [. . .]  \nstrategies. Id. \nThe Agency found that response “insufficient” as well. AR 4892. The Agency \nstated that the “two challenges … are not related to the Capability Areas” described \nin the solicitation, are not “specific to IT,” and “do not represent a mature Case 1:24-cv-01227-SSS     Document 63     Filed 04/30/25     Page 4 of 16- 5 - \n understanding of the job market .” Id. The Agency also found that Plaintiff’s \n“corresponding mitigations are similarly high level and generic and are not related to \nthe Capability Areas.” Id. “The challenges and mitigations described by [Plaintiff],” \nthe Agency concluded, “are not applicable to work being performed on behalf of” the \nAgency. Id. \nTwo of Plaintiff’s other responses to Factor 3 prompts were rated “sufficient ,” \nand “minimally sufficient ,” and a third was rated “high confidence.”  AR 4891 –93, \n5114.  \nC. Overall Decision  \nIn addition to the “low confidence” rating for Factor 1, the Agency gave Plaintiff \na “low confidence” rating for Factor 2 and Factor 3. AR 5114, 5120. The Agency’s \nSource Selection Decision justified the Factor 2 and Factor 3 ratings based primarily  \non the “insufficient” ratings for answers to the prompts described above:  \nTeam 22nd was considered low confidence for Factor 2 (Management), \nbecause they did not clearly describe supporting organizational change \nmanagement amid flat or shrinking resources. In addition, their \nresponse to Factor 3 (Staffing), was low confidence, b ecause they did not \nclearly describe challenges and mitigations for staffing the [blanket \npurchase agreement] . \nAR 5120.  \nThe Agency compared Plaintiff with several  different offerors,  AR 5134 –36, \n5142 –45, 5147 –49, 5155 –57, 5162 –63, 5167 –69, 5173 –75, and rank ed Plaintiff in \nninth place. AR 5119 –20. The Agency awarded blanket purchase agreements  to the \ntop seven offerors. AR 5119.  \nDISCUSSION  \nI.  Legal Standards  \nA. Jurisdiction and Standing  \nTo reach the merits of the case, I must first determine that the Court has \njurisdiction over Plaintiff’s  claims. See Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Env ’t, 523 U.S. \n83, 94  (1998). This Court ’s jurisdiction in post -award bid protests is derived from the \nTucker Act, as amended by the Administrative Dispute Resolution Act of 1996, Pub. \nL. No. 104 -320, § 12(a) –(b), 110 Stat. 3870, 3874 –75 (1996) (codified at 28 U.S.C. \n§ 1491(b)) . See Dyonyx, L.P. v. United States , 83 Fed. Cl. 460, 464 –65 (2008). The \nTucker Act now grants this Court “jurisdiction to render judgment on an action by an \ninterested party objecting to ... the award of a contract or any alleged violation of \nstatute or regulation in connection with a procurement[.]” 28 U.S.C. § 1491(b)(1). This Case 1:24-cv-01227-SSS     Document 63     Filed 04/30/25     Page 5 of 16- 6 - \n Court is empowered under the statute to “award any relief that the court considers \nproper, including declaratory and injunctive relief[.]” 28 U.S.C. § 1491(b)(2).  \nPlaintiff  must also have standing to challenge the contract award. Plaintiff  has \nArticle III standing because it claims an injury — specifically, denial of a blanket \npurchase agreement  award  — which is traceable to the allegedly defective \nprocurement process and which could be redressed by this Court. See Lujan v. Defs. \nof Wildlife , 504 U.S. 555, 560 –61 (1992) ; see also Weeks Marine, Inc. v. United States , \n575 F.3d 1352, 1359 (Fed. Cir. 2009)  (“The Court of Federal Claims, though an Article \nI court, ... applies the same standing requirements enforced by other federal courts \ncreated under Article III.” ). \nTo establish that it has statutory standing as  an interested party,  see 28 U.S.C. \n§ 1491(b)(1) ; CACI, Inc. -Fed. v. United States , 67 F.4th 1145, 1151 (Fed. Cir. 2023) , a \nplaintiff must show (1) that it “is an actual or prospective bidder” and (2) that it \n“possesses the requisite direct economic interest.” Rex Serv. Corp. v. United States , \n448 F.3d 1305, 1307 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (citing Myers Investigative & Sec. Servs., Inc. v. \nUnited States , 275 F.3d 1366, 1369 –70 (Fed. Cir. 2002) (itself citing Lujan , 504 U.S. \nat 561)).  Here, there is no dispute that Plaintiff meets the two -part test . First, \nPlaintiff  was an actual bidder who submitted a proposal. See AR 362–428, 4036 –63, \n5080.  Second, Plaintiff  has the requisite economic interest . It was  one of the offerors \nrecommended for Phase II , AR 3889 , 5109 , and — as discussed further below — it \nhas “a substantial chance of being awarded  the contract ” if its claims lead the Agency \nto reconsider its evaluation.  McVey Co., Inc. v. United States , 111 Fed. Cl. 387, 405 \n(2013) ; see also Weeks Marine , 575 F.3d at 1359  (quoting Rex Serv. Corp. , 448 F.3d at \n1308) . \nB. Standard of Review  \nThis Court reviews bid protests “pursuant to the standards set forth in section \n706 of title 5,” i.e., the Administrative Procedure Act. 28 U.S.C. § 1491(b)(4); see \nBanknote Corp. of Am., Inc. v. United States , 365 F.3d 1345, 1350 (Fed. Cir. 2004).3 \nThe protester must show that the agency ’s action was arbitrary and capricious and \nthat it was prejudiced by the agency ’s conduct. Id. at 1350 –51; 5 U.S.C. § 706; see \nBannum, Inc. v. United States , 404 F.3d 1346, 1351 (Fed. Cir. 2005) ; Weeks Marine , \n575 F.3d at 1358 –59.  \n \n3 The Agency notes that the solicitation followed the procedures of FAR Subpart 8.4. Def.’s MJAR at \n12; AR 50, 302. Those procedures are less formal in some respects than negotiation procurements \nunder FAR 1 5. Allied Tech. Grp., Inc. v. United States , 94 Fed. Cl. 16, 4 4 (2010), aff’d, 649 F.3d 1320 \n(Fed. Cir. 2011). For example, the requirements for agency discussions with offerors are simpler. Id. \nBut the Agency does not contend that the underlying review for arbitrary and capricious action is \nsubstantively different. See Def.’s MJAR at 11; Tr. at 29 –30. Case 1:24-cv-01227-SSS     Document 63     Filed 04/30/25     Page 6 of 16- 7 - \n There are two bases for setting aside government procurements as arbitrary \nand capricious: “(1) the procurement official’s decision lacked a rational basis; or (2) \nthe procurement procedure involved a violation of regulation or procedure.” Impresa \nConstruzioni Geom. Domenico Garufi v. United States , 238 F.3d 1324, 1332 (Fed. Cir. \n2001); Weeks Marine , 575 F.3d at 1358 (quoting PGBA, LLC v. United States , 389 \nF.3d 1219 , 1225  n.4 (Fed. Cir. 2004) ); see also  Bannum , 404 F.3d at 1351; Advanced \nData Concepts, Inc . v. United States , 216 F.3d 1054, 1057 –58 (Fed. Cir. 2000). The \nfirst route involves determining “whether the contracting agency provided a coherent \nand reasonable explanation of its exercise of discretion.” Impresa , 238 F.3d at 1332 –\n33 (quotes omitted) ( quoting Latecoere Int ’l, Inc. v. United States Dep ’t of Navy , 19 \nF.3d 1342, 1356 (11th Cir. 1994)). To succeed, “the disappointed bidder bears a heavy \nburden of showing that the award decision had no rational basis.” Id. at 1333 (quotes \nomitted) ( quoting Saratoga Dev. Corp. v. United States , 21 F.3d 445, 456 (D.C. Cir. \n1994)  (itself quoting  Kentron Haw ., Ltd. v. Warner , 480 F.2d 1166, 1169 (D.C.  Cir. \n1973) )). The second route requires the disappointed bidder to “show a clear and \nprejudicial violation of applicable statutes or regulations.” Id. (quotes omitted)  \n(quoting Kentron , 480 F.2d at 1169 , and Latecoere , 19 F.3d at 1356) . In either case, \nthis Court ’s review is “highly deferential” to agency decision -making, Advanced Data \nConcepts , 216 F.3d at 1058 — especially in an award based on best value, where “the \ncontracting officer ha[s] even greater discretion than if the contract were to have been \nawarded on the basis of cost alone.” Galen Med. Assocs., Inc. v. United States , 369 \nF.3d 1324, 1330 (Fed. Cir. 2004); see also Cleveland Assets, LLC v. United States , 883 \nF.3d 1378, 1382 (Fed. Cir. 2018).  \n“Further, in addition to identifying ‘a significant error in the procurement \nprocess,’ a protestor must show ‘that the error prejudiced it.’” Wis. Physicians Serv. \nIns. Corp. v. United States , 151 Fed. Cl. 22, 32 (2020) (quoting Data Gen. Corp. v. \nJohnson , 78 F.3d 1556, 1562 (Fed. Cir. 1996)).  Prejudice cannot be presumed. Sys. \nStud. & Simulation, Inc. v. United States , 22 F.4th 994, 998 (Fed. Cir. 2021) . “[T]o \nestablish prejudice, a protester must show that, had it not been for the alleged error \nin the pro curement process, there was a reasonable likelihood that the protester \nwould have been awarded the contract.” Data Gen. Corp. , 78 F.3d at 1562.  \nWhen resolving motions for judgment on the administrative record under Rule \n52.1(c), this Court proceeds “as if it were conducting a trial on the record.” Bannum , \n404 F.3d at 1354 (addressing former RCFC 56.1); see also Young v. United States , 497 \nF. App’x 53, 58 –59 (Fed. Cir. 2012)  (addressing the standard under RCFC 52.1 and \nciting Bannum , 404 F.3d at 1356) .  Case 1:24-cv-01227-SSS     Document 63     Filed 04/30/25     Page 7 of 16- 8 - \n II.  Merits  \nThe facts of this bid protest  are unusually simple. I conclude that the Agency \nfailed to conduct a rational review of Plaintiff’s proposal, and that the error prejudiced \nPlaintiff.  \nA. Evaluation Error s \nThe first error was in Factor 2: Management. The Agency considered Plaintiff’s \nproposal insufficient because it concluded Plaintiff had failed to address part of \nFactor 2, prompt 2: namely, the sentence asking  “how [Plaintiff]  evolved an IT \norganization’s management and process methodologies [.]” AR 4889 –90. But \nPlaintiff’s proposal did include a response to that part of the prompt, in its \nsubparagraph  3.2. AR 4051.  The Agency’s  failure to consider that response renders \nits review of the proposal arbitrary and capricious.  See Air Borealis Ltd. P ’ship v . \nUnited States , 167 Fed. Cl. 370, 385 (2023)  (“When the government misinterprets a \nproposal, its decision may be arbitrary or capricious. ”).   \nThe omission  cannot reasonably  be ascribed to the Agency’s technical judgment \non Plaintiff’s proposal , for there is no question that Plaintiff intended subparagraph \n3.2. to address the subjects the Agency believed were missing. Most obviously, \nPlaintiff used the relevant language as the heading for that part of its proposal. AR \n4051.  The government conceded at argument that the Agency was obligated to \nconsider both parts of Plaintiff’s discussion. Tr. 32 –33. But the government also \nconceded that  there is no  evidence that the  Agency did so . Id. The Agency  did not \neven mention the examples Plaintiff provided in subparagraph 3.2. See AR 5114, \n5120. Instead, it focused solely on the example mentioned in subparagraph 3.2.1. AR \n4889 –90. Although that subparagraph’s heading mentioned only the second part of \nthe Factor 2, prompt 2 — concerning Plaintiff’s “ experience driving organizational \nchange ,” AR 405 2 — the Agency looked to that section for Plaintiff’s response on the \nfirst sentence as well , AR 4889 –90. The Agency appears simply to have missed the \nrelevant di scussion.  \nAt best, the Agency contends that it “fully considered” Plaintiff’s proposal, \nDef.’s Reply at 2 –3, but simply read the two sections in an “integrated” way. See Tr. \nat 32 –33. Even if that is true, there is no evidence of it, id., so the argument assumes \nthat the Agency’s reason s for rejecting parts of the proposal are  undocumented. And \nthat is just another form of error: “Where the agency fails ... to document [its] review, \nwe must conclude that it acted irrationally.” Starry Assocs ., Inc v. United States , 127 \nFed. Cl. 539, 550 (2016); see also Advanced  Data Concepts , 216 F.3d at 1058 \n(explaining that an agency action should be sustained when it demonstrates \n“consideration of relevant factors”) (citing Bowman Transp., Inc. v. Ark .-Best Freight Case 1:24-cv-01227-SSS     Document 63     Filed 04/30/25     Page 8 of 16- 9 - \n Sys., Inc. , 419 U.S. 281, 285 (1974) ); DigiFlight, Inc. v. United States , 165 Fed. Cl. \n588, 607 (2023) (explaining that even FAR Subpart 8.4’s streamlined documentation  \nrequires the agency to provide enough documentation of the “reasoned basis for the \nagency’s decision” to permit “effective judicial review under the Tucker Act, applying \nthe APA standard[.]”) . \nThe Agency may not have anticipated that Plaintiff would  bifurcate its \nresponse to the two sentences of Factor 2, prompt 2. But Plaintiff was not alone in \nconsidering the sentences separate, at least to some extent.  [. . .] used the prompt as \nthe heading for its subsection 3.2 ., then used the prompt’s two sentences as \nsubheadings for paragraphs describing what appear to be different sets of projects. \nAR 4653 –54. [. . .]  used the first sentence of the prompt as a heading for subsection \n3.2., and the second s entence for subsection 3.2.1., with additional discussion of \n“organizational change” in subsection 3.2.2. AR 4808 –11. The [. . .] and [. . .] proposals \nare not exactly like Plaintiff’s, of course, and the Agency has discretion to evaluate \ntheir relative technical merits. See Air Borealis , 167 Fed. Cl. at 382; One Largo Metro, \nLLC v. United States , 109 Fed. Cl. 39 , 97 (2013) . But both [. . .]  and [. . .]  received \nawards,  AR 5119, 5473, 5532 , so the organization of Plaintiff’s response could not \nhave been either surprising or impermissible.4  \nTo be clear, t he Agency was not obligated to “ search through [Plaintiff’s]  entire \nproposal to find responsive information that should have been located elsewhere [.]” \nBarbaricum LLC v. United States , 172 Fed. Cl. 186, 199 –200 (2024) . Nor was it \nobligated to spell out its response to every point in the proposal. See Integrated Fin. \n& Acct. Sols., LLC v. United States , 161 Fed. Cl. 475, 49 5–96 (2022)  (citing 22nd \nCentury Techs., Inc. v. United States , No. 21 -1137, 2021 WL 3856038, at *10 (Fed. Cl. \nJuly 21, 202 1)). Yet the Agency  was obligated to give Plaintiff’s proposal a fair reading  \nand a reasoned response . See IBM Corp. v. United States , 119 Fed. Cl. 145, 157 (2014)  \n(“[T]he Court should read the proposal as a whole in order to discern the meaning of \nany individual parts .”); DigiFlight , 165 Fed. Cl. at 607 . A fair review of the proposal \n— with two numerically connected sections , on consecutive pages, using the two \nsentences of the prompt as headings — should have made it reasonably clear to the \nreviewers what Plaintiff intended. Disregarding half of Plaintiff’s response without \nexplanation fell short of the fair reading to which Plaintiff was entitled.  \n \n4 To the extent there was any ambiguity as to whether the solicitation permitted offerors to treat the \ntwo sentences of the prompt as separate questions calling for separate answers, it was a latent \nambiguity that must be construed in the offeror ’s favor. Valley Realty Co. v. United States , 96 Fed. Cl. \n16, 31 (2010)  (“If … the ambiguity is latent or not obvious, the general rule of contra proferentem  \ncontrols. ”) (citing HPI/GSA 3C, LLC v. Perry , 364 F.3d 1327 , 1334  (Fed. Cir. 2004) ). Case 1:24-cv-01227-SSS     Document 63     Filed 04/30/25     Page 9 of 16- 10 - \n The second error was in Factor 3: Staffing. The Agency found the proposal \ninsufficient because  it did not consider  [. . .] and [. . .] related to staffing for the \nCapability Areas of the solicitation, the IT job market , or the Agency’s work. AR 4892 . \nIn the abstract, that decision is hard to challenge.  An agency has wide discretion to \nevaluate the technical adequacy of proposals . Barbaricum , 172 Fed. Cl. at 197 (citing \nE.W. Bliss Co. v. United States , 77 F.3d 445, 449 (Fed. Cir. 1996)) . Subject -matter \nexper ts reviewing proposals are best situated to determine whether a particular \nofferor has evinced sufficient familiarity with the relevant field.  See id. \nThe problem for the Agency here, though, is that other offerors described \nstaffing challenges in similar terms, and the Agency did not raise similar objections.  \n[. . .] ’s offer mentioned three staffing challenges, including [. . .]  and [. . .].  AR 4521. \nThe Agency considered those challenges responsive to the prompt. AR 4941, 5111. \nCustomer Value Partners’ offer similarly pointed to a [. . .],  AR 4268, and received \ncredit from the Agency too. AR 4931, 5115.  If those challenges were responsive, it is \nhard to imagine why Plaintiff’s references to a “ [. . .]”  and “ [. . .]” would not have been, \nAR 4061, much less why the Agency could have dismissed the relevance of Plaintiff’s \nproposal in such emphatic language. AR 4892. The Agency has not explained  why it \nconsidered the same staffing challenges relevant in some proposals but not in \nPlaintiff’s.  \nThe government characterizes this issue as a claim of disparate evaluation by \nthe Agency , which it argues that  Plaintiff forfeited by raising in its Response & Reply \nrather than its opening brief. Def.’s Reply at 7 . Whatever the best characterization \nmight be, Plaintiff was clear all along in arguing that its response to Factor 3, prompt \n3 should have been considered adequate. Pl.’s MJAR at 10 –13. The reference to the \nother offerors was simply additional argumentation in support of the basic claim.  See \nOnes imus Def. LLC v. United States , 173 Fed. Cl. 344 , 354 –55 (2024 ); Tech . \nInnovation All . LLC v. United States , 149 Fed. Cl. 105, 131 (2020) ; see also Tr. at 21 –\n22. Although Plaintiff should ideally have presented that specific point in its opening \nbrief, raising it in the response brief at least allowed the government an opportunity \nto respond. This Court has not found a forfeiture even in much more severe  \ncircumstances.  Am. Corr. Healthcare, Inc. v. United States , 137 Fed. Cl. 395 , 420 –21 \n(2018)  (addressing a claim for injunctive relief presented for the first time in a \nresponse and reply ) (citing SmithKline Beecham Corp. v. Apotex Corp. , 439 F.3d 1312 , \n1320 n.9  (Fed. Cir. 2006) , and Ironclad/EEI v. United States , 78 Fed. Cl. 351, 358  \n(2007)) .  \nThe government also argues that the Agency reviewers objected primarily to \nPlaintiff’s plans to mitigate staffing challenges — i.e., [. . .]  — as too generic to be \nhelpful. Def.’s MJAR at 20 –21. The problem with that response is that it contradicts Case 1:24-cv-01227-SSS     Document 63     Filed 04/30/25     Page 10 of 16- 11 - \n the words the Agency used.  The Agency explicitly distinguished its criticisms of \nPlaintiff’s staffing challenges and mitigations . AR 4892  (stating that the “challenges” \nwere “not related to the Capability Areas” and the “mitigations” were “high level and \ngeneric”).  The potential shortcomings of Plaintiff’s plans are thus separate, in the \nAgency’s own view, from Plaintiff’s diagnosis of the problem.  See id. Even if the \nAgency could  permissibly have  consider ed the mitigations too generic,  see Air \nBorealis , 167 Fed. Cl. at 382,  it should have started from a reasonable, non -arbitrary \nposition on the challenges themselves.  \nTo be clear, I do not hold that the Agency should have given Plaintiff a higher \nrating for either prompt, let alone for Factor 2 or Factor 3 as a whole. I do conclude, \nthough, that the Agency did not give those prompts the fair, rational review that was \nrequired.   \nB. Prejudice  \nThe Agency ’s errors prejudiced Plaintiff, at least within the meaning this Court \nhas applied to the term in bid protests.5 The solicitation, recall, contemplated  \napproximately four to eight blanket purchase agreements, and the Agency awarded \nseven . Plaintiff was ranked ninth. AR 311, 5119 –20. The most straightforward way \nfor Plaintiff to demonstrate prejudice is to show how re -evaluation of its proposal  in \nlight of the errors noted above  might put it in the top eight offerors, where it could be \nconsidered again for an award.  See Accura Eng ’g & Consulting Servs., Inc. v. United \nStates , 167 Fed. Cl. 258, 272 ( 2023) ; Harmonia Holdings Grp., LLC v. United States , \n167 Fed. Cl. 448, 461 , 475  (2023 ); Allicent Tech., LLC v. United States , 166 Fed. Cl. \n77, 108 (2023), as amended  (July 18, 2023), reconsideration denied , No. 22 -1380C, \n2023 WL 4287196 (Fed. Cl. June 30, 2023);  Serco Inc. v. United States , 81 Fed. Cl. \n463, 501 (2008) (explaining that the fundamental question in this type of solicitation \nis whether the “protester had a substantial chance of receiving a contract award in \naddition to the other awardees,” not “instead of” a current awardee)  (emphasis \nomitted) ; see also CACI, Inc. -Fed. v. United States , 719 F.2d 1567, 1574 –75 (Fed. Cir. \n1983) (discussing prejudice to offerors “within the zone of active consideration”) . Two \ndifferent approaches  show how reconsideration might do just that.   \nFirst,  compare Plaintiff’s evaluations with those of the eighth -ranked offeror, \n[. . .]. AR 5120. Both Plaintiff and [. . .] were rated “low confidence” for Factor 1, Factor \n2, and Factor 3. Id. But the ratings for the Factor 2 and Factor 3 prompts were \n \n5 Determination of prejudice on the merits “employs the same standards as the prejudice \ndetermination for purposes of standing[.] The difference between the two is that the prejudice \ndetermination for purposes of standing assumes all non -frivolous allegatio ns to be true, whereas the \npost-merits prejudice determination is based only on those allegations which have been proven true.” \nL-3 Commc ’ns Corp. v. United States , 99 Fed. Cl. 283, 289 (2011).  Case 1:24-cv-01227-SSS     Document 63     Filed 04/30/25     Page 11 of 16- 12 - \n different. [. . .]’ s responses were “minimally sufficient” for three Factor 2 prompts, see \nAR 4947 –50, 5115 , while Plaintiff had one “sufficient,” one “minimally sufficient,” and \none (potentially erroneous) “insufficient.” AR 4888 –90, 5114 . An improvement in \nPlaintiff’s “insufficient” rating after reconsideration could potentially make Plaintiff’s \nFactor 2 evaluation superior to [. . .]’s. \nSimilarly, for Factor 3’s prompts, both Plaintiff and [. . .] received one \n“sufficient,” one “minimally sufficient,” one “insufficient ,” and one “high confidence” \nrating . AR 4891 –93, 4951 –53, 5114, 5116 . Improvement of Plaintiff’s “insufficient” \nrating on reconsideration could place Plaintiff ahead of  [. . .] on Factor 3 as well.  \nThen turn to pricing. Plaintiff quoted just under $ [. . .] million. AR 5123. [. . .] \nquoted a price of approximately $[. . .] million.  Id. The current seventh -ranked offeror, \nAccenture  — the lowest -ranked offer to receive a blanket purchase agreement — \nquoted $794 million . AR 5120, 5123.  It therefore seems at least plausible that an \nimprovement in Plaintiff’s Factor 2 and Factor 3 ratings, combined with Plaintiff’s \nprice advantages, could make Plaintiff’s proposal appear more attractive than [. . .]’s \nand m ore economical than Accenture’s . In that situation, Plaintiff may have a \nsubstantial chance of an award.  Samsara Inc. v. United States , 169 Fed. Cl. 311, 330 –\n31 (2024) . \nSecond  — besides the comparison between Plaintiff and  [. . .]  — Plaintiff \nsuggests a comparison to ECS , the current fifth -ranked offeror . Pl.’s MJAR at 4 n.4 ; \nsee AR 5119 . ECS was rated “some confidence” for Factor 1, and “low confidence” for \nFactor 2 and Factor 3. AR 5059 –60. Plaintiff was rated “low confidence” for all three \nfactors — with errors potentially infecting Factor 2 and Factor 3 . AR 5060 . The \nsolicitation described Factor 1 as more important than Factor 2 and Factor 3, and the \nthree substantive factors as significantly more important than price. AR 312.  But \nECS’s quoted price was approximately $742 million — over $ [. . .] million more than \nPlaintiff’s. AR 5123 . It is plausible that improvement in Plaintiff’s Factor 2 and \nFactor 3 evaluations, combined with the price advantage, could lead the Agency to \nconsider Plaintiff’s proposal comparable to ECS’s, at least for the price. That could \ngive Plaintiff a substantial chance of an award as well.  See Samsara , 169 Fed. Cl. at \n330–31. \nThe government’s main response is that Plaintiff’s low rating for Factor 1: \nTechnical Experience justified the Agency’s overall review of Plaintiff’s proposal as \ncompared with other proposals. Def.’s MJAR at 21 –23. The government points out \nthat Factor 1 was most important , AR 31 2, and that the Agency  may have expected \nan especially compelling Phase II response from Plaintiff before making an award. \nDef.’s MJAR at  22. But two proposals rated “low confidence” at Phase I received Case 1:24-cv-01227-SSS     Document 63     Filed 04/30/25     Page 12 of 16- 13 - \n awards, AR 5119 –20 — specifically, NTT  and Accenture — so that rating is hardly \nthe disqualification that the government suggests. It depends, rather, on the strength \nof an offeror’s Factor 2 and Factor 3 proposals (both of which were erroneously \nevaluated in Plaintiff’s case) and on price.  \nMore fundamentally,  the government’s argument ignores the standard of \nreview.  The point of reviewing contracting decisions for arbitrary and capricious \nagency action is to keep judicial decisions from displacing the technical judgment of \nexperts tasked with administrative responsibility. Harmonia Holdings Grp., LLC v. \nUnited States , 999 F.3d 1397, 1408 (Fed. Cir. 2021);  Squire Sols., Inc. v. United States , \n156 Fed. Cl. 249, 267 –68 (2021) ; see also, e.g. , Barbaricum , 172 Fed. Cl. at 197 . For \nthat reason, even when this Court sets aside an agency action, it generally cannot \ndetermine  what rating  the agency  should have applied.  Tesla Lab ’ys, Inc. v. United \nStates , 172 Fed. Cl. 505, 529, 531, 536 (2024) . As a result, instead of directing what \nratings to apply and what contracts to award, this Court  ordinarily must remand for \nfurther agency action . See id. at 536; see also  IAP Worldwide Servs., Inc. v. United \nStates, 160 Fed. Cl. 57, 82 (2022) (explaining that when an agency retains some \ndiscretion, a remand is the preferred remedy ) (citing Huff v. Vilsack , 195 F. Supp. 3d \n343, 362 (D.D.C. 2016)) .  \nThe Court’s lack of authority to impose its own technical analysis on remand \nis a double -edged sword for agencies: It implies that this Court cannot predict the \nratings an agency might apply after a fair review.  See Fluor Intercontinental, Inc. v. \nUnited States , 147 Fed. Cl. 309, 338 (2020) . The government’s prejudice argument — \nwhich depends on piling up hypotheticals about future technical judgments and \ncomparisons between offerors  — thus asks this Court to preempt decisions committed \nto the Agency. Just as this Court cannot raise a technical rating based on a p laintiff’s \nargument , see, e.g. , Patriot Taxiway Indus., Inc. v. United States , 98 Fed. Cl. 575, \n585–86 (2011) (explaining that to the extent plaintiff argued for higher ratings, \nplaintiff was “asking the Court to step into the shoes of the [] evaluators,” and that \nthis “Court does not sit as a super source selection authority to second guess and re -\nscore  offerors’ proposals.”) , it cannot prospectively presume an unfavorable  rating \nbased on the government’s argument.  See CACI , 67 F.4th at 1154 (explaining th at “a \ndeclaration from a contracting officer as to how she would resolve the case is no \nsubstitute for a remand where the challenging party would have a full opportunity to \npresent the case to the contracting officer” ).  \nOnce again , I do not hold that the Agency must  upgrade the rating or ranking \nof Plaintiff’s proposal, or that it must compare Plaintiff’s proposal to other proposals \nmore favorably. Rather, given the prejudice standard, the record shows that if Case 1:24-cv-01227-SSS     Document 63     Filed 04/30/25     Page 13 of 16- 14 - \n Plaintiff’s proposal were re -evaluated under the correct standard, there is a \nsubstantial chance that Plaintiff could receive an award.  \nC. Remedy  \nThe proper remedy, at the outset, is a remand to the Agency for reconsideration \nof Plaintiff’s proposal. The Agency may choose whether to re-evaluate Plaintiff’s offer, \ncancel or restart the procurement, or take other action consistent with this Opinion.  \nAccura , 167 Fed. Cl. at 276.  \nPlaintiff has requested that remand be accompanied by an injunction \nprohibiting the Agency from competing  or awarding  task orders among current \nblanket purchase agreement awardees based on the current award decision. Pl.’s \nMJAR at 17 –20. The government objects.  Def.’s MJAR at 24 –26. The following test \napplies:  \nOnce a plaintiff has succeeded on the merits, in determining whether to \ngrant a permanent injunction, the court considers three factors: \n(1) whether the plaintiff will suffer irreparable harm if the procurement \nis not enjoined; (2) whether the harm suffere d by the plaintiff, if the \nprocurement action is not enjoined, will outweigh the harm to the \ngovernment and third parties; and (3) whether granting injunctive relief \nserves (or is at least not contrary to) the public interest.  \nFed. Acquisition Servs. Team, LLC  v. United States , 124 Fed. Cl. 690, 707–08 (2016)  \n(citing Centech Grp., Inc. v. United States , 554 F.3d 1029, 1037 (Fed. Cir. 2009) , \nPGBA, LLC , 389 F.3d at 1228 –29, and Supreme Foodservice GmbH v. United States , \n109 Fed. Cl. 369, 383 (2013)).  I conclude that an injunction is warranted.  \nFirst, it is well established that loss of an opportunity to compete fairly for a \ncontract constitutes irreparable harm. T Square  Logistics Servs. Corp. v. United \nStates , 134 Fed. Cl. 550, 560 (2017) (“[P]laintiff has shown that absent injunctive \nrelief, it will suffer irreparable harm in the form of a lost opportunity to compete for \nthe award at issue.”); RLB Contracting , Inc. v. United States , 118 Fed. Cl. 750, 761 \n(2014)  (“[I]n the context of a bid protest, the loss of an opportunity to compete for an \naward for which a party would not otherwise be disqualified is sufficient injury to \nwarrant injunctive relief .”); PGBA, LLC  v. United States , 57 Fed. Cl.  655, 664 (2003) \n(“[A]  lost opportunity to compete may constitute an irreparable harm [.]”). That logic \nextends to procurements where, as here, the award consists of an opportunity to \ncompete for task orders.  Allicent Tech., LLC , 166 Fed. Cl. at 186; Sirius Fed., LLC v. \nUnited States , 153 Fed. Cl. 410, 428 (2021).  \nSecond, the balance of harms favors Plaintiff. The Agency claims that an \ninjunction “ may interrupt [its] critical scientific work, where long -term partnerships Case 1:24-cv-01227-SSS     Document 63     Filed 04/30/25     Page 14 of 16- 15 - \n with IT providers are critical to cybersecurity and stability .” Def.’s MJAR at 26. The \nAgency has brought no evidence to substantiate that concern . That leaves little basis \nto find that the government will be harmed.  \nBut even assuming  that some disruption is possible , only in an “exceptional \ncase” do contracting delays alone justify denial of injunctive relief. CW Gov’t Travel, \nInc. v. United States , 110 Fed. Cl. 462, 495 (2013) (quoting Reilly’s Wholesale Produce \nv. United States , 73 Fed. Cl. 705, 715 (2006) (itself quoting Ellsworth Assocs., Inc. v. \nUnited States , 45 Fed.  Cl. 388, 399 (1999) )). The Agency’s IT needs are certainly \nlegitimate, but it must satisfy them through  permissible channels. Accura , 167 Fed. \nCl. at 275 (“Whatever the government ’s ultimate goals in a procurement — as in any \nother regulatory process — the government has to follow the applicable law on the \nway there. ”). In any event, the harm to the Agency of having to reconsider a \nprocurement in a fair and rational way does not outweigh the harm to a n individual \norganization that was denied its right to fair consideration. See i d. at 275 –76 (citing \nT Square , 134 Fed. Cl. at 560).  I therefore conclude that the balance of harms favors \ninjunctive relief.   \nThird, “the public interest always favors the correct application of law.” Id. at \n276 (alteration omitted)  (quoting RLB Contracting , 118 Fed. Cl. at 761 ). That leaves \nit hard to imagine any circumstance where it is in the public interest for an agency \nto act arbitrarily or capriciously. “[W]here, as here, defendant erred, it is both proper \nand in the public interest [] for the court to step in and protect the integrity of the \nprocurement process.”  T Square , 134 Fed. Cl. at 56 1. \nBecause the Agency should  have the opportunity to reconsider its decisions on \nremand, I do not enjoin it to take any particular action related to Plaintiff.  Rather, \nthe Court shall enjoin the Agency  not to compete or award task orders under the \ncurrent award decisions  until it complies with the terms of the remand, as further \nexplained below . \nCONCLUSION  \nFor the foregoing reasons, Plaintiff’s Motion for Judgment on the \nAdministrative Record  (ECF 39)  is GRANTED and the government’s Cross -Motion  \nfor Judgment on the Administrative Record (ECF 40)  is DENIED .  \nPursuant to RCFC 52.2, t he case is REMANDED  for 60 days to the Agency  for \nfurther proceedings . The Agency is ORDERED to proceed with the procurement \nconsistent with this Opinion. The Agency may re -evaluate Plaintiff’s offer, cancel the \nprocurement, start the procurement process over again, or take other action \nconsistent with this Opinion.  Case 1:24-cv-01227-SSS     Document 63     Filed 04/30/25     Page 15 of 16- 16 - \n It is further ORDERED  that no later than  May 9, 2025 , the parties shall file \neither a stipulation of dismissal or a joint status report including the Agency’s  \ndecisions on remand.  \nIt is further ORDERED that if no stipulation of dismissal is filed, the parties \nshall file a joint status report no later than June 9, 2025 , proposing further \nproceedings in this case.  \nThis case shall be STAYED  pending the Agency’s decision.  \nThe Agency  is ENJOINED  from competing or awarding task orders among \ncurrent awardees until further order of the Court or a joint stipulation of dismissal is \nfiled, whichever comes first.  \nPursuant to the Court’s August 21 , 202 4, Protective Order (ECF 10), this \nOpinion has been issued under seal. The transcript of oral argument is under seal as \nwell. The parties  shall have two weeks to propose redactions and, accordingly, are \nORDERED  to file notice of their proposed redactions no later than April 9, 2025 .

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: The court case involves the United States and several states suing Google LLC for violating Section 2 of the Sherman Act due to Google's monopolistic practices in the general search services market. The court found that Google used exclusive agreements to maintain its dominance, effectively freezing competition. The case also considers the potential impact of generative AI products like ChatGPT as competitive threats to Google's search engine. The court imposed various remedies to address these violations, including prohibiting Google from entering exclusive distribution agreements but refrained from requiring structural remedies like Chrome divestiture, citing concerns about potential harms.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: The primary legal issue was whether Google's exclusive agreements with device manufacturers, browser developers, and other partners constituted unlawful monopolistic practices under Section 2 of the Sherman Act, which harmed competition in the search engine and advertising markets.\n\n3. **Court’s Holding**: The court held that Google violated the Sherman Act by maintaining its monopoly in the general search services and search text advertising markets through exclusionary agreements. The court imposed various remedies to enhance competition but did not require Google to divest its Chrome or Android businesses. It ordered Google to share certain data and syndicate services with competitors to mitigate the anti-competitive effects of its conduct.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine Google as the biggest kid in the playground who wants others to keep using their toys. It made deals with other kids, offering treats (like money), so they wouldn't play with any other toys. The court stepped in and said that's not fair because it prevented any other kids from bringing their toys (new search engines or AI assistants) to the playground. So, the court told Google it can't make those kinds of deals anymore but didn't take away their toys (like Chrome) because taking away toys might make things worse. Now, Google has to share some of its stuff with others to give everyone a better chance to play together nicely.",

These access points were \nthe most efficient channels for distributing a GSE , and  Google paid billions to lock them up.  \nThe agreements harmed competition .  They prevented rivals from accumulating  the queries and \nassociated data, or scale,  to effectively compete  and discouraged investment and entry into the \nmarket .  And they  enabled Google to earn monopoly profits from its search text ads , to amass an \nunparalleled volume of scale to improve its search product, and to remain  the default GSE  without \nfear of being displaced.   Taken together, t hese agreements effectively “f roze” the search \necosystem, resulting in markets in which  Google ha s “no true competi tor.”   \nMuch has changed since the end of the liability trial, though some things have not.  Google \nis still the dominant firm in  the relevant product markets.  No existing rival has wrest ed market \nshare from Google.  And no new competitor has entered the market.  But artificial intelligence \ntechnologies, particularly generative AI ( “GenAI ”), may yet prove to be game changer s.  \nToday,  tens of millions of people use GenAI chatbots, like ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Claude, to \ngather information that the y previously soug ht through internet search.   These GenAI chatbots are \nnot yet close to replacing GSEs, but the industry expect s that developers will continue to add \nfeatures to GenAI products to perform more like GSE s.    \nThe emergence of GenAI changed the course of this case.  No witness at the liability trial \ntestified that GenAI product s posed a near-term threat to GSEs .  The very first witness at the Case 1:20-cv-03010-APM     Document 1436     Filed 09/02/25     Page 5 of 230 \n2 remedies hearing , by contrast , placed GenAI front and center  as a nascent competitive threat .  \nThese remedies  proceedings thus have been as much about promoting competition among GSEs \nas ensuring that Google’s dominance in search does not carry over into the GenAI space.   Many \nof Plaintiffs’ proposed remedies are crafted with that latter objective in mind.       \nThe question now is what to do about Google’s violations.  Precedent requires fashion ing \nantitrust remedies that “effectively pry open to competition  a market that has been closed” by a \nmonopolist’s “illegal restraints.”  Int’l Salt Co. v. United States , 332 U.S. 392, 401 (1947).  \nDenying the fruits of the violation  is a valid objective , and so , too, is ensur ing that anticompetitive \nbehavior will not recur in the same or related ways .  The court  has broad discretion to impose \nremedies  to accomplish  those aims .   \nNotwithstanding this power, courts must approach the task of crafting  remedies with a \nhealthy dose of humility.  This court has done so.  It has no expertise in the business of GSEs , the \nbuying and selling of search text ads , or the enginee ring of GenAI technologies .  And, unlike the \ntypical case where the court’s job is to resolve a dispute based on historic facts, here the court is \nasked to gaze into a crystal ball and look to the future.  Not  exactly a judge’s forte.        \nBecause of what is at stake , the remedies phase has been contentious.  The p arties have \nseen eye-to-eye on very little.   In Google’s view, there is little work to be done.  The only \nappropriate remedy is to enter an injunction that prohibits it from entering into exclusive \ndistribution agreements, which would include its GenAI product s, the Gemini app  and Google \nAssistant .  Google says it has already  stripped from its existing contracts the provisions that the \ncourt found had an exclusionary impact , so the market is now effectively unfettered and open to \ncompetition.   It also urge s the court to do nothing more because the GenAI technology space is Case 1:20-cv-03010-APM     Document 1436     Filed 09/02/25     Page 6 of 230 \n3 highly competitive, and any further restrictions would unfairly hobble it in that fight.  Google asks \nthat the final judgment be for a term of three  years.   \nPlaintiffs believe that far more  must be done.  Simply enjoining Google’s bad acts, as \nGoogle insists, would maintain the status quo.  Plaintiffs therefore have put forward a \ncomprehensive slate of remedies , whose component parts , they claim, work together both to revive \ncompetition in the general search  market and to protect the GenAI market from suffering the same \nfate as search.  Plaintiffs’ proposals can be collected into three general categories:  (1) structural \nremedies ; (2) behavioral remedies ; and (3) administrative, anti -retaliation, and anti -circumvention \nremedies.  Plaintiffs ask that the judgment remain in place for up to 10 years.   \nBecause of the number and complexity of the parties’ proposed remedies, the court does \nnot recite its conclusions and reasoning in detail  in this introduction .  But here are the top -line \ndeterminations : \n• Google will be barred from entering or maintaining any exclusive contract \nrelating to  the distribution  of Google Search, Chrome, Google Assistant, \nand the Gemini app .  Google shall not enter or m aintain any agreement that \n(1) condition s the licensing of the Play Store or any other Google \napplication  on the distribution , preloading, or placement of Google Search , \nChrome , Google Assistant, or the Gemini app anywhere on a device; \n(2) conditions  the receipt of revenue share  payments for the placement of \none Google application  (e.g., Search, Chrome, Google  Assistant, or the \nGemini app) on the placement of another such application ; (3) condition s \nthe receipt of revenue share payments on maintaining Google Search, \nChrome, Google Assistant, or the Gemini app on any device , browser , or Case 1:20-cv-03010-APM     Document 1436     Filed 09/02/25     Page 7 of 230 \n4 search access point for more than one year ; or (4) prohibit s any partner from \nsimultaneously distributing an y other GSE, browser, or GenAI  product .   \n• Google will not be required to divest Chrome ; nor will the court include a \ncontingent divestiture of the Android operating system  in the final \njudgment .  Plaintiffs overreach ed in seeking forced divesture  of these key \nassets , which  Google did not use to effect any illegal restraints.   \n• Google will not be barred from making payments or offering other \nconsideration to distribution partners for preloading or placement of Google \nSearch, Chrome, or its GenAI products.  Cutting off payments from Google \nalmost certainly will impose substantial —in some cases, crippling —\ndownstream harm s to distribution partners, related markets , and consumers , \nwhich counsels against a broad payment ban.   \n• Google will have  to make available to Qualified Competitors certain search \nindex  and user -interaction data , though  not ads data , as such sharing will \ndeny Google the fruits of its exclusionary acts and promote competition .  \nThe court , however, has narrowed the datasets Google will be required  to \nshare  to tailor the remedy to its anticompetitive conduct . \n• Google shall offer Qualified Competitors search and search text ads \nsyndication services to enable those firms to deliver high -quality search \nresults and ads to compete with Google while they develop their own search \ntechnologies and capacity.  Such syndication, however, shall occur largely \non ordinary commercial terms that are consistent with Google’s current \nsyndication services.   Case 1:20-cv-03010-APM     Document 1436     Filed 09/02/25     Page 8 of 230 \n5 • Google will not have to present users with  choice screens on its products or \nencourage its Android distribution partners to do the same .  Precedent \nrequires court s to avoid remedies that compel  product design requirements , \nand in any event, choice screens have not been shown to enhance \ncompetition among GSEs.    \n• Google will not be required to share granular, query -level data with \nadvertisers or provide them with more access to such data.   Nor will it have \nto restore an “exact match” keyword b idding option .  Plaintiffs did not \nestablish  that these remedies would promote competition  in the search text \nads market.   \n• Google will be compelled to publicly disclose material changes it makes to \nits ad auctions  to promote greater transparency in search text ads pricing  \nand to prevent Google from increasing prices by secret ly fine-tuning its \nad auctions .    \n• Google will not have to underwrite a nationwide public education \ncampaign.  That remedy does not fit Google’s violation s and its terms are \ntoo indefinite.   \n• Google will not have to modify its policies to offer website publishers more \nchoice in how Google uses their content.  This remedy bears no relation ship \nto Google’s unlawful acts and is an improper demand to implement overly \nregulatory requirements.  \n• Google will not be subject to an investment  reporting requirement .  It, too, \nbears no relationship to Google’s anticompetitive conduct .   Case 1:20-cv-03010-APM     Document 1436     Filed 09/02/25     Page 9 of 230 \n6 • Google will not be subject to anti -retaliation , anti-circumvention , or self -\npreferencing  provisions .  The first two restrictions  are too vague and do not comport \nwith the requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(d).   There is no legal \nor factual basis for the last.   \nThe court will establish a Technical Committee to assist Plaintiffs and the court in implementing \nand enforcing the final judgment.  The term of that judgment will be six years , and it will become \neffective 60 days after entry, except for those provisions relating to the  Technical Committee, \nwhich will go into effect immediately.    \nThis opinion is organized as follows :  The court beg ins by recounting the liability - and \nremedial -phase histories of this case.  In that same section the court sets forth the parties’ \ncompeting remedies proposals.  The court then makes  its Findings of Fact.  Those factual findings \nwere  drafted with the primary objective of updating the reader on market developments since the \nclose of the liability phase  and therefore are less detailed  than those in the liability opinion .  The \ncourt then turns to explaining its Conclusions of Law.  That section sets forth  the general antitrust \nprincip les that will guide the court’s evaluation of remedies and addresses  various remedies -related \ndisputes of law .  Next are Remedy -Specific Conclusions of Law.  That section will detail  the \ncourt’s rationale for adopting, rejecting, or modifying the parties’ proposed remedies .  The court \nmakes extensive findings of fact in that section  as well .  Finally, the court concludes with a \ndirective to the parties to meet and confer and present by September 10, 2025,  a joint revised final \njudgment that is consistent with this Memorandum Opinion.  As with the liability opinion, the \ncourt includes as an Appendix a list of the names and titles of all witness es whose remedies -phase \ntrial or deposition testimony is cited in this decision.  Case 1:20-cv-03010-APM     Document 1436     Filed 09/02/25     Page 10 of 230 \n7 The court is grateful to all counsel for their professionalism and zealous advocacy during \nthese remedies -phase proceedings.         \nPROCEDURAL HISTORY  \nI. PRETRIAL LIABILITY PHASE  \nThis case began on October 20, 2020, when the U.S. Department of Justice and 11 states \n(“U.S. Plaintiffs”) filed an antitrust complaint against Google pursuant to authority conferred by \nSection 4 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. § 4.  See Compl., ECF No. 1; see also  Am. Compl., \nECF No. 94 [hereinafter Am. Compl.]  (including 14 states) .  U.S. Plaintiffs  asserted three \nviolations of Section  2 of that law , each corresponding to an alleged product market  in the \nUnited  States .  Am. Compl. ¶¶ 173 –193.  Those markets were general search services, search \nadvertising, and general search text advert ising.  Id. ¶¶ 88–107.  The crux of U.S. Plaintiffs’ \ncomplaint was that Google illegally maintained a monopoly in these markets by entering into \nexclusive agreements to secure default distribution for its GSE  on nearly all desktop and mobile \ndevices in the United States.  See id.  ¶¶ 111–165.  U.S. Plaintiffs sought a finding of liability, an \ninjunction against the challenged conduct, and structural relief necessary to cure any resulting \nanticompetitive effects.  Id. ¶ 194.  \nRoughly two months later, 38 additional states and territories  (“Plaintiff States”) , filed \nState of Colorado v. Google , 20-cv-3715 (APM) [hereinafter Colorado v. Google Docket ], under \nSection  16 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. § 26.  Compl., Colorado v. Google  Docket, ECF No.  3 \n[hereinafter Colorado Compl.] , ¶¶ 21 –23.  Their complaint largely mirrored U.S. Plaintiffs’  but \nsupplemented it in three primary ways .  Plaintiff States : (1) alleged an additional  advertiser -side \nmarket for general search advertising but did not adopt U.S. Plaintiffs’ broader market for search \nadvertising , id. ¶¶ 56 n.3, 82 –89; (2)  asserted exclusionary conduct by Google that targeted Case 1:20-cv-03010-APM     Document 1436     Filed 09/02/25     Page 11 of 230 \n8 specialized vertical providers , which are internet companies that provide search services focused \non niche markets  such as  travel  (e.g., Expedia or TripAdvisor) , restaurant reservations  \n(e.g., OpenTable),  or shopping  (e.g., Amazon or eBay) , id. ¶¶ 168 –199; and (3)  claimed that \nGoogle had engaged in additional exclusionary conduct by using its proprietary advertising tool, \nSA360, to harm competition in the relevant markets , id. ¶¶ 144 –167.  Plaintiff States likewise \nsought declaratory and injunctive relief.  Id. ¶ 233.   \nThe court consolidated the two cases for both pretrial and trial proceedings .  Order, \nColorado v. Google  Docket, ECF No. 67 ; Status Conf. Tr., ECF No. 609, at 10 –14.  At the parties ’ \nrequest,  the court bifurcate d the proceedings into liability and remedies phase s.  See Order, \nECF No. 264.   \nFollowing a lengthy period of merits discovery, the court granted in part and denied  in part \nGoogle’s motions for summary judgment in both cases.  See generally  United States v. Google \nLLC, 687 F. Supp. 3d 48 (D.D.C. 2023).  In United States v. Google , the court entered judgment \nin Google’s favor  with respect to those portions of U.S. Plaintiffs’ claims that related to Android  \nCompatibility Commitments and Anti -Fragmentation Agreements, Google’s voice -activated \nassistant and other “Internet -of-Things” devices, and the Android Open -Source Project.  Id. at 85 –\n87.  In Colorado v. Google , the court found in Google’s favor with respect to Plaintiff States’ \ntheory that Google’s exclusionary acts directed at specialized vertical providers —namely, placing  \nrestrictions on the visibility of their content on Google’s search engine results page (“SERP ”) and \ncoercing them to share data —had not caused anticompetitive effects in the proposed markets.  Id. \nat 78 –83.  The remaining claims proceeded to trial.   Case 1:20-cv-03010-APM     Document 1436     Filed 09/02/25     Page 12 of 230 \n9 II. LIABILITY DETERMINATION  \nThe liability trial  commenced on September 12, 2023, and concluded on November 16, \n2023.  After receiving testimony  from dozens of witnesses ; reviewing thousands of pages of \nexhibits and deposition designations ; considering the parties’ post -trial briefs , proposed findings \nof fact , and proposed conclusions of law ; and hearing from the parties at closing arguments over \ntwo days, the court issued its liability findings  on August 5, 2024 .  The  court  held that Google had \nviolated Section  2 of the Sherman Act by maintaining a monopoly in certain product markets \nthrough exclusionary conduct.  See generally United Sta tes v. Google LLC , 747 F. Supp. 3d 1 \n(D.D.C. 2024)  [hereinafter Google ].   \nThe court identified three relevant product markets: general search services , search \nadvertising, and general search text advertising.1  Id. at 109–16, 125–33, 136–38.  The court did \nnot find a separate general search advertising market, as alleged by Plaintiff States.  Id. at 139 –42.  \nThe court determined that Google had monopoly power in the general search services and general \nsearch text advertising markets but not the search advertising market.  Id. at 117–24, 133–36, 138 –\n39.   \nHaving found that Google had monopoly power in two relevant product markets, the \ncourt’s Section  2 inquiry proceeded to analyze whether Google engaged in exclusionary conduct \nin those markets.  See id.  at 142 –52.  Plaintiffs challenged certain contracts between Google and \nother companies as unlawful exclusive agreements.  The court held that (1) agreements between \nGoogle and browser developers, such as Apple  and Mozilla, were  exclusive insofar as they \nestablish ed Google  as the out -of-the-box default search engine ; (2) mobile application distribution \nagreements (“MADA s”) between Google and Android original equipment manufacturers \n \n1 The parties agreed that the United States is the relevant geographic market.  See Google, 747 F. Supp. 3d at 107.  Case 1:20-cv-03010-APM     Document 1436     Filed 09/02/25     Page 13 of 230 \n10 (“OEMs”) were exclusive in practice ; and (3) revenue share agreements (“RSAs”) between Google \nand Android device distributors —both OEMs and wireless carriers —formalized the practical \nexclusivity of the MADA s.  Id. at 146 –52.   \nBecause merely characterizing  Google’s challenged contracts as “exclusive” did not \nanswer whether those agreements  violate d Section  2, the court next evaluated whether they caused  \nanticompetitive effects in the relevant markets —they did.  See id. at 152 –81.  First, the court  held \nthat the agreements caused significant anticompetitive effects in the general search services \nmarket.  Id. at 152 –71.  The court  found that Google’s distribution agreements (1)  foreclosed a \nsubstantial portion of the general search services market and impaired  rivals’ opportunities to \ncompete, id. at 153–59; (2) denied rivals access to the volume of user queries  and the resulting \ndata, or “scale ,” needed to compete  effectively , id. at 159 –64; and (3)  reduced other companies’ \nincentive to inves t and innovate in search , id. at 165 –71.   \nThe court rejected Google’s procompetitive justifications for the distribution agreements .  \nIt concluded that the  contracts  did not “(1) enhance the user experience, quality, and output in the \nmarket for general [search ] services, (2) incentivize competition in related markets that redounds \nto the benefit of the search market, [or] (3) produce consumer benefits within the related markets.”  \nId. at 171; see also id.  at 171 –77.  Accordingly, the court held  that Google violated Section  2 of \nthe Sherman Act by maintaining its monopoly in the general search services market through \nexclusive distribution agreements.  Id. at 177.   \nAs for the general search text advertising market, the court reached similar conclusion s.  \nIt found that the exclusive agreements (1) foreclosed a substantial share of the market ; (2) allowed \nGoogle to increase text ad s prices without any meaningful competitive constraint ; (3) permitted \nGoogle to degrade the quality of its text ad s offerings ; and (4) capped rivals’ advertising revenue, Case 1:20-cv-03010-APM     Document 1436     Filed 09/02/25     Page 14 of 230 \n11 thereby decreasing their ability to reinvest in quality improvements and attract more users  and ad \ndollars .  Id. at 177 –82.  Google did not  offer any procompetitive justifications beyond those the \ncourt had already rejected in the general search services market .  Id. at 181.  The court therefore \nheld that Google ’s exclusive agreements also violated Section  2 of the Sherman Act in the general \nsearch text ad s market.  Id.  \nThat left Plaintiff  State s’ additional claim concerning Google’s use of its search engine \nmanagement tool, SA360.  SA360 allows advertisers to run online marketing campaigns across \nmultiple platforms  all in one place .  Id. at 181.  According to Plaintiff States, Google  promised \nthat it would not self -preference its own proprietary ad platform, Google Ads, on SA360 , but it did \njust that when it implemented certain features for Google Ads but not for Microsoft ’s ad platform , \nMicrosoft Ads .  Id.  This lack of feature parity, Plaintiff  States  asserted,  placed Microsoft at a \ncompetitive disadvantage in the relevant markets.  See id.    \nThe court found  in favor of Google.  It  concluded that , under Supreme Court precedent,  \nGoogle had no duty to deal with its rival Microsoft , and in any event, Plaintiff States had failed to \ndemonstrate the SA360 conduct resulted in any anticompetitive harm in the relevant markets .  Id. \nat 181 –85.   \nLastly, the court declined to make a finding of anticompetitive intent, as it is not an element \nof a Section  2 violation, and it did not sanction Google for its failure to preserve certain evidence.  \nId. at 186 –88.   \nIII. REMEDIAL PHASE  \nA. Remedial -Phase Filings and Pretrial Proceedings  \n The remedial phase  began September 18, 2024 , with entry of a scheduling order that set \naside  approximately six months for discovery to be followed by a three -week evidentiary hearing .  Case 1:20-cv-03010-APM     Document 1436     Filed 09/02/25     Page 15 of 230 \n12 See Order, ECF No. 1043.  At the outset,  the court ordered Plaintiffs to submit a high -level \nframework of potential remedies, see id. , which they did on October 8, 2024 , see Notice of Pls.’ \nProposed Remedy Framework, ECF  No. 1052.  Thereafter, Plaintiffs filed their initial proposed \nfinal judgment on November 20, 2024 .  See Notice of Pls.’ Proposed Final J., ECF No. 1062.  \nGoogle submitted its initial proposed final judgment on December 20, 2024.  See Notice of Def.’s  \nProposed Final J., ECF No. 1108.  Both parties then submitted revised proposed final  judgments \nin anticipation of the remedies trial.  See Pls.’ Revised Proposed Final J., ECF No. 1184 -1 \n[hereinafter Pls.’ RPFJ ]; Def. Google LLC’s  Proposed Final J., ECF No. 1185 [hereinafter \nGoogle’s RPFJ ].  Discovery concluded on April 9, 2025.  See Order, ECF No. 1043.   \nThe evidentiary hearing ran from  April 22, 2025, to May 9, 2025.  Each side  presented \nhundreds of exhibits, see, e.g. , ECF Nos. 1220, 1228, 1233, 1234, 1238, 1268, 1283, 1339, 1340, \nand the court heard from nearly 50 witnesses via live testimony and deposition \ndesignation s, see List of Anticipated Live Witnesses , ECF  No. 1210 -1; List of Anticipated \nWitnesses by  Dep. Des ignation , ECF No. 1210 -2. \nFollowing the evidentiary presentation, the parties made extensive post -hearing \nsubmissions , including proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law and replies in support .  \nSee Def.’s  Proposed Findings of Fact, ECF No. 1346  [hereinafter Google’s PFOF];  \nDef.’s Proposed Conclusions of Law, ECF No. 1347 [hereinafter Google’s Br.] ; Pls.’ Remedies \nPost-Trial Br., ECF  No. 1348  [hereinafter Pls.’ Br.]; Pls.’ Remedies Proposed Findings of Fact, \nECF No. 1349  [hereinafter Pls.’ PFOF ]; Pls.’ Remedies Responsive Proposed Findings of Fact, \nECF No. 1364  [hereinafter Pls.’ RPFOF ]; Pls.’ Remedies Responsive Post -Trial Br., \nECF No. 1365  [hereinafter Pls.’ Reply ]; Def.’s  Responsive Proposed Findings of Fact, Case 1:20-cv-03010-APM     Document 1436     Filed 09/02/25     Page 16 of 230 \n13 ECF No. 1366  [hereinafter Google’s RPFOF ]; Def.’s  Responsive Proposed Conclusions of Law, \nECF No. 1367  [hereinafter Google’s Reply ].   \nThe court heard closing arguments on May 30, 2025.  See Order, ECF No. 1362.  \nB. The Parties’ Remedies Proposals  \nNot surprisingly, the parties’ proposed remedies are dramatically different.  The wide gulf \nseparating  them reflects a fundamental disagreement over the scope of appropriate antitrust \nremedies and the court’s authority to impose them.   \nPlaintiffs have offered what they say is a “comprehensive and unitary framework” of \nremedies that will “reinforce each other to restore competition.”  Remedies Hr’g  Tr. at 13:20 -24 \n(Opening Arg.) [hereinafter Rem. Tr.].  Their proposed final judgment covers the full spectrum of \nequitable remedies available under the case law.   \nMost significantly, Plaintiffs demand structural relief .  They seek an immediate forced \ndivesture of Google’s web browser Chrome.  Pls.’ RPFJ § V.A .  They also ask the court to include \na contingent divestiture of Google’s operating system, Android, in the event the initial remedies \nfail or Google  circumvent s them.  Id. § V.C .   \nPlaintiffs’ next class of proposed remedies, broadly speaking, are behavioral remedies.  \nThese are remedies that would compel Google to undertake affirmative acts or bar it from certain \nconduct beyond restrictions on contracting.  The proposed remedies in this category are many.  \nThey include (in order of their appearance in Plaintiffs’ RPFJ):  \n1. prohibit ing Google from making any search -related payments to \ndistribution partners , with one limited exception, id. § IV.A –G;  \n2. requiring Google to provide advance notice of certain acquisitions and \ninvestments, id. § IV.H –I;  Case 1:20-cv-03010-APM     Document 1436     Filed 09/02/25     Page 17 of 230 \n222 directors, officers, managers, agents, and employees.”  Pls.’ RPFJ § III.L.  It is hard to conceive \nof anyone at Alphabet or any Alphabet -related entity excluded from this definition.   \nThe definition’s breadth poses problems for implementing parts of the final judgment  \nproposed by Plaintiffs .  For  example, Google’s appointed compliance officer “must supervise the \nreview of Google activities to ensure they comply with this Final Judgment.”  Id. at § X.B. 3.  \nSurely, Plaintiffs do not intend for the compliance officer’s duties to reach such Alphabet \nsubsidiaries like YouTube, Nest, or Waymo.  Additionally, Plaintiffs would have “all officers and \nemployees of Google” receive a copy of the final judgment, trai ned annually on the final judgment \nand antitrust laws, and certify that they have read the  final judgment.  Id. § X.B.4.a, c, d , f.  \nAlphabet reportedly now has over 185,000 employees.   See Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) , STOCK \nANALYSIS , https://perma.cc/2B6A -AEB6  (last visited Sept. 1 , 2025).  Plaintiffs cannot reasonably \nbelieve that such wide -ranging notice and compliance measures are appropriate.   \nThe court takes no position on this issue.  It will leave it to the parties in the first instance \nto constrain the definition  of “Google” and to reach —hopefully, mutually agreeable —\nimplementation provisions.  \nB. Fees and Costs  \nThe court  will not include  in the final judgment Section XIV of Plaintiffs’ RPFJ , which \nawards  fees and costs  to Plaintiffs .  A request for such an award will have to be made by separate \nmotion.    \nCONCLUSION  \n For the reasons discussed, the court accepts , with its modification s, Google’s proposed \nremedies  in full  and adopts Plaintiffs’ proposed remedies in part.  The parties shall meet and confer \nand, by September 10, 2025, submit a revised final judgment that is consistent with this Case 1:20-cv-03010-APM     Document 1436     Filed 09/02/25     Page 226 of 230 \n223 \nMemorandum Opinion.  That revised final judgment shall reconcile Section III of Google’s RPFJ \nand those portions of Plaintiffs’ RPFJ, as modified, that the court has agreed to adopt .  Any request \nfor clarification or any dispute that may arise should be set forth in a Joint Status Report filed on \nthat same date, which identifies the issue and sets out the parties’ respective positions.   \n \nDated:  September 2, 2025      ___________________________  \n            Amit P.

    "summary": "1. **Summary:** This case involves a shareholder dispute following a squeeze-out merger. Plaintiffs, minority shareholders in an AI firm called Torch, allege that Defendants, majority shareholders, illegally undervalued their stakes to force them out, breaching fiduciary duties and the company's operating agreements. The court addresses a discovery dispute related to the timeframe for producing post-merger documents, ultimately deciding to allow post-merger discovery with some limitations.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue:** Whether the scope of discovery should include documents and information dated after the merger, which Plaintiffs argue are relevant to their claims of breach of fiduciary duty and fraud.\n\n3. **Court's Holding:** The court granted in part and denied in part Plaintiffs’ motion to compel discovery. It allowed for post-merger documents to support claims of breach of duty and fraud but limited the scope by rejecting additional custodial searches or ongoing updates past a specific date due to proportionality concerns.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation:** In this court case, two small owners of a big AI company felt they were unfairly squeezed out during a merger by the bigger owners who didn't pay them enough for their shares. They wanted the court to make the other side share documents for the time after the merger to prove their point. The court agreed to let them see some documents from after the merger but didn't make the other side look through all past and future emails and messages since that would be too much work.",

Plaintiffs Andes Capital Financing \nLLC (“Andes”) and Coevolution LLC (“Coevolution”) (collectively, “Plainti ffs”) move to compel \nDefendants to fully respond to certain interrogatories and requests for production (“RFP”) to \ninclude certain post-merger documents and information.  ECF No. 58.  Defendants Crossed Keys \nLLC (“Crossed Keys”), Brian Weaver (“Weaver”), J ae Cha (“Cha”) and Torch Research LLC \n(“Torch ”) (collectively, “Defendants”) oppose the motion on the grounds  that the requested \ndiscovery is not relevant or proportional to the needs to the case .   \nFor the reasons explained below,  Plaintiffs’ motion to compel is granted in part and denied \nin part.  \nI. BACKGROUND  \n According to the complaint,  Torch “is a leading global artificial intelligence (AI) firm that \nuses machine learning to enable massively scaled, ultra -high performance data processing.”  ECF \nNo. 1 at 3, ¶ 11.  Defendant Crossed Keys is the 90 percent majority shareholder of Torch, with Case 6:21-cv-01270-KHV-RES   Document 61   Filed 06/17/22   Page 1 of 192 \n Plaintiffs Andes and Coevolution owning the remaining 10 percent.  Id. at 1, ¶ 3.  Defendant \nWeaver is a manager, board member, and CEO of Tor ch, and he is also the owner and manager of \nDefendant Crossed Keys.  Id. at 1-2, ¶ 4.   Plaintiffs contend that in 2017, Weaver needed capital \nto keep the business alive an d reached out to Plaintiffs to secure the funds  to start the entity that is \nnow Torch .  Id. at 3, ¶ 12.   Plaintiffs agreed to provide the capital, and , in exchange, the parties \nentered into the Operating Agreement of Torch Research LLC (the “Operating Agreement”) , \nestablishing certain rights and duties among the parties .  Id. at 3-4, ¶ 13.   \n According to the complaint, Weaver began searching for prospec tive purchasers of Torch \nwithout Plaintiffs’ knowledge or consent, which included Torch engaging Deloitte Touche \nTohmatsu Limited  to produce a report that ultimately valued Torch at over $130 million.  Id. at 4, \n¶¶ 17 -18.  Highly summarized, Plaintiffs con tend that both before and after receiving the valuation, \nDefendants attempted to purchase Plaintiffs’ shares or otherwise oust Plaintiffs at a fraction of the \ntrue value of their 10 percent ownership interest in Torch  while also keeping Plaintiffs from \nreviewing Torch’s books and records .  Id. at 4-7, ¶¶ 19-28.   \nIn September 2020, Defendants sent notice of a meeting regarding approval of a proposed \nmerger of Torch with and into Crossed Keys, which would result in the cancelation of Plaintiffs ’ \nmembership interests in Torch.  Id. at 7, ¶ ¶ 29-30.  Plaintiffs contend that both the meeting and \nproposed merger violated the Operating Agreement  and they did not attend the meeting.   Id. at 9-\n10, ¶¶ 35 -40.  Weaver presided over the meeting approving the  merger, and Defendants  filed the \nmerger documents with the Delaware Secretary of State th at same day —October 9, 2020 .  Id. at \n10, ¶ 39.   According to Plaintiffs, Defendants unilaterally concluded that their shares were worth \nonly $1,354,248, contrary to the prior valuation.  Id. at 10 -11, ¶ 40.    Case 6:21-cv-01270-KHV-RES   Document 61   Filed 06/17/22   Page 2 of 193 \n Plaintiffs assert that Defendants breached various provisions of the Operating Agreement , \nbreached  and conspired to breach  fiduciary duties,  were unjustly enriched  and defrauded Plaintiffs \nout of the true value of their investment in Torch via what they contend was an improper squeeze -\nout merger.   On May 25, 2022, the District Judge granted in par t and denied in part Defendants’ \nmotion to dismiss.  See Andes Cap. Fin. LLC v. Crossed Keys LLC , No. CV 21 -1270 -KHV, 2022 \nWL 1658861 (D. Kan. May 25, 2022).  The Court summarized the remaining claims in the case as \nfollows:  \nThe following claims remain in the case: (1) that Torch , Weaver and \nCrossed Keys breached Section 4.11 of the operating agreement \nbecause they made a capital expenditure over $50,000 without \nputting the decision to a vote of all members, (2) that Torch , Weaver \nand Crossed Keys breached Section 5.4 of the operating agreement \nbecause they transferred plaintiffs ’ share interests without the \nconsent of all members, (3) that Crossed Keys, Weaver and Cha \nbreached their fiduciary duties by depriving plaintiffs of the fair \nvalue of thei r ownership interest when Torch  merged with Crossed \nKeys, (4) that Crossed Keys, Weaver and Cha conspired to breach \ntheir fiduciary duties to plaintiffs by acting in concert to conceal \ninformation and deprive plaintiffs of the fair value of their \nownership  interests in Torch , (5) that Torch , Weaver and Cha were \nunjustly enriched by squeezing out plaintiffs and acquiring their \nmembership interests in Torch  at a grossly undervalued amount and \n(6) that defendants fraudulently induced them into investing in \nTorch while knowing that defendants would later oust them from \nthe company.  \nId. at *11 .  Plaintiffs ask the Court to rescind the merger, or alternatively, to award Plaintiffs \ncompensatory and punitive damages.  ECF No. 1 at 13, ¶¶ 51 -52; id. at 20, ¶  88.   \nThe present dispute centers around the appropriate temporal scope for Plaintiffs’ \nInterrogatories Nos. 2, 3, 7 and 9 and for Plaintiffs’ Request for Production (“RFP”) Nos. 3, 4, 5, \n8, 9, 10 and 11,  served on Defendants on March 3, 2022 .  The Interrogatories ask Defendants to \nidentify : persons involved in soliciting funds for Torch  or any predecessor entity owned by Weaver  \n(Interrogatory No. 2) ; persons or entities involved in business strategy and planning for Torch or Case 6:21-cv-01270-KHV-RES   Document 61   Filed 06/17/22   Page 3 of 194 \n in preparing business forecasts and valuation -related information  for Torch  (Interrogatory No. 3) ; \npersons or entities with which  Defendants communicated regarding  a potential sale or investment \nin Torch  (Interrogatory No. 7); and entities that received information about Torch’s potential value, \ntechnology,  business plans  or a potential investment in Torch  (Interrogatory No. 9) .  See generally \nECF No. 58-1.  The RFPs seek  documents reflecting the solicitation of funds in Torch  or its \npredecessors  (RFP No. 3) ; communications reflecting business planning, foreca sts, and valuations  \nrelated to Torch or its predecess ors (RFP No. 4) ; actual business forecasts, valuations and business \nplans  (RFP  No. 5); communications about the planning and execution of the merger  (RFP No. 8) ; \ncommunications about the sale of or investment in Torch  (RFP No. 9) ; communications about the \ndrafting of merger documents  or related to the cancelation of Plaintiffs’ ownership interests (RFP  \nNo. 10); and communications showing Torch’s potential value  (RFP No. 11) .  See generally ECF \nNo. 58 -2.  The RFPs and the Interrogatories all sought responsive information and documents “to \ndate.”  ECF Nos. 58 -1, 58 -2.  \nDefendants responded to the discovery requests on April 1, 2022 .  Defendants agreed to \nprovide information and/or produce documents from  January 1, 2017, through October 9, 2020, \nfrom the approximate time of Plaintiffs ’ investment in Torch through only the date of the merger.  \nECF No. 59 at 3.  Defendants relied largely on relevance and proportionality objections, with the \nexception of RFP Nos. 8 and 10 .  See generally ECF Nos. 58 -1 & 58 -2.  As to RFP Nos. 8 and 10 , \nDefendants objected to the extent the RPFs “call[] for information protected by the attorney -client \nprivilege, the work product doctrine, or any other applicable  privilege or protection.”  ECF No. \n58-2 at 5, 6.  Defendants did not assert  an undue burden objection as to any of the discovery \nrequests.  See generally ECF Nos. 58 -1 & 58 -2.  Case 6:21-cv-01270-KHV-RES   Document 61   Filed 06/17/22   Page 4 of 195 \n The parties met and conferred regarding Defendants’ responses .  After extendin g the D. \nKan. Rule 37.1(b) deadline for raising issues with the Court concerning Defendants’ responses to \nthese discovery requests, the parties emailed the Magistrate Judge’s chambers on  May 31, 2022, \nto state that they had  “worked through a number of concerns ” and “ there remains one issue \ncurrently unresolved and which the parties are now requesting a discovery conference.   \nSpecifically, the parties disagree over the relevant time period for discovery in this case. ”  Plaintiffs \ncontinue to seek discove ry through the present day and Defendants contend that the period should \nend on October 9, 2020, the day of the merger.   \nOn June 3, 2022, the Court held a discovery conference regarding this dispute  and directed \nthe parties to further meet and confer foll owing the preliminary feedback provided by the Court \nduring the conference call.  See ECF No. 56.  Because the parties represented that they had \nthoroughly conferred pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(a)(1)  and D. Kan. Rule 37.2, both before and \nfollowing the discovery conference and were well aware of each other’s respective positions, the \nCourt ordered simultaneous briefing to facilitate a prompt ruling.1  See generally id.   Those briefs \nare now before the Court.  \n \n1     Plaintiffs’ motion is timely under D. Kan. Rule 37.1(b).  Specifically, the Court granted  \nin part and denied in part  Plaintiffs’ unopposed  motion for an extension of time, extending the \nRule 37.1(b) deadline to May 31, 2022, for Plaintiffs t o raise issues with the Court concerning \nDefendants ’ April 1, 2022 discovery responses.  ECF No. 46.  Plaintiffs timely requested a \ndiscovery conference in compliance with the Court’s order , and the Court imposed a deadline for \nbriefing th is issue .  During the discovery conference and in their brief, Defendants note that \nPlaintiffs were aware since April 1, 2022 , that Defendants objected to a temporal scop e that \nincluded post -merger documents.  But in the discovery conference, Defendants c onceded that these \nissues were timely raised by Plaintiffs .   \nTo the extent that Defendants ’ footnote 1  again suggest s that Plaintiffs were dilatory, the \nCourt rejects this argument for the same reasons .

PLAINTIFFS’ THRESHOLD SHOWING OF RELEVANCE2  \n Plaintiffs easily meet their initial  minimal  burden to establish the relevance of the requested \ndiscovery.  In their brief, Plaintiffs explain that post-merger discovery is relevant for two reasons.  \nFirst , Plaintiffs contend that the discovery  is relevant to Defendants’ planning and execution of \nthe cash -out merger, and second , Plaintiffs contend that the discovery is relevant to Torch’s \nvaluation , which goes to Plaintiffs’ damages stemming from the merger .   \nAs to the first stated reason, Plaintiffs explain that they allege that Defendants were \npursuing  other companies to invest in Torch while planning to move forward with the cash -out \nmerger.  According to Plaintiffs, discovery has suggested that the investor Torch secured l ikely \nconditioned its investment on Plaintiffs’ removal from Torch.  Because of this, Plaintiffs argue \n \n2     The parties’ briefs largely address the Interrogator ies and RFPs collectively without \ndistinguishing among the  disputed discovery requests.  In the absence of specific discussion about \nindividual interrogatories and RFPs, this order  addresses the discovery request s in the same fashion \nwhile noting that not all arguments necessarily apply equally to all of the disputed discovery \nrequests and objections.  Case 6:21-cv-01270-KHV-RES   Document 61   Filed 06/17/22   Page 7 of 198 \n that post-merger communications are germane to Defendants’ intent .  At the discovery stage of the \ncase, the Court cannot say that this information would have no possible bearing on the claims, \nparticularly in light of the remaining claims, which include —among other things —that Defendants \nboth breached and “ conspired to breach their fiduciary duties . . .  by acting in concert to conceal \ninformation and dep rive plaintiffs of the fair value of their ownership interests in Torch”  and that \nDefendants fraudulently induced Plaintiffs into investing in Torch “while knowing that [they] \nwould later oust them from the company.”  Andes , 2022 WL 1658861 at *11 (summari zing \nremaining claims and legal theories  after ruling on Defendants’ motion to dismiss ).  Plaintiffs have \nestablished relevance for this stated reason.  \nThe Court also finds that Plaintiffs have established the relevance of the requested \ndiscovery as to Plaintiffs’ damages , which could include the value of rescissory damages  \ndetermined by comparing the value of Plaintiffs’ investment at the time of the mer ger with Torch’s \ntheoretical value at various points in time until judgment .  As Plaint iffs explain, post -merger \ndocuments could  help Plaintiffs establish Torch’s post -merger value and would therefore be \nrelevant for this purpose.   In sum, Plaintiffs have articulated why the requested discovery could \nreasonably bear on their claims and dam ages sufficient to make  a threshold showing of relevance.   \nSee Beaty , 2020 WL 1862563, at *3 (explaining that given the broad construction of relevance on \na motion to compel in that disallow discovery if “it is clear that the information sought can have \nno possible bearing on the claim or defense of a party”).   Because of this, the burden shifts to \nDefendants to support their objections.  See id. \nIV. DEFENDANTS’ OBJECTIONS  \nWhen ruling on objections to discovery requests, the Court “ considers only those \nobjections initially asserted in response to the discovery request and relied upon in response to the Case 6:21-cv-01270-KHV-RES   Document 61   Filed 06/17/22   Page 8 of 199 \n motio n [to compel].”   Steven Volkswagen, Inc. v. Zurich Am. Ins. Co. , No. 19 -1161 -JWB -ADM, \n2019 WL 6310186, at *3 (D. Kan. Nov. 25, 2019) (citing White v. Graceland Coll. Ctr. for Prof’l \nDev. & Lifelong Learning, Inc. , 586 F. Supp. 2d 1250, 1256 (D. Kan. 2008)).  The Court deems \nobjections waived if they  were not initially asserted in response to a discovery request unless the \nobjecting party shows good cause for the failure.  Id. (citing White , 586 F. Supp. 2d at 1256).   In \nthis case, the  Court understands Defendants’ brief as continuing to rely on relevance and \nproportionality objections.  Although Defendants raise arguments concerning undue burden  in \ntheir brief , the Court construes these as falling under the proportionality objection in sofar as \nDefendants did not assert a stand -alone undue burden objection when they initially responded to \nthe discovery requests.   See generally ECF Nos . 58-1 and 58 -2. \nAlthough not addressed by the parties, Defendants did not assert a relevance or \nproporti onality objection as to RFP Nos. RFP Nos. 8 and 10 , although they rely on these objections \nin their brief . 3  While the Court could properly find the objections waived  as to these RFP s, it is \n \n3     Defendants’ response to RFP No. 8 states:  \nDefendants object to this Request to the extent it calls for \ninformation protected by the attorney -client privilege, the work \nproduct doctrine, or any other applicable privilege or protection.   \nDefendants will conduct a reasonable search and will produce \nresponsive, non -privileged documents, to the extent any exist, \nreflecting communications with the person and entity identified in \nDefendants’ Response to Interrogatory No. 6 concerning the merger \nof Torch Research, LLC into Torch Merger, LLC.  \nECF No. 58-2 at 5.  Defendants’ response to RFP No. 10 states:  \n \nDefendants object to this Request to the extent it calls for \ninformation protected by the attorney -client privilege, the work \nproduct doctrine, or any other applicable privilege or protection. \nDefenda nts will conduct a reasonable search and will produce \nresponsive, non -privileged documents, to the extent any exist, Case 6:21-cv-01270-KHV-RES   Document 61   Filed 06/17/22   Page 9 of 1910 \n disinclined to so for two reasons.  First , Plaintiffs did not raise the issue of waiver  during either \nthe June 3, 2022  discovery conference  or in their brief , and Plaintiffs have represented they have \nthoroughly conferred with Defendants.  If that is accurate , the Court would expect Plaintiffs to  be \nwell apprised of the nature of Defendants’ objections and unsurprised by their position  now.  \nSecond , the  Court has an independent obligation to ensure that discovery is proportional , so \naddressing these specific  types of objectio ns is within the Court’s discretion, particularly where \nthe objections concerning the appropriate temporal scope apply equally to multiple discovery \nrequests  and were properly preserved as to the bulk of those requests.  See generally Fed. R. Civ. \nP. 26(b)(1 ) (defining the scope of discovery); see also Ad Astra , 2019 WL 4466903, at *3 (relying \non Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(2)(C)(iii) to conclude that the court has an independent obligation to sua \nsponte consider proportionality) .  But even considering the merits of these objections, the Court \nstill finds that they should be largely overruled with some limited exceptions.  \nA. Relevance Objection s  \nAs discussed above, because Plaintiffs have met their burden to make the threshold \nshowing of relevance required by the Federal Rules , Defendants bear the burden to support their \nrelevance objection.   Defendants concede that “some post -merger materials may be discoverable” \nin that the material could bear on Plaintiffs’ alleged damages  (although Defendants generally \ndisagree that rescissory  damages are an appropriate measure of damages in this case) .  ECF No. \n59 at 5.  Nevertheless, Defendants dispute that the remainder of the documents and information \nare relevant to either the issue of Plaintiffs’ damages or to the issue of Defendants’ intent in \n \nreflecting communications with the entity identified in Defendants’ \nResponse to Interrogatory No. 8 related to the drafting of the merger \ndocuments.  \nId. at 6.   Case 6:21-cv-01270-KHV-RES   Document 61   Filed 06/17/22   Page 10 of 1911 \n executing the cash -out merger.   For the reasons explained below, the Court disagrees and overrules \nthe relevance obj ection.  \nAs to relevance to damages, Defendants note that they offered to produce non -custodial \ndocuments such as stand -alone PDF, PowerPoint and Ex cel files sufficient to show Torch’s post -\nmerger value through the present.  They argue that any additional r esponsive information, such as \ncommunications about those financials, would not be relevant to a reliable valuation analysis in \nthat a damages expert would reasonably rely on the financials themselves, not hearsay statements \nabout the financials.4  But t he fact that some discovery may  ultimately  be more relevant or reliable \nto prove an issue —and therefore more likely to be relied upon by an expert —does not render the \nmaterial irrelevant.  This is particularly true given that Plaintiffs also contend that De fendants’ \ncommunication about Torch’s valuation could help establish Defendants’ intent, discussed further \nbelow.  In other words, the Court does not evaluate relevance in a vacuum.  The fact that responsive \ndocuments may arguably be more relevant for one stated purpose than another is not sufficient to \nsustain a relevance objection so long as the requested discovery is relevant for at least some \n \n4     Defendants cite cas e law from the Delaware Court of Chancery for its proposition that \npost-merger evidence may be relevant only to assess, in the context of valuation, the validity of \nmanagement projections pre -merger.  ECF No. 59 at 6 (citing In re PetSmart, Inc. , No. CV 10782 -\nVCS, 2017 WL 2303599, at *20 n.268 (Del. Ch. May 26, 2017); cf. Cinerama, Inc. v. Technicolor, \nInc., No. 7129, 1999 WL 135242, at *4 (Del. Ch. Feb. 25, 1999) (holding Delaware law “permit[s] \nconsideration of post -merger evidence that could have been discerned at the time of the merger, \nbut [does] not [] permit consideration of post -merger evidence that was not capable of being known \non the date of the merger”)).   Defendants ’ citation to the 268 th footnote in PetSmart , an appraisal \naction following a private merger , is not persuasive in that the court was simply explaining how  it \nconsidered the evidence when making a merits determination —not whether the evidence was \nrelevant under the Federal Rules  at the discovery phase.  The same is true of Technicolor , which \nruled on a motion to reconsider a prior order appointing an appraisal expert and opin ed on the \ncourt’s and the expert’s right to consider post -merger evidence —again, not whether such evidence  \nwas relevant and discoverable in a civil action in federal court  with the types of causes of action \nalleged in this lawsuit . Case 6:21-cv-01270-KHV-RES   Document 61   Filed 06/17/22   Page 11 of 1912 \n permissible purpose.  And in this case, Defendants’ communications concerning valuation would \npotentially be  more relevant to the issue of intent.  \nBut on this point, Defendants criticize Plaintiff s for their failure “to identify any factual \nsupport for the proposition that relevant p ost-merger communications exist” and characterize \nPlaintiffs’  requests as a mere “fishing expedition” without ever squarely addressing Plaintiffs’ \narguments concerning relevance as to Defendants’ intent.  ECF No. 59 at 5.  Although it is likely \nthat more communications would exist pre -merger, that does not establish that post -merger \ncommunications are either non -existent  or irrelevant.  It is not Plaintiffs ’ obligation to come \nforward with any quantum of proof that responsive documents actually exist where Defendants , \nwho have possession, custody, or control of any such responsive documents , do not assert that \nsuch documents do not exist .  Particularly in response to Plaintiffs’ Interrogatories, Defendants \ncould have stated that there is no additional responsive information from this disputed timeframe, \nbut they did not do so.    \nDefendants have not overcome Plaintiffs’ threshold showing of relevance .  As the Court \npreviously found , these types of communications could be  potentially  relevant to  the issue of \nDefendants’ intent, which reasonably bears on Plaintiffs’  claims that Defendants both breached \nand conspired to breach certain fiduciary  duties and fraudulently induced Plaintiff s to invest in \nTorch while knowing that they would later oust Plaintiffs from the company .  For these reasons, \nthe Court overrules Defendants’ relevance objection s. \nB. Proportionality Objection s \n When evaluating whether the requested discovery is proportional, the Court evaluates six \ngeneral factors: “the importance of the issues at stake in the action, the amount in controversy, the \nparties’ relative access to relevant information, the parties ’ resources, the importance of the Case 6:21-cv-01270-KHV-RES   Document 61   Filed 06/17/22   Page 12 of 1913 \n discovery in resolving the issues, and whether the burden or expense of the proposed discovery \noutweighs its likely benefit. ”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(1).   The party asserting a proportionality \nobjection still bears the burden to support the objection.  Lawson v. Spirit AeroSystems, Inc. , No. \n18-1100 -EFM -ADM, 2020 WL 1813395, at *5 -6 (D. Kan. Apr. 9, 2020) (citing Fed. R. Civ. P.  \n26(b)(1) advisory committee ’s note to the 2015 amendment (“Restoring the proportionality \ncalculation to Rule 26(b)(1) does not change the existing responsibilities of the court and the \nparties . . .  .”)).   \nPractically speaking, the Court’s responsibility is to analyze the information provided by \nthe parties to make a case -by-case determination as to the appropriate scope of discovery.  Id. \n(explaining , for example, the  objecting party likely has better information regarding the burden or \nexpense of the proposed discovery, whereas the discovering party should be able to articula te how \nthe requested discovery could be important to resolving the issues in the case ).  No one factor \noutweighs any other f actor, and the Court need not address every factor in the absence of \narguments from the parties.  Ad Astra Recovery Servs., Inc. v. Heath , No. 18 -1145 -JWB, 2019 WL \n2448569, at *4 (D. Kan. June 12, 2019) . \n In this case, the above six factors show that the bulk of the requested discovery —with the \nlimited exception s discussed below —is proportional.  First , the issues at stake in the case are \nimportant, but in the absence of more specific arguments from the parties, the Court declines to \nfind that they are any more or less important than issues at stake in other civil cases.  See generally \nid. (reaching the  same conclusion in a RICO case where the parties had not specifically addressed \nthis factor) ; see also CCA Recordings 2255 Litig. v. United States , No. 19 -CV-2491 -JAR, 2020 \nWL 4284222, at *2 (D. Kan. July 27, 2020) (noting that this factor primarily consi ders whether \nthe case involves significant public policy or personal rights or public values) .   Case 6:21-cv-01270-KHV-RES   Document 61   Filed 06/17/22   Page 13 of 1914 \n Second , the amount in controversy  weighs strongly in Plaintiffs’ favor.  As Plaintiffs note, \nthey had a 10 percent ownership in Torch and have alleged that Torch’s pre -merger value could \nhave been as high as $130 million  or more  and could potentially be higher now.   Plaintiffs allege \nthat their “damages likely exceed $20 million ,” ECF No. 58 at 3, a figure Defendants do not \ndirectly dispute.  \nThird  and Fourth , Defendants have sole access to the information at issue, and Plaintiffs \ndo not , and there is no indication that Defendants have limited resources to gather the requested \ninformation and documents.  As Plaintiffs note, Defendants have already readily produced the \nsame categories of pre -merger information.   \nFifth, the Court has already found that the discovery Plaintiffs seek appears relevant, and  \nit appears to have at least some importance in resolving the issues.   \n That leaves the sixth  factor —whether the burden or expense of the proposed discovery \noutweighs its likely benefit.   Defendants state that from the period of January 1, 2017, through \nOctober 9, 20 20, Defendants collected approximately 229,000 documents, reviewed \napproximately 13,000 documents, and produced 2,677 documents.  As discussed on the telephone \nconference, Defendants collected custodial documents from only two custodians.   \nNowhere in Defe ndants’ brief do they articulate any burden if required to respond to an \nexpanded timeframe for Plaintiffs’ interrogatories.  Most of the interrogatories require Defendants \nto identify people and companies who were involved in various aspects of soliciting  funds for \nTorch, valuating Torch or those  companies that received information about Torch’s potential \nvalue.  Much, if not all, of this information could be obtain ed by interviewing employees without \nthe need for full-scale  document review.  It was Defendants’ obligation to come forth with Case 6:21-cv-01270-KHV-RES   Document 61   Filed 06/17/22   Page 14 of 1915 \n information about the burden in responding to these Interrogatories and Defendants have not met \ntheir burden.  \nWith regard to Plain tiffs’ document requests, nowhere in Defendants’ brief do they \nestimate any expenses related to producing r esponsive documents, either for the documents \nproduced to date or for any additional productions if the timeframe were expanded.5  As part of \nthe me et and confer process, Defendants “ agreed in the spirit of compromise to search for and \nproduce non -custodial documents ( e.g., stand -alone PDF files, PowerPoint files, and Excel files) \nthat are sufficient to show the value of Torch after October 9, 2020 th rough the present, while \npreserving all objections as to relevance and admissibility.”  ECF No. 59 at 4.   Defendants do not \nexplain any costs or burden associated with producing responsive non -custodial documents such \nas stand -alone PDF, PowerPoint and Exc el files  from an expanded timeframe .   \n  Defendants additionally do not explain any costs associated with collecting documents \nfrom two custodians, reviewing those documents or producing any relevant and responsive \ndocuments.  While Defendants extrapolate that a n expanded timefram e would require “Defendants \nto roughly double their collection and review effort,” ECF No. 59 at 6, Defendants do not provide \nany factual support to justify their assumption that the core collection will be of similar size or that \nthe same search terms for this expanded timeframe would produce a similar number of documents \nto review.  Defendants could have, for example, sampled documents from either custodian to \njustify these estimates, but Defendants provided no such information to  the Court to support their \n \n5  In the telephone conference with the Court, Defendants asked if a separate declaration \nwas necessary to support any allegations of burden or expense.  Defendants were told that a \nseparate declaration was unnecessary,  and counsel should instead provide any supporting facts \nwithin their brief.   Again, none of this information was provided in their brief.      Case 6:21-cv-01270-KHV-RES   Document 61   Filed 06/17/22   Page 15 of 1916 \n argument that this expanded timeframe “imposes an undue burden that is disproportionate to the \nneeds of this case.”  ECF No. 59 at 6.  \nThe fact that Defendants would inevitably expend additional time and resources producing \ndocuments does not itself show that the burden of the proposed discovery outweighs its benefit.   \nNotably, 2,677 documents is not a particularly high number in light of the nature of the claims or \nrelative to Plaintiffs’ assertion that tens of millions of dollars are at stake.   On the whole, \nDefendants have not shown that post -merger discovery is disproportional, and the above factors \nweigh in favor of allowing post -merger discovery —with the limits discussed below .   \nC. Objections  Regarding Custodians , Search Terms and Continuous \nSupplementation of Custodian -Level Information  \n \nDefendants allege that after the telephone c onference  with the Court, Plaintiffs expressed \nan expectation that Defendants would add additional custodians and additional search terms  \nbeyond those used to produce responsive documents to date, which Defendants contend would \nnecessarily expand the time and money required to produce these documents.  ECF No. 59 at 6.  \nDefendants additionally raise concerns that requiring produ ction to date would necessitate multiple \nESI collections.  T he Court agrees that Defendants should not be required to engage in a more \nexpansive search to produce post -merger documents  or continuously  supplement their ESI \nproductions .   \nPlaintiffs’ belated  concerns with the custodians and search terms Defendants have utilized \nthroughout this entire litigation were not timely preserved for the reasons  the Court explained \nduring the discovery conference.6  The Court granted leave for Plaintiffs to file a mot ion to compel \n \n6     During the  June 3, 2022  discovery conference , the Court asked Defendants how many \ncustodians were searched .  Defendants responded that in addition to collections from general \nsources, two custodians were searched, which was apparently a surprise to Plaintiffs.  In other \nwords, Plaintiffs had not previously raised this issue and the parties had not previously met and Case 6:21-cv-01270-KHV-RES   Document 61   Filed 06/17/22   Page 16 of 1917 \n limited to the parties’ dispute regarding the appropriate temporal scope.   ECF No. 56.   To that end, \nthe Court will not require Defendants to expand either their custodians or search terms to search \nfor and produce post -merger documents.   To the extent Plaintiffs seek post-merger information \nthat would require Defendants to use additional search terms and additional custodians , the Court \nsustains Defendants’  objection on that basis .   \nDefendants  also argue that a cutoff is necessary for custodian -level information to spare \nDefendants the burden of continually updating their document production and to protect them from \ninterference with ongoing business relationships.   They cite to Orchestrate HR, Inc. v. Blue Cross \n& Blue Shield of Kansas, Inc. , No. 19 -CV-4007 -HLT -TJJ, 2021 WL 1635853, at *4 (D. Kan. Apr. \n27, 2021), in which the court  simply  noted that in an earlier ruling, it imposed a temporal scope \nending on the date the plaintiffs had filed an amended compl aint.  Orchestrate does not involve \nanalogous claims or parties, and so the discovery rulings in that case provide limited guidance as \nto the appropriate scope of discovery here .  Conversely, Plaintiffs point to Sheldon v. Vermonty , \nadopting a broader temp oral scope in a securities -fraud  case as to certain RFPs , noting that a \nlengthier  timeframe “may be relevant to show Defendants ’ creation of the fraudulent scheme and \ntheir ongoing participation in it” and that the documents could “support Plaintiff ’s claims that \n \nconferred about this issue in comp liance with D. Kan. Rule 37.2 despite being granted an extension \nof time to continue meet and confer discussions for months .   \nAs stated at the discovery conference, the Court would have expected the meet -and-confer \ndiscussions to include  addressing  custodians and search terms  at least  by the time a discovery \ndispute developed —if not from the outset of discovery .  See generally Initial Order, ECF No. 12, \nat 4 ( explaining that the parties should be prepared to discuss at their planning conference how \nelectronically information is stored and retrieved) .  The parties were on notice that after exhausting \ntheir meet -and-confer efforts, the assigned Magistrate Judge required that they request a discovery \nconference before filing any disputed discovery -related motion.  See ECF No. 46.  Plaintiffs \nrequested a discovery conference limited to the issue of the appropriate temporal scope, not \ncustodians or search terms, and that is the sole issue that the Court has allowed the parties to brief.  \nSee ECF No. 56. Case 6:21-cv-01270-KHV-RES   Document 61   Filed 06/17/22   Page 17 of 1918 \n Defendants knew that the representations they made to Plaintiff in connection with his purchase \nof the securities were false. ”  204 F.R.D. 679, 690 (D. Kan. 2001).    \nThe parties’ citations simply underscore the Court’s authority to issue appr opriate orders \nto ensure proportional discovery  given the contours of the claims and defenses in a particular case .  \nThey  do not suggest a bright -line rule the Court must follow in fashioning the appropriate temporal \nscope.   See generally Ad Astra , 2019 WL  4466903, at *3 (explaining the court’s ongoing  obligation \nto consider proportionality and hearing a renewed objection articulated in a more targeted and \nmeaningful fashion) .  Instead, cases like Orchestrate acknowledge that, based on the unique facts \nin that case, a plaintiff might be able to demonstrate “ that the time period should be extended until \nthe time of trial.”  No. 19 -4007 -HLT -TJJ, ECF No. 92 at 5.    \nHere, while the Court finds that inquiry into post-merger documents  generally may be  \nrelevant , the Court agree s that at some point, the burden of continuously updating production  of \ncustodial documents  outweighs the potential benefits to be gained by this discovery , particularly \nwhen the discovery seeks communications after the filing of a lawsuit .  As previously discussed, \nDefendants offered to produce non -custodial documents to show Torch’s post -merger valuation  \nbut argued that additional custodial documents were not relevant in  that they were unlikely to aid \nPlaintiffs in establishing Torch’s value.  While t he Court overruled th at objection generally, as \nmore time elapses since the date of the merger —and the filing of a lawsuit concerning the \nmerger —the less likely it is that additional searches would yield relevant information  regarding , \nfor example,  the issue of intent .  In other words,  relevance diminishes while Defendants continue \nto bear a burden of updat ing custodial -level production.   \nOn this point and on this record, the Court finds that the discovery would not be \nproportional  as to this limited category of documents .

    "summary": "1. Summary:\nThe court case involves a post-award bid protest by OBXtek, Inc. against the General Services Administration (GSA), concerning the award of certain scores under a contract proposal evaluation for a government-wide acquisition contract. OBXtek contested GSA's deduction of 1600 points from its self-score, arguing wrongful point deductions related to verification forms and interim reports, ultimately impacting its potential contract award. The court found the GSA's deductions reasonable and in accordance with the terms of the Request for Proposals (RFP), thus denying OBXtek's protest.\n\n2. Key Legal Issue:\nWhether the GSA acted arbitrarily or capriciously in the evaluation process by deducting points from OBXtek's self-score based on its adherence to the RFP's verification and scoring requirements.\n\n3. Court's Holding:\nThe court held that GSA's deduction of points from OBXtek's self-score was reasonable and consistent with the solicitation terms. The court determined that the agency did not arbitrarily fail to award points, and it did not conduct unequal discussions, therefore denying the bid protest filed by OBXtek.\n\n4. ELI5 explanation:\nImagine a school where students have to score their own homework using a special grading sheet the teacher gave them. If a student's score is too high and doesn't match the teacher's rules, the teacher takes away some points. OBXtek thought the teacher (GSA) unfairly took points off their homework score (proposal score). They said they followed the rules because they didn't see some extra instructions. However, the court (like the school principal) reviewed everything and decided that the teacher followed the rules correctly and that OBXtek misunderstood the instructions, so OBXtek didn't get back the points it lost.",

(“OBXtek”) filed this post-award bid \nprotest challenging the decision of the General Services Administration ( “GSA”  or “Agency” ) to \ndeduct 1600 points from OBXtek’s self- score in an award of contracts in connection with the \nAlliant 2 government-wide acquisition contract (“GWAC”) under Request for Proposals No. \n                                                           \n1 The parties were directed to submit any redactions; they agreed that no redactions were \nnecessary.  Case 1:17-cv-01849-EJD   Document 41   Filed 06/04/18   Page 1 of 132 \n QTA0016JCA003 (“The RFP” or “Solicitation”).2  The GWAC is a Multiple Award, Indefinite \nDelivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract to provide information technology (“IT”) services \nto a wide variety of federal agencies.  In its protest , OBXtek allege s that  (1) GSA wrongfully \ndeducted 1000 points from its self -score because it did not provide a verification form  under the \nProject Service Code Group relevant experience and  (2) GSA wrongfully deducted 600 points \nfrom its self -score because there was no requirement to submit an interim report for Leading \nEdge Technology  projects with less than one year of project performance.  But for GSA’s errors  \nin the evaluation, OBXtek contends it would have been selected for award.  After receiving the Administrative Record, OBXtek filed an Amended Complaint on February 2, 2018, adding its allegation that GSA conducted unequal discussions.  For these reasons, OBXtek argues that the award decision was arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law, and requests this Court to enter a permanent injunction.   \n A protective order was entered on December 6, 2017, and  on the same date, the Court \nadopted the litigation sch edule as provided by the parties.  On January 19, 2018, the \nAdministrative Record was timely filed pursuant to the schedule.  \n On January 31, 2018, Salient CRGT, Inc., filed a motion to intervene which was \nsubsequently granted on February 1, 2018.\n3 \n OBXtek  filed its motion for judgment on the administrative record on February 9, 2018, \nin compliance with the parties agreed to scheduling order (“Pl. Mot.”).  On March 5, 2018, defendant filed its response and cross-motion for judgment on the administrative record (“Def. \nResp.”) .  On March 16, 2018 and March 30, 2018, the parties timely filed their responses and \nreplies.    \n After careful consideration and f or the reasons set forth below the Court DENIES  \nOBXtek ’s motion for judgment on the a dministrative r ecord  and GRANTS  defendant’s cross \nmotion for judgment on the a dministrative record.  \n \nI.

AR at 1.  GSA made its first draft RFP public in March 2015, AR at 412, and had \nreceived more than 900 comments regarding draft RFPs by December 2015.  AR at 1891.   \nOn June 24, 2016, GSA issued the RFP.  AR at 1887.  The RFP provided for a 5- year \nbase period, one 5-year option period, and a total ceiling value of $50 billion for all task orders.  AR at 1386, 1334.  The RFP further provided that GSA would issue multiple awards to the top sixty highest -rated offerors on a best -value bases to “the highest technically rated offerors with a \nfair and reasonable price.”  AR at 1581 -82.  Offerors were to self-score their proposals in the \nfollowing categories:  relevant experience; past performance; systems, certifications, and clearance; and organizational risk assessment.  AR at 1517-80.  GSA would then verify the scoring during proposal evaluation.  AR at 1582.  Based on the offeror’s answers, the scoring worksheet auto- calculated its score out of a po ssible 83,100 points.  AR at 30306.  In the event of \na tied score, “all Offerors precisely tied at the 60\nth position [would] receive an award.”  AR at \n1582.  The awardees would then be permitted to bid on a series of fixed- price, cost \nreimbursement, time -and-materials, and labor -hour task orders to provide IT services to various \nfederal agencies.  AR at 1333.   \n Relevant to this protest are the evaluations under Project Service Code (“PSC”)  Group \nProjects, Leading Edge Technology (“LET”)  Relevant Experience Projects, and the Individual \nSubcontracting Plan (“subcontracting plan”).  \n \n1. PSC Group Relevant Experience  \n Offerors could possibly earn a total of 17,000 points for experience under traditional \ninformation technology projects, known as PSC Group Projects, RFP Section 5.2.2.  AR  at 2264.   \nIn order to score these points, offerors were required to submit verification documents under two methods, depending on the information available.  AR at 1543-44.   \n RFP section L.5.2.2.1.1 provided the two methods of verifying relevant experience: (1) a \nFederal Procurement Data System report  (“FPDS  Report ”), combined with the statement of \nwork, as verification, or (2) if an FPDS Report was either not available, incomplete, or inaccurate, an offeror could submit the J.P -2 form describing the project and signed by the \nproject’s contracting officer, corporate officer, or local official, a copy of the contract award document and any modifications, a copy of the contract statement of work, and, if applicable, documentation of the contract line items.  AR  at 1543-44.  Simply put, an FPDS R eport was \nrequired if possible; if it was not possible, then the J.P-2 form option with the contracting officer’s signature was an available option in order to gain the base points for PSC expe rience.   \n \nIn addition to the possible 17,000 PSC project points, an offeror could earn an additional \n500 points, per project, if an offeror could establish that the contract  was of a particular size  or \ncomplexity .  AR 1673-74.  This required that an offeror establis h that the contract was either a \nmultiple -agency award  or a cost -reimbursement -type contract  for each separate federal customer.  \nAR at 1548-49.  To verify the distinct sources of federal funding, RFP Sections L.5.2.2.2, \nL.5.2.2.3, and L.5.2.2.4 explicitly requ ired the submission of an FPDS R eport to award these \npoints, unlike the base points for the underlying PSC experience .  AR  at 154 7-48 (emphasis Case 1:17-cv-01849-EJD   Document 41   Filed 06/04/18   Page 3 of 134 \n added).  In other words, offerors had the option of the two methods of verifying relevant \nexperience to earn base points, but in order to gain additional points the FPDS R eport was \nrequired.  \n \nSpecific to this protest is RFP Section L.5.2.2.3, “PSC Group Relevant Experience – \nDemonstrating Ex perience with Multiple Federal Government Customers,” which provided in \npertinent part:  \n \nThis additional scoring is only available for relevant experience projects performed as a prime contractor to the Federal Government.   \n Federal Government Customer is determined by the Funding Agency ID identified within  the FPDS Report . . . \n Verification must also be provided by attaching the FPDS Report that indicates the claimed Funding Agency ID.  \n AR at 1548.   \nAdditionally, in a published answer and question session, a prospective bidder asked and \nthe contracting officer  responded to this provision, “[h]ow can we obtain credit from a unique \nfunding source that does not have an FPDS Report or a Funding Agency ID?  The Document Verification and Scoring Sheet only gives credit for unique Funding Agency IDs.”  AR  at 1932.  \nIn its published response the GSA responded, “[t]hat is correct. You must have an FPDS specifying the funding agency code.  No exceptions.”  AR at 1932.    \n2. LET Relevant Experience Projects  \n \nOfferors could also earn points for Leading Edge Technology experience.  AR at 2264.  \nUnder the potential ten types of LETs, each offeror could earn points for three occurrences (referred to as projects) for up to 600 points (100 points for the first occurrence, 200 for the second, and 300 for the third) under each of the ten  categories .\n4  AR  at 1675.  \n Section L.5.2.3, “ Leading Edge Technology Relevant Experience,” provided in pertinent \npart: \n \n4. Each Leading Edge Technology Relevant Experience Project must be \nOngoing or have been Comp leted  within 5 years from the date proposals are \ndue. (Completed is within 5 years from the proposal’s original submission date, 29 August 2016; and an Ongoing status can be at the proposal’s original \n                                                           \n4 The ten categories are: (1) artificial intelligence; (2) autonomic computing; (3) big data; \n(4) biometrics; (5) cloud computing; (6) cyber security; (7) health IT; (8) mobile IT; (9) the internet of things; and (10) virtual networking.  AR at 1559. \n Case 1:17-cv-01849-EJD   Document 41   Filed 06/04/18   Page 4 of 135 \n or the extended submission date ).  Each project must have at  least one year \nof performance unless one of the following situations exist: \n \na. The project has an Interim or a Final CPARS/PPIRS.5  \nb. The project has a completed Award Fee Determination.  \nc. The project had a base period of performance less than one year and  \nthat period of performance is Completed.  \n DEFINITION : For purposes of this section L.5.2.3, the words “Ongoing” is \ndefined as a Project that has not yet been “Completed” by the proposal’s original submission date (29 August 2016), or by the propo sal’s extended \nsubmission date ONLY if the Ongoing project has at least one full -year \nof performance. Otherwise, if less than one- year performance, one of the \nthree situations must exist, noted above in L.5.2.3, item #4 . . .  \n \nAR at 1554 (emphasis in the original).  \n \n3. Subcontracting Plans  \n \nThe RFP further required other than small business offerors to submit an Individual \nSubcontracting Plan.  AR  at 1518.  Section M.4.2 set forth the evaluation criteria for the \nsubcontracting plan .  In relevant part it provided: \n \nM.4.2 The Offeror’s Individual Subcontracting Plan (Plan) must be \ndetermined Acceptable  \nThe Plan is a material requirement of the proposal for an other than small business Offerors.  \nThe Offeror’s Plan must be determined Acceptable in order to be eligible for \naward. The Offeror's Plan will be evaluated on an ACCEPTABLE / UNACCEPTABLE basis and a Responsibility Determination factor [.]  \n \nAR at 1585 (emphasis in the original). \n \nB. Pre-Awa rd and GAO Protests  \n \nEight protests6 were filed before the Government Accountability Office (“GAO”) before \nthe deadline for proposals and two were filed with the Agency.  AR  at 2297-2772.  Out of the ten \nprotests, two protests challenged the RFP requirement that an offeror submit an FPDS Report in order to gain bonus points for work performed.  Four others challenged the price evaluation scheme.  All protests were denied.  AR  at 2760-61.   \n                                                           \n5 A Contractor Performance Assessment Report System (“CPARS”) report is a \nperformance report  created by government personnel for a contractor’s performance on a given \nproject.  https://www.cpars.gov.  The Past Performance Information Retrieval System (“PPIRS”) is the Federal repository for completed CPARS.  https://www.ppirs.gov. \n6 One protest was voluntarily withdrawn after GSA took corrective action.  AR at 2305. Case 1:17-cv-01849-EJD   Document 41   Filed 06/04/18   Page 5 of 136 \n C. Proposal Submission, Evaluation, and Award \n \nOBXtek timely filed its proposal in response to the RFP, along with 169 other offerors.  \nAR at 30306.  The Source Selection Evaluation Team ( “SSET ”) performed a technical \nevaluation of the 170 offers, selecting the top 61 rated proposed for price evaluation.  After th e \nproposals were submitted, GSA informed at least five offerors that their subcontracting plans \nwere unacceptable or contained deficiencies and requested  revis ions of the plans.  AR at 30410-\n56; 30501-25.  GSA did not identify a need to conduct clarifications to offerors with respect to PSC Groups and LET experiences.  AR  at 30324.  Ultimately, GSA awarded contracts to 61 \nofferors, with scores ranging from 83,100 to 73,600.  AR  at 30 306. \n \nD. OBXtek’s Notification and Debriefing  \n \nOn November 17, 2017, GSA notified OBXtek that it had not been selected for award.  \nAR at 30537.  GSA informed OBXtek that it deducted 1,900 points from its self-score of 74,400, \nresulting in a total evaluated score of 72,500.  AR at 30544-46.    \n GSA awarded OBXtek  17,000 points for PSC Group relevant experience, the maximum \namount available for this aspect of the evaluation.  OBXtek claimed 3,500 additional points in its self-score for experience with multiple federal government customers.  However, GSA deducted \na total of 1,000 points stating:    \n[i]n accordance with RFP Sec. L.5.2.2.3 PSC Group Relevant Experience - Demonstrating Experience with Multiple Federal Government Customers, the Federal Government Customer is determined by the Funding Agency ID identified within the FPDS Report.  In order to gain points in this area, the \nofferor is required to provide an FPDS report. Here, the Offeror failed to \nprovide a FPDS report in connection with these two PSCs.  \n \nAR at 30538 (emphasis added). \n \nFor its LET  experience, OBXtek claimed 3,600 points in its self- score.   Here, GSA \ndeducted 600 points from OBXtek’s self-score, explaining: \n \nThe SSET evaluated OBXtek Inc., proposal and determined that Leading Edge  Technology (LET) Relevant Experience Projects 3 -3 and 10- 3 were \ndisallowed due to  the fact that the projects did not have 1 year period of \nperformance and did not meet  any of the exceptions . . .  \n Accordingly, the evaluation team deducted 300 points for LET 3 -3 and 300 \npoints for LET 10 -3 for a total of 600 points.  \n \nAR at 30539 (emphasis added). \n \nII.  Jurisdiction  and Standard of Review \n Case 1:17-cv-01849-EJD   Document 41   Filed 06/04/18   Page 6 of 137 \n The Court has jurisdiction under the Tucker Act, 28 U.S.C. section 1491(b)(1).  The \nTucker Act, as amended by the Administrative Disputes Resolution Act of 1996, 28 U.S.C. \nsection 1491(b)(1), grants this Court exclusive jurisdiction to “render judgment on an action by an interested party objecting to a solicitation by a Federal Agency for  bids or proposals for a \nproposed contract or to a proposed award or the award of a contract or any al leged violation of \nstatute or regulation in connection with a procurement or proposed procurement.”  28 U.S.C. § 1491(b)(1).  Under the Tucker Act, an “interested party” includes an  actual or prospective offeror \nwhose direct economic interest would be affe cted by or which has  suffered a non -trivial \ncompetitive injury or prejudice as a result of the alleged error.  Sys.  Application & Tech., Inc. v. \nUnited States , 691 F.3d 1374, 1382 (Fed. Cir. 2012).   \n In a bid protest, the trial court “review[s] the agency’s decision pursuant to the standards \nset forth in section 706 of Title 5,” the Administrative Procedure Act (“ APA” ).  28 U.S.C. § \n1491(b)(4); see Banknote Corp. of Am., Inc. v. United States , 365 F.3d 1345, 1350 (Fed. Cir. \n2004).  Pursuant to the standards set forth in the APA, the trial court determines whether the agency’s actions were “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.”  5 U.S.C. § 706.  A procurement decision may be set aside “if either: (1) the procurement official’s decision lacked a rational basis; or (2) the procurement procedure \ninvolved a violation of regulation or procedure.”  Impresa Construzioni Geom. Domenico Garufi \nv. United States , 238 F.3d 1324, 1332 (Fed. Cir. 2001) (citations omitted).  Further, a protester \nmust demonstrate that there was a substantial chance it would have received the contract award, but for the alleged error in the procurement process.  Statistica Inc . v. Christopher , 102 F.3d \n1577, 1581 (Fed. Cir. 1996). \n \nIII. Discussion  \n \nOBXtek raises three separate bases  for this protest.  Specifically, OBXtek alleges that : (1) \nGSA wrongfully deducted 1000 points from its self-score under the PSC group, (2) GSA \nwrongfully deducted 600 points under the LET category, and (3) GSA engaged in unequal discussions.  The Court will take each in sequence.  \n \nA. Group Relevant Experience - Demonstrating Experience with Multiple Federal Government Customers Under RFP Section L.5.2.2.3 PSC: GSA ’s Bonu s Point Deduction was Reasonable.   \n \nOBXtek alleges that it is protesting the A gency’s evaluation as it wa s “unreasonable and \ninconsistent with the Solicitation.”  Pl. Mot. at 20.  OBXtek argues that the Agency unreasonably \ndeducted 1,000 multiple -agency bonus points because OBXtek “did not provide FPDS Reports \nfor two of its seven projects that it submitted to demonstrate its experience with multiple federal customers. ”  Id.; AR at 30538-39, AR 29880-81.  Because OBXtek  captured all 17,000 points \nunder PSC experience, it argues that it should have been awarded all of its claimed additional points – 3,500 – without the 1,000 point deduction for the two projects that did not contain an FPDS R eport.  Pl. Mot. at 21.  \n OBXte k relies on section L.5.2.2.1.1 of the RFP  which provided that an offeror had two \nchoices for project verification – a choic e of either (1) filing an FPDS R eport (L.5.2.2.1.1(1)),  or Case 1:17-cv-01849-EJD   Document 41   Filed 06/04/18   Page 7 of 138 \n if not available or accurate, by (2) submitting a contracting officer’s signature (L.5.2.2.1.1(2)).    \nOBXtek argues that by choosing the alternate method – L.5.2.2.1.1(2) – in lieu of an FPDS \nReport – L.5.2.2.1.1 – it should have been credited with the additional points.  In support of this \nargument , OBXtek compares the verif ication Section of L.5.2.2.3 with L.5.2.2.4.  Specifically, \nRFP s ection L.5.2.2.3 provided in relevant part:  \n \nThis additional scoring is only available for relevant experience projects \nperformed as a prime contractor to the Federal Government.  \n Federal Government Customer is determined by the Funding Agency ID \nidentified within the FPDS Report. . .  Verification must also be provided by attaching the FPDS Report that indicates the claimed Funding Agency ID.  \n AR at 1548.    In comparison, section L.5.2.2.4 states:  \nVerification must also must be provided by attaching the FPDS -NG Report \nthat indicates a cost -reimbursement contract type. The verification method \nmentioned in Section L.5.2.2.1.1(2) shall not apply to this Section L.5.2.2.4. \nAn attached FPDS- NG Report verifying the submitted cost -type project \nis required for earing points in this section.  \n \nAR at 1549 (emphasis in the original).  Therefore, b ecause section L.5.2.2.3 does not specifically \ninclude the language, “S ection L.5.2.2.1.1(2) shall not apply[,] ” OBXtek claims that  section  \nL.5.2.2.1.1(2) verification (not requiring an FPDS Report only a contracting officer’s signature) \nis available to capture the additional points under section L.5.2.2.3.    \n Here, unlike the base project points, which provided two options to capture points \nwithout an FPDS Report, AR at 1544-47, the R FP explicitly required an FPDS R eport to capture \nthe additional points.  See AR at 1548-49 (“Verification must also be provided b y attaching the \nFPDS report  . . . .”).  Furthermore, when asked during proposal preparation how an offeror could \nobtain credit from a unique funding source that does not have an FPDS Report of Funding Agency ID, the Agency replied unequivocally that an offeror must provide “an FPDS specifying \nthe funding agency code.  No exceptions.”  AR  at 1932.    \n Moreover, this RFP provision was subject to a pre-award protest at GAO, with the \nGAO finding that:  \n [T]he record supports the agency’s position that assigning points to firms that can provide a FPDS report is reasonably related to the agency’s needs . . .   Case 1:17-cv-01849-EJD   Document 41   Filed 06/04/18   Page 8 of 139 \n Given that the acquisitions that will take place  under the Alliant 2 GWAC \nare acquisitions that w ill be competed, awarded, and performed under the \nFAR, we find nothing objectionable with an RFP provision that provides an \nevaluation preference to contracts that were performed under the FAR.  \n \nAR at 25 76, 2580-81. \n Therefore, it  is clear that th e requirement for an FPDS R eport was made explicit on the \nface of the RFP.  It is further clear that when asked, the Agency was specific that an FPDS Report was required to gain the additional points.  And lastly, the GAO pre -award protest \ndetermined that assigning points to firms that could provide an FPDS R eport was reasonably \nrelated to the Agency’s needs.  Thus, when the Agency evaluated OBXtek’s PSC projects for the possibility of capturing additional points, t he Agency did exactly what it told the offerors it \nwould do: that in the absence of an FPDS Report, the Agency would decline to award the multiple bonus points.  Here, the two projects that were deducted did not have an FPDS Report, as required.  Therefore, the Agency’s evaluation  deducting 1000 points was reasonable and in \naccordance with the Solici tation.   \n \nB. Leading Edge Technology Relevant Experience Under RFP Section \nL.5.2.3: GSA’s Point Deduction was Reasonable. \n GSA deducted 600 points from OBXtek’s self- score because two of its LET project \nsubmissions (LETs 3 -3 and 10- 3) failed to meet the RFP’s requirement of at least one -year of \nperformance and did not otherwise qualify under the RFP’s stated exceptions to this rule.  Section L.5.2.3 Leading Edge Technology Relevant Experie nce provided, in pertinent part: \n \n4 . . . . Each project must have at least one year of performance unless \none of the following situations exist:  \n \na. The project has an Interim or a Final CPARS/PPIRS.  b. The project has a completed Award Fee Determination.  c. The project had a base period of performance less than one year and that period of performance is Completed.  \n \nAR at 1554. \n In its evaluation, GSA noted the dates of the two projects in question—for LET 3 -3, the \nperiod of performance is 01 February 2016 through 31 January 2021, and for LET 10-3, the period of performance is 01 April 2016 through 31 March 2021— both outside the “one year” rule.  GSA then found that these two projects did not meet any of the above exceptions.    \n OBXtek concedes that the two projects did not meet the above requirement for one ye ar \nof performance.  P l. Mot. at 24.  OBXtek also does not argue with t he requirement that the \nproject s have an “Interim or Final CPARS/PPIRS.”  Rather, OBXtek contends that Section \nL.5.2.3 did not require the submission of verification, that is,  of the Interim or Final \nCPARS/PPIRS.   In its own words:  “nothing in the Solicitation  reasonably notified offerors that Case 1:17-cv-01849-EJD   Document 41   Filed 06/04/18   Page 9 of 1310 \n submitting  CPARS/PPIRS was a requirement  in order for projects  to qualify for the exception .”  \nId. at 25.  Therefore, OBXtek contends that its conclusion that no documentation was needed \nwas reasonable and tha t the deductions were inconsistent with the terms of the RFP and/or the \nresult o f a latent ambiguity in the RFP.  Id . at 26; Pl. R eply at  15-18.   \n \n “A latent ambiguity is a hidden or concealed defect which is not apparent on the face of \nthe document, could not be discovered by reasonable and customary care, and is not so patent and glaring as to impose an affirmative duty on plaintiff to seek clarification.”  Analytical & Research Tech., Inc. v. United States , 39 Fed. Cl. 34, 46 (1997) .  On the other hand, “[a] patent \nambiguity is present when the contract contains facially inconsistent provisions that would place a reasonable contractor on notice and prompt the contractor to rectify the inconsistency by inquiring of the appropriate parties.”  Stratos Mobile Networks USA, LLC v. United States , 213 \nF.3d 1375, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2000) .   \n A plaintiff who “has the opportunity to object to the terms of a government solicitation \ncontaining a patent error and fails to do so prior to the close of the bidding process waives its ability to raise the same objection subsequently in a bid protest action in the Court of Federal Claims.”  Blue & Gold Fleet, L.P. v. United States , 492 F.3d 1308, 1313 (Fed. Cir. 2007).  A \nparty's failure to do so is a waiver of its ability to raise the same objection in a bid protest action in this Court.  Id.  at 1313.  “This doctrine was established to prevent contractors from taking \nadvantage of the government, protect other bidders by assuring that all bidders bid on the same specifications, and materially aid the administration of government contracts by requiring tha t \nambiguities be raised before the contract is bid, thus avoiding costly litigation after the fact.”  Id . \nat 1313- 14 (citing  Cmty. Heating & Plumbing Co. v. Kelso, 987 F.2d 1575, 1580 (Fed. Cir. \n1993)). \n In arguing that the Solicitation contained a latent ambiguity, OBXtek contends that no \naffirmative duty was imposed on it to seek clarification  and its interpretation allowed it to meet \nthe requirement s without submitting the reports.  Specifically, OBXtek contends that because \nother sections of the RFP contained explicit verification requirements, and as this section was  \nsilent with regard to verification requirements, OBXtek  was not required to submit any verifying \nreports or documents in order to capture the points.  Pl. Mot. at 37.  This Court, howeve r, \ninterprets the inconsistency entirely differently : because the RFP was explicit in other sections \nrequiring the submission of forms, i. e. J.P-3 Form, FPDS R eport, AR at 1523, 1594.  OBXtek \nwas placed on notice of the ambiguity in this section which should have prompted it to rectify the inconsistency prior to submitting its bid.  The inconsistency—ex plicit verification \nrequirements versus no expl icit verification requirement—consequently amounts to a patent \nambiguity.  As a patent ambiguity, the challenge was required pre -award .  Blue & Gold Fleet, \n492 F.3d 1318. \n Furthermore, regardless of the pa tent/latent ambiguity argument, OBXtek could not have \ncomplied with the requirement in any event, as an interim CPARS /PPIRS did not exist at the \ntime of proposal submission.\n7    \n                                                           \n7 OBXtek argues that even though its proposal did not contain any information which \nmight qualify those LETs under an exception, a CPAR/PPIRS exists and should have been Case 1:17-cv-01849-EJD   Document 41   Filed 06/04/18   Page 10 of 1311 \n  \nFinally,  although section L.5.2.3 did not expressly require submission of verification, it \ndid so by clear implication.  How could the Agency have verified that OBXtek’s  projects fit into \none of the exceptions without any documentation, unless it did the research itself —a burden that \nthe Agency was unlikely to assume?  Thus, it is only logical that verification was required and, \ntherefore, the deductions were consistent with the RFP .  The Agency’s deductions were therefore \nreasonable.    \n \nC. GSA Treated All Equally  \n “The acid test for deciding whether an agency has engaged in discussions is whether the \nagency has provided an opportunity for quotations or proposals to be revised or modified.”  Consol. Eng’g Servs., Inc. v. United States , 64 Fed. Cl. 617, 626 (2005) (citations omitted).  “If \nthe agency decides to award the contract after holding discussions, it must hold discussions with all responsible offerors within the competitive range.”  Id . (citations omitted).  \n \nIn this case, i t is uncontested that after th e proposals were submitted , GSA requested at \nleast five offerors to revise their subcontracting plans.  The GSA letter requesting additional \ninformation plainly stated that their “ plans were unacceptable. ”  AR at 30410-56; 30501-25.  \nThus, it is OBXtek’s contention that because the solicitation required that the subcontracting plan be rated acceptable for the offeror to be eligible for award , but for the discussions, many of the \nofferors would have been ineligible to receive the award.  Pl. R eply at 6; see also  AR at 1585 \n(“[t]he Of feror’s Plan must be determined Acceptable in order to be eligible for award.  The \nOfferor’s Plan will be evaluated on an ACCEPTABLE / UNACCEPTABLE basis and a Responsibility Determination factor [.]”) (emphasis in the original) .  Simply put, OBXtek  \nalleges that once GSA submitted comments to the various offerors on their subcontracting plans, \nand then permitted these offerors to incorporate those comments into revised subcontracting plans, discussions were triggered.  Once discussions were trigged, OBXtek claims that it should then have been permitted to revise and correct any deficiencies within its proposal.   \n In addition, OBXtek argues that the Agency can avoid its obligations under the Federal \nAcquisition Regulation (“ FAR ”) simply by labeling an  evaluation criterion as part of the \nresponsibility determination .  Pl. Reply at 11.  By doing so, OBXtek contends that an agency can \navoid its obligations under the FAR simply by labeling an evaluation criterion as part of the responsibility determination.  Id .  Moreover, OBXtek argues that  the “Defendant has not cited a \nsingle case in which this Court has held that a subcontracting pla n was part of a responsibility \ndetermination and, therefore, not subject to the regulations governing discussions.”  Pl. Reply  at \n                                                           \nlocated by GSA.  Pl. Reply 17-18.  Therefore, according to OBXtek, both projects qualify for points under exception (a).  However, the Court cannot find any evidence from OBXtek that these interim CPARS reports existed at the time of proposal submission.  See generally Pl. Mot. and Pl. Reply.  Instead, defendant responds that the reports, which the government evaluators located in the CPARS system during the course of this litigation, are dated some eight months after the proposal deadline had passed.  The relevant interim CPARS records indicate that they \nwere created in May and June of 2017, long after the solicitation closing date.  Def. Reply at 9 -\n10.\n Case 1:17-cv-01849-EJD   Document 41   Filed 06/04/18   Page 11 of 1312 \n 8.  This statement is untrue, see Def. Br. at 12, and as the cases hold that subcontracting plans are \nproperly part of a responsibility determination , the Court will begin here.      \n \nIn Consolidated Engineering, the plaintiff alleged that the agency failed to conduct equal \nand meaningful discussions when the agency requested that the apparently successful offeror \nrevise its subcontracting plan.  Consol. Eng’g Servs., 64 Fed. Cl. at 626.  Like OBXtek, the plaintiff in Consolidated Engineering argued that once the agency submitted comments to an \nofferor on its subcontracting plan  and  permitted that offeror to incorporate those comments into \na revised subcontracting plan, discussions were triggered and the plaintiff was entitled to revise \nits proposal and correct any deficiencies therein.  Id. at 627.  Th e Court did not agree.  Instead , \nquoting the FAR, the Court noted:   \nFAR § 19.702(a)(1) provides that a subcontracting plan shall be required \nfrom the “apparently successful offeror,” and states that said offeror shall be \nineligible for award “[i ]f the apparently successful offeror fails to negotiate a \nsubcontracting plan acceptable to the contracting officer within the time limit \nprescribed by the contracting officer.  FAR § 19.702(a)(1).  Furthermore, \nFAR § 19.705–4 sets forth the additional requirement that “[t]he contracting \nofficer must review the subcontracting plan. . . . and provides this instruction: In determining the acceptability of a proposed subcontracting plan, the contracting officer should take the following actions:  . . .(7) Obtain advice \nand recommendations from the SBA procurements center representative (if \nany) and the agency small business specialist.  FAR § 19.705–4(d).  \nId.  Therefore, relying on the FAR, the Court concluded that an agency’s actions in requesting a \nsubcontracting plan and negotiating with a bidder to ensure that the subcontracting plan was \nacceptable “was not only contemplated by the FAR, but required by it.”  Id .  The Court further \nheld that “subcontracting plan[s] relate[] to an offeror’s responsibility, eve n where the \nsolicitation requests the offeror submit the plan with its proposal.”  Id . at 627 (internal quotations \nomitted).     In Dyncorp Int'l LLC v. United States, 76 Fed. Cl. 528 (2007), th is Court also held that \nthat exchanges between an  agency and offerors regarding responsibility determinations, \nincluding the analysis of the subcontracting plan, do not constitute discussions under FAR 15.306(d).  Id. at 546-547.  In this instance, the Court held , “[t]his court has approvingly cited \nGAO cases stating this rule to support a holding that exchanges concerning an element of responsibility such as a subcontractor plan do not constitute discussions.”  Id. ( citing  Consol. \nEng'g Servs., 64 Fed. Cl. 627; Kahn Instruments, Inc., B–277973, 98–1 CPD ¶ 11, 1997 WL 811931 (Comp. Gen. Dec. 15, 1997); A.B. Dick Co., B–233142, 89–1 CPD ¶ 106).    \nApplying the same reasoning, the Court holds that the GSA’s communications regarding \nthe subcontracting plans do not amount to discussions because the communications  only \nconcerned responsibility .  Responsibility relates to the offeror’s capability or ability to perform a \ncontract.  Responsiveness, by contrast, relates directly to the contractor’s ability to provide the goods or services being procured.  Heli-Jet Corp. v. United States 2 Cl. Ct. 613, 620 (1983).  \nThus, communications based on a responsibility determination in accordance with the FAR,  does Case 1:17-cv-01849-EJD   Document 41   Filed 06/04/18   Page 12 of 1313 \n not open up discussions for other areas to include those related to responsiveness.  Accordingly, \nthe Agency acted pro perly when it did not allow OBXtek to revise its proposal with regard to the \nPSC and LET scores.   \n  \nD.  Denial of Permanent Injunctive  Relief  \n \nIn order to establish that it is entitled to permanent injunctive relief, the plaintiff must \nestablish actual success on the merits.  The foregoing analysis reveals that there is no basis upon which to grant OBXtek’s motion for judgment on the administrative record.  As such, OBXtek  \nhas failed to establish an entitlement to injunctive relief, i.e., it has failed to show actual success on the merits . \n \nE. Conclusion \n \nFor all the for egoing reasons, OBXtek ’s motion for judgment on the administrative \nrecord is DENIED and defendant’s cross motion for judgment on the administrative r ecord  is \nGRANTED.  The Clerk shall enter judgment accordingly.   \n \nIT IS SO ORDERED.  \n \n        s/Edward J. Damich  \n        EDWARD J.

    "summary": "1. Summary: The United States District Court for the District of Columbia denied Apple Inc.'s motion to intervene in the antitrust case against Google LLC. Apple sought to intervene to protect its contractual rights with Google in light of potential remedies proposed by the plaintiffs that could affect these agreements. The court found Apple's motion untimely, but allowed Apple to participate as amicus curiae and submit a post-hearing brief.\n\n2. Key Legal Issue: Whether Apple Inc.'s motion to intervene as a defendant in the remedial phase of the antitrust litigation against Google was timely under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 24.\n\n3. Court's Holding: The court held that Apple's motion was untimely due to the significant delay between the inception of the suit and Apple’s motion to intervene, and the lack of immediate action once Apple recognized a potential inadequacy of representation of its interests. However, Apple was permitted to participate as amicus curiae and submit a post-hearing brief.\n\n4. ELI5 Explanation: Imagine there's a big game between two teams, and Apple wants to join as a player right before the last minute of the game. The referee says it's too late because Apple should have joined earlier when they first saw that the game could impact their scorecard. But the referee allows Apple to sit on the side, watch closely, and share its thoughts after the game ends.",

Apple’s Mot. for Limited \nIntervention, ECF No. 1111 [hereinafter Apple’s Mem.].  Apple seeks intervention as of right or , \nalternatively,  permissive intervention to protect its “property interest in its existing contract with \nGoogle and in its ability to enter into future contracts with Google.”  Id. at 6.  The United States \nand Colorado Plaintiff States oppose d Apple’s motion; Google took no position on it.  Apple’s \nmotion ripened on January 15, 2025, and the court heard argument two days later.  See Tr. of \nJan. 17, 2025 Status Conf. Proc., ECF No. 1147 [hereinafter Jan. 17, 2025 Tr.], at 30–77. Case 1:20-cv-03010-APM     Document 1153     Filed 01/27/25     Page 1 of 192 Because Apple’s motion is untimely , the court must deny it .  The court, however, will \npermit Apple to participate as amicus curiae  and file post-hearing submission s to ensure \nconsideration of Apple’s views when  crafting the remedial decree. \nI. \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 24 governs intervention as of right and  permissive \nintervention, both of which require a timely motion .  See NAACP v. New York , 413 U.S. 345, 365 \n(1973) (“Whether intervention be claimed of right or as permissive, it is at once apparent, from \nthe initial words of both Rule 24(a) and Rule 24(b), that the application must be ‘timely.’  If it is untimely, intervention must be denied.”); United States v. Brit. Am. Tobacco Australia Servs., \nLtd., 437 F.3d 1235, 1238 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (describing timeliness as a “threshold” requirement under Rule 24). \nThe timeliness of a motion to intervene is committed to the “sound discretion” of the \ndistrict court and must be “judged in consideration of all the circumstances.”  NAACP, 413 U.S.  \nat 366; Roane v. Leonhart , 741 F.3d 147, 151 (D.C. Cir. 2014) (quoting Smoke v. Norton, 252 \nF.3d 468, 471 (D.C. Cir. 2001)).  When  making this determination , the D.C. Circuit has instructed \ncourts to “especially weigh []” four factors : (1) the “time elapsed since the inception of the suit”; \n(2) “the purpose for which intervention is sought”; (3) “the need for intervention as a means of preserving the applicant’s rights”; and (4) “the probability of prejudice to those already parties in the case.”  Smoke, 252 F.3d at 471 (quoting United States v. AT&T , 642 F.2d 1285, 1295 \n(D.C.  Cir. 1980) ).  As discussed below, a ll four factors weigh against finding that Apple timely \nsought to intervene in this case. Case 1:20-cv-03010-APM     Document 1153     Filed 01/27/25     Page 2 of 193 II. \nA. Time Elapsed  \nAt the threshold, the parties dispute the point from which timeliness is measured .  \nApple contends that the clock starts  ticking “when the ‘potential inadequacy of representation \n[comes] into existence.’”  Apple’s Mem. at 13 (alteration in original) (quoting Smoke , 252 F.3d \nat 471, and citing Amador Cnty. v. U.S. Dep’t of the Interior , 772 F.3d 901, 904 (D.C. Cir. 2014)).  \nApplying that standard here, Apple asserts that the relevant starting point is when Plaintiffs filed \ntheir Proposed Final Judgment (“PFJ”) on November 20, 2024.  Apple’s Mem. at 14. \nPlaintiffs frame the inquiry slightly differently.  In their view , “[t]imeliness is measured \nfrom when the prospective intervenor knew or should have known that any of its rights would be directly affected by the litigation.”  Roeder v. Islamic Republic of Iran, 333 F.3d 228, 233 (D.C. Cir. 2003) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted); Pls.’ Mem. in Opp’n to Apple’s Mot., ECF No. 1121 [hereinafter Pl s.’ Opp’n], at 6–7.  Under that standard, Plaintiffs argue, Apple’s \nmotion comes four years too late, because Apple was on notice from the outset of this case, in \nlate 202 0, that its contractual rights were implicated.  Pls.’ Opp’n at 6.  \nThe D.C. Circuit recently  articulated  a third variation.  Quoting Supreme Court precedent, \nit said that “‘[t]he most important circumstance relating to timeliness ’ is whether a party ‘sought \nto intervene as soon as it became clear’ that its ‘i nterests would no longer be protected by the \nparties in the case. ’”  Campaign Legal Ctr. v. FEC , 68 F.4th 607, 610 (D.C. Cir. 2023)  (quoting \nCameron v. EMW Women’s Surgical Ctr., P.S.C., 595 U.S. 267, 279–80 (2022)) ; see id.  at 610 \n(applying Smoke ’s “potential inadequacy” standard  to distinguish the instant action ). \nRegardless of how the timeliness inquiry is framed, the court finds that Apple unduly \ndelayed filing its motion.  Case 1:20-cv-03010-APM     Document 1153     Filed 01/27/25     Page 3 of 194 Rights Directly Affected.   Apple does not dispute that it knew or should have known since \nthis suit’s inception that its contractual rights would be directly affected.  See Reply  in Supp. of \nApple’s Mot., ECF No. 1135 [hereinafter Apple’s Reply], at 3 –7 (disputing only the proper \nstandard for measuring timeliness).  Nor could it.  As Apple itself acknowledges , exclusive search \ndistribution agreements, including Apple’s Information Services Agreement (“ISA”) with \nGoogle, are at the heart of this antitrust action , and have been since the beginning.    See Apple’s \nMem. at 7 (asserting a protectable property interest in “its contractual rights under the ISA and \nits right to enter future contracts with Google”); id. at 3 ( recognizing that “Plaintiffs alleged [in \ntheir complaints ] that Google engaged in anticompetitive conduct via exclusionary agreements to \n‘secure default status for its general search engine’”).   Furthermore, Plaintiffs’ complaints made \nclear the risks th is litigation posed for Apple.  Plaintiffs indicated that they might seek structural \nremedies and injunctive relief to put an end to Google’s anticompetitive conduct —relief that \nwould limit  Apple’s ability  to contract with Google  now and in the future.  See United States \nCompl., Case  No. 20- cv-3010, ECF No. 1, ¶ 194 (requesting that the court “[e]nter structural \nrelief” and “[e]njoin Google from continuing to engage in the anticompetitive practices described herein”); Colo. Pl. States Compl., Case No. 20- cv-3715, ECF No. 3, ¶ 233 (seeking “structural \ndivestitures” as well as  relief addressing harms from “agreements that limit the distribution to \nand/or use of potential or competitive general search engines by consumers”). \nUsing the inception of this suit in October 2020 as the relevant starting point, Apple waited \nover four years before moving to intervene.  Such an extensive delay weighs heavily against \ntimeliness.  \nPotential Inadequacy Developed.  Apple responds that its motion would have been denied \nhad it moved to intervene when this  case was first filed (and its interests were first implicated), Case 1:20-cv-03010-APM     Document 1153     Filed 01/27/25     Page 4 of 195 because at that point its interests were still adequately represented by Google.  Apple’s Reply at \n4–5.  According to Apple, the divergence in interests did not arise until the remedial stage, when \nPlaintiffs’ PFJ revealed that they might seek remedies that “go well beyond the ISA” and “exceed \nthe bounds of this Court’s liability decision” “ by requiring a major structural remedy—the \ndivestiture of Google Chrome —and specifically targeting Google’s contractual relationship with \nApple.”1  Apple’s Mem. at 1, 4.  More specifically, Apple argues that Plaintiffs’  PFJ—in \n“prohibit[ing] Apple and Google from agreeing to even standard- fare revenue share agreements \nthat Apple maintains with every other [ general search engine] provider  . . . for 10 years” and \n“threat[ening] to reshape Google’s business in other ways,” including “the spinoff of its Chrome browser”—may reduce Google’s incentive to “defend[] the right for Apple to receive commercial value for distributing third -party search to its users” and prompt Google to focus its efforts on  \nremedies  “that may more directly impact its own operations.”  Id. at 14.  In short, Google might \nstop paying Apple, and Google might not “offer a full -throated defense” of the ISA or Apple’s \nright to pursue future agreements  with  Google.  Id.  \nThe problem with Apple’s argument is that these potential inadequacies materialized  a \nfull six weeks  earlier, when Plaintiffs filed their Proposed Remedy Framework on October 8, \n2024.  Pls.’ Proposed Remedy Framework, ECF No. 1052.  In that document, Plaintiffs identified four broad categories of remedies , one of which —“search distribution and revenue sharing” —\nencompassed  “remedies that would, among other things, limit or prohibit default agreements, \npreinstallation agreements, and other revenue -sharing arrangements related to search and search -\nrelated products[.]”  Id.  at 4–6.  Plaintiffs  also stated  that they were considering “structural \nremedies that would prevent Google from using products such as Chrome, Play, and Android to \n \n1 The parties’ Revised Proposed Final Judgments, which will be the subject of the evidentiary hearing scheduled to \nbegin on April 22, 2025, are due by March 7, 2025.   Scheduling Order, ECF No. 1043, at 2.

Google itself  interpreted Plaintiffs’ framework that way.3  Thus, Plaintiffs’ \nProposed Remedy Framework laid bare the very cleavage that Apple claims  is the reason Google \ncan no longer adequately represent its interests  in this case .  Yet Apple waited 76 days —until \nDecember 23, 2024—to seek intervention. \nSeventy -six days is lengthy, even under Apple’s own cases  granting intervention.  \nSee Cameron v. EMW Women’s Surgical Ctr., P.S.C., 595 U.S. 267, 280 (2022) (motion filed \ntwo days after learning that the existing party would not continue to defend the challenged law); Dimond v.

Moten v. Bricklayers, Masons & Plasterers, Int ’l Union of Am., 543 F.2d 224, \n228 (D.C. Cir. 1976) .  Seventy- six days  comprises nearly half  (49%) of the remedies -phase fact \ndiscovery period, which commenced on September 26, 2024, and will end on February 28, 2025.   \nScheduling Order, ECF No. 1043 [hereinafter Scheduling Order] , at 1 –2.  And it amounts to \nnearly  one- third  (31%) of the remedies phase as a whole.  Id.  at 1 (setting September 26, 2024 \nstart date  for fact discovery ); Amended Scheduling Order, ECF No. 1145 [hereinafter Am. \nScheduling Order] , at 1  (setting May 30, 2025 end date for closing arguments ). \nFurthermore, this court has been clear from the first status conference following the \nliability decision , held on September  6, 2024, that the remedies  phase would need to proceed on \na compressed  schedule .  See Tr. of Sept. 6, 2024 Status Conf. Proc., ECF  No. 1040, at  6:14–7:3 \n(stating that the remedies decision  must be issued by early August  2025, to preserve the court’s Case 1:20-cv-03010-APM     Document 1153     Filed 01/27/25     Page 7 of 198 institutional knowledge about this case ); id. at 29:6 -18 (stating that closing arguments must be \nheld no later than  June 1, 2025, to give the court enough time to write its opinion ). \nThe court’s September 18, 2024 Scheduling Order  reflected that imperative.  The court \nallotted eight months for the entire remedies phase, from late September 2024 to late May 2025, \nbased on the parties’ representations, the court’s own schedule, and the public ’s interest  in prompt \nresolution of this matter .  That tight timetable necessarily left little breathing room between \ndeadlines (a fact the parties do not hesitate to mention when raising discovery disputes with the \ncourt).   And as the court’s order clearly indicated, those deadlines were unlikely to move.  \nSee Scheduling Order at 3 (stating that “[m] otions for extension of time are discouraged”). \nSince then, the court  has told parties and non- parties alike that “we, frankly, just don’t \nhave the luxury of [  ] time here” and has ordered them to produce documents on an expedited \nbasis .  Tr. of Dec. 13, 2024 Status Conf. Proc., ECF No. 1096, at 13:4-20; see also Tr. of Oct. 24, \n2024 Status Conf. Proc., ECF No. 1060, at 23:2-6 (considering the “fairly compressed time \nperiod” for discovery when resolving discovery disputes) .  The court  has also  informed  Plaintiffs \nthat, “if there ’s going to be a reevaluation of the remedies that are being  requested” by the new  \nadministration, “ it needs to be done quickly and promptly; the trial is not going to move for that \npurpose [.]”  Tr. of Nov. 26, 2024 Status Conf. Proc., ECF No. 1081 [hereinafter Nov. 26, 2024 \nTr.], at 76:21–77:3. \nDespite the court’s repeated indications that time is  of the essence, Apple did not act  \nexpeditiously.  As noted, it waited 76 days after Plaintiffs filed their remedies framework before seeking intervention on the eve of Christmas Eve.  And when it finally did move to intervene , it \ndid not seek expedited resolution of its motion.  Nor did it oppose Plaintiffs’ request for more \ntime to file their response  given “the multiple intervening federal holidays  between Apple ’s Case 1:20-cv-03010-APM     Document 1153     Filed 01/27/25     Page 8 of 199 motion and the deadline for Plaintiffs ’ response .”  Consent Mot. for Extension of Time, \nECF No. 1120, at 1 . \nTo sum up: Apple knew (or should have known) from the outset of this litigation, in late \n2020, that this suit would directly  affect its contractual rights .  Apple knew (or should have \nknown) since October 8, 2024, when Plaintiffs filed their Proposed Remedy Framework, that the \nremedies sought could be expansive in scope and, consequently, that Google may not be capable \nof adequately defending Apple’s interests  during the remedial  phase of this litigation .  And Apple \nknew (or should have known) that  waiting two -and-a- half months to intervene in a proceeding \nscheduled to last  just eight months altogether would constitute a significant delay.  The time \nelapsed therefore weighs against the timeliness  of Apple’s motion. \nB. Purpose of Intervention  \nApple states that its purpose in intervening is “to ensure that this Court has the complete \nrecord required to issue a fair and effective remedial decree.”  Apple’s Mem. at 2 ; accord Jan. 17, \n2025 Tr. at 50:11- 13 (Apple’s counsel affirming that Apple is “really intervening because we \nthink Apple  has information that is going to be of service to the Court  in reaching a proper \nremedy ”).  More specifically , Apple seeks intervention on a “ limited ” basis “to present only two \nor three witnesses, engage in limited cross -examination at the remedies proceeding to the extent \nother witnesses address remedies relating to Apple, and participate alongside Google in briefing \nand arguing issues before the Court insof ar as they impact Apple.”  Apple’s Mem. at 15.  Apple’s \nevidence and arguments would cover at least three topics: (1) Apple’s intentions regarding \ngeneral search ; (2) the proposed remedies’ effects on Apple ’s commercial relationship with \nGoogle and on Apple’s customers ; and (3) the rapidly evolving artificial intelligence landscape.  Case 1:20-cv-03010-APM     Document 1153     Filed 01/27/25     Page 9 of 1910 Id. at 18 –19 (leaving open the possibility that Apple would “respond to any additional points that \nmay arise during the trial of the remedies phase and directly impact Apple’s interests”).  \nDuring oral  argument, Apple elaborated on the scope of its intervention.  Regarding \ndiscovery, Apple stated that it “would not be issuing written discovery requests,” but “would seek \nto attend depositions going forward and potentially ask limited questions at the end of the  \ndepositions [.]”  Jan. 17, 2025 Tr. at 51:3- 8.  As  to witnesses, Apple clarified  that it intended to \ncall three in total, including an expert, which  would require adding “a couple of additional days ” \nto the evidentiary hearing.  Id.  at 51:9–52:5.  Finally , with respect to post -hearing submissions, \nApple expressed “definite[] interest[] in proposing a remedy,” in addition to filing  a post -hearing \nbrief  and participating in closing arguments  (as stated  in its motion).  Id. at 52:10-14; Apple’s \nMem. at 15.   Apple further represented  that it is “ not interested in weighing in on the entire \nbreadth of the  proposed final judgments” submitted by the parties , but did not  specify  which \nremedies  it believes would affect  Apple’s interests  and, therefore, which remedies it intends to \nweigh in on.  Jan. 17, 2025 Tr. at 52:14-19. \nAs a preliminary matter, the court doubts that the scope of Apple’s  intervention is truly as \ncircumscribed as it believes.   Apple insists that its “involvement in the proceedings” would be \nconfined “to the extent the remedy affects Apple,” Apple’s Reply at 2, but that hardly imposes a \nmeaningful limitation.   See United States v. Heinz , 790 F.3d 365, 367 (2d Cir. 2015)  (“The verb \n‘to affect’ expresses a broad and open -ended range of influences.”  (alteration and citation \nomitted)).   Is the court to defer to Apple’s own judgment as to which witnesses’  testimony or PFJ \nterms  “affect” Apple?  Or is the court to adjudicate that question each time Apple wishes to \nparticipate?  Case 1:20-cv-03010-APM     Document 1153     Filed 01/27/25     Page 10 of 1911 In any event, Apple, by its own telling, seeks  to present “evidence and argument .”  \nApple’s Mem. at 19; accord  id. at 1 (“Apple must be able to present facts and arguments  \nconcerning [Plaintiffs’] PFJ’s actual effects on competition[.] ”).  That is the very purpose the \nD.C. Circuit has suggested would render intervention untimely where, as here, the movant \n“permitted significant time to elapse”  before filing its motion .  United States v. AT&T , 642 F.2d \n1285, 1294–95 (D.C. Cir. 1980)  (stating  that “ intervention would be untimely” “[h]ad [the \nputative intervenor] sought to intervene for the purpose of presenting evidence or argument ,” \nrather than “for the limited purpose of taking an appeal”).  \nWhat’s more, Apple has not established that the information it wishes to present is any \ndifferent than that the court already considered —and largely credited —during the liability phase.  \nTo describe the content of its proposed “testimony, documents, and briefing,” Apple submit ted a \ndeclaration from Edd y Cue , Apple’s Senior Vice President of Services .  Apple’s Mem. at 18–19; \nDecl. of Eddy Cue, ECF No. 1111- 1, ¶ 1; see also Jan. 17, 2025 Tr. at 51:16 (Apple’s counsel \nconfirming that Apple intends to call Cue as a witness  if granted intervention) .  Cue was one of \ntwo Apple witnesses to testify at the liability trial ( over Apple’s vehement opposition) , and he is \ncurrently included on Google’s witness list for the remedies hearing.  Apple’s Mem. at 4; Jan. 17, \n2025 Tr. at 44:18 -19; see Apple’s Mot. to Quash Trial Subpoenas, ECF No. 643, at 3 (“ The parties \nshould not be permitted to require Apple’s executives or this Court to undergo the burden presented by live testimony in this case when their deposition testimony could be reviewed by the Court in camera .”). \nAs the court observed during oral argument, however, the statements in Cue’s declaration \n“tracked perfectly  with” Cue’s testimony at trial.   Jan. 17, 2025 Tr. at 53:16 -21.  Based in part on \nhis testimony, and the testimony of one other Apple witness, the court found that Apple has Case 1:20-cv-03010-APM     Document 1153     Filed 01/27/25     Page 11 of 1912 business reasons  beyond the loss of revenue share to stay out of the general search services \nmarket —the very fact Apple seeks to emphasize at the remedial stage.  Redacted Mem. Op., \nECF No. 1033 [hereinafter Mem. Op.],  at 104, 241–42; see Apple’s Mem. at 1 ( asserting that \n“Apple must be able to present facts and arguments concerning [Plaintiffs’]  PFJ’s actual effects \non competition,” including “evidence dispelling the PFJ’s erroneous assumption that, absent the \nISA, Apple will  enter the general search market ”); Apple’s Reply at 2 (arguing that intervention \nis warranted because “ only Apple can explain that it has no intention of entering the general \nsearch market, regardless of the injunction’s terms ”); Jan. 17, 2025 Tr. at 57:6- 12 (Apple’s \ncounsel stating that the court’s remedies decision “presumably will depend, in not insignificant \npart, on assumptions about Apple ’s own behavior with respect to  how the remedy would affect \nits incentives to enter the  search market or not into the future ,” and stressing that “[o] nly Appl e \nis in a  position to ensure that the record is complete on that ”). \nApple responds that the market has changed since the court made its liability \ndetermination.  Jan. 17, 2025 Tr. at 54:3- 17.  Maybe so.  But Apple offer s no reason why party \nstatus  is necessary  to present such evidence, especially when Google is likely to call Cue as a \nwitness .4 \nApple’s case authorities do not help its cause.   According to Apple, “[c]ourts  routinely \npermit limited intervention to allow affected parties to participate in remedial proceedings in similar circumstances.”  Apple’s Mem. at 6 , 15 (citing cases).  But none of the cases  Apple cites  \n \n4 Nor is the court convinced that Google lacks incentive to make Apple’s position known to the court.  G oogle’s \nProposed Final Judgment specifically authorizes revenue share agreements  with Apple (and other browser developers) \nin exchange for setting Google Search as the default general search engine, while permitting Apple to reevaluate such \nagreement s on an annual basis and even promote rival products  across devices and browser settings.  Google’s \nProposed Final Judgment, ECF No. 1108- 1, at 4 –5.  Apple nowhere explains why Google’s proposal does not align \nwith its stated interests.  See Jan. 17, 2025 Tr. at 60:7 -15.  ( Indeed , Google’s proposal would arguably put Apple in a \nbetter position than it is today. )  And when given the opportunity at oral argument to articulate how its proposed \nremedy would differ  from Google’s, Apple demurred.  See id. at 59 :12–60:25 . Case 1:20-cv-03010-APM     Document 1153     Filed 01/27/25     Page 12 of 1913 involved an antitrust enforcement action, and none involved a remedial phase featuring extensive \ndiscovery and a contested evidentiary hearing.  See Hodgson v. United Mine Workers of Am. , \n473 F.2d 118, 126, 129–30 (D.C. Cir. 1972)  (intervention granted to comment on proposed decree  \ndissolving unlawful trusteeships in labor case); Costle , 561 F.2d at 906–08, 906 n.7 (intervention \ngranted  to participate in implementation and oversight of EPA settlement agreement , where the \ncourt had earlier allowed eight intervenors ); Forest Conservation Council v. U.S. Forest Serv., \n66 F.3d 1489, 1491–93, 1496 (9th Cir. 1995)  (intervention granted, where timeliness was \nundisputed, to present evidence weighing against proposed injunction prohibiting timber sales \nand other forest management activities ), abrogated on other grounds by Wilderness Soc. v. U.S. \nForest Serv. , 630 F.3d 1173 (9th Cir. 2011) ; Humane Soc’y of the United States v. U.S. Dep’t of \nAgric. , No. 19- cv-2458 (BAH), 2023 WL 3433970, at *1–2, *8 (D.D.C. May 12, 2023)  \n(intervention granted to submit cross -motion and reply brief addressing whether federal animal \nwelfare rule should be revived) ; Ctr. for Food Safety , 2009 WL 4724033, at *1–3 (intervention \ngranted  in NEPA suit to address  whether injunction should issue and appropriate scope of \ninjunctive relief, where the court had already  permitted 13 intervenors and the remedies portion \nhad not yet begun). \nThe closest Apple comes is Benjamin ex rel. Yock v. Department of Pub lic Welfare of \nPennsylvania, an out -of-circuit case in which the court of appeals held  that appellants  should have \nbeen granted intervention as of right to fully participate in a fairness hearing on a  proposed class -\naction settlement agreement , instead of merely allowed  to submit objections and question the \nparties’ witnesses.  701 F.3d 938, 941–42, 946 (3d Cir. 2012) .  Apple , however, offers no \nexplanation as to how a fairness hearing in a class -action lawsuit is similar to a contested \nevidentiary hearing in an antitrust case, beyond the fact that both take place at the remedies  stage.   Case 1:20-cv-03010-APM     Document 1153     Filed 01/27/25     Page 13 of 1914 See Apple’s Mem. at 6.  Moreover, the circumstances  in Benjamin are clearly distinguishable .  \nNo party opposed intervention  on timeliness grounds.  Benjamin, 701 F.3d at 949 ( explaining that \ntimeliness was contested only as to class certification , not the settlement agreement).  \nMore  importantly , there was no finding of prejudice to the existing parties.  Id. at 951; see infra  \nPart II.D  (finding prejudice in this case).  \nFor the foregoing reasons, the purpose for which Apple seeks intervention weighs against \nthe timeliness of its motion. \nC. Need for Intervention  \nThe need for intervention to protect  Apple’s contractual rights likewise weighs against \ntimeliness, as the court will afford Apple an opportunity to be heard through post -hearing \nsubmissions. \nD. Prejudice to Existing Parties  \nThe D.C. Circuit has called  the probability of  prejudice “the most important  \nconsideration” in determining  timeliness.  Roane , 741 F.3d at 152.  That is because “the \nrequirement of timeliness is aimed primarily at preventing potential intervenors from unduly \ndisrupting litigation, to the unfair detriment of the existing parties.”  Id.  at 151. \nIn accordance with these principles , courts in this Circuit have consistently denied \nintervention where it would likely require additional discovery, necessitate further proceedings, \nor delay resolution of the case .  See, e.g., Amador Cnty. v. U.S. Dep’t  of the Interior , 772 F.3d \n901, 902, 906 (D.C. Cir. 2014)  (holding that the district court did not abuse its discretion in \nfinding that  “intervention would cause prejudicial delay” where the putative intervenor sought to \nintervene for the “ limited purpose ” of filing a Rule 19 motion because t he district court “would \nneed to accept briefing on the [ ] motion, hear argument, and rule on the motion”) ; Love v. Vilsack, Case 1:20-cv-03010-APM     Document 1153     Filed 01/27/25     Page 14 of 1915 304 F.R.D. 85, 91 (D.D.C. 2014)  (finding the motion untimely because the “ litigation [was]  quite \nadvanced ” and “[i] ntervention would require further proceedings to address new issues and \npotentially new factual development ”), aff’d , No. 14- 5185, 2014 WL 6725758 (D.C. Cir. Nov. 18, \n2014); Bethesda Health, Inc. v. Cohran, No. 18- cv-875 (BAH), 2021 WL 8323602, at *6 (D.D.C. \nFeb. 16, 2021)  (concluding that “JMH’s intervention would likely prejudice the existing parties ,” \n“[d]espite the purportedly limited remedial purpose for which intervention [was]  sought,” because \n“adding JMH as an intervenor -plaintiff at this stage would necessarily require additional \ndocumentation and review” and thereby result in delay); Ctr. for Biological Diversity v. \nRaimondo, No. 18- cv-112 (JEB), 2021 WL 2823102, at *4 (D.D.C. July 7, 2021)  (ruling that  \n“allowing intervention at this juncture would unduly interfere with the parties ’ right to a timely \nresolution of this matter ”); see also  Roane , 741 F.3d at  152 (granting intervention in part because \n“adding Paul as a party would have required no additional factual development” ). \nAll three types of prejudice are likely to occur here .  For starters, just because Apple has \nopted to forgo written  discovery does not mean the existing parties will.   Jan. 17, 2025 Tr. at 51:3-\n4.  Only one Apple witness (Cue) is included on the parties’  initial witness lists—meaning the \nparties  will need to request documents from and depose one additional (unidentified) fact witness .  \nId. at 32:2-5, 44:18- 19.  What’s more, the third witness is an (as-yet-unnamed) expert on “Apple’ s \neconomic interests ,” id. at 51:9-13, whose designation will generate discovery obligations and \ndemands.  Apple will be required to make disclosures under Rule 26(a)(2), which are likely to be substantial, i f the liability -phase expert reports are any guide.  The parties will then have to devote \nconsiderable time and resources to respond to Apple’s expert’s opinions.  At  minimum, Apple ’s \nexpert will have to be deposed, and the parties might also seek to cross -designate a rebuttal expert \nand demand additional discovery directly from Apple. Case 1:20-cv-03010-APM     Document 1153     Filed 01/27/25     Page 15 of 1916 Apple similarly fails to account for  the parties’ needs during the evidentiary hearing.  \nAt oral argument, Apple estimated that its involvement would add only “a couple of additional \ndays” to the schedule .  Jan. 17, 2025 Tr. at 52:5.  Apple based that estimate on seven hours for \ndirect examination of its own  witnesses plus four hours for cross -examination  of “certain” party \nwitnesses (though Apple noted that the extent of its cross -examination, like other aspects of its  \nparticipation, would depend on which witnesses “implicate d” its interests).  Id. at 51:20–52:4 .  \nApple ’s estimate , however,  does not include  the time it will take Plaintiffs and Google to cross -\nexamine Apple’s three witnesses.   The court has already set aside the maximum number of days \nit has available for the evidentiary hearing —14 days in total, leaving 7 days per side .5  Any \npresentation by Apple will necessarily encroach upon the parties’ time to present their own cases.   \nThus, while t he court appreciates Apple’s “commit[ment] to following this Court’s \nschedule for the remedial phase,” Apple’s Reply at 2, even “limited” intervention would come at \nthe parties’ expense.  By  this point  in the litigation —just one month before  the close of fact \ndiscovery and less than three months until the evidentiary hearing—the parties have structured \ntheir discovery, served their written requests, disclosed their initial witness lists, scheduled  their \nwitness depositions, and reviewed hundreds of thousands of documents.  See Scheduling Order.  \nAnd they have done it all within the strict confines of the court’s Scheduling Order —with still \nmore yet to come .  See Jan. 17, 2025 Tr. at 108:8-9, 108:24–109:8 (parties’ counsel stating that \nnumerous document productions are forthcoming and 15 Google witness depositions, plus \nmultiple  third -party witness depositions, are scheduled for February 2025); id. at 109:13-15 \n \n5 Initially , the court set aside nine days for the hearing .  Scheduling Order at 3 .  Midway through discovery and \nfollowing submission of the parties’ Proposed Final Judgments, Plaintiffs sought three additional days, while Google \nrequested  11 more .  Joint Status Report, ECF No. 1125, at 23– 26.  The court added five.  Am. Scheduling Order at 1.  \nEven that was challenging.  See Jan. 17, 2025 Tr. at 101:24 –102:13 (describing the court’s trial calendar ).  But that \nwas the most the court could offer without compromising its ability to meet the early August deadline for issuing a \nremedies decision that it had announced back in September.  Id. at 102:18 –104:1. Case 1:20-cv-03010-APM     Document 1153     Filed 01/27/25     Page 16 of 1917 (Google’s counsel stating that “trying to get this calendar to work has been like air traffic control \nat National Airport” —“[i]t is very, very difficult”) .  At this late stage , Apple’s request for \nintervention, if granted, would unfairly prejudice the parties  by adding to their already heavy \nburden.6 \nThe alternative, of course, would be to delay the evidentiary hearing, and with it, the \nresolution of this case.  But not even Apple defends  that option, and for obvious reason—it merely  \nswaps one form of prejudice for another.  See supra 14–15;  Apple’s Mem. at 2 (emphasizing that \n“granting intervention would not delay or otherwise disrupt the proceedings ”); Apple’s Reply at \n5 (stating that “Apple agrees with Plaintiffs that the ‘remedies phase must proceed expeditiously’” and recognizing that “delayed resolution of the merits” constitutes “unfair prejudice”  (alteration \nand citations omitted)).   In the context of this case, moreover, s uch prejudice would likely be \nconsiderable.   The court has organized its docket around the remedial proceeding , and it simply \ndoes not have the same flexibility now as it did last September, when it first set the schedule.   \nJan. 17, 2025 Tr. at 101:25–102:2.  Consequently, the delay from postponing the evidentiary \nhearing would be months, not weeks.  Given that this case has already been pending for over four \nyears, s uch a delay would be prejudicial to the parties  and contrary to the public’s keen interest \nin prompt resolution of this matter . \nFinally, the court cannot turn a blind eye to the potential consequences of granting Apple’s \nmotion .  If Apple is  entitled to intervene, “ there is no apparent reason why” other counterparties \nto Google’s search distribution agreements  “could be denied a similar opportunity.”  Deutsche \nBank National Trust Co. v. FDIC , 717 F.3d 189, 192 (D.C. Cir. 2013) ; see Pls.’ Opp’n at 8 ( “In \n \n6 Plaintiffs represented in both their opposition brief and at oral argument that , in the event  Apple is granted \nintervention,  they might  seek to amend their complaints under Rule 15 “to include Apple as a named defendant for \nliability purposes” and “request that Apple be bound by the Court’s final judgment.”  Pls.’ Opp’n at 16; accord Jan. 17, \n2025 Tr. at 33.   If that were to come to pass, this litigation would  experience even greater disruption and delay.  Case 1:20-cv-03010-APM     Document 1153     Filed 01/27/25     Page 17 of 1918 theory, any company that signed Mobile Application Distribution Agreements, Revenue Share \nAgreements, and other similar agreements [  ] could make the same arguments that Apple has \nmade here.”).  Such counterparties include some of the world’s largest companies, like Samsung and AT&T, to name  just two.  Mem. Op. at 101.  They also include browser developer s, like \nMozilla, whose Firefox browser depends on Google ’s revenue share payments for its very \nsurvival.  Id. at 116 (finding that Google’s 2021 revenue share payment to Mozilla amounted to \n“80% of Mozilla’s operating budget”).  Plaintiffs have already been contacted by two third parties who are currently contemplating  intervention.  Jan. 17, 2025 Tr. at 34:4-14. \nApple dismisses this concern as “misguided” in light of Apple’s position under Plaintiffs’  \nPFJ—namely , that Apple is the only entity (besides Google) “ specifically target[ed] by name” in \na provision “ of extraordinary breadth.”   Apple’s Reply at 6 (citing Pls.’ PFJ, ECF No. 1062-1 \n[hereinafter Pls.’ PFJ], § IV.B ).  But as Plaintiffs rightly point out, “Plaintiffs’ PFJ prohibits \nGoogle from paying any  third party . . . for making Google the default search engine on its \ndevices.”  Pls.’ Opp’n at 4 (emphasis added) (citing Pls.’ PFJ, § IV.A).  Thus, Apple’s contractual  \ninterests are not unique .  If this court were to open the door to intervention now, halfway through \nthe remedial phase, there is a strong possibility that this litigation would become even more \ncomplex and prolonged. \nThe court therefore finds that the existing parties would suffer substantial prejudice were \nApple to intervene at this late stage.  \nIII. \nBecause Apple’s Motion for Limited Intervention fails to satisfy Rule 24 ’s timeliness \nrequirement , the motion is hereby denied.

    "summary": "1. **Summary:** The case involves a bid protest by Percipient.ai, Inc. against the United States regarding the SAFFIRE project by the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA). Percipient alleged that the NGA failed to comply with statutory obligations under 10 U.S.C. § 3453 to consider commercial products, specifically its computer vision system, Mirage, for the SAFFIRE contract, which was awarded to CACI, Inc. The court held that it had jurisdiction to hear the case and denied the motions to dismiss filed by the United States and CACI, Inc.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue:** Whether the NGA violated 10 U.S.C. § 3453 by not adequately considering Percipient's commercial product, Mirage, in its procurement process for the SAFFIRE project.\n\n3. **Court's Holding:** The court held that it has jurisdiction over Percipient's claim against the NGA, as the allegations related to a statutory violation connected to a procurement. It determined that Percipient, as an offeror of a commercial product, has standing to challenge the procurement under §3453 and denied the motions to dismiss filed by the United States and CACI, Inc.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation:** Imagine you have a tool that could solve a big problem for a government agency, but they didn't consider using it because they decided to develop their own tool instead. You argue that by not giving your tool a fair chance, they broke a rule meant to encourage using already available solutions. The court agreed to hear your complaint because the agency might have ignored the rule by choosing to build something from scratch instead of considering what's already out there.",

Case 1:23-cv-00028-EGB   Document 44   Filed 04/07/23   Page 1 of 142 \n  \nOPINION     \nThis is a post- award bid protest of the  National Geospatial-\nIntelligence Agency’s alleged violation of 10 U.S.C. § 3453, a statute that \nrequires agencies to procure commercial or non-developmental products “to \nthe maximum extent practicable.”  Both the United States and the intervenor, \nCACI, Inc. – Federal, move to dismiss the protest for lack of subject-matter \njurisdiction.  \nThe matter is fully briefed, and oral argument was held on March 6, \n2023. We denied the motions to dismiss in an order issued on March 9, 2023. \nThis opinion more fully explains our reasoning.   \nBACKGROUND2 \nThe National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) obtains and \nanalyzes images and other geospatial information to provide the federal government with intelligence data. Supplying  this kind of intelligence on a \nglobal scale  is a burdensome analytical task  and cannot be done effectively \nwithout the help of advanced computer technology. One of those advanced \ntechnologies is computer vision, a form of artificial intelligence that “trains \nand uses computers to interpret the visual world.” Compl. ¶ 55. With \ncomputer vision, users can more efficiently compile and analyze geospatial \nintelligence.  \nHoping to benefit from  this technology, NGA, more than three years \nago, issued the SAFFIRE solicitation—which was an indefinite delivery, \nindefinite quantity contract containing two parts. The first was a data \nrepository that would store and disseminate geospatial intelligence “across \nvarious large organizations.” Compl. ¶  60. The second, which is at the heart \nof this dispute, woul d integrate a computer vision system to enhance the \n \n2 When a party moves  to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, the \ncourt assumes that the undisputed facts in the complaint are true and draws \nreasonable inferences in the plaintiff’s favor. Acevedo v. United States, 824 \nF.3d 1365, 1368 (Fed. Cir. 2016). These undis puted facts are drawn from the \ncomplaint, the attached materials, and the administrative record.  Case 1:23-cv-00028-EGB   Document 44   Filed 04/07/23   Page 2 of 143 \n agency’s ability to produce, review, and classify intelligence from “ millions” \nof images. Compl. ¶ 58.  \nThe plaintiff, Percipient, is a technology company that developed a \ncomputer vision software called “Mirage .” Mirage is an open architecture \nsoftware that works  alongside other computer systems  and can detect \nequipment, vehicles, and faces—each  of which is a critical aspect of \ngeospatial intelligence. More than that, though, Mirage’s tools also allow \nusers to narrow the computer’s focus to specific objects, patterns, or \ngeographical areas, and it can even learn to a nticipate its users’ needs over \ntime. Despite these features and capabilities, Percipient did not bid on the \nSAFFIRE contract because its  software could only fulfill SAFFIRE’s \ncomputer vision requirements, not the entire contract. For that reason, \nPercipient relied  on what it viewed as the agency’s statutory obligation to \nconsider incorporating commercial products and hoped to be part of NGA’s \nSAFFIRE efforts.  \nIn January 2021, NGA  awarded the SAFFIRE contract to CACI  and \ninformed Percipient that if it wanted to participate in SAFFIRE, it needed  to \nspeak with CACI. This eventually led to a meeting between Percipient and \nCACI in March 2021. At this meeting, CACI expressed significant interest \nin partnering with Percipient on future projects, but explained that,  as for \nworking together on SAFFIRE, “that ship” had already “sailed.” Compl. ¶ \n93. \nAlarmed by this revelation, Percipient asked  NGA if it would \nindependently evaluate Mirage as a possible commercial solution for \nSAFFIRE’s computer vision system. NGA responded several weeks later \nand reassured Percipient of its commitment to using commercial products. \nNGA further explained that CACI’s “ship has sailed” statement was an \n“unfortunate miscommunication” that did not reflect the agency’s position. Compl. ¶ 100. Instead, the agency had not yet decided whether  it needed to \nincorporate a commercial product because CACI was still  reviewing NGA’s \nlegacy systems. NGA confirmed that commercial products would be \nevaluated once CACI finished.  \nAnother two months went by before Percipient finally secured a \nmeeting with CACI to demonstrate Mirage , although CACI’s Program \nManager—the individual largely responsible for deciding whether to Case 1:23-cv-00028-EGB   Document 44   Filed 04/07/23   Page 3 of 144 \n incorporate a commercial product—left the meeting after only 20 minutes. \nStill, Mirage received positive feedback, and CACI promised to evaluate \nMirage more fully. This “deep dive” into Mirage never happened, however.  \nCompl. ¶ 108.  \nSeveral months later , Percipient learned  at the 2021 GEOINT \nSymposium that CACI would be developing a computer vision system for \nSAFFIRE  when CACI employees visited  Percipient’s symposium booth. \nSurprised by the news, and no longer believing that CACI could fairly \nevaluate Mirage, Percipient met with NGA and asked to set up a \ndemonstration. NGA agreed but requested that Percipient “ease up on the \nlegal pressure.”  Compl. ¶ 118.  Percipient  then demonstrated Mirage’s \nabilities to several NGA representatives in December 2021, at the end of \nwhich NGA concluded that Percipient’s software met “all of NGA’s \nanalytical transformation requirements.” Compl. ¶ 120.  \nOver the next several months, the parties worked to reach an \nagreement that would allow NGA to test Mirage with live data, something that Percipient agreed to do at no cost. Just before signing an agreement to \nthat effect, however,  NGA changed its tune. Citing legal and security \ncomplexities, NGA would no longer use live data and would instead use \npreviously released and publicly available images. Percipient pushed back,  \nclaiming that these images would not allow NGA to test Mirage’s geospatial \nmodule or some of its unique features, like its ability to alert changes over \ntime. After significant delay, NGA relented and allowed the use of live data.  \nNGA completed its testing of Mirage in October 2022. Based on the \nresults, Percipient suspected that NGA was not assessing Mirage as a \npossible commercial solution for SAFFIRE’s computer vision requirements \nbecause, among other reasons, Percipient could only identify  four NGA \nsearches  over the 12- week testing period. Thus, Percipient offered to extend \nthe testing period, again at no cost, so NGA could more fully evaluate Mirage \nas a computer vision system. Percipient’s suspicions appeared to be \nconfirmed, though, when NGA explained one month later that it had \nevaluated Mirage as “an enterprise Machine Learning Platform,” and not “as \nan Analytical tool.” Compl. ¶ 137.  \nAfter Percipient’s efforts to be incorporated into SAFFIRE proved \nunfruitful, it filed this protest. In its complaint, Percipient alleges that the Case 1:23-cv-00028-EGB   Document 44   Filed 04/07/23   Page 4 of 145 \n agency  violated its statutory and regulatory obligations by wastefully \npursuing a development solution when a possible commercial solution \nexisted. It also alleges that the agency  unlawfully delegated inherent \ngovernment authority when it allowed its contractor, CACI, to determine agency policy on commercial technology. Finally, Percipient believes that \nthe agency  acted arbitrarily in handling  the SAFFIRE project. In response, \nthe government and CACI have moved to dismiss for lack of subject matter \njurisdiction.  \nDISCUSSION  \nI. Subject Matter Jurisdiction  \nLike all federal courts, we possess limited jurisdiction, with ours \nbeing defined mainly by the Tucker Act. Fisher v. United States, 402 F.3d \n1167, 1172 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (en banc). Under the Tucker Act, we have \njurisdiction over non -frivolous allegations of statutory or regulatory \nviolations “in connection with a procurement or a proposed procurement.” \nDistributed Sols., Inc. v. United States, 539 F.3d 1340, 1345 (Fed. Cir. 2008).  \nFirst, Percipient has alleged a non-frivolous violation of 10 U.S.C. \n§ 3453, which provides, in short, that defense agencies and their contractors \nmust acquire “commercial products” “to the maximum extent practicable.” \n§ 3453(b)(1)-(2). To that end, the statute requires agencies to conduct market \nresearch throughout the procurement process —including before each task \norder award—to identify commercial products that (1) “meet the agency’s \nrequirements,” (2) “could be modified to meet the agency’s requirements,” \nor (3) “could meet the agency’s requirements if those requirements were \nmodified to a reasonable extent.” § 3453(c)(1)-(2). In addition, offerors of \ncommercial products must be given an opportunity to compete. § 3453(a)(3).   \nWhile the parties may dispute the merits of Percipient’s claim, no \nparty has argued Percipient’s allegations are frivolous. Indeed, Percipient \nalleges specific facts that, if true, may violate §3453. Percipient alleges that \nit owns a commercial product that could fulfill NGA’s computer vision Case 1:23-cv-00028-EGB   Document 44   Filed 04/07/23   Page 5 of 146 \n requirements and that NGA ignored whether a commercial solution existed \nbefore it allowed CACI to develop a solution.3 \nSecond, to invoke our bid-protest jurisdiction, a protestor must allege \na “violation of statute or regulation in connection with a procurement or a \nproposed procurement.” 28 U.S.C. § 1491(b)(1) (2018). The statute’s \n“operative phrase ‘in connection with’ is very sweeping in scope.” RAMCOR \nServs. Group v. United States, 185 F.3d 1286, 1289 (Fed. Cir. 1999). The \nphrase encompasses any statutory violation  connected to a procurement, and \na procurement includes “all stages of the process of acquiring property or \nservices, beginning with the process for determining a need for property or services and ending with contract completion and closeout.” Distributed \nSols., 539 F.3d at 1345 (quoting 4 1 U.S.C. § 111).  \nWith this in view, NGA’s alleged violation of §3453 has a connection \nto a procurement. That is because §3453 is itself a procurement statute and \nestablishes a preference for commercial products and services. A violation \nof a statute that sets out what an agency can lawfully acquire has a connection \nto a procurement. RAMCOR, 185 F.3d at 1289  (holding that a  violation has \na connection with a procurement when an agency’s actions under that statute \naffect the award or performance of the contrac t).  \nThe government disagrees and argues that Percipient’s protest is not \nin connection with a procurement and is instead a challenge to NGA’s \nadministration of the SAFFIRE contract. In reaching that conclusion, the government reasons that Percipient’s pro test cannot be in connection with a \nprocurement because it alleges a post-award statutory violation that relates \nto NGA’s oversight of CACI’s performance.  \nWe reject the government’s characterization of Percipient’s protest. A \nprotest does not become a contract administration dispute simply because the agency’s statutory violation occurs after the contract award. Indeed, the \nTucker Act “does not require an objection to the actual contract \nprocurement”—only an objection to a statutory violation with a connection \nto a procurement. RAMCOR, 185 F.3d at 1289. Nothing in the Tucker Act \n \n3 On the current record, we know that CACI will at least  develop port ions of \nthe computer vision system, but it has not decided yet whether it will develop \nthe entire system. Tr. 25:6–15.  Case 1:23-cv-00028-EGB   Document 44   Filed 04/07/23   Page 6 of 147 \n suggests that th ose violations must occur before the contract award for the \ncourt to have jurisdiction.  \nNext, as a matter of statutory construction, the government invokes \nsovereign immunity to argue that we should narrowly construe the Tucker \nAct’s jurisdictional grant to exclude post-award procurement violations. But \nthe “sovereign immunity canon is just that —a canon of construction.” \nRichlin Sec. Serv. v. Chertoff, 553 U.S. 571, 589 (2008). It does not \n“displace[] the other traditional tools of statutory construction” and , like all \ncanons of construction, applies only when ambiguity exists. See id. at 590. \nNo ambiguity exists here, however, as we simply apply the Federal Circuit’s \ninterpretation of the Tucker Act in this protest.  Distributed Sols., 539 F.3d at \n1345.  \nFinally, CACI turns to the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act’s \n(FASA) task order bar,  which excludes from our jurisdiction any prot est “in \nconnection with the issuance or proposed issuance of a task or delivery \norder.” 10 U.S.C. § 3406(f)(1). It argues that we lack jurisdiction over \nPercipient’s protest because its development of a computer vision system is \nbeing performed under a task order and therefore falls outside this court’s \njurisdiction. All of that may be true, but FASA’s task order bar will not apply \nwhen, as here, a task order exceeds $25,000,000. § 3406(f)(1)(B). Thus, we \nconclude that we have subject matter jurisdiction over Percipient’s protest, \nwhich alleges a non-frivolous violation of a statute “in connection with a \nprocurement.”  \nII. Standing  \nEven though we may have subject matter jurisdiction, we can only \nexercise our jurisdiction when a plaintiff has established that it has standing to bring its claim. Myers Investigative & Sec. Servs., Inc. v. United States, \n275 F.3d 1366, 1369 (Fed. Cir. 2002). Standing ensures that plaintiffs who seek review in federal court have a sufficient “personal stake in the outcome \nof the controversy.” Baker v. Carr, 369 U.S. 186, 204 (1962). Although we \nare an Article I court, we apply Article III standing requirements. Anderson \nv. United States, 344 F.3d 1343, 1350 n.1 (Fed. Cir. 2003).  \nWhen it comes to bid protests, a plaintiff must do more than establish \nArticle III standing. That is because Congress, through the Tucker Act, Case 1:23-cv-00028-EGB   Document 44   Filed 04/07/23   Page 7 of 148 \n provided that only an “interested party” has standing to challenge a \nprocurement. 28 U.S.C. § 1491(b)(1) (2018). The phrase “interested party” \n“imposes more stringent standing requirements than Article III,” Weeks \nMarine, Inc. v. United States, 575 F.3d 1352, 1359 (Fed. Cir. 2009), and limits claims “to actual or prospective bidders” who have a “direct economic \ninterest” in the award of the contract, Am. Fed’n of Gov’t Emps. v. United \nStates, 258 F.3d 1294, 1302 (Fed. Cir. 2001).  \nThe government mostly disputes the first standing requirement, which \nrequires a protestor to be an actual or prospective bidder. As all the parties agree, Percipient did not (and could not) bid on the SAFFIRE contract. That \nfailure, in the government’s view, is fatal to Percipient’s protest and reveals \nthat Percipient is simply a “disappointed subcontractor” without standing.  \nNormally, a protestor is an actual or prospective bidder if it either \nsubmitted a proposal in response to a solicitation, or it is “expecting to submit an offer” before the solicitation closes. MCI  Telecomm. Corp. v. United \nStates, 878 F.2d 362, 365 (Fed. Cir. 1989) (emphasis omitted). But the \nrequirement that a protestor have submitted a bid for it to be an interested party is anything but absolute. For example, SEKRI v. United States  refused \nto apply the actual or prospective bidder requirement to a challenge brought under a mandatory source statute because doing so would thwart Congress’s \nintent behind the statute. 34 F.4th 1063, 1072–73 (Fed. Cir. 2022). Distributed Solutions  allowed contractors to challenge an agency’s \nnoncompetitive procurement vehicle without bidding because they “were prepared to submit bids” if the agency had solicited them. 539 F.3d at 1345. Elmendorf Support Services v. United States held that an incumbent \ncontractor need not be a bidder for it to challenge an agency’s in-sourcing decision because it had  an obvious interest in “maintaining its incumbency.” \n105 Fed. Cl. 203, 208– 09 (2012). Electra-Med Corporation v. United States \ndetermined that contractors can be interested parties without bidding when \nthey challenge an agency action that denies them the opportunity to compete. 140 Fed. Cl. 94, 103 (2018); see also McAfee, Inc. v. United States, 111 Fed. \nCl. 696, 708–09 (2013). And finally, the interested party requirements have \neven been relaxed when their rigid application would make statutory \nguarantees illusory. See Navarro Rsch. & Eng’g v. United States, 94 Fed. Cl. \n224, 230 (2010).  Case 1:23-cv-00028-EGB   Document 44   Filed 04/07/23   Page 8 of 149 \n What these cases make clear is that the “judicial review of \nprocurement methods should not be thwarted through the wooden application \nof standing requirements.” CCL, Inc. v. United States, 39 Fed. Cl. 780, 790 \n(1997). In other words, those requirements should be sensitive to a \nprotestor’s specific claim and should not deny standing to those who otherwise have a sufficient “personal stake in the outcome of the \ncontroversy.” Baker, 369 U.S. at 204.  \nWith that in mind, we turn to the statute at issue. Under §3453, the \ncritical issue is whether offerors of commercial products have standing. We conclude that they do and that §3453 does not require an offeror of a \ncommercial product to have bid on the prime contract.  \nFirst, unlike most procurement statutes, §3453 contemplates that \nofferors of commercial products have rights under the statute. Specifically, \n§3453 provides that agencies must give offerors of commercial products “an \nopportunity to compete in any procurement to fill [the agency’s] requirements.” § 3453(a)(3). And this clause  guarantees more than just a \nright to compete by bidding on the contract because the statute expressly \ndistinguishes between bidders and offerors of commercial products. \n§ 3453(b)(4) (requiring  agencies to state their specifications “in terms that \nenable and encourage bidders and offerors to supply commercial services or commercial products” (emphasis added)); see also  Ysleta Del Sur Pueblo v. \nTexas , 142 S. Ct. 1929, 1939 (2022) (“[D]ifferences in language . . . convey \ndifferences in meaning.”). A violation of §3453 therefore denies these \ncommercial product owners an opportunity to compete that is guaranteed to \nthem by the statute, see Electra- Med, 140 Fed. Cl. at 103; cf. Distrib. Sols., \n539 F.3d at 1345, and that guarantee would become illusory if offerors of \ncommercial products could not sue under §3453, Navarro Rsch. & Eng’g, 94 \nFed. Cl. at 230.  \nSecond, §3453  imposes an obligation on agencies to incorporate \ncommercial products that continues beyond the contract’s award. For \nexample, agencies must conduct market research even before “award ing a \ntask order or delivery order.” § 3453(c)(1)(C). They must then use the results  \nof that research to identify any commercial products that (1) “meet the  \nagency’s requirements,” (2) “could be modified to meet the agency’s requirements,” or (3) “could meet the agency’s requirements if those \nrequirements were modified to a reasonable extent.” § 3453(c)(2). So, putting Case 1:23-cv-00028-EGB   Document 44   Filed 04/07/23   Page 9 of 1410 \n this all together, an agency must conduct market research even after the \ncontract award and then, depending on the results, need to incorporate a \ncommercial product. This means that an agency can still violate §3453 after \nthe contract award and  is why—unlike most other protests—it is irrelevant \nwhether the commercial product offeror bid on the prime contract.  \nThe government emphasizes Percipient’s inability to perform the \nentire contract and appears to suggest that standing under §3453 is limited to \nthose offerors whose commercial product can meet every requirement in a \nsolicitation. But the statutory text does not support this conclusion as it \nprovides in at least one part that agencies must “require prime contractors \nand subcontractors . . . to incorporate commercial services [and] commercial \nproducts . . . as components of items supplied to the agency.” § 3453(b)(2) \n(emphasis added). The word “component” means a “part or element of a \nlarger whole” and contradicts a requirement that commercial products satisfy \nevery agency requirement. New Oxford American  Dictionary (3d ed.  2010).  \nBecause the text’s meaning is plain, we could stop there. Carcieri v. \nSalazar, 555 U.S. 379, 387 (2009). But relevant caselaw further suggests that this ability of a commercial product to meet every agency requirement is \nunnecessary for standing under §3453. In Palantir USG v. United States, the \nFederal Circuit held that the Army violated §3453 when it failed to use \nmarket research results to identify possible commercial solutions, but it \nreached that conclusion without deciding whether Palantir’s product could satisfy every Army requirement. See 904 F.3d 980, 990–91, 993 (Fed. Cir. \n2018).  \nThird, the statute uniquely expresses a significant preference for \ncommercial products. That preference manifests itself throughout  the statute \nby imposing obligations that require agencies to consider commercial \nproducts at nearly every stage of  the procurement. This preference then \nculminates in Congress encouraging agencies to sacrifice their own \nrequirements if doing so would allow the agency to incorporate a commercial \nproduct or service. § 3453(b)(3), (c)(2)(C). It would thwart Congress’s intent \nbehind §3453  if offerors of commercial products could not bring challenges \nunder the statute. SEKRI, 34 F.4th at 1072–73. \nWe thus hold that offerors of commercial products need not bid on the \nprime contract to have §3453 standing. Instead, the appropriate question in Case 1:23-cv-00028-EGB   Document 44   Filed 04/07/23   Page 10 of 1411 \n this context is whether the protestor was prepared to offer its commercial \nproduct to the agency if the agency had complied with the statute. In this \ncase, Percipient’s actions over the last two years make clear that it was \nwilling and ready to offer its commercial software.   \nOn a different note, CACI contends that offerors of commercial \nproducts do not have §3453 standing because procurement violations, like \nthe one alleged here, can be prevented through congressional oversight. No \ndoubt, Congress has the  power to oversee federal procurements, yet Congress \nvested this court with exclusive bid protest jurisdiction  and surely had in \nmind that we would remedy procurement violations. And again, Palantir  \nupheld a protestor’s §3453 challenge even though Congress had taken some \nremedial steps of its own. See, e.g. , National Defense Authorization Act for \nFiscal Year 2017, Pub. L. No. 114 -328, §§ 113, 220 (2016).  \nThe government’s final salvo is to once again argue that offerors of \ncommercial products cannot challenge a post-award violation of §3453 \nbecause these disputes become challenges to the government’s contract \nadministration. Just as we rejected this argument as a jurisdictional defense, we reject it here too. For one thing, requiring these challenges to be brought \nbefore contract award makes little sense when §3453’s requirements \ncontinue beyond the contract’s award and can still be violated afterward. But \nfor another, that limitation would also allow agencies to ignore §3453 with \nimpunity as long as they defer decisions about commercial products until \nafter the contract award. That result would be untenable, especially when Congress enacted this statute to stem wasteful and inefficient agency \nspending.\n4 \n \n4 See, e.g., Formula for Action: A Report to the President on Defense \nAcquisition by the President’s Blue Ribbon Commission on Defense \nManagement at 23–24 (April 1986); H.R. Rep. No. 103-545, at 21 (1994); S. \nRep. No. 103-258, at 6 (1994); H.R. Rep. No. 103-712, at 233 (1994) (Conf. \nRep.); S. Rep. No. 112- 173, at 162–63  (2012); Hearing to Receive Testimony \non the Current Readiness of U.S. Forces in Review of the Defense \nAuthorization Request for Fiscal Year 2014 and the Future Years Defense \nProgram: Hearings Before the Subcomm. on Readiness and Management \nSupport, Comm. on Armed Services , 113th Cong., 1st Sess. 24 –27  (2013)  \n(statement of Sen. McCaskill); Hearing to Receive Testimony in Review of \nthe Defense Authorization Request for Fiscal Year 2016 and the Future Years Case 1:23-cv-00028-EGB   Document 44   Filed 04/07/23   Page 11 of 1412 \n Finally, the parties do not seriously dispute Percipient’s economic \ninterest. A protestor has a direct economic interest if, “but for the alleged \nerror in the procurement process,” it would have received an award. Info. \nTech. & Applications v. United States, 316 F.3d 1312, 1319 (Fed. Cir. 2003). \nThe only argument advanced against Percipient’s economic interest is its \nfailure to bid on the SAFFIRE contract. But Percipient is an offeror of a commercial product  under §3453 and is  prepared to offer  NGA  its product. \nViewed in that light, Percipient has an economic interest in that opportunity. \nThus, Percipient has standing to challenge the agency’s alleged violation of §3453.  \nIII. Timeliness  \nThe government and CACI assert two timeliness defenses, both of \nwhich we reject. First, the government invokes Blue & Gold Fleet v. United \nStates, which held that a protestor waives its right to protest if it “has the \nopportunity to object to the terms of a government solicitation containing a \npatent error and fails to do so prior to the close of the bidding process.” 492 \nF.3d 1308, 1313 (Fed. Cir. 2007). In the government’s view, Percipient’s \nprotest is essentially a challenge to the solicitation and is therefore waived \nunder Blue & Gold .  \nWe disagree: In the limited record we have, nothing in the solicitation \nappears to violate §3453. The solicitation was flexible enough to allow for a \ndevelopment solution, but it did not require one. And that approach is entirely \nconsistent with §3453, which allows for development solutions when a \ncommercial one is impracticable or nonexistent. Likewise, NGA’s actions \nhere only confirm that the solicitation did not require a development solution \nas NGA repeatedly explained to Percipient that there would be opportunities \nfor Percipient to offer its commercial product. Thus, Percipient’s protest is \nnot barred by Blue & Gold.  \nSecond, CACI argues that Percipient’s complaint is barred by the \ndoctrine of laches. In essence, laches is “a defense developed by courts of \nequity to protect defendants against unreasonable, prejudicial delay in commencing suit.” SCA Hygiene Prods. Aktiebolag v. First Quality Baby \n \nDefense Program: Before the Subcomm. on Airland of the S. Comm. on \nArmed Servs., 114th  Cong. 60–62 (2015) (statement of Sen. Cotton).  Case 1:23-cv-00028-EGB   Document 44   Filed 04/07/23   Page 12 of 1413 \n Prods., 580 U.S. 328, 333 (2017).  CACI maintains that laches applies \nbecause Percipient’s protest should have been brought in March 2021  when , \naccording to CACI, Percipient first learned of a potential §3453 violation.  \nWe cannot apply the doctrine of laches to defeat Percipient’s cause of \naction on a motion to dismiss. Of course, a party’s delay in suit is relevant \nwhen deciding whether to grant a permanent injunction, which requires us to \nconsider, among other things, “whether the balance of hardships leans in the \nplaintiff’s favor.” Fed. Acquisition Servs. Team v. United States, 124 Fed. \nCl. 690, 708 (2016). But the Supreme Court has long held that laches is not \nan affirmative defense when a statute of limitations exists. United States v. \nMack, 295 U.S. 480, 489 (1935). A statute of limitations is a “congressional \ndecision that the timeliness of covered claims is better judged on the basis of \na generally hard and fast rule rather than the sort of case-specific judicial \ndetermination that occurs when a laches defense is asserted.” SCA Hygiene, \n580 U.S. at 334 –35. Thus, applying laches to a claim brought within the \nstatute of limitations violates “separation-of- powers principles” because it \nwould “give judges a ‘legislation-overriding’ role that is beyond the \nJudiciary’s power.” Id.  at 335 (quoting Petrella v. Metro-Goldwyn- Mayer, \nInc., 572 U.S. 663, 680 (2014)).  \n In this case, Congress has established a six- year statute of limitations \nfor any claim in this court, 28 U.S.C. § 2501, and we “are not at liberty to \njettison Congress’ judgment on the timeliness of suit,” SCA Hygiene, 580 \nU.S. at 335. Therefore, because Percipient’s suit was brought within six \nyears, its claim is timely, and laches is no defense.   \n \n     \n \n Case 1:23-cv-00028-EGB   Document 44   Filed 04/07/23   Page 13 of 1414 \n CONCLUSION  \nIn sum, we have subject matter jurisdiction over Percipient’s \nnon-frivolous allegation of a statutory violation in connection with the \nSAFFIRE procurement. In addition, Percipient, as an offeror of a commercial \nproduct, has standing under §3453 because it was prepared to offer its \nproduct to NGA, and it had a direct economic interest in that opportunity. \nTherefore, the motions to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction are denied.  \n      s/Eric G.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**:\n   The case involves a post-award bid protest by Centech Group, Inc., challenging the General Services Administration's (GSA) decision to deduct points from Centech's self-score for not having required signatures on documents demonstrating their experience with leading-edge technology (LET) projects, which include areas like artificial intelligence (AI) and other advanced fields. The court found that GSA's signature requirement was not arbitrary or capricious, reaffirming that a CO’s signature was essential to verify past project qualifications in the given technological categories.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**:\n   The key legal issue was whether GSA's requirement for a Contracting Officer's signature on documents verifying LET experience was reasonable and whether the failure to obtain such signatures could justifiably result in a deduction of points in a bid evaluation.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**:\n   The court denied Centech's motion for judgment on the administrative record, ruling that GSA's signature requirement was reasonable and not arbitrary, and therefore GSA acted within its discretion in adhering to its solicitation requirements. Consequently, the court upheld the deduction of points from Centech’s bid, given the non-compliance with the stipulated signature requirement.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**:\n   Imagine you're part of a club that wants to hire different bands to play at a big concert. Your rules say every band has to show a signed letter from a previous gig's manager to prove they played there. Centech, a band, couldn't get those signed letters for two of its gigs. They still wanted to play at your concert, so they included emails showing they tried to get the letters. The club said, \"Sorry, no signed letters, no gig,\" and stuck to their rules. Centech asked a judge to change the club's mind, but the judge said the club’s rules were clear and fair, so Centech's request was denied.",

In its protest, Centech alleges that GSA abused its discretion by failing to exercise any discretion whatsoever.  Specifically, Centech alleges that GSA acted unreasonabl y by deducting points from its score solely for the lack of a signature \nthat was beyond Centech’s control especiall y in light of the fact that GSA could have \nverified  or clarif ied Centech’s leading edge technology (“LET”) relevant experience \nthrough the information it had on hand or by reaching out to the identified contracting officers  (“CO”) .  \nCentech , therefore, requests the Court to enter judgment on the \nadministrative record in its favor  and restore its award eligibility .   \n \nThe Court adopted the litigation schedule as provided by the parties and entered \nits scheduling order on January 5, 2018.  Pursuant to the scheduling order, the Administrative Record was timely filed on January 19, 2018.  Defendant-Intervenor, Salient CRGT, Inc., w as granted  leave to intervene on February 2, 2018.\n3     \n  On February 9, 2018, Centech filed its motion for judgment on the administrative record (“Pl. Mot.”).  Defendant timely filed its response to Centech ’s motion for \njudgment on the administrative record and cross motion for judgment on the administrative r ecord on March 3, 2018 arguing that (1) Centech’s protest is untimely , or \nin the alternative , that  (2) GSA reasonably required a CO ’s signature for certification of \ncertain projects.   \n \nThe parties timely filed their  respective responses and replies with briefing \ncomplete d on March 26, 2018. \n  On April 10, 2018, the Court granted defendant’s unopposed motion to \nsupplement the r ecord  to reflect a change in scoring to one of the awardees on the \nprocurement.    \n                                                 \n2 Centech originally filed its protest at the GAO which was dismissed on \nDecember 20, 2017, without any decision on the merits because another bidder had challenged the same procur ement in this Court.

Facts  \n  \nA. The Solicitation  \n \nGSA first published notice of its intent to procure under the RFP  in FedBizOps in \nJanuary 2014.  AR  at 1. GSA made its first draft RFP public in March 2015, AR at 412, \nand received more than 900 comments regarding draft RFPs by December 2015.  AR  at \n1891.  \n \nOn June 24, 2016, GSA issued the RFP.   AR at 1 887.  The RFP provided for a 5-\nyear base period, one 5-year option period, and a total ceiling value of $50 billion for all \ntask orders.  AR at 1386, 1334.  The RFP further provided that GSA would issue multi ple \nawards to the top sixty highest- rated offerors on a best -value bases to “the highest \ntechnically rated offerors with a fair and reasonable price.”  AR  at 1581-82.  Offerors \nwere to self -score their proposals in the following categories:  relevant exper ience; past \nperformance; systems, certifications, and clearance; and organizational risk assessment.  AR at 1517-80.  GSA would then verify the scoring during proposal evaluation.  AR  at \n1582.  Based on the offeror’s answers, the scoring worksheet auto- calculated its score out \nof a possible 83,100 points.  AR  at 30306.  In the event of a tied score, “all Offerors \nprecisely tied at the 60\nth position will receive an award.”  AR at 1582.  The awardees \nwould then be permitted to bid on a series of fixed- price, cost reimbursement, time -and-\nmaterials, and labor -hour task orders to provide IT services to various federal agencies. \nAR at 1333.   \n \nRelevant to this protest is the evaluation under L ET relevant experience projects.   \nOfferors could earn points for LET relevant  experience.  AR  at 1556.  The RFP provided \nfor offerors to identify as many as 30 different leading edge projects by verifying up to three previous leading edge projects in each of the following 10 areas: (1) artificial intelligence; (1) autonomic computing; (3) big data; (4) biometrics; (5) cloud computing; (6) cyber security; (7) health IT; (8) mobile IT; (9) the internet of things; and (10) virtual networking.  AR  at 1559.  It defined LETs as “highly sophisticated and cutting edge \ndevelopments in the extensive field of information technology. . . .” AR at 319.   \nThe RFP inclu ded the requirement that the offerors use a particular template, \nForm J.P-3, to document their LET experience in accordance with s ection L.5.2.3.1.1 of \nthe RFP.   AR at 15 39.  Under section  L.5.2.3.1.1:  “Any other format will be rejected as a \nmaterial non -conformity .”  AR at 1539.  The RFP was explicit, “[i]n order to receive \npoints for each submitted L eading Edge Technology Relevant Experience project . . . \n[t]he completed Attachment J.P -3, Relevant Experience (Leading Edge Technology) \nProject Template must be signed by a Contracting Officer  (“CO”) with cognizance over \nthe submitted project.”  AR at 1556; s ee also  AR at 645-46 (J.P-3 form for signature). \n  Case 1:17-cv-02031-EJD   Document 38   Filed 06/01/18   Page 3 of 114 \n B. Published Answers Regarding Signature Requirement  \n \nIn published questions and answers, t he CO acknowledged the signature \nrequirement for verification of LET experience:  \n \nQUESTION 15:   In the event that one or more of our customers does not return signed J.P-2 and/or J.P-3 forms in time for proposal submission, will the Government please confirm that an offeror’s proposal will not be dismissed if there is a discrepancy between the LET/PS C 1-1, 1-2, 1-3 project identifier numbering on the J.P-2 and \nJ.P-3 forms and the self scoring worksheet?   RESPONSE: The Offeror may not claim points without all the \nrequired forms or without the proper citation signed by the client \nagency.  \n AR at 1935 (emphasis added).  \n QUESTION 26: Will the government allow Project Identifiers (Attachment J.P -3, Part 1. Project Identification, 8th row) on the \nsigned template to be hand corrected after the CO has signed and returned the completed LET template? . . .   RESPONSE:  No.   \n AR at1938.  \n QUESTION 5: If the Contracting Officer elects to have the COR sign the template because they are in a better position to verify the technical aspect of the citation, will that be acceptable if COR email notification is provided to the CO by the COR that they have signed the LET template on their behalf? Should the Offeror submit a copy of the actual email with our bid?  \n RESPONSE: The J.P -2/J.P- 3 forms re quire the Contracting \nOfficer’s name and contact information; however, the signature of the CO, or COR in lieu of the Contractin g Officer, is acceptable. . .   \n AR at 1948.  \n QUESTION 11: If the government issued a contract award with “signature on file” in  the signature block, will GSA consider it a \nvalid document for verification purposes?   Case 1:17-cv-02031-EJD   Document 38   Filed 06/01/18   Page 4 of 115 \n RESPONSE: Yes, we will accept an award document presented to \nus that shows the “signature on file.” However, the J.P -2 and J.P-3 \nmust have actual signature, or e-signature  (including CAC  \nAuthenticated Electronic Signature).   \n AR at 1957-58 (emphasis added).  \n QUESTION 22: For the J.P -2, Relevant Experience (PSC Group) \nProject Template, and the J.P -3, Relevant Experience (Leading Edge \nTechnology) Project Template, may a verification signature be \nprovided by an individual who no longer has cognizance over the project ( i.e., the individual has moved on to a new position in the \nGovernment, or left Government entirely)?   RESPONSE: No, a current Contracting Officer / Contrac ting \nOfficer Representative or other recognized official with cognizance over the project needs to sign .  \n QUESTION 23: Will the Government accept a SOW/PWS for verification instead of the signature of a cognizant Government official on the J.P-2 or J.P- 3?  \n RESPONSE: Signatures are generally required for J.P -2. The only \nexception that a signature is not required on the J.P-2 is when the FPDS -NG Report is Available, Complete and Accurate.  \nSignatures are required for ALL J.P-3 templates .  \n \nAR at 1970 (emphasis added).  \n \nQUESTION 24: In Section L.5.2.3.1.1 the RFP states “NOTE: If Attachment J.P -3 ... requires a signature”.  In what circumstances \ndoes the J.P- 3 require a signature?  \n RESPONSE: Attachment J.P -3 templates always require a CO/COR \nsignature pursuant to L.5.2.3.1.1 . . .  QUESTION 28: If a project being submitted for the Leading Edge Technology Relevant Experience has an accurate FPDS report and current CPAR report, will the government consider removing the requirement for Attachment J.P-3 to be signed by the Contracting \nOfficer?  \n RESPONSE: No. A completed Attachment J.P-3 with a signature is always required. No exceptions . See all subsections under Section \nL.5.2.3.   Case 1:17-cv-02031-EJD   Document 38   Filed 06/01/18   Page 5 of 116 \n QUESTION 29: In cases for our DoD customer s can the \nVerification of LET Relevant Experience J.P -3 be signed by the \nSenior Agency Program Director in charge?  \n RESPONSE: No, only a cognizant CO or COR can sign the verification.  \n AR at 1971 (emphasis added).  \n \nC. Proposal Submission, Evaluation, and A ward   \n \nCentech timely filed its proposal in response to the RFP, along with 169 other \nofferors.  AR at 30306.  In its proposal, Centech included a number of J.P-3 F orms \nregarding its LET experience.  See AR at 25490-26876. With respect to one past contract, \nCentech attached an email from an Air Force CO  who declined to sign the J.P-3 Form  \nbecause he “ha[d] not been the contracting officer on this effort for four years.”  AR at \n25951.  Centech was l ikewise  unable to include a CO’s signature for a Department of \nTransportation (DOT) project , as the CO  failed to respond to any of Centech’s requests.  \nAR at 25604-25608.  In lieu of signature s for these two projects , Centech  attached \ndocuments showing it made efforts to obtain the required signatures.  AR at 25606-25613.  Even without the required signatures, Centech added these two projects  to its \ntechnical self -score culminating in a total score of [. . .].  AR at 30333.  GSA deducted \n600 points from the proposal for the se two LET projects that did not have the required \nsignature, resulting in a final technical score of [. . . ].  AR  at 30333-34.   \n \nGSA named a total of 61 awardees, with a tie occurring at slot numbers 59 \nthrough 61.  AR at 30306.  The awardee technical scores ranged 83,100 to 73,600 at slots 59, 60, and 61, and any technical score below 7 3,600 was ineligible for award.  AR at \n30306. \n \nII. Legal Standards  \n \nThe Court has jurisdiction under the Tucker Act, 28 U.S.C. section 1491(b)(1). \nThe Tucker Act, as amended by the Administrative Disputes Resolution Act of 1996, 28 \nU.S.C. section 1491(b)(1), grants this Court exclusive jurisdiction to “render judgment on \nan action by an interested party objecting to a solicitation by a Federal Agency fo r bids or \nproposals for a proposed contract or to a proposed award or the award of a contract or any alleged violation of statute or regulation in connection with a procurement or proposed procurement.”  28 U.S.C. § 1491(b)(1).  Under the Tucker Act, an “interested \nparty” includes an actual or prospective offeror  whose direct economic interest would be \naffected by or which has suffered a non- trivial competitive injury or prejudice as a result \nof the alleged error.  Sys. Application & Tech., Inc. v. United States , 691 F.3d 1374, 1382 \n(Fed. Cir. 2012).   \n The Court sustains procurements so long as the action was not arbitrary, \ncapricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.  28 U.S.C. § Case 1:17-cv-02031-EJD   Document 38   Filed 06/01/18   Page 6 of 117 \n 1491(b)(4); 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A); Impresa Construzioni Geom. Domenico Garufi v. \nUnited States , 238 F.3d 1324, 1332 (Fed. Cir. 2001); see also Citizens to Preserve \nOverton Park, Inc. v. Volpe , 401 U.S. 402, 416 (1971), overruled on other grounds, \nCalifano v. Sanders , 430 U.S. 99 (1977); Ramcor Serv s. Group, Inc. v. United States , 185 \nF.3d 1286, 1290 (Fed. Cir. 1999).  \n \nIn reviewing the A gency’s procurement decisions, the Court recognizes that the \ndecision is entitled to a “presumption of regularity,” Citizens to Preserve Overton Park, 401 U.S. at 415 (citations omitted), and that the Court should not substitute its judgment for that of the agency.  Redland Genstar, Inc. v. United States , 39 Fed. Cl. 220 (1997); \nCincom Systems, Inc. v. United States , 37 Fed. Cl. 663, 672 (1997); see also M.W. \nKellogg Co. v. United States , 10 Cl. Ct. 17, 23 (1986) (holding that “deference must be \nafforded to an agency’s . . . procurement decisions if they have a rational basis and do not violate applicable law or regulations .”).  The disappointed bidder “bears a heavy b urden,” \nand the CO  is “entitled to exercise discretion upon a broad range of issues.”  Impre sa, \n238 F.3d at 1332 (citations and quotes omitted).  “An agency’s decision will be upheld so long as it was not ‘clearly erroneous,’ and there was a rational basis for the decision.”  Int’l Res. Recovery, Inc. v. United States , 64 Fed. Cl. 150, 161 (2005) (quoting Gulf \nGroup Inc. v. United States , 61 Fed. Cl. 338, 353 (2004)).  Furthermore, the Court must \ngive the procuring agency considerable deference in matters requiring technical judgment.  Benchmade Knife Co., Inc. v. United States , 79 Fed. Cl. 731, 740 (2007) \n(“Agencies are entitled to considerable discretion and deference in matters requiring exercise of technical judgment.”).\n \n \n The Federal Circuit has held that challenges to the terms of a solicitation itself, as \nopposed to the evaluation of proposals responding to a solicitation, must occur prior to \nthe deadline for receipt of proposals when these are based on alleged patent errors.  Blue & Gold Fleet, L.P. v. United States, 492 F.3d 1308, 1313 (Fed. Cir.  2007).  A party's \nfailure to do so is a waiver of its ability to raise the same objection in a bid protest action in this C ourt.  Id.  at 1313.  “This doctrine was established to  prevent contractors from \ntaking advantage of the government, protect other bidders by assuring that all bidders bid on the same specifications, and materially aid the administration of government contracts by requiring that ambiguities be raised before the contract is bid, thus avoiding costly litigation after the fact. ”  Id. at 1313-14 ( citing  Cmty. Heating & Plumbing Co. v. Kelso, \n987 F.2d 1575, 1580 (Fed. Cir.  1993)). \n Therefore, a preliminary question to address in considering plaintiff's protest is \nthe nature of the challenge brought—in other words, whether the terms of the Solicitation itself, or the Agency evaluation of Centech ’s proposal, is being challenged.   \n \nIII. Discussion  \n A. Has Centech  Waived its Right to Protest? \n Blue & Gold Fleet , teaches “that a party who has the opportunity to object to the \nterms of a government solicitation containing a patent error and fails to do so prior to the close of the bidding process waives its ability to raise the same objection subsequently in Case 1:17-cv-02031-EJD   Document 38   Filed 06/01/18   Page 7 of 118 \n a bid protest action in” this Court.  492 F.3d at 1313.  Moreover, an unsuccessful bidder \nmay not re- write the solicitation to suit its needs in a post-award protest after sleeping on \nits rights before bidding.  Id . at 1314.   \n \nIn its opening brief, Centech admits that it knew that its bid did not meet th e \nsignature requirem ent for two LET projects.  Pl. ’s Mot. at 3-5.  Centech further states that \n“[t]he RFP unambiguously states that bidders would not receive points in connection with their claimed LET experience unless the form was signed by either the CO or COR.”  Id . \nat 3.  As well, Centech acknowledges that by including this provision, GSA “invoked a \nformal requirement” in the solicitation, albeit “a formal requirement th at served no \npurpose.”  Pl. ’s Reply  at 4.  These admissions, advance the government, compel a finding \nthat Centech’s claim s are barred under Blue & Gold Fleet .  Def. Reply at 1 -2. \n Centech  argues that there is no ambiguity in the Solicitation ; but by Centech’s \nown admission, it admits that it did not know whether the documents it submitted in lieu of the signed J.P-3 Form would be accepted.  See Pl.’s Reply at 4 (“[Centech ] did not \nknow whether the Government would accept documentation it submitted of its efforts and whether it would factor in [its] complete lack of control over the other governmental agen cy’s action.” ).  Even so, Centech argues that it is not challenging the solicitation \nterms  but “ it is challenging the Government’s conduct during evaluation.”  Pl. ’s Reply at \n4.  Thus, Centech maintains that it is the lack of Agency action with the documents that formulates the basis of its challenge.  Id .   \n Although Centech attacks the reasonableness of the requirement, it admits that \nthere is no ambiguity.  The thrust of its brief is that the Agency applied the requirement \nrigidly, indeed, “robotically.”  On  balance, the Court concludes that Centech is \nchallenging the conduct of the Agen cy during the evaluation, not the terms of the \nsolicitation.  The Court, therefore, disagrees with the government’s characterization of \nCentech’s challenges and the challenges are timely as a post -award protest.   \n The Court must, therefore, address the merits of the protest, i.e., w ere the \nAgency’s actions reasonable? \n \nB.   Was GSA’s Signature Requirement R easonable? \n \nIn general, COs conducting negotiated procu rements award contracts to \n“responsible offeror[s] whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.”  48 C.F.R. § 52.212-2(a) (emphasis added).  Indeed, awards based on non- conformi ng proposals may \n“violate[] the procurement statutes and regulations.”  E.W. Bliss Co. v. United States , 77 \nF.3d 445, 448 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (citations omitted).     \n The facts are simple in this case.  T he RFP stated “. . . Project Template must be \nsigned  by a Contracting Officer  (“CO”) . . . .”  AR 1556 (emphasis added).  Not only was \nthe language clear, the signature requirement was reinforced through extensive answers and questions regarding the J.P-3 Form .  See supra Section I.B.   Centech knew that its Case 1:17-cv-02031-EJD   Document 38   Filed 06/01/18   Page 8 of 119 \n proposal did not meet the J.P-3 Form signature requirement with two of its LET projects.  \nBy attaching the email requests to those CO s in lieu of the signatures, Centech tried to \novercome its deficiency.  Thus, there is no argument that Centech  did not have the \nrequired signatures and did not conform to the solicitation.  Yet, it is Centech’s position that the Agency’s point deduction for lack of signatures served no rational basis.  Pl. Mot. at 7-8.  Additionally, Centech argues that the Agency’s failure to  exercise discretion by \nverifying or clarifying its concerns was an abuse of discretion.  Pl. Mot. at 9.  And finally, Centech argues that  the Agency acted arbitrarily when it elevated form over substance.  \nPl. Mot. 12-14.  The Court disagrees with Centech  for the following reasons.  \n \n1. There was a rational b asis. \nCentech  alleges that the signature requirement did not serve any actual purpose or \nrational basis .  However, the government provided several reasons for the solicitation’s \nsignature requirement .  Specifically :  \n \n● The CO  for each previous project was in the best position to \nobjectively assert whether a past IT project actually qualified under the RFP’s definitions of the LET categories.    \n ● The CO signature was necessary because the relevant CO or  COR \nis the individual most qualified to make that determination.     ● The most reliable and accurate arbiter of a given project’s \nqualification under a given LET category is the CO or COR responsible for that project. \n Gov. Mot. at 8-9.  These reasons pr ovide ample support for the signature requirement in \norder to verify LET experience.   \n Furthermore, t he RFP defined LETs as “highly sophisticated and cutting edge \ndevelopments in the extensive field of information technology . . . .” AR at 319.   Therefore, when there are engineering and scientific considerations, it has been held that when a court is reviewing an agency’s technical expertise and experience, “it should \ndefer to [the Agency’s]  analysis unless it is without substantial basis in fac t.”  Cube Corp. \nv. United States , 46 Fed. Cl. 368, 375 (2000) (quoting Federal Power Comm’n v. Florida \nPower & Light Co., 404 U.S. 453, 463, reh’g denied, 405 U.S. 948 (1972)).  Thus, verification of LET experience was reasonable and in accordance with an RFP seeking specialized technical knowledge.    \n \n2. GSA  reasonably e xercised its d iscretion . \n \nCentech  further argues that the Agency failed to exercise discretion by verifying \nits LET projects .  Pl. Mot. at 9.  Furthermore, Centex argues if the Agency had any \nquestions or concerns about its LET experience it was obligated to clarify its concerns.  Id.    \n Case 1:17-cv-02031-EJD   Document 38   Filed 06/01/18   Page 9 of 1110 \n The RFP contemplated clarification, stating : “The Government may conduct \nclarifications, as descri bed in FAR § 15.306(a).”  AR at 1582.  However, the government \nhas wide discretion in determining whether a clarification should be sought.  Even so, “a \ncontracting officer’s actions can still be arbitrary and thus not substantially justified.”  BCPeabody Constr. Servs., Inc. v. United States , 112 Fed. Cl. 502, 512 (2014).   \n Here, the Agency did not verify or ask for clarifications regarding the tw o LET \nprojects claimed by Centech  and rejected for points by the Agency.  It is Centech’s \nposition that the Agency was “obligated to exercise its discretion and do something.”  Pl. Mot. at 12.  In support, Centech argues that in this same procurement, after the bids were submitted and in the context of past performance evaluations, the Agency acted reasonably  by waiving an email require ment regarding past performance finding that the \nrequirement did not serve any purpose.  Pl. Mot. at 11.  Because the past performance email requirement was  not necessary for the relevant  analysis and because a deduction \nfor other than negative performance would be unfair and unreasonable, compliance was waived  by the Agency.  Pl. Mot. at 11-12. \n \nThus, it is Centech’s argument that the signature requirement f or the J.P -3 Forms \nwas similar to the waived email requirement in that the signatures did not provide any additional relevant data points.  Pl. Mot. at 12.  Centech further argues that be cause the \nAgency knew that it had not been at fault in not obtaining the signatures ,\n4 the Agency \nwas obliged to take some action.  Id .  For instance, Centech argues that the requirement \ncould have been waived; the Agency could have independently verified the LET experience by contacting the CO or another agency representative; the Agency could have asked for additional information from Centech as a clarification; or the Agency could have looked at alternate information available to it.  Id .   \n The RFP directed bidders to “ attach verification documents . . . Any other format \nwill be rejected as a material non -conformity.  NOTE: The Offeror must substantiate all \nthe information through the verification method identified in Section L.5.2.3.1.1.”  AR at 1539 (emphasis added) .  Consequently, the RFP placed the burden on the offerors to \nprovide the verification of its LET experience by requiring the signature.  This \n                                                 \n4 Centech asserts that it made many “continued” and “substantial,” attempts to get \nthe required signatures.  Pl. Resp. at 2 .  However, the record shows that Centech did not \nbegin seeking signatures from CO s until shortly before bids were due.  For LET 1 -3, \nCentech initiated  its efforts with an email to the Department of Transportation on \nSeptember 28, 2016, only 10 business days before the solicitation closing date.  AR  at \n25612.  A few more emails followed, all sent on the eve of, or just following, the end of the busiest time of year for any Federal Government contracting office.  AR at 25606-12.  With respect to LET 6 -2, the record indicates that Centech started its request for signature \nwith an email dated September 29, 2016; again , on the eve of the end of the fiscal year .  \nAR at 25952.  Thereafter, Centech followed u p with two more emails in early October, \non the eve of the proposal due date.  AR  at 25952-53.  Thus, the record clearly indicates \nthat Centech waited to last the minute to get the required signatures and the Court cannot agree with Centech that its efforts were “substantial.”    \n Case 1:17-cv-02031-EJD   Document 38   Filed 06/01/18   Page 10 of 1111 \n requirement was reasonable.  For instance, Centech provided a number of J.P-3 F orms \nwith its bid .  See AR at  25277-26902.  In addition, the other 169 bidders provided at least \nsome forms.  See, e.g., AR Index, (i dentifying LET forms for bidders included in the \nAR).  If GSA waived the signature requirement  for the LET projects, this would shift  the \nburden onto the CO s to review possibly thousands of contracts performed by the 170 \nbidders and to contact COs for those contracts to obtain those COs’ views as to whether \nthe contracts were “leading edge” under one o r more of 10 categories.  Instead, it was a \nreasonable requirement that bidders prove that they have “leading edge” experience by obtaining signatures from COs on their own contracts.  Thus, GSA reasonably exercised its discretion by requiring the signatures in order to capture the LET points.  \n 3. \n GSA did not act arbitrarily with form over substance.  \nCentech appears to contend that the Agency should have waived the signature \nrequirement .  Pl. Mot. at 3.  Centech argues that by requiring the signatures, signatures \nthat it could not obtain, the Agency put “form over substance.”  Pl. Mot. at 13-15.  This argument must fail.  If GSA waived the signature requirement for Centech, not only \nwould it be contrary to  the RFP signature requirement , it would now be unreasonable and \nunfair to all of the other bidders, some of whom may have complied with the solicitation and not included in their bids past projects that were not verified through CO signatures.  Centech was on notice, and it was clear from the answer and questions , that failure to \ncomply with the Solicitation LET project requirements would be “a material non-\nconformity.”  AR at 1539.  Thus, a bidder who followed the RFP directions would not have included pages in its bid that it knew would be rejected.  The Court, therefore , holds \nthat the Agency did not act arbitrarily when it required that the LET experience projects required the CO’s signature.    \n \nIV. Denial of Permanent Injunctive Relief  \nIn order to establish that it is entitled to permanent injunctive relief, the plaintiff \nmust establish actual success on the merits.  The foregoing analysis reveals that there is no basis upon which to grant Centech’s motion for judgment on the administrat ive \nrecord.  As such, Centech has failed to establish an entitlement to injunctive relief, i.e.,  it \nhas failed to show actual success on the merits.  \nV. Conclusion \n \nFor the reasons set forth above, the Court DENIES  Centech ’s motion for \njudgment on the administrative record and GRANTS  defendant’s cross motion for \njudgment on the administrative record.  The Clerk shall enter judgment accordingly.   \n \nIT IS SO ORDERED. \n         \n        s/ Edward J. Damich    \n        EDWARD J.

    "summary": "1. **Summary:** In this court opinion, the plaintiffs, GovernmentGPT Inc. and Raj Abhyanker, sought a preliminary injunction to prevent Axon Enterprise Inc. from using its Bodycams at political events, citing national security risks due to the inclusion of Quectel chips alleged to be linked to the Chinese Communist Party. The plaintiffs, who are competing in the law enforcement technology space, claimed that the Bodycam could be used for espionage. However, the court denied the motion, finding plaintiffs failed to demonstrate imminent or actual injury, relevant facts to justify the injunction, or a linkage between their antitrust claims and their request for injunctive relief. AI-related elements are involved as GovGPT is a company specializing in AI solutions for law enforcement, and the concern is about potential unauthorized surveillance risks through advanced technology.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue:** The key legal issue is whether the plaintiffs have sufficiently demonstrated the standing and justification for a preliminary injunction against Axon’s Bodycams based on national security concerns stemming from alleged risks posed by Quectel chips.\n\n3. **Court's Holding:** The court denied the plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction due to lack of standing, insufficient evidence of actual or imminent injury, and inability to show a direct relationship between their claims and the requested relief. \n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation:** Imagine if Company A is worried that a gadget from Company B might have computer chips that could spy for a suspicious organization. They go to court asking to stop Company B from using the gadget at important events because they fear spying. The court looked at their reasons and facts, expecting proof of harm and a strong tie to their case. But since Company A couldn't bring enough proof or show direct harm or connection, the court said, \"Nope, we're not stopping Company B from using their gadget.\"",

(“GovGPT”) and Raj \nAbhyanker’s (“Abhyanker”) (collectively, “Plaintiffs”) Motion for Preliminary Injunction \n(Doc. 2).  Axon Enterprise Inc. (“ Defendant ”) filed a response (Doc. 24), to which \nPlaintiffs replied (Doc. 25).  The Court granted Defendant’s request to file a sur -reply (Doc. \n48), which Defendant thereafter filed (Doc.  49).  A scheduling hearing was held on August \n20, 2024 , neither side requested an evidentiary hearing , and both sides submitted the issue \nto the Court on the briefing.  After reviewing the Parties’ briefing and the relevant case \nlaw, the Court will deny Plaintiffs ’ Motion.  \nI. BACKGROUND  \nThis case arises from a series of alleged antitrust and consumer protection \nviolations.  ( See Doc. 1.)  Here, however, Plaintiffs seek a preliminary injunction to prevent \nthe use of Defendant’s Axon Body 4 Cameras (the “Bodycam”) at political events.  (Doc. \n2 at 2 ¶ 3.)  Plaintiffs cite “substantial and imminent national security risks posed by the \ninclusion of Quectel chips in [the Bodycams] . . . which could facilitate espionage and  Case 2:24-cv-01869-SMB     Document 71     Filed 09/18/24     Page 1 of 11 \n- 2 -  \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n interference by the Chinese Communist Party.”  ( Id.) \nThe relevant alleged facts are as follows: GovGPT  is a startup specializing in \nadvanced artificial intelligence solutions for law enforcement, which includes body -worn \ncameras.  (Doc. 1 at 5 –6 ¶ 6.)  One of GovGPT’s flagship products includes a body -worn \ncamera, the DragonFly.  ( Id. at 6 ¶  7.)  The DragonFly  was created, in part, to compete \nwith other comparable items on the market.  ( Id. at 6–7 ¶¶ 7–8.)  However, Defendant’s \nacquisition of several competitors and collaboration with Microsoft Corporation \n(“Microsoft”) have posed significant market entry c hallenges for GovGPT.  ( Id. at 7 ¶  9, \n8–9 ¶ 12–13.)   \nPlaintiffs allege that the Bodycams each contain Quectel chips, which are linked to \nthe Chinese government, and thus the Chinese Communist Party (“CCP”).  ( Id. at 5 ¶  5.)  \nAccording to Plaintiffs, the  presence of the Qu ectel chips “create a risk of unauthorized \naccess and surveillance, compromising the safety and security of both law enforcement \npersonnel and the public. ”  (Id.)  Moreover, Plaintiffs allege that use of the Bodycams at \nhigh-profile events pose significant risks of espionage, ( Id. at 21 ¶  8), and raise concerns \nabout real -time surveillance capabilities such that the CCP could interfere with the \nupcoming elections  in the United States .  (Id. at 22 ¶  9.)  Supporting this contention, \nPlaintiffs cite Federal Communications Commission Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel’s \nSeptember 2023 warning to federal  government agencies regarding national security risks \nposed by Quectel chipsets and a January 2024 Congressional Report with similar warnings \nprovided to U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Auston.   (Id. at 20 ¶ 6.)   Plaintiffs also cite to \na post from the popular online forum , Reddit, in which one user noted concerns about the \nvulnerability of “Quectel modules.”  ( Id. at 20 –21 ¶ 7.) \nAfter Defendant rebuked Plaintiffs attempt to purchase units of the Bodycam while \nposing as a private security company, (Doc. 24 at 8), Plaintiffs purchased four of the \nBodycams from Chinese online marketplace Alibaba.  (Doc. 1 at 24 –25 ¶ 13.)  Upon \ndisass embling one of the Bodycams, Plaintiffs allege that each included a Subscriber \nIdentity Module (“SIM”) card from AT&T, which only operates in the United States, and Case 2:24-cv-01869-SMB     Document 71     Filed 09/18/24     Page 2 of 11 \n- 3 -  \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n “advanced Chinese Quectel real -time streaming chips. ”  (Id. at 25 –26 ¶ 14.)  Plaintiffs \ncontacted Defendant to express concerns about the presence of the Quectel chips.  ( Id. at 26 \n¶ 16.)  During a n investment meeting  with Defendant’s senior leadership, Plaintiffs \nexpressed their security concerns about the Bodycam s.  (Id. at 27–28 ¶¶  17–19.)  Defendant \nallegedly dismissed any security concerns.  ( Id. at 28 ¶  20.) \nIn their Complaint, Plaintiffs ask for declaratory judgment pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \n§§ 2201 and 2202 because  Defendant’s “failure to disclose the presence of Quectel chips \nin its Bodycams poses significant national security risks and constitutes a material omission \nin violation of applicable laws.”  ( Id. at 83 ¶  216.)  Plaintiffs’ Motion seeks an order from \nthe Court to prohibit the use of Bodycams at political events, an order requiring law \nenforcement agencies to use alternative surveillance equipment, an o rder mandating  the \nimplementation of enhanced security protocols at political  events , and an order requiring \nAxon and Microsoft to disclose any and all foreign components used in their products.   \n(See Doc. 2.)   The Court denied Plaintiffs’ request for a TRO (Doc. 23).   The Court held a \nstatus conference on August 20, 2024, did not order a hearing, and took the Motion under \nadvisement.  \nII. LEGAL STANDARDS  \nUnder Federal Rule of Civil Procedure  65, a party may seek injunctive relief if it \nbelieves it will suffer irreparable harm during the pendency of an action.  “A preliminary \ninjunction is ‘an extraordinary and drastic remedy, one that should not be granted unless \nthe movant, by a clear showing, carries the burden of persuasion.’”  Lopez v. Brewer , 680 \nF.3d 1068, 1072 (9th Cir. 2012)  (emphasis omitted)  (quoting Mazurek v. Armstrong , 520 \nU.S. 968, 972 (1997)); see also Winter v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc ., 555 U.S. 7, 24 \n(2008) (“A preliminary injunction is an extraordinary remedy never awarded as of right.”).  \nA plaintiff seeking a preliminary injunction must show that (1) he is likely to \nsucceed on the merits, (2) he is likely to suffer irreparable harm without an injunction, (3) \nthe balance of equities tips in his favor, and (4) an injunction is in the public interest.  \nWinter , 555 U.S. at 20.  “But if a plaintiff can only show that there are ‘serious questions Case 2:24-cv-01869-SMB     Document 71     Filed 09/18/24     Page 3 of 11 \n- 4 -  \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n going to the merits’ —a lesser showing than likelihood of success on the merits —then a \npreliminary injunction may still issue if the ‘balance of hardships tips sharply in the \nplaintiff’s favor,’ and the other two Winter  factors are satisfied.”  Shell Offshore, Inc. v. \nGreenpeace, Inc. , 709 F.3d 1281, 1291 (9th Cir. 2013)  (emphasis omitted)  (quoting All. \nfor the Wild Rockies v. Cottrell , 632 F.3d 1127, 1135 (9th Cir. 2011)).  Under this “serious \nquestions” variant of the Winter  test, “[t]he elements  . . . must be balanced, so that a \nstronger showing of one element may offset a weaker showing of another.”  Lopez , 680 \nF.3d at 1072.  \nIII. DISCUSSION  \nA. Preliminary Injunction  \nPlaintiffs ’ Motion does not directly address the merits of their federal and state \nconsumer protection and antitrust claims.  ( See Doc. 2.)  Instead, it requests this Court to \norder a preliminary injunction based on  “substantial and imminent national security risks \nposed by the inclusion of Quectel chips in Axon Body 4 cameras, which could facilitate \nespionage and interference by the Chinese Communist Party.”  ( Id. at 2 ¶  3.)1 \n“There must be a relationship between the injury claimed in the motion for \ninjunctive relief and the conduct asserted in the underlying complaint. ”  Pac. Radiation \nOncology, LLC v. Queen ’s Med. Ctr. , 810 F.3d 631, 636 (9th Cir. 2015); Brightly v. \nCorizon Health Inc. , No. CV -21-00127 -TUC -JCH, 2022 WL 2646008, at *1 (D. Ariz. July \n8, 2022) (“This relationship is established where the TRO would grant ‘relief of the same \ncharacter as that which may be granted finally.’ Absent such a relationship or nexus, distr ict \ncourts lack authority to grant emergency injunctive relief.”  (citation omitted) ).  Plaintiffs  \nhave not shown how their  antitrust and consumer protection claims are related to their \npersonal  concern about the CCP ’s interference with U.S. national security or  the upcoming \n \n1 Plaintiff utterly fails to present any argument on any of the four factors required for \ninjunctive relief.  As to the likelihood of success factor, Plaintiff merely states that  \n“Plaintiff has demonstrated a substantial likelihood of success on the merits of its claims, \nincluding violations of federal and state consumer  protection and antitrust laws.”  (Doc. 2  \nat 4 ¶  8.)  As to the remaining three factors, Plaintiffs offer rote recitation of the allegations \nin their Complaint without advancing any evidence or substantive argument as to why \ninjunctive relief is appropriate.  ( Id. at 4–5 ¶¶ 8–11.) Case 2:24-cv-01869-SMB     Document 71     Filed 09/18/24     Page 4 of 11 \n- 5 -  \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n 2024 elections.   (See generally Doc. 1.)   Indeed,  Plaintiffs ’ Reply  highlights that this case \nis about GovGPT’s attempt to compete with Axon and not concern about U.S. national \nsecurity.  (Doc. 25 at 8 –9 ¶ 18.)  In their Reply , Plaintiff s maintain that  “GovGPT has faced \nsignificant market entry barriers and reduced revenue opportunities due to Axon ’s \nmonopolistic practices and concealment of material facts .”  (Id.)  The Reply goes on to \ndiscuss the various claims and that the “laws provide private parties the right to seek redress \nfor economic and competitive harms they ha ve suffered, even if indirectly. ”  (Id.)  These \nclaims are related to money , not national security.  Put simply , there is no relationship here \nbetween Plaintiffs ’ antitrust and consumer protection  claims and their requested relief  with \nrespect to espionage and election interference  so as to grant “relief of the same character \nas that which may granted finally.”  Pac. Radiation Oncology , 810 F.3d at 636.   \nConsequently, the Court lacks the authority to grant injunctive relief.  Brightly , No. \nCV-21-00127 -TUC -JCH, 2022 WL 2646008, at *1.  \nB. Lack of Standing  \nDefendant argues that Plaintiffs  lack standing to request a preliminary injunction  \nbecause they cannot establish that law enforcement’s use of the Bodycams has caused, or \nwill cause, them harm.  (Doc. 24 at 11.)  According to Defendant, Plaintiffs’ attempt to \nshow the injury  in fact required for standing rests  on a long chain of speculative fallacies  \nmeant to evince a national security  threat .  (Id.)  In reply, Plaintiffs argue that the “barriers \n[that] have prevented GovGPT from competing fairly . . . lead[] to financial harm.”  (Doc. \n25 at 8 ¶  17.)  Additionally, Plaintiffs argue that GovGPT, Abhyanker, and similarly \nsituated taxpayers and municipalities have experienced “direct and personal injuries due to \nDefendant’s concealment and deception through higher taxes.”  ( Id. ¶ 18.)   \nTo bring a justiciable lawsuit into federal court, Article III of the Constitution \nrequires that a plaintiff have “the core component of standing.”  Lujan v. Defs . of Wildlife , \n504 U.S. 555, 560 (1992).  A plaintiff bears the burden of showing that he has standing for \neach type of relief sought.  Los Angeles v. Lyons , 461 U.S. 95,  105 (1983) .  To seek \ninjunctive relief, a plaintiff must show : Case 2:24-cv-01869-SMB     Document 71     Filed 09/18/24     Page 5 of 11 \n- 6 -  \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n [H]e is u nder threat of suffering “injury in fact” that is concrete and \nparticularized; the threat must be actual and imminent, not conjectural or \nhypothetical; it must be fairly traceable to the challenged action of the \ndefendant; and it must be likely that a favo rable judicial decision will prevent \nor redress the injury.  \nSummers v. Earth Island Inst. , 555 U.S. 488, 493 (2009)  (citation omitted) .  A “speculative \nchain of possibilities” cannot establish an actual or imminent injury in fact.  Clapper v. \nAmnesty Intern. USA, 568 U.S. 398, 41 4 (2013); see also Summers , 555 U.S. at 496 \n(“‘[S]ome day ’ intentions —without any description of concrete plans, or indeed even any \nspecification of when the some day will be —do not support a finding of the ‘actual or \nimminent’ injury that our cases require.”).  \nHere, Plaintiffs allege several injuries .  First, Defendant’s actions have resulted in \nfinancial harm for GovGPT, Abhyanker, and numerous taxpayers.  (Doc. 25 at 8 ¶¶  17–18.)  \nFor Plaintiffs’ requested relief here, the existence of such an injur y is inapposite.  Instead, \nfor injunctive relief to be granted, Plaintiffs must show they suffered an injury in fact with \nrespect to their allegation  that the Quectel chips pose a  “substantial and imminent national \nsecurity risk [] . . . which could facilitate espion age and  interference by the [CCP]. ”  (Doc. \n2 at 2 ¶  3.)  Plaintiffs  argue  that the Bodycams contain Quectel chips ( Doc. 1 at 23 ¶  10; \nDoc. 2 at 2 ¶  3), the chips might give foreign adversaries —like the CCP and Iran —access \nto real -time surveillance  and GPS tacking  (Doc. 1 at 23 –24 ¶¶  10–11; Doc. 2  at 2–4 ¶¶ \n2–6), law enforcement use the Bodycams at political events, and therefore national security \nis at risk  (Doc. 1 at 21–22 ¶ 8, 24 ¶ 12; Doc. 2  at 4 ¶  10).  Plaintiffs claim to have relied on \nPatrick Gibbons and Fred Addy, former law enforcement officers, who allegedly identified \n“national security risks associated with the Quectel LTE” module in the Bodycam.  (Doc. \n25 at 9 –10 ¶ 21; Doc. 25 -1 at 3 ¶  11–13.)  H owever, Plaintiffs do not provide any report or \naffidavit prepared by the alleged experts that show how  the CCP or Iran may commandeer  \nthe Bodycam’s internal components to threaten national security .   \nMoreover, during the pendency of Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction, \ntheir counsel filed a Motion to Seal  allegedly confidential documents containing highly Case 2:24-cv-01869-SMB     Document 71     Filed 09/18/24     Page 6 of 11 \n- 7 -  \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n sensitive information about the Quectel chip s.  (Doc. 43; Doc. 43 -1 at 2 ¶  1.)  In that \nMotion, Plaintiffs ask the Court to appoint a “technical special master” under Federal Rule \nof Civil Procedure 53 to evaluate the allege d “complex technical risks” contained in \nconfidential documents.  (Doc. 43; Doc. 43 -6.)  Plaintiffs provide d a list of “Key \nResponsibilities” for the special master, such as  conducting a “thorough penetration \ntesting” of the Quectel module remote and firmware update process, analyzing ex ploitable \nelements of those mechanisms, and writing “detailed reports to the Court on how these \nvulnerabilit ies could be leveraged to disrupt or gain control over the [Bodycams] .”  (Doc. \n43-6 at 2.)   Additionally,  Plaintiffs  task the Court to find a technical master with “top secret \nclearance” to access classified information related to security concerns.  (Id.)  Here, \nPlaintiffs essentially ask the Court to do their job by searching for and hiring an expert to \nanalyze the Quectel chips to  support Plaintiff s’ claims .  (Doc. 43 at 2 ¶ 3; Doc. 43 -1 at 5 –6 \n¶ 10.)  Their failure to do the testing eviscerates their claim of an actual and imminent \nthreat because they have no reliable allegations.   \nThe weakness of Plaintiffs’ claims is compounded by their failure  to submit  \nevidence that, other than the units  purchased on Alibaba, the Bodycams contain a Quectel \nchip.  ( Doc. 1 at 24 –25 ¶ 13.)  In fact, Defendant disputes the presence of Quectel chips \naltogether.  In his affidavit, Axon Principal Security Engineer David MacDonald  \n(“MacDonald”) states that the Bodycam does not contain any chips designed, developed, \nor manufactured by Quectel.  (Doc. 24 -1 at 3 ¶  3.)  Rather, the chipset “in Quectel’s module  \nis designed, developed, and manufactured by Qaulco mm Technologies, Inc.  \n(“Qualcomm”) , a respected American company.”  ( Id.)  This module, according to \nMacDonald, is distinct from a chip in that it is separate from the Bodycam’s Qualcomm \nprocessor, and therefore, cannot access or decrypt any data stored or streamed on the \nBodycam.  ( Id. ¶ 4.)  Moreover, MacDonald states that the Bodycams do not receive \nOver -The-Air (“OTA”)  updates from carriers or non -Axon sources  and only firmware \ncontaining Axon’s digital signature and certificate are accepted by the Bod ycams .  (Id.)  In \nits sur -reply, Defendant contends that, had Abhyanker removed the faceplate from the Case 2:24-cv-01869-SMB     Document 71     Filed 09/18/24     Page 7 of 11 \n- 8 -  \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n Quectel module, he “would have seen another Qualcomm chip that looks very similar to \nthe one in Plaintiffs’ own images.”  (Doc. 49 at 3 ; Doc. 25 -2 at 8, 12.)   The record  thus \nbelies Plaintiffs’ contention that any Quectel chip exists in the Bodycam.   Plaintiffs also \npeddle unsupported allegations about OTA  and local  firmware updates for the Bodycam.  \nPlaintiffs maintain that updates include code provided by Quectel in Shanghai , China  and \nthat Bodycam’s  user manual shows how such updates are carried out .  (Doc. 25 at 6 –8 \n¶¶ 9–16.)  Not only does MacDonald’s affidavit directly contravene Plaintiffs’ contention  \n(Doc. 24 -1 at 3 ¶  4), the mention of “China,” “Shanghai,” and “Quectel” are absent from \nthe Bodycam’s user manual.   (See Doc. 25 -14.) \nWithou t evidence  of the Bodycams containing the chips , and that the chips are \nsusceptible to hacking , Plaintiffs cannot show that the CCP, Iran, or any other malicious \nactor could  use the Bodycam  to commit any of  the acts Plaintiffs  allege .  Thus , Plaintiffs’ \nconclusion that “there is a clear and imminent threat posed by the use of [the \nBodycams]  . . . in politically sensitive environments” is patently unfounded.  (Doc. 25 at 8 \n¶ 18.)  The Court already noted that no evidence was presented of an actual know n threat.  \n(Doc. 23 at 2.)   Plaintiffs  have not advanced additional evidence to show a  known threat, \nand thus their  allegations remain  a mere  “speculative chain of possibilities” that cannot \nestablish an actual or imminent injury in fact.   Clapper, 568 U.S. at  410; Spokeo, Inc. v. \nRobins , 578 U.S. 330, 339 (2016) (noting that injuries in the abstract do not satisfy the \ninjury prong) .  Because injury, causation, and prevention or redress are all required to \nsatisfy standing, the absence of one precludes invocation federal -court jurisdiction.  See \nWarth v. Seldin , 422 U.S. 490, 498 –99 (1975) (“[T] he standing question is whether the \nplaintiff has ‘alleged such a personal stake in the outcome of the controversy’ as to warrant \nhis invocation of federal -court jurisdiction .” (citation omitted)).  Here, Plaintiffs cannot \nshow they have suffered an injury , thus they fail to  establish the requisite s tanding for their \npreliminary injunction.   See Summers , 555 U.S. at 493.  \nDespite Plaintiffs’ failure to show that they suffered an injury, the Court briefly \ndiscusses both the causation and redress elements of standing.  For causation, Plaintiffs Case 2:24-cv-01869-SMB     Document 71     Filed 09/18/24     Page 8 of 11 \n- 9 -  \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n assert that Defendant’s inaction, i.e., its failure to do disclose the presence of Quectel chips \nin the Bodycams , resulted in their alleged injur ies.  (Doc. 1 at 83 ¶  216; Doc. 25 at 8 ¶  17.)  \nCausation requires a “causal connection between the injury and the conduct complained \nof.”  Lujan , 504 U.S. at 560.  This element is concerned with ensuring that the injury is \n“fairly ... trace[able] to the challenged action of the defendant, and not .  . . th[e] result [of] \nthe independent action of some third party not before the court.”  Id.  As discussed, \nPlaintiffs have not shown that all  Bodycam s contain Quectel chip s.  Even if each Bodycam \ndid contain a Quec tel chip , Plaintiffs have not shown that  malicious actors can hack the \nchips to access sensitive information.  Thus, Plaintiffs cannot show how Defendant’s \nfailure to disclose any danger of Quectel chips to law enforcement caused Plaintiffs’ \nalleged injuries . \nFor redress , Plaintiffs merely state that their claims are “grounded in \nwell-recognized legal principles” entitling them to “seek redress for harms suffered.”  \n(Doc. 25  at 8–9 ¶ 18.)  Redressability means it is “likely” and not “merely speculative” that \nthe plaintiff ’s injury will be remedied by a favorable decision .  Lujan , 504 U.S. at  560–61.  \nPlaintiffs seemingly do not afford much argument as to how a favorable judgment from \nthis Court would ameliorate the alleged “imminent national security risks.”  (Doc. 2 at 2 \n¶ 3; see also Doc. 25.)  Again, Plaintiffs have not established the presence of Quectel chip s \nor the danger resulting therefrom .  Thus, g ranting Plaintiffs ’ injunction would functionally \ndo nothing to protect national securit y, but would conveniently prevent Defendant from \nkeeping its Bodycam on the market . \nUltimately, Plaintiffs cannot establish a single prong of the requirements for Article \nIII standing for the requested relief in their Motion (Doc. 2).  \nC. Defendant’s Request for an Order to Show Cause  \nIn its response to Plaintiffs’ Motion, Defendant’s ask the Court to issue an Order to \nShow Cause as to why Plaintiffs should not be sanctioned for filing a frivolous motion.  \n(Doc. 24 at 14.)  Plaintiffs contend that Defendant’s request is an attempt to in timidate and \nsilence Plaintiffs.  ( Doc. 25 at 11.)  Plaintiffs maintain that their Motion was neither Case 2:24-cv-01869-SMB     Document 71     Filed 09/18/24     Page 9 of 11 \n- 10 -  \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n frivolous nor baseless but is grounded in legitimate security concerns.  ( Id.) \nFederal courts have  certain “inherent powers  . . . to manage their own affairs so as \nto achieve the orderly and expeditious disposition of cases.”   Link v. Wabash R. Co. , 370 \nU.S. 626, 630 –631 (1962) ; Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. v. Haeger , 581 U.S. 101, 107 \n(2017) (reaffirming this principle) . That authority includes “the ability to fashion an \nappropriate sanction for conduct which abuses the judicial process.”  Chambers v. NASCO, \nInc., 501 U.S. 32, 44 –45 (1991).   Legally frivolous or factually misleading filings are \nsanctionable under Rule 11(c).  Ringgold -Lockhart v. C ounty of Los Angeles , 761 F.3d \n1057, 1065 (9th Cir. 2014); Truesdell v. S. Cal. Med. Grp. , 293 F.3d 1146, 1153 (9th Cir. \n2002) (“Plaintiff’s complaint was sanctionable because it was both legally frivolous and \nfactually misleadi ng.”).  \nAs Defendant notes, it is not unusual to issue a show cause order in a nascent case.  \n(Doc. 24 at 15); Oladiran v. Suntrust Mortg ., Inc. , No. CV -09-01471 -PHX -GMS, 2010 \nWL 728993 , at *14 –15 (D. Ariz. Feb. 26, 2010) (issuing a show cause order pursuant to \nRule 11(c)(3) because it the court’s “duty to . . . dispose of clearly frivolous claims as early \nas that may be accomplished ”).  Here, some of Plaintiffs filings are  their Complaint  (Doc. \n1), Emergency Motion for Preliminary Injunction  (Doc. 2) accompanied by additional \nattachments (Doc. 16), a Reply to Defendant’s Motion in Opposition to the Injunction \n(Doc. 25), and a Motion to Seal (Doc. 43)  accompanied by attachments (Doc. 45) .  Absent \nin these filings is any explanation —expert affidavits, reports, or other material evidence —\nof how  the CCP or Iran ian government  may be able compromise national security  by \nhacking  the Bodycams .  Nevertheless, Plaintiffs  filed an “Emergency Motion” on the very \nbasis that national security was at risk  (Doc. 2) .  After the Court found that no known risk \nexisted (Doc. 23), Plaintiffs continued to submit filings with the Court bereft of evidence \nthat would legitimize their claim.  Consequently, the Court will order a show cause hearing \nfor why Rule 11 (c) sanctions should not be imposed against Plaintiffs.  \nIV.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: In X Corp., Inc. v. Bright Data Ltd., X Corp., the owner of a social media platform now known as X, sued Bright Data for data scraping, which allegedly violated contract and other laws. Bright Data counterclaimed, alleging that X Corp.'s new Terms of Service, enacted after its acquisition of Twitter, included unreasonable restraints that violated antitrust laws by preventing competition in the market for publicly available data. The court held that Bright Data's counterclaims were plausible, except for a claim related to fraudulent competition.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether X Corp.'s Terms of Service and practices, which restrict data scraping and impose penalties on entities like Bright Data, constitute unreasonable restraints of trade and monopolization under the Sherman Act.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court denied X Corp.'s motion to dismiss Bright Data's counterclaims under the Sherman Act, as well as related state law claims, finding plausible allegations that X Corp.'s restrictive practices could harm competition. However, the court dismissed Bright Data's claim for fraudulent competition under California’s Section 17200.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine a big playground where everyone comes to talk and share the latest news. A new owner takes over this playground and decides to sell the conversations people are having. They tell everyone that if they talk to anyone else about what's happening on this playground, they can't play in the playground anymore. One company that was sharing this information with others says this isn't fair because it stops people from sharing freely. The court agreed that this might be unfair and allowed the company to continue its complaint, except for one part where it wasn't clear how people were fooled by this playground's rules.",

Now, X aims \nto sell mostly data instead, and it can sell more if it closes off customer s from other sellers.  \nBright Data claims that  X’s Terms of Service now bar anyone  who buys data on X, shares data \nwith X, or just looks at data on X, from ev er doing business with any company like Bright \nData, which scrapes data X does not own fro m webpages X puts on public display.  This \nallegedly hurts competition in th e market for public-squa re data in the United States.  Both \nBright Data and X sell such data to businesses,  academics, and others who use it to discern up-\nto-the-minute insights about  current events.  This or der now recounts the alleged \ntransformation from Twitter into X th at provoked these counterclaims.  \n1. THE FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS . \nIn 2006, Twitter was founded for people to shar e what’s happening in the world and what \npeople are talking about right now.  As Bright Data alleges it, that  focus on “public square user \nengagement” separated Twitter’s platform from  other social media platforms focused on \nmaking professional connections (like LinkedIn) or keeping friendships  (Facebook).  And, that \n“democratized” approach to creating, consumin g, and re-sharing news separated Twitter also \nfrom news services.   \nFew alternative “public square platforms” arose to compete.  Alternatives were limited \nby powerful network effects.  As more users cr eated more content on Tw itter, they attracted \nmore users who did more of the same (and adve rtisers, too), increasing the first platform’s \nvalue beyond what a new entran t could reasonably achieve.  Indeed, even now, alternative \npublic-square platforms are site to  just five percent of active pub lic-square users, compared to \n95 percent on Twitter (now X).  The other pl atforms are primarily Mastodon, Truth Social, \nBluesky, and Threads. \nX Corp. acquired Twitter and renamed it X.  The platform continued on as Twitter had \nbut with some changes, star ting with how it made money. \nJust before acquisition, Twitter had made over 90 percent of its money from ads.  It had \nattracted users to share content — free of charge .  And, it had attracted companies to place ads Case 3:23-cv-03698-WHA     Document 263     Filed 04/18/25     Page 2 of 14 \n3 1 \n2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 \n10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 United States District Court \nNorthern District of Californi a alongside that content — for a charge.  Yes, Twitter had used the public-square data to help its \nplatform moderate feeds and place ads, and so indirectly had profited from the data.  And, \nTwitter had sold some of it directly (addressed next).  But Twitter had not prioritized selling \nthat data as a product for others.   \nIndeed, Twitter had provided an applicati on programming interface (or API) so others \ncould tap into Twitter’s data, charging only for sele ct information or for large quantities.  And, \nTwitter had freely let others crawl and scrape.  Twitter’s Terms of Service expressly had let people use computer automation to access Tw itter’s publicly displayed webpages.  And, \nTwitter’s corporate leadership “[k]new about it” and determined “[i]t was fine” to let others \ncopy the data on those pages — saying “[s]crapi ng was the open secret of Twitter” (¶ 12).\n1 \nBright Data had been one such scraper.  It had copied public data from Twitter and sold it \nto Fortune 500 companies, academic in stitutions, and small businesses.   \nAll that changed after X Corp. acquired Twitt er.  Entrepreneur and Twitter user Elon \nMusk led the acquisition.  He be lieved, it is alleged, that Twitte r was frittering away its most \nvaluable asset — public-square data.  As a co -founder of OpenAI, Musk appreciated data’s \nvalue to artificial intelligence.  OpenAI itself had paid Twitter for data.  Such data would be \nessential to a future AI servic e he envisioned answering questions  about current events as part \nof an “everything app.” “[B]uying Twitter,” he tw eeted, “probably accelerates [this project] by \n3 to 5 years” (¶ 38).  Early in 2022, Musk offere d $44 billion for Twitter.  Later that year, his \ncompany X Corp. completed the acquisition and re named Twitter “X.”  And, in July 2023, he \nfounded xAI, a company that uses X’s data to power an AI chatbot.   \nSo, X Corp. now aimed to exclude scrapers  like Bright Data from scraping X.   \nTo be sure, X Corp. never tried to buy exclus ive rights to the public-square data on X.  It \nlimited its liability (via the Co mmunications Decency Act) by l eaving data ownership with X’s \nusers.  Instead, X Corp. first tried putting X’s webpages behind logins and therefore beyond \nscrapers.  But this caused user ac tivity on X to crater.  Into this  breach came Threads, a rival \n \n1   Citations to paragraphs are to the count erclaims (Dkt. No. 168), unless otherwise stated. Case 3:23-cv-03698-WHA     Document 263     Filed 04/18/25     Page 3 of 14 \n4 1 \n2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 \n10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 United States District Court \nNorthern District of Californi a that threatened to use public  pages to prompt engagement.  X Corp. put X’s pages back on \npublic display. \nSo, X Corp. next changed X’s Terms of Servic e.  That allegedly did the trick.  Bright \nData now assails four unreasonable restraints in these terms (¶ 153).2  \nFirst and Second , the terms for crawling and scraping changed.  Recall that crawling was \npreviously expressly permitted, and scraping previously consente d to.  Now, both crawling and \nscraping became newly pr ohibited absent written  consent not forthcoming.  To be specific, the \nterms changed:  \n from  “crawling the Services is per missible if done in accordance \nwith the provisions of the robot s.txt file, howev er, scraping the \nServices without our prior cons ent is expressly prohibited” \n(robots.txt permitted craw ling logged-off pages) ( see ¶ 68 \n(incorporating X’s Terms of Se rvice as of May 18, 2023); Br. \nExh. 3 at 47 (exhibiting that version)), \n to “crawling or scraping the Servi ces in any form, for any purpose \nwithout our prior written consen t is expressly prohibited” ( see \n¶ 69 (incorporating X’s Terms of Service as of September 29, \n2023); Br. Exh. 2 at 30 (exhi biting that version)). \nThird , the above had impact also because of a newly stated term ba rring facilitation of \nany violation, and so barri ng facilitation of crawling and scraping.  It stated: \n “It is also a violation of  these Terms to facilitate or assist others in \nviolating these Terms, includi ng by distributing products or \nservices that enable or encourag e violation of these Terms” (¶ 92 \n(quoting X’s Terms of Service); see Br. Exh. 2 at 30 (X’s Terms \nof Service as of September 29, 2023) (containing term); Br. Exh. \n1 at 11 (November 15, 2024) (same)). \nFourth , a new term was added imposing liqui dated damages for any violation:  \n “You further agree that, to the exte nt permitted by applicable law, \nif you violate the Terms, or you i nduce or facilitat e others to do \nso, in addition to all other legal remedies available to us, you will be jointly and severally liable to us for liquidated damages as follows for requesting, viewing, or accessing more than 1,000,000 \nposts (including reply posts, vi deo posts, image posts, and any \nother posts) in any 24-hour  period - $15,000 USD per 1,000,000 \nposts. You agree that these amounts  are (i) a reasonable estimate \n \n2   Bright Data’s counterclaims incorporate by reference X’s Terms of  Service in use at the various \ntimes cited.  Bright Data sometimes skips over ph rases in the passages it excerpts.  Those phrases \nare included here for completeness, with citation s to X Corp.’s exhibits being to the relevant \nversion of X’s terms and to th e blue pagination impr inted by ECF (Dkt. No. 165-1 (“Br. Exhs.”)).

You further agree that repeated \nviolations of these Terms will irreparably harm and entitle us to injunctive and/or other equitable re lief, in addition to monetary \ndamages” ( see ¶ 83 (incorporating X’s Te rms of Service as of \nNovember 15, 2024); Br. Exh. 1 at 13 (exhibiting that version)). \nBright Data alleges that this  liquidated damages provision amount s to one cent and a half per \npost, or “1400% higher” than the about one-ten th of a cent per post that X charges its API \ncustomers.  X Corp., it is alleged, knows the amount imposed departs wildly from any actual \ndamages, and wields it as  a “cudgel” (¶¶ 86–87).   \nBright Data alleges the above terms restrain competition.  X Corp. uses the terms and the \nthreat of attempting to enforce them to frigh ten prospects and restrain customers from doing \nbusiness with scrapers like Bright Data.  And, “as a matter of commercia l reality,” that is \nenough to let X Corp. “effectively control prices, exclude competition, and exercise substantial \nmonopoly power” in the public-squa re data market (¶ 96).  \nAdditionally , Bright Data alleges that X Corp. ha s frustrated the growth of rival public-\nsquare platforms, and so the gr owth of alternative supplies for rival public-square data sellers \nlike Bright Data.  Whenever an X user clicks  on a link appearing on X but pointing to a rival \npublic-square platform (like Bluesky), X “throttle s” the user’s connection to that new page, \nprompting some users to give up and go back to X (some transfers take up to 60 times longer, \nand research shows one user gives up for every three in such a situa tion) (¶¶ 107–08).  X also \nburies posts that include such links  — so fewer users see them at all.  The sole purpose is to \nstall competition.   \n2. T\nHE LEGAL CLAIMS AND IMMEDIATE PROCEDURE . \nFrom these factual allegati ons, Bright Data asserts va rious counterclaims.   \nBright Data alleges the exis tence of product mark ets for public-square user engagement, \npublic-square platforms, public-square data, and (as a submarket within  the latter) publicly \navailable public-square data (fro m publicly displayed webpages).  But the allegations and this \norder focus on the public-square data market.  Br ight Data asserts geogr aphic markets in the \nUnited States and worldwide. Case 3:23-cv-03698-WHA     Document 263     Filed 04/18/25     Page 5 of 14 \n6 1 \n2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 \n10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 United States District Court \nNorthern District of Californi a For each of those markets, Bright Data then alleges unreasonable restraints of trade under \nthe Sherman Act’s Section 1 (Claim I) and m onopolization or attemp ts under Section 2 \n(Claims II–III), as well as anal ogous claims under the antitrust la ws of California and Texas \n(Claims IV, VII) and the still-broader trade prac tices laws of California and Nevada (Claims \nV–VI).  Finally, Bright Data al leges tortious interference with customer relationships under the \ncommon laws of these various  states (Claim VIII). \nX Corp. moves to dismiss these counterclaim s for failure to state a claim under Rule \n12(b)(6).  Alternatively, it moves to stay discovery or bifurcate proceedings related to them.   \nThis order follows full briefing and argument.   \nANALYSIS \n1. SHERMAN ACT SECTION 1. \nSection 1 of the Sherman Act provides:  “Every  contract, combination in the form of trust \nor otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of tr ade or commerce among the several States, or with \nforeign nations, is declared to be illegal.”  Th e phrase “restraint of trade” means “unreasonable \nrestraint.”  Standard Oil Co. of N. J  v. United States , 221 U.S. 1, 54, 60–62 (1911).  Therefore, \nThe true test of legality is whethe r the restraint imposed is such as \nmerely regulates, and perhaps thereby promotes, competition, or \nwhether it is such as may suppress or even destroy competition. To determine that questi on, the court must ordi narily consider the \nfacts peculiar to the business to which the restraint is applied; its condition before and after the rest raint was imposed; the nature of \nthe restraint and its effect, actual or probable. The history of the \nrestraint, the evil believed to ex ist, the reason for adopting the \nparticular remedy, the purpose or en d sought to be attained, are all \nrelevant facts. This is not because a good intention will save an otherwise objectionable regulati on or the reverse, but because \nknowledge of intent may help the court to interpre t facts and to \npredict consequences. \nChicago Bd. of Trade v. United States , 246 U.S. 231, 238 (1918); accord Twin City Sportserv., \nInc. v. Charles O. Finley & Co. , 676 F.2d 1291, 1303–04 & n.9 (9th Cir. 1982).  Here, Bright \nData alleges that X’s Terms of Service — impos ed on X’s data buyers (and all X’s users) — \nviolate the rule of reason because they prev ent all of X’s customers from doing business with \nscrapers like Bright Data and so preempt competition for sales into a massive share of the \nmarket for public-square data in the United States. Case 3:23-cv-03698-WHA     Document 263     Filed 04/18/25     Page 6 of 14 \n7 1 \n2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 \n10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 United States District Court \nNorthern District of Californi a First , Bright Data alleges a plausible product and geographic market:  sales of public-\nsquare data in the United States.  Not all data drives all engines.  Th e data here emerges from \nreal-time, multi-side d, public conversations a bout current events, such as conversations on X.  \nOnce that data is scraped and packaged for sa le, it becomes a unique input for customers who \nuse it to power up-to-the-minute insights into current events and people’s sent iments about \nthem.  Fortune 500 companies pay for that data  to drive decisions; ar tificial intelligence \ncompanies pay for that data to drive services, li ke chatbots that answer  questions about what’s \nhappening (not all can).  Other data is no substi tute.  Data from traditi onal news organizations \nis not as social, for instance, wh ile data from social networks se rving professionals or friends is \nnot as newsy.  Bright Data also plausibly alle ges relevant geographic bounds.  The supplies of \nsuch public-square data and the uses to whic h buyers put it — and the places of sale — \nplausibly cluster in political geogr aphies, such as the United States. \nSecond , Bright Data alleges that X’s exclus ionary contracts pl ausibly foreclose \ncompetition for selling into a subs tantial share of this market.  Recall that, when Bright Data’s \nfocus on selling data began, Twitter was focuse d on selling ads.  No more.  After the \nacquisition, X Corp. shifted to se lling data and sought to exclude  scrapers from this market.  \nThe main allegation is that X Corp. did so by transforming X’s Terms of Service, foisting a \nnew exclusionary agreement upon nearly all prospective buyers of public-square data. \nThe agreement is exclusionary, as plausibly al leged.  It contains an anti-“facilitation” \nterm that bars X’s data customers (or any X user) from ever buyi ng from a business that \nscrapes the public-square data X does not own fr om the webpages X publicly displays.  The \nagreement also contains a “liq uidated damages” term that th reatens otherwise daring traders \ninto submission.  It is plausible that no pros pect browse-wrapped by such an agreement will \nbuy from Bright Data or from any other scrape r according to the co mmercial realities \n(examined further below) (¶ 95).   \nAnd, this exclusionary agreemen t forecloses customers across  a substantial share of the \nmarket, plausibly.  Recall X’s Te rms purport to browsewrap all of  X’s users and data buyers.  \nAllegedly, nearly 100 percent of those who want to buy the kinds of public-square data that X Case 3:23-cv-03698-WHA     Document 263     Filed 04/18/25     Page 7 of 14 \n8 1 \n2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 \n10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 United States District Court \nNorthern District of Californi a and Bright Data offer — be they  individuals, corporate entities, or otherwise — at some point \nvisit X (or buy data from X) (¶ 90).  So it is plausible that nearly 100 percent of any market \nmeasure is likewise covered by these agreements  (by share of customer s, data volumes, or \ndollars).   \nThe contract’s anticompetitive effects cannot be evaded by choos ing not to scrape, either.  \nAn alleged 95 percent of public-square user enga gement takes place on X, so a similar share of \nthe public-square data emerging from such e ngagement is on X, too (¶¶ 137–40).   \nNor can the effects be waited out.  Customer s cannot readily leave X’ s agreement.  Those \nwho want to keep using X just to tweet are st uck with it.  And, those who more specifically \nwant to buy data from the priv ately displayed pages (not ava ilable from scrapers) are stuck \nbuying any data they want from th e publicly displayed pages also from X (despite such data \nbeing available from other seller s).  But there’s a more fundam ental reason none can escape the \nrelevant provisions, purportedly:  “For th e avoidance of doubt, [X’s] Terms survive the \ndeactivation or termination of [any user’s] account” ( see Br. Exh. 1 at 11–12 (X’s Terms of \nService as of Nov. 15, 2024)).  And, because of network effects and thro ttling, other spots for \npublic-square engagement and data flowing from it will not appear to sa ve the day, either.   \nIn sum, these contracts impair the competitive process, or so it is plausibly alleged.   \nFinally , X Corp.’s proposed justification for the re straint is plausible,  too, at least as \nargued by X Corp.  That purported purpose is to prevent free riding on X’s investment by \nallowing X alone to profit from the data it aggregates there.  Perhaps so.  But, at this stage, \nthose asserted benefits cannot be said to justify the alleged harm s to competition.  For example, \nis the free ride on X’s servers from scrapers like Bright Data a little burde nsome or a lot?  “X \nincurs no real burden in responding to scrapers’ server requests” (¶ 16) .  We must credit that \nallegation here.  We must also credit the allegati ons that Twitter built it s platform in the main \nbefore X imagined this payout. \nNone of X Corp.’s more specific case citations  or counterarguments pe rsuade otherwise.   \nIndeed, in the case X Corp. represents as  “most analogous to our case” (Mar. 27, 2025 \nTr. 26), “there [we]re no allegations in the complaint to support [a vertical foreclosure] theory:  Case 3:23-cv-03698-WHA     Document 263     Filed 04/18/25     Page 8 of 14 \n9 1 \n2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 \n10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 United States District Court \nNorthern District of Californi a the complaint d[id] not address or desc ribe the API terms of use at all.”  Crowder v. LinkedIn \nCorp. , No. 22-cv-00237-HSG, 2023 WL 2405335, at *5 (N.D. Cal. Mar. 8, 2023) (Judge \nHaywood Gilliam, Jr.).  The distri ct court went on to speculate about the terms only to guide \namendment.  In that context, it said the part ies did not yet seem to “allege that the terms \nprevent[ed] [data customers] from dealing with compet[ing data sellers]. ”  There was no clear \naccount for how limiting access to th e data interfered with co mpetitive mechanisms in any \nmarket.   \nThe case X Corp. points to as it s next best offers no better gui dance.  Put aside that the \nplaintiff there failed to effect ively allege a product market.  hiQ Labs, Inc. v. LinkedIn Corp. , \n485 F. Supp. 3d 1137, 1149 (N.D. Cal. 2020) (Judge Ed ward Chen).  The pl aintiff furthermore \n“failed to explain how LinkedIn was able to coerce its members” — throu gh contracts or \nhijinks — “to boycott hiQ’s or other comp anies’ people analytics services.”  Id. at 1154.  Our \ncounterclaims do not suffe r these defects.  (Arguments about  the sufficiency of the markets \nalleged here are addressed belo w in the part on Section 2.) \nOther cases X Corp. relies on to attack the above allegations suffer the same defects as \nthese first two cases.  Some involved a failure to  allege the purported anticompetitive terms at \nissue.  E.g., Aerotec Int’l, Inc. v.  Honeywell Int’l, Inc. , 836 F.3d 1171, 1181 (9th Cir. 2016) \n(“Aerotec failed to provide a ny significant details about th e repair agreements between \nHoneywell and the airlin es.”).  Others involved a failure to explain how the incumbent, beyond \nblocking its members from competing with it, was able to coerce its members from doing \nbusiness with competitors.  E.g., CREXi’s Opp., CoStar Grp. v. Com. Real Est. Exch. Inc. , No. \nCV 20-8819-CBM(ASx) (C.D. Cal. Sept. 13, 2021), Dkt. No. 86 (CREXi argued that “CoStar \nconditions access to its websites, and brokers ’ own [CoStar]-hosted websites, on [CoStar’s] \nusers’ agreement not to compete with CoSt ar,” not on their agreement not to buy from \nCoStar’s competitors); CoStar Grp. , 619 F. Supp. 3d 983, 991 (C.D. Cal. 2022) (Judge \nConsuelo Marshall)  (“CoStar blocking CREXi from [CoS tar’s] websites does not forbid \nbrokers from hiring CREXi”); Sambreel Holdings LLC v. Facebook, Inc. , 906 F. Supp. 2d \n1070, 1078 (S.D. Cal. 2012) (Judge Cathy Ann Bencivengo) (“[T]h e Complaint lacks Case 3:23-cv-03698-WHA     Document 263     Filed 04/18/25     Page 9 of 14 \n10 1 \n2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 \n10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 United States District Court \nNorthern District of Californi a factually-supported allegations th at implicate the impact of Face book’s actions with respect to \nanything that occurs outsid e of Facebook . . . .”); FTC v. Qualcomm Inc. , 969 F.3d 974, 1002–\n05 (9th Cir. 2020) (no license, no chips, but no co ercion — and same for vol ume discounting).     \nFinally, X Corp. emphasizes that  it may refuse to deal with  anyone, any way it chooses.  \nBut X Corp. is doing more than me rely refusing to deal with scra pers.  X Corp. is forcing its \nown customers not to deal with scrapers, in perpetuity, a much different problem under the \nSherman Act.  Relatedly, X Corp. argues that the Supreme Court in Trinko  held that “when \nthere is another source of law that addresses the competitive concerns at issue, courts should \ntread carefully before grafting antitrust remedies on top,” X Co rp. proposes that the Copyright \nAct is a source of law that already addresses th e anticompetitive concerns at issue here because \nit preempts enforcement under stat e law of “anti-[copy]i ng restrictions” as to material for \nwhich X lacks copyright, and X Cor p. therefore concludes “that our contract[ ] trying to restrict \npeople from stealing [what we do not own under c opyright] is [not] an antitrust violation” \n(Mar. 27, 2025 Tr. 47–48).  But this takes Trinko too far.  Of course the antitrust laws still \napply to anticompetitive conduc t and self-help in the shadow s of the Copyright Act.  E.g., \nFashion Originators’ Guild of Am. v. FTC , 312 U.S. 457, 464 (1941).  To  the extent copyright-\nrelated concerns come into play at all in our antitrust counterclaims, t hose concerns will be \nfactually sensitive, and under the rule of r eason we cannot now decide they overtake or \noutweigh the alleged harms to competition.   \nX Corp.’s motion to dismiss Bright Data’s Section 1 counterclaim is DENIED . \n2. SHERMAN ACT SECTION 2. \nFor similar reasons, Bright Da ta’s counterclaims also stat e a plausible cl aim for relief \nfrom monopolization and m onopoly attempts.  Indeed, even wher e vertical foreclosure theories \nhave not prevailed under Sec tion 1, monopolization theories i nvolving the same conduct have \non occasion been sustained under Section 2.  E.g., United States v. Dentsply Int’l, Inc. , 399 \nF.3d 181, 197 (3d Cir. 2005).  It is too soon to reject these out of hand here.   \nX Corp.’s insistence that Bright Data must alle ge the relevant market more specifically to \nestablish market power is well- taken, but it demands too much for purposes of pleading.  Case 3:23-cv-03698-WHA     Document 263     Filed 04/18/25     Page 10 of 14 \n11 1 \n2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 \n10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 United States District Court \nNorthern District of Californi a For one thing, Bright Data alleges direct ev idence of X Corp.’s power over price (¶ 133–\n34, 141).  X Corp.’s arguments about  the failure to de fine the market needed to establish \ncircumstantial evidence of the sa me thing thus lack force.   \nFor another thing, Bright Data does allege circumstantial eviden ce supporting a market \nand the shares within it.  X Corp.’s main counte rargument in this connec tion is that scrapers \ncompose some material portion of those selling public-s quare data, and thus that X’s share of \nthat marketplace is much smaller than supposed (B r. 23).  But this, too, misses key allegations.  \nAgain, accepting the allegations as true, the releva nt metric is that X’s exclusionary contracts \nblanket nearly the entire base  of customers that any rival could sell to — which plausibly \ncreates a dangerous possibility of  monopolization of the public-squa re data market even if the \nstarting share in the market is more modest than Bright Data’s allegations  make it seem (which \nwe must credit as true here).  X Corp.’s broade r counters in this connect ion also fail.  That X \ncompetes with companies “that enable people to create and shar e ideas” — ultimately with all \ncompanies that require “people’s attention and [ ] adve rtiser’s budgets” — tells us little about \nthe narrowest plausibly drawn market that matt ers for antitrust purposes  at the pleading stage.3  \nBright Data has plau sibly alleged that public-square platforms  are not reasonably \ninterchangeable with all social media platform s (nor all news sites), and also that the public-\nsquare data  aggregated there is not reasonably interchangeable w ith other data.  If other \nplatforms or data are in fact closer substitu tes (or more competitively disciplining) than \ncontended, such “factual testing [wi ll be] by summary judgment or trial.”  Newcal Indus., Inc. \nv. Ikon Off. Sol. , 513 F.3d 1038, 1045 (9th Cir. 2008). \nRecall Bright Data alleges two other markets.   X Corp.’s objections as to both are well-\ntaken, but premature.  Regarding the public-square user engagement market , which is alleged \nto be for the user inputs into public-square  platforms, X Corp. ar gues that “no factual \nallegations distinguish” that ma rket from the public-square plat form market (Reply 11 n.8).  \n \n3   The quotes come from a Tw itter securities fi ling pre-dating the alleged conduct that X Corp. \ncites to support that X comp etes in broad markets (Br. 18–19), and that Bright Data’s \ncounterclaims cited to support that X has narrower characteristics (¶ 113) .  Twitter, Inc., Annual \nReport (Form 10-K), at 8 (Feb. 17, 2021).  Case 3:23-cv-03698-WHA     Document 263     Filed 04/18/25     Page 11 of 14 \n12 1 \n2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 \n10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 United States District Court \nNorthern District of Californi a Not quite.  Bright Data alleges a market for the input side and for the out put side, as well as \nfactually alleged reasons why firms that compete on both front s at once may be disciplined \nmost effectively, if at all, by others doing the same (including because of  cross-side effects and \ncost structure).  Whether these market contours in  fact matter for compet ition, specifically with \nregard to the conduct alleged here, is better assessed on a factual record.  And, regarding the \npublicly available public-square data market , X Corp. tries the same argument (Br. 21 n.14).  \nBut here X Corp. itself readily recognizes (a t 19) a factual allega tion distinguishing the \nproposed submarket.  And, at least some of Brig ht Data’s claims agai n plausibly allege how \nthat distinction makes a differenc e in the compet itive dynamics.  See Newcal Indus. , 513 F.3d \nat 1045 (stating factors including distinct production, vendors, a nd price sensitivities).   \nAlso recall Bright Data alleged other theo ries of anticompetiti ve conduct.  X Corp. \ncontends, however, that, whether characterized as exclusive dealing or  monopoly leveraging or \nsomething else, the allegations amount to the same thing “repackaged” (Br. 12).  If so, that \ncritique is not fatal here.  And, because Bright Data’s alle gations about X’s throttling are \nbound up by that same packaging, not brought as some “stand-alone claim” for which its \nstanding would be suspect, this order will not discard them yet ( see Opp. 14, 22 & n.16).   \nX Corp.’s motion to dismiss Bright Data’s Section 2 counterclaims is DENIED . \n3. STATE ANTITRUST LAWS. \nX Corp. offers no other reason to dismiss the state-law antitrust claims (Br. 23) — \nconceding they “mirror[ ] the analysis under federal law.”  Cnty. of Tuolumne v. Sonora Cmty. \nHosp. , 236 F.3d 1148, 1160 (9th Cir. 2001).  While this order questions the wisdom of Bright \nData pressing multiple, parallel theories where it seems one will do and re sources (on all sides) \nare limited, X Corp.’s motion to dismiss Br ight Data’s state-la w counterclaims is DENIED . \n4. CALIFORNIA SECTION 17200. \nBecause Bright Data states a claim for a violat ion of the antitrust laws, it states a claim \nfor unlawful and unfair competition under California’s Section 17200.  Cel-Tech Commc’ns., \nInc. v. L.A. Cellular Tel. Co. , 973 P.2d 527, 539–40, 544 (Cal. 1999). Case 3:23-cv-03698-WHA     Document 263     Filed 04/18/25     Page 12 of 14 \n13 1 \n2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 \n10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 United States District Court \nNorthern District of Californi a Bright Data further alleges a claim for fraudulent  competition under Ca lifornia’s Section \n17200.  That claim is premised on two possi ble fraudulent course s of conduct.   \nFirst , it is premised  on X Corp.’s alleged misrepresentati ons about how well its platform \nspirits users away to anywhere, even to its ri vals’ platforms — when really it stops them in \ntheir tracks whenever users cl ick on a link to rival platfo rms.  But assuming such \nmisrepresentations were made, it is not clear how those misrepresentations were directly relied \nupon by Bright Data or Br ight Data’s customers sufficiently to estab lish standing under the \ndemanding standards of Sec tion 17200 in the wake of Kwikset Corp. v. Superior Ct. , 246 P.3d \n877 (Cal. 2011). \nSecond , it is alternatively premised on X Cor p.’s alleged misrepresentations about the \nenforceability of the liquidated damages clause .  This clause may (or may not) end up doing \nmuch work in the antitrust context.  There, as alleged, it plausibly raises rivals’ costs even if no \ncustomer believes it enforceable because frivolous threats still create commercial frictions.  \nBut it is hard to see how this term alone can shoulder a claim under the fraudulent conduct \nprovision of Section 17200 — because, as allege d, this facially impr oper term would not \nplausibly deceive the sophisticated buyers of the data at issue.  Lavie v. Procter & Gamble Co. , \n105 Cal. App. 4th 496, 512 (2003).  And, to the extent  it still deceives the broader public that \ndoes not go on to buy from Bright Data, the above standing point again applies.   \nIn sum, Bright Data’s count erclaims for relief from unlawful and unfair competition \nunder Section 17200 are sustained.  The mo tion to dismiss as to them is DENIED .   But Bright \nData’s counterclaims for relief from fraudul ent competition cannot be sustained, and the \nmotion to dismiss as to them is GRANTED . \n5. TORTIOUS INTERFERENCE . \nThe alleged facts, accepted as true, make reasonably probable that more than one \nprospective economic advantage would have been  realized by Bright Da ta but for X Corp.’s \ninterference.  See Soil Retention Prods., Inc. v. Brentwood Indus., Inc. , 521 F. Supp. 3d 929, \n961 (S.D. Cal. 2021) (Judge Roger Benitez).   Case 3:23-cv-03698-WHA     Document 263     Filed 04/18/25     Page 13 of 14 \n14 1 \n2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 \n10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 United States District Court \nNorthern District of Californi a X Corp. argues Bright Data should have alle ged which of its specific customer contracts \nX Corp.’s alleged conduct has affected.  When  X Corp. itself brought th e same claim against \nBright Data, it identified its affected custom ers as, for example, “paying customers [who] \nlawfully access certain categories of X dat a” (Dkt. No. 36 ¶ 48).  And, it argued those \npleadings sufficed to “describe[ ] the contracts”  and the “group of people who were parties to \nthem” (Dkt. No. 48 at 20 (quoting Byton N. Am. Co. v. Breitfeld , No. CV 19-10563-DMG \n(JEMx), 2020 WL 3802700, at *6 (C.D. Cal. Apr.  28, 2020) (Judge Dolly Gee)).  Recognizing \nthe problem here, X Corp. now proposes that Br ight Data should not benefit from the same \nstandard because Bright Data knows its own cust omers.  That was true for X Corp., too.  \nX Corp.’s motion to dismiss Bright Data’s  tortious interfere nce counterclaim is DENIED . \n6. MOTION TO STAY OR BIFURCATE . \nX Corp.’s motion to stay or bifurcate disc overy on the counterclaims, which overlaps \nwith discovery on the affirmative defenses  and other issues in this case, is DENIED .   \nCONCLUSION \nThe counterclaims are sustained, except fo r the claim of fraudulen t competition under \nCalifornia’s Section 17200.   \nIT IS SO ORDERED.  \nDated:  April 18, 2025.  \n  \nWILLIAM ALSUP \nUNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE  \nCase 3:23-cv-03698-WHA     Document 263     Filed 04/18/25     Page 14 of 14",

    "summary": "1. **Summary:**\n   PredictiveIQ LLC filed a motion for a preliminary injunction against the United States government after being excluded from a contract award by the United States Air Force under the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Program's Commercial Solutions Opening (CSO). The court denied the motion, ruling that PredictiveIQ did not sufficiently demonstrate the likelihood of success on the merits or irreparable harm. The case involves AI/ML technologies, as PredictiveIQ argued about competitive disadvantages concerning its AI/ML solutions and the fast-paced evolution of such technologies.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue:**\n   Whether the Air Force's decision to override the Competition in Contracting Act (CICA) stay provisions, allowing certain awards to proceed despite PredictiveIQ's protest, was lawful and whether PredictiveIQ demonstrated the necessary elements for a preliminary injunction.\n\n3. **Court's Holding:**\n   The court held that PredictiveIQ did not meet the burden of proof required for a preliminary injunction, failing to show a likelihood of success on the merits or irreparable harm. The balance of equities and public interest also weighed against granting the injunction, especially given the unique nature of the SBIR Program with its broad discretion in procurement.\n\n4. **ELI5 explanation:**\n   Imagine there's a big contest where small businesses can create new tech for the Air Force. PredictiveIQ didn't win, and they asked the court to pause other winners from starting their projects, saying they'd miss out on good opportunities. The court checked if PredictiveIQ's complaint might succeed and if they'd really be harmed. The court decided \"no\" on both counts, saying PredictiveIQ wasn’t likely to win the complaint and they wouldn't suffer enough without the pause. Plus, the other projects would help many companies and the Air Force, so it was better to let them continue.",

For the reasons \ndiscussed below, the Court denies plaintiff’s Motion.    \nI. Background \n \nThis case involves a post-award bid protest of awards made under the United States \nDepartment of the Air Force’s (“Air Force” or “Agency”) Commercial Solutions Opening \n(“CSO”) Direct -To-Phase- II X23.4 seeking commercial technologies “to create new Air Force \nsolutions or potential new capabilities to help fulfill Agency requirements, close capability gaps, or provide potential technological advancements.”  Complaint at 5, ECF No. 1 [hereinafter Compl.].   The CSO contemplated award of up to 104 Small Business Innovation Research \n(“SBIR”) Program contracts  under two topics: Top ic AFX234 -DCSO1 – Orbital Prime ISAM: \nIn-Space Servicing Assembly and Manufacturing Direct- To-Phase II SBIR (“Orbital Prime  \nISAM Topic ”) and Topic AFX234 -DCSO2 – Direct -to-Phase-II Call for Innovative \nDefense- Related Dual -Purpose Technologies/Solutions wi th a Clear Air Force Stakeholder Need \n(“Open Topic”).   Id.  Unlike more traditional government contracts, a SBIR solicitation “is not \nbased on design or performance specifications for existing equipment, but rather emphasizes Case 1:23-cv-00545-LAS   Document 33   Filed 07/21/23   Page 1 of 5- 2 - \n scientific and technological innovation and has as its objective the development of new \ntechnology.”   Squire Sols., Inc., B-419477.2, 2021 CPD ¶ 229 at 5 (Comp. Gen. June 10, 2021).  \nOn January 20, 2023, the Agency informed plaintiff that it was not an awardee  under the \nOrbital Prime ISAM Topic .  Compl. at 6.  Plaintiff filed a protest with GAO challenging the \ninitial evaluation and award.  Id.   Afterwards, the Agency took corrective action and ultimately \nmade a new award decision, again excluding plaintiff as an awardee.  Id.   On April 3, 2023, \nplaintiff filed a second GAO protest.  Id .  Shortly thereafter, the Agency notified plaintiff that it \nwas staying the awarded contracts.  Id.  at 7.  On April 12, 2023, the Agency stated that “while \nthe Air Force initially stayed all awards made under CSO AFX234-DCSO1, the Air Force is now \nlifting the stay on certain awards that would not affect, or would not be affected by, a scenario in which [plaintiff’s] proposal would be awarded.”  Id .  The Agency stated that it lifted the \nCompetition in Contracting Act (“CICA”) stay on certain awards because CICA did not apply, thus, negating the need for an override.  Id.   However, the Agency kept in place a voluntary stay \nof performance on the 29 th and 30th ranked Orbital Prime  ISAM Topic funding agreements.  See \nDefendant’s Motion to Dismiss and Response to Plaintiff’s Motion for Preliminary Injunction, ECF No. 20 at 14  [hereinafter Def.’s Resp.].   \n \nOn April 20, 2023, plaintiff filed its Complaint and a motion for preliminary injunction.  \nSee generally Compl.; Plaintiff’s Motion for Preliminary Injunction, ECF. No 2 [hereinafter Pl.’s Mot. for PI ].  On May 6, 2023, defendant filed a response to plaintiff’s Motion for Preliminary \nInjunction.  See generally Def.’s Resp.  On May 9, 2023, the Court held Oral Argument.  The parties have fully briefed plaintiff’s Motion for Preliminary Injunction, and it is  ripe for review.  \n \nII. Discussion  \n \nPreliminary injunctions are “extraordinary and drastic remed[ies] . . . that should not be \ngranted unless the movant, by a clear showing, carries the burden of persuasion.”  Mazurek v. Armstrong , 520 U.S. 968, 972 (1997) ( internal citation omitted).  “When determining whether to \ngrant a preliminary injunction, the Court considers: ( 1) whether the movant has a reasonable \nlikelihood of success on the merits, (2) whether the movant will suffer irreparable harm if an injunction is not granted, (3) whether the balance of hardships tips in the movant’ s fav or, and (4) \nwhether the public interest is best served by an injunction.”  LS3, Inc. v. United States , 163 Fed. \nCl. 1, 8 (2022) (citing Winter v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 22 (2008)). “No single factor is determinative, and the weakness of the showing regarding one factor may be overborne by the strength of the others.”  Munilla Constr. Mgmt., LLC v. United States , 130 Fed. Cl. 131, \n135 (2016) (internal citations omitted).  However, at the same time, “the absence of an adequate showing with regard to any one factor may be sufficient, given the weight or lack of it assigned [to] the other factors, to justify . . . denial.”  Id . (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting \nChrysler Motors Corp. v. Auto Body Panels of Ohio, Inc., 908 F.2d 951, 953 (Fed. Cir. 1990)).  For the reasons stated below, the Court finds preliminary injunctive relief inappropriate in this case.  \n \nFirst, the Court finds that plaintiff has not demonstrated that it is likely to succeed on the \nmerits.  Plaintiff alleges that the Air Force violated the statutory requirements of CICA because (1) CICA applies to the CSO  and (2) the Air Force is not complying with CICA’s automatic stay \nrequirements  under 31 U.S.C. § 3553.  See Plaintiff’s Memorandum in Support of Motion for Case 1:23-cv-00545-LAS   Document 33   Filed 07/21/23   Page 2 of 5- 3 - \n Preliminary Injunction at 7 –8, ECF. No. 3 [hereinafter Pl.’s Memo. in Support of PI ]; see also  \nCompl. at 1–2.  In response, defendant a rgues that this was not a traditional solicitation and the \nCICA  stay provision is  not applicable to these awards because they were made under separate \nprocurements from the one that PredictiveIQ currently protests before the GAO .  See Def.’s \nResp. at 27.   \n \nUnder the A dministrative P rocedure Act standard of review, agency  procurement \nactions —including an agency’s decision whether to implement a CICA stay —may be set aside if \nthey are “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with the \nlaw.”  28 U.S.C. § 1491(b)(4); 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A).  The arbitrary and capricious standard is a \nhighly deferential one.  See Advanced Data Concepts , Inc. v. United States , 216 F.3d 1054, 1058 \n(Fed. Cir. 2000).  Thus, “[i]f the [C]ourt finds a reasonable basis for [an] agency’s action, the \n[C]ourt should stay its hand even though it might, as an original proposition, have reached a \ndifferent conclusion as to the proper administration and application of the procurement \nregulations.”  Honeywell, Inc. v. United States , 870 F.2d 644, 648 (Fed. Cir. 1989) (quoting M. \nSteinthal & Co. v. Seamans , 455 F.2d 1289, 1301 (D.C. Cir. 1971)).  Plaintiff bears a heavy  \nburden to  prevail in this protest.  See Impresa Construzioni Geom. Domenico Garufi v. United \nStates , 238 F.3d 1324, 1338 (Fed. Cir. 2001).   \n \nRelev\nant here, “ [t]he SBIR program gives the participating agencies broad discretion in \nadministering the program.”  Squire Sols., Inc. v. United States , 156 Fed. Cl. 249, 269 (2021).  \n“Under the SBIR program’s broad discretion, agencies have unfettered ability to avoid the \nconstraints of a bid protest.”  Id.   Accordingly, an agency has “control over how it construct[s] its \nsolicitations.”  Id.  at 263.  Within that framework , the purpose behind SBIR programs is  to allow \nthe Agency “flexibility in the operation of their individual programs.”  Small Business \nAdministration SBIR/STRR Policy Directive  (version 2), Oct. 1, 2020, at 2  (stating that the \nSmall Business Administration is “attempt[ ing] to reduce the paperwork and regulatory \ncompliance burden on small business concerns [] applying to and participating in the \nSBIR/STTR programs.”).  As such, this is a unique solicitation for research and development (“R&D ”) which differs from the usual government procurement. \n \nIn this case, the Agency requested proposals to meet needs in broad areas identified by \nthe Agency.  Pl.’s Mot. for PI, Exhibit (“Ex.”) B at 6 (“This CSO seeks innovative, commercial technologies proposed to create new [Air Force] solutions or potential new capabilities fulfilling \nrequirements, closing capability gaps, or providing potential technological advancements.”) .  \nAccordingly, each of these proposals were evaluated based on their individual merit and unique technical solutions to meet the Agency’s defense and commercial  needs.  See id.  at 48.  These \nindividual proposals stem from the SBIR program involving one CSO but  comprise multiple \nawards responding to many separate needs contemporaneously.  Indeed, Federal Acquisition \nRegulation 3.104- 1 defines federal agency procurement including “broad agency announcements \nand small business innovation research programs, each proposal rec eived by an agency \nconstitutes a separate procurement .”\n1  48 C.F.R. § 3-104.1 (emphasis added).  Therefore, the \n \n1  The Court is aware that a pending Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement rule proposes to \ninclude “commercial solutions openings” in the definition of “federal agency procurement.”  See Defense Federal Case 1:23-cv-00545-LAS   Document 33   Filed 07/21/23   Page 3 of 5- 4 - \n Court is not convinced that the Agency acted in an arbitrar y or capricious manner when it issued \na stay to the particular awards which affected  plaintiff’s protest but not the remaining awards  in \nthe CSO program. \n \nNext, the Court concludes that plaintiff has failed to demonstrate that it will suffer \nirreparable harm  before the conclusion of its GAO protest.  P laintiff argues  that it will be \nirreparably harmed due to (1) its inability to compete for an award; (2) its competitive disadvantage when most award s have been made; and (3) the Agency’s strong incentive to \ndisregard GAO’s recommendations should these awards proceed.  See Pl.’s Memo. in Support of PI at 11 –15.  D efendant responds that plaintiff has not met the high bar in demonstrating \nirreparable harm .  See Def.’s Resp. at 28 (citing Air Transp. Ass’n  of Am., Inc. v. Exp.-Imp. Bank \nof the U.S., 840 F. Supp. 2d 327, 334 (D.D.C. 2012)).  Defendant argues that plaintiff has not suffered harm in the form of lost opportunities when the Agency has preserved funding “in the event that the Air Force elects to reevaluate or award a different SBIR D2P2 funding agreement.”  Def.’s Resp. at 30.  Additionally, defendant argues that plaintiff’s alleged competitive disadvantage is speculative because plaintiff’s R&D approach is different in \ncomparison to other awardees.  See Def.’s Resp. at 30 –31.  \nOn review, the Court finds that plaintiff has not demonstrated irreparable harm.  Plaintiff \nmust demonstrate more than the “mere possibility of injury” but a “presently existing, actual \nthreat must be shown.”  See Qingdao Taifa Grp. v. United States , 581 F.3d 1375, 1379 (Fed. Cir. \n2009) (quoting Zenith Radio Corp. v. United States , 710 F.2d 806, 809 (Fed. Cir. 1983)).  In \nfurtherance of the SBIR program, the Agency’s CSO for R&D efforts contemplated awarding multiple awards.  Pl.’s Mot. for PI, Ex. B ; see also Def.’s Resp. at 8 –9.  With no set requirement, \neach offeror was evaluated to “determine the most promising technical and scientific approaches” to various “defense need [s]” identified in the CSO, with each proposal “judged on \nits own merits.”   Pl.’s Mot. for PI, Ex. B at 48–49.  After the Agency determined the technical aspects of the offerors, the Agency ranked the proposals for purposes of funding availability.  See id.  Due to the unique nature of this procurement, the Agency put forth stop- work orders for \nfunding agreements ranked 29 and 30—essentially preserving those funds should plaintiff \nprevail at the GAO.  See Def.’s  Resp. at 14, 29–30.  Thus, plaintiff has not demonstrated an \nexisting or actual threat to which an injunction would be appropriate. \nAdditionally, the Court finds allegations of competitive disadvantage too speculative to \ndemonstrate irreparable harm.  Plaintiff’s argument of competitive disadvantage is  supported by \nan affidavit from its CEO, Dr. Juan Betts, arguing that plaintiff’s technological approach \noverlaps with  at least fifteen of the thirty awarded contracts.  See  Pl.’s Mot. for PI, Ex. L at 2.  \nDr. Betts asserts that the Agency would be giving “other companies a head start, thereby \ndisadvantaging [plaintiff].”  See id .  The Court is sympathetic to plaintiff’s position that Machine \nLearning/Artificial Intelligence technologies are fast- paced and con stantly evolving; however, \nthis perceived harm is speculative under the standards of irreparable harm.  See Lockheed Martin \n \nAcquisition Regulation Supplement: Defense  Commercial Solutions Opening (DFARS Case 2022 –D006) , 88 Fed. \nReg. 6,605, 6,606 (Jan. 31, 2023)  (to be codified at 48 C.F.R. pt. 203) . Case 1:23-cv-00545-LAS   Document 33   Filed 07/21/23   Page 4 of 5- 5 - \n Corp. v. United States , 124 Fed. Cl. 709 (2016) (holding that an awardee’s transition into \nperformance was not sufficient to establish irreparable harm); see also IBM Corp. v. United \nStates , 118 Fed. Cl. 677 (2014). \nLastly, the Court finds that the balance of equities and public interest tips against an \naward of  injunctive relief.  The statutory use of the SBIR Program “is to strengthen the role of \ninnovative [small business contracts] in federally-funded research or research and development.”  Small Business Administration SBIR/STRR Policy Directive  (version 2), Oct. 1, 2020, at 2.  To \nthat end, the Agency issued the CSO to meet various defense need s under the Orbital Prime \nISAM Topic with a view of strengthening small businesses and non- profit research institutions.  \nId.  Further, plaintiff is requesting that all 147 CSO awards be enjoined, including those awards \nthat are not under the Orbital Prime ISAM Topic.  See generally Pl.’s Mot. for PI.  To preserve the status quo, the Agency has agreed to reserve funding should plaintiff prevail at the GAO.  The weighing of harm to the Agency and numerous other contractors weighs strongly in favor of staying our hand.  See FMS Inv. Corp. v. United States , 142 Fed. Cl. 488, 490 (2019) (citing \nCont’l Serv. Grp., Inc. v. United States , 722 Fed. App’x 986, 994 (Fed. Cir. 2018)) (“A court \nusually issues a preliminary injunction to preserve the status quo that existed before the litigation began until the court can make a final decision on the merits.”).  \nMoreover, the public interest is undoubtedly furthered by allowing these contractors to \nperform to stimulate technological innovation, encourage small business relationships in R&D, \nfoster partnerships between small businesses and non-profit research institutions, and increase commercial application of R&D solutions and technologies toward identi fied defense needs.  See \nPl.’s Mot. for PI, Ex. B at 6–7.  Taken together, the Court concludes that plaintiff has not demonstrated that the balance of equities and public interest favors granting the extraordinary \nrelief it seeks.   \nIII. Conclusion \n \nFor the reasons set forth above, plaintiff’s Motion for Preliminary Injunction is hereby \nDENIED.   \n \nIT IS SO ORDERED.  \n  \n s/ Loren A. Smith  \nLoren A.

The United States, et al.*, Percipient.ai challenged the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) for allegedly bypassing its commercial computer vision software, \"Mirage,\" in favor of a system developed by CACI, Inc. The court dismissed Percipient.ai's protest due to lack of subject matter jurisdiction, citing the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act (FASA), which prohibits judicial review for protests related to task orders like the one in question here.

Case 1:23-cv-00028-EGB   Document 62   Filed 05/19/23   Page 1 of 62 \n  \nOPINION    \nThis is a post- award bid protest of the  National Geospatial-\nIntelligence Agency’s alleged violation of 10 U.S.C. § 3453, a statute that \nrequires agencies to procure commercial or non-developmental products “to \nthe maximum extent practicable.” Both the United States and the intervenor, \nCACI, Inc. – Federal, move to dismiss the protest for lack of subject-matter \njurisdiction. For the reasons below, we grant the motions to dismiss. \nBACKGROUND2 \nThe National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) obtains and \nanalyzes images and other geospatial information to provide the federal \ngovernment with intelligence data. Supplying this kind of intelligence on a \nglobal scale  is a burdensome analytical task  and cannot be done effectively \nwithout the help of advanced computer technology. One of those advanced \ntechnologies is computer vision, a form of artificial intelligence that “trains \nand uses computers to interpret the visual world.” Compl. ¶ 55. With \ncomputer vision, users can more efficiently compile and analyze geospatial \nintelligence. \nHoping to benefit from  this technology, NGA, more than three years \nago, issued the SAFFIRE solicitation—which was for an indefinite delivery, \nindefinite quantity contract containing two parts. The first was a data \nrepository, which would store and disseminate geospatial intelligence  \n“across various large organizations .” Compl. ¶ 60. The second, which is at \nthe heart of this dispute, would integrate a computer vision system to enhance \nthe agency’s ability to produce, review, and classify intelligence from \n“millions” of images. Compl. ¶ 58.  \nThe plaintiff, Percipient, is a technology company that developed a \ncomputer vision software called “Mirage.” Mirage is an open architecture \nsoftware that works alongside other computer systems  and can detect \n \n2 When a party moves  to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, the \ncourt assumes that the undisputed facts in the complaint are true and draws \nreasonable inferences in the plaintiff’s favor. Acevedo v. United States, 824 F.3d 1365, 1368 (Fed. Cir. 2016). These undisputed facts are drawn from the \ncomplaint, the attached materials, and the administrative record. Case 1:23-cv-00028-EGB   Document 62   Filed 05/19/23   Page 2 of 63 \n equipment, vehicles, and faces—each  of which is a critical aspect of \ngeospatial intelligence. More than that, though, Mirage’s tools also allow \nusers to narrow the computer’s focus to specific objects, patterns, or \ngeographical areas, and it can even learn to anticipate its users’ needs over \ntime. Despite these features and capabilities, Percipient did not bid on the \nSAFFIRE contract because its  software could only fulfill SAFFIRE’s \ncomputer vision requirements.  For that reason, Percipient relied  on what it \nviewed as the agency’s statutory obligation to consider incorporating \ncommercial products and hoped to be part of NGA’s SAFFIRE efforts. \nIn January 2021, NGA simultaneously awarded the SAFFIRE \ncontract to CACI  and issued Task Order 1, which directed CACI, among \nother things, to “develop and deliver the Computer Vision (CV) suite of \nsystems.” AR 3030. The agency then informed Percipient that, if it wanted \nto participate in SAFFIRE, it needed  to speak with CACI. This eventually \nled to a meeting between Percipient and CACI in March 2021. At this \nmeeting, CACI expressed significant interest in partnering with Percipient \non future projects, b ut explained that,  as for working together on SAFFIRE, \n“that ship” had already “sailed.” Compl. ¶ 93.  \nAlarmed by this revelation, Percipient asked  NGA if it would \nindependently evaluate Mirage as a possible commercial solution for \nSAFFIRE’s computer vision system. N GA responded several weeks later \nand reassured Percipient of its commitment to using commercial products. \nNGA further explained that CACI’s “ship has sailed” statement was an \n“unfortunate miscommunication ,” which  did not reflect the agency’s \nposition. Compl. ¶ 100. Instead, the agency had not yet decided whether it \nneeded to incorporate a commercial product because CACI was still \nreviewing NGA’s legacy systems. NGA confirmed that commercial products \nwould be evaluated once CACI finished.  \nAnother two months went by before Percipient finally secured a \nmeeting with CACI to demonstrate Mirage , although CACI’s Program \nManager—the individual largely responsible for deciding whether to \nincorporate a commercial product—left the meeting after only 20 minutes. \nStill, Mirage received positive feedback, and CACI promised to evaluate \nMirage more fully. This “deep dive” into Mirage never happened, however.  \nCompl. ¶ 108.  Case 1:23-cv-00028-EGB   Document 62   Filed 05/19/23   Page 3 of 64 \n Several months later , Percipient learned  at the 2021 GEOINT \nSymposium that CACI would be developing a computer vision system for \nSAFFIRE  when CACI employees visited  Percipient’s symposium booth. \nSurprised by the news, and no longer believing that CACI could fairly \nevaluate Mirage, Percipient met with NGA and asked to set up a \ndemonstration. NGA agreed but requested that Percipient “ease up on the \nlegal pressure.”  Compl. ¶ 118.  Percipient  then demonstrated Mirage’s \nabilities to several NGA representatives in December 2021, at the end of \nwhich NGA concluded that Percipient’s software met “all of NGA’s \nanalytical transformation requirements.” Compl. ¶ 120.  \nOver the next several months, the parties worked to reach an \nagreement that would allow NGA to test Mirage with live data, something \nthat Percipient agreed to do at no cost. Just before signing an agreement to \nthat effect, however,  NGA changed its tune. Citing legal and security \ncomplexities, NGA would no longer use live data and would instead use \npreviously released and publicly available images. Percipient pushed back,  \nclaiming that these images would not allow NGA to test Mirage’s geospatial \nmodule or some of its unique features, such as  its ability to alert changes over \ntime. After significant delay, NGA relented and allowed the use of live data.  \nNGA completed its testing of Mirage in October 2022. Based on the \nresults, Percipient suspected that NGA was not assessing Mirage as a \npossible commercial solution for SAFFIRE’s computer vision requirements \nbecause, among other reasons, Percipient could only identify  four NGA \nsearches  over the 12- week testing period. Thus, Percipient offered to extend \nthe testing period, again at no cost, so NGA could more fully evaluate Mirage \nas a computer vision system. Percipient’s suspicions appeared to be \nconfirmed, though, when NGA explained one month later that it had \nevaluated Mirage as “an enterprise Machine Learning Platform,” and not “as an Analytical tool.” Compl. ¶ 137.  \nAfter Percipient’s efforts to be incorporated into SAFFIRE proved \nunfruitful, it filed this protest. In its complaint, Percipient alleges that the \nagency  violated its statutory and regulatory obligations by wastefully \npursuing a development solution when a possible commercial solution existed. It also alleges that the agency  unlawfully delegated inherent \ngovernment authority when it allowed its contractor, CACI, to determine agency policy on commercial technology. Finally, Percipient believes that Case 1:23-cv-00028-EGB   Document 62   Filed 05/19/23   Page 4 of 65 \n the agency arbitrarily  handled  the SAFFIRE project. In response, the \ngovernment and CACI have moved to dismiss for lack of subject matter \njurisdiction, arguing that Percipient’s protest is barred by the Federal \nAcquisition Streamlining Act’s (FASA) task order bar.  \nDISCUSSION  \nLike all federal courts, we possess limited jurisdiction, with ours \nbeing defined mainly by the Tucker Act. Fisher v. United States, 402 F.3d \n1167, 1172 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (en banc). Under the Tucker Act, we have \njurisdiction over bid protests that allege a “violation of statute or regulation in connection with a procurement or a proposed procurement.” 28 U.S.C.  § 1491(b)(1).   \nEven if a protest falls within the Tucker Act’s jurisdictional grant, it \nmay still be barred by FASA . Through FASA, Congress effectively \neliminate[d] all judicial review for protests made in connection with a procurement designated as a task order.” 22nd Cent. Techs., Inc. v. United \nStates, 57 F.4th 993, 999 (Fed. Cir. 202 3). In particular, FASA excludes from \nour jurisdiction any protest “in connection with the issuance or proposed issuance of a task or delivery order.” 10 U.S.C. § 3406(f)(1). A n agency’s \nchallenged action is “in connection with the issuance” of a task order if there \nis a direct and causal relationship between the two. SRA Int’l v. United States, \n766 F.3d 1409, 1413 (Fed. Cir. 2014).  \nHere, Percipient’s protest is directly and causally related to the \nagency’s issuance of Task Order 1. Specifically, Percipien t alleges that—\nafter the agency issued Task Order 1, which directed CACI to develop and \ndeliver a computer vision system—the agency violated §3453 because it \nfailed to consider whether Percipient’s product could meet those same \nrequirements. That challenge is barred by FASA.  \nFirst, it is unclear whether §3453 requires an agency to consider \ncommercial products after it issues a task order—an issue we need not \ndecide. But even if it does, that task order would be the “direct and immediate \ncause” of the agency’s statutory obligation to consider those commercial \nproducts. See Mission Essential Pers.  v. United States , 104 Fed. Cl. 170, 178 \n(2012) (holding that FASA barred a protest because an agency’s challenged \naction was the “direct and immediate cause” of the issued task order). In other Case 1:23-cv-00028-EGB   Document 62   Filed 05/19/23   Page 5 of 66 \n words, without the task order, the work that Percipient is challenging would \nnot be taking place and Percipient could not allege this §3453 violation.  \nSecond, the agency’s alleged procurement decision not to consider \ncommercial products is not “logically distinct” from its decision to procure \nthat same computer system through a task order. See 22nd Cent. Techs., Inc. \nv. United States, 157 Fed. Cl. 152, 157 (2021) (holding that FASA applies \nunless a procurement decision is “logically distinct” from the issuance of a \ntask order). Instead, that decision would be in direct response to the task order \nthat the agency had already issued.  \nIn short, the protest cannot be abstracted away from CACI’s \nperformance under a task order. And certainly,  if Percipient prevailed on the \nmerits, any meaningful relief would require this court to partially suspend or \ndiscontinue performance under that  task order, which further evidences the \nconnection between the challenge and the task order. See SRA, 766 F.3d at \n1414 (explaining that a protestor’s requested relief can support the \napplication of FASA’s task order bar). We hold that Percipient’s protest is “in connection with the issuance” of a task order and is therefore barred by \nFASA  from being brought in this court. \nCONCLUSION \nIn sum, we lack subject matter jurisdiction over Percipient’s protest. \nIts challenge to the agency’s actions under §3453 is “in connection with the issuance of a task order” and is barred by FASA. Thus, the motions to dismiss \nfor lack of subject matter jurisdiction are granted. The Clerk of Court is \ndirected to enter judgment accordingly. No costs. \n      s/Eric G.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: This court case involves multiple plaintiffs challenging the U.S. Customs and Border Protection’s (CBP) solicitation process for awarding two substantial Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs) concerning professional services and emerging technology, each worth hundreds of millions over five years. The plaintiffs contend that CBP's evaluation was flawed due to the application of unstated criteria, improper documentation, and disparate treatment among offerors, with particular emphasis on the agency’s integration of emerging technologies including artificial intelligence and machine learning into its evaluation processes.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether CBP acted arbitrarily, capriciously, or unlawfully in evaluating and awarding the BPAs for professional services and emerging technologies, specifically in its consideration and treatment of bid proposals related to artificial intelligence and technology services.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court found no prejudicial errors in CBP's processes and denied all plaintiffs’ motions for judgment. It concluded that CBP’s evaluation methods and award decisions, including those concerning AI and ML applications, were not arbitrary or capricious and complied with the stated solicitation criteria. The court granted the government's cross-motions for judgment, upholding the award decisions made by CBP.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine you're organizing a big contest to decide who gets to help you with cool tech projects for the next few years, but some of the people who didn't win are upset.

(CMCI) filed separate post -award bid protests \nchallenging the award of two Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs) with U.S. Customs and \nBorder Protection (CBP), each worth approximately $450 million over five years.  The Solicitation was a General Services Administration (GSA) Multiple Award Schedule (MAS).  \nThe S olicitation called for the award of two distinct multiple award BPAs, divided into \nProfessional Services ( “Track 1 ”) and Emerging Technology, Data Transformation, \nDevelopment and Maintenance Support (“ Track 2 ”).  The Solicitation covered both Tracks, and \nbidders who wished to be evaluated for both requirements were to submit two quotations.  CBP received over 100 quotes in total.  CBP awarded seven multiple award BPAs for Professional Services and six for Emerging Technology, Data Transformation, Development and Maintenance Support.     For Track 1, the Solicitation stated:  “CBP has a requirement for consulting \nand providing technical support to advise and assist the Government as the Subject Matter Expert \n(SME) fo r strategic planning, risk assessment and mitigation, cost analysis, data management \nand analysis strategies, and senior program management.”  AR at 346–47 (TAB 12a4) (Solicitation – Statement of Work).   The Solicitation also noted “CBP requires vendor support to \nrecommend enhancing and supporting CBP’s emerging technology, data management, reporting and analytical capabilities.”   Id.  For Track 2, the Solicitation stated:  “ CBP requires a wide range \nof services and business disciplines supporting innovation and digital transformation.  CBP’s overarching objective is  to sustainably improve the total experience and to achieve business \nagility by integrating people, processes, data, and technology.”  AR at 3 74–75 (TAB 12 b4) \n(Solicitation – Statement of Work).   When asked at oral argument to provide more concrete \ndetail regarding the Solicitation, the government responded the broad purpose of the contract is to support CBP’s data- related endeavors, including processing customs information, scanning \nlicense plates, patrolling the border, and developing language interpretation tools.  Oral Arg. Tr. (Tr.) at 104:16–19 (“[GOVERNMENT]:  So CBP has a whole broad host of responsibilities that generate[] a ton of data, and they are trying to leverage AI and machine learning to better perform their duties.”), ECF Nos. 143 and 145; Tr. at 104:3–24 (“[GOVERNMENT]:   They do \nlicense plate scanning.  They patrol the borders, . . . [and] when they stop somebody from crossing the border,  . . . [they] collect information . . . .  [They also collect] information about \nCustoms duties [such as from ] cargo ships coming in with lots of both legal goods and illegal \ngoods, and then the legal goods may or may not be properly admitted into the United States because of patent disputes and things like that, or they have to be subject to certain tariffs. . . .  [They also frequently have to work] with a person who doesn’t speak the language that the officer speaks at the border.”).   CBP intends to incorporate novel application s of AI  into these Case 1:23-cv-01610-RTH   Document 187   Filed 03/07/24   Page 3 of 108- 4 - \n tasks.  Tr. at 74:13–15 (“[GOVERNMENT: ]  [T]his is the type of work that the agency is \nlooking to procure in the future as emerging technology, so novel applications of AI.”).  CBP’s \nteam of technical experts reviewed all quotes with this broad purpose in mind, given the highly technical nature of the contract.   \n  \n For the reasons discussed at length infra, the Court does find CBP erred in its analysis of \nsome  Track 2 plaintiff’s RREPs, and the government largely concedes such mistakes, see \ninfra  Sections V and VI.  Per the terms of the Solicitation for Track 2, however, CBP finding \nonly one  RRE P failed was acceptable grounds for CBP to eliminate an offeror from award, see \ninfra  Section s VI.A. &  VI.D.  These errors were therefore not prejudicial.   In sum, the Court \nfinds no prejudicial error and denies all plaintiffs’ Motions for Judgment on the Administrative Record. \n \n  For the foregoing reasons, the Court :  (1) denies  plaintiff  Ekagra ’s Motion for Judgment \non the Administrative Record; (2) finds as moot plaintiff Ekagra’s Motion for Preliminary Injunction; (3) denies plaintiff Unissant’s Motion for Judgment on the Administrative Record; (4) denies plaintiff AttainX ’s Motion for Judgment on the A dministrative Record ; (5) denies \nplaintiff LSI ’s Motion for Judgment on the Administrative Record; (6) denies plaintiff Arch ’s \nMotion for Judgment on the Administrative Record; (7) denies plaintiff AOI’s Motion for Judgment on the Administrative Record ; (8) finds as moot plaintiff AOI’s Motion to Strike; (9) \ndenies plaintiff GTS’ Motion for Judgment on the Administrative Record; (10) denies plaintiff Constellation’s Motion for Judgment on the Administrative Record; (11) denies plain tiff CMCI’s \nMotion for Judgment on the Administrative Record; (12) grants the government’s Cross -Motions  \nfor Judgment on the Administrative Record; (13) grants defendant -intervenor Novilo Technology \nSolutions, LLC (Novilo) ’s Cross -Motions  for Judgment on t he Administrative Record ; (14) \ngrants defendant -intervenor CAN Softtech, Inc.

Only submissions from a valid GSA MAS Schedule Information \nTechnology Category, IT Services, IT  professional services (SIN 54151S) who are \nSmall Business Schedule Holders will be accepted.   The  Government will compile \na ranking of quotes by reviewing the quotations for compliance, accuracy, and  \ncomplet ion of all required areas to select the technically highest rated submissions. \nDuring this process, Quoters’ self -scores can either remain the same or decrease. \nThe highest ranked quoters will be  evaluated for relevancy on the two (2) required \nRREPs submit ted for each task areas.   The RREPS will  be evaluated for similarity \nin scope and complexity to the task areas identified in the ESB BPA scope of  work.   \nIf the Government determines any of the required two (2) RREPs are not  similar in \nscope and  complexity, the quotation will be ineligible for award and will not be \nfurther evaluated.   Any additional  RREP submissions will not be substituted by the \nGovernment for any RREP submissions that are  deemed not relevant.  Once the \nGovernment has evaluated a Quoter’s A ttachment 1 Section 2 for  relevancy, the \nGovernment will then continue to review and validate the remaining sections of  \nAttachment 1.  If the Government deems irrelevant and subsequently eliminates \nany of the additional  RREP submissions from Section 2, the  Government will also \neliminate its corresponding points  associated with that RREP from all other self -\nscoring sections.  \n \nThe Government will review the Quoter’s proposed labor categories and corresponding labor rates for  each task area in accordance with  the Quoter’s GSA \nMAS Schedule Contract to determine  reasonableness.  The Government will \nreview the Quoter’s proposed labor categories for each task to determine \nappropriateness.  \n \nAR at 689 (TAB 18.2) (Solicitation).

Parties’ MJAR Arguments Related to Track 1  \n  Plaintiffs LSI, Arch, GTS, and Constellation challenge CBP’s award decision related to \nTrack 1.  The four Track 1 plaintiffs’ arguments can generally be grouped into three distinct categories:  (1) challenges related to the size of subcontractors; (2) challenges related to RREPs; and (3) related miscellaneous challenges.  The Court describes each, as well as the specifics of the parties’ arguments, in turn.    \nA. Challenges Related to Subcontractor Size  \n Track 1 plaintiffs LSI, Arch, and Constellation argue CBP wrongfully found \nsubcontrac tors used by each plaintiff were “other than small under [North American Industry \nClassification System (NAICS) code] 541511 and [therefore] made a[n improper] point adjustment.”  LSI Reply at 2.  Under the Solicitation, bidders were entitled to “preferent ial scores \nfavoring lower percentages of large business utilization.”  Gov’t’s Cross -MJAR and Resp. to \nGroup 2 at 61 n.10; see also AR at 696 (TAB 18a1) (Self Scoring and Document Verification Worksheet).  LSI, Arch, and Constellation all assert CBP’s “poi nt adjustment[s] [related to their \nsubcontractors] should be reversed,” LSI MJAR at 4, because the agency improperly “determined that . . . [their] subcontractors . . . [were] not [] small business[es], resulting in losing points on the small business part icipation score.”  Constellation MJAR at 3; see also Arch \nMJAR at 1, 20–25 (“CBP improperly deducted 375 points based on Arch Systems’ use of a subcontractor that DBP deemed (incorrectly and without authority) to be a large business.”).  At oral argument, plaintiffs clarified their primary issue is the FAR makes clear “it’s the size standard associated with the NAICS codes [that matters , detailing number of employees and/or \nthreshold dollar amount .]  Not the NAICS code per se.”  Tr. at 381:6–8 (Constellation).  Thus, \nplaintiffs argue CBP should not have decreased their scores because, although their subcontractors were not self -certified under NAICS code 541511, they were beneath the relevant \nsize threshold.  See, e.g., Tr. at 357:14–358:4.  In response, the government contends “CBP did not act arbitrarily or capriciously when it disallowed small business preferential points” for plaintiffs’ subcontractors.  Gov’t’s Group 2 Reply at 7.  Multiple defendant intervenors, although making distinct legal arguments , echo the government’s sentiment the Court should not disturb \nCBP’s determinations related to plaintiffs’ subcontractors.  See  Catalina Cross -MJAR and Resp. \nat 2–3 (“One offeror (Arch Systems) included RREPs from a large business subcontractor in its \nproposal and the other (Catalina Solutions) did not.”); Chevo Cross -MJAR and Resp. at 5–6 \n(“[T]he Group 2 protesters challenge the agency’s decisions related to subcontractor size . . . [t]his Court does not have jurisdiction to adjudicate these claims, so the y must be dismissed.”). Case 1:23-cv-01610-RTH   Document 187   Filed 03/07/24   Page 10 of 108- 11 - \n  \nB. Challenges Related to RREP Point Deductions  \n \nTrack 1 plaintiffs LSI and Arch also challenge CBP’s deduction of points related to  \nRREPs.  LSI MJAR at 7 (citing AR at 10139–40 (TAB 73.10) (LSI Track 1 Memorandum); \n9702–03 (Tab 63) ( LSI Self -score Worksheet)); Arch MJAR at 15 (quoting AR at 687 (TAB \n18.2) (RFQ Amend. 8)).  “The minimum value for an RREP under the RFQ was one million \ndollars.”  Gov’t’s Cross -MJAR and Group 2 Resp. at 61 (citing AR at 687 (Tab 18.2) (RFQ \nAmend. 8)).  “I n its evaluation, CBP . . . sought to verify that the projects submitted as RREPs \nwere at least of a value of one million dollars. . . .”  Id.  RREPs below the $1,000,000 threshold \nwere disregarded by CBP, and those with values greater than $10,000,000 wer e disfavored.  See \nGov’t’s Group 2 Reply at 5 (citing AR at 223–25 (TAB 10b1) (Self -Score Worksheet)) \n(explaining “the scoring rubric . . . favored projects with lower ‘total’ values,” meaning RREPs of a value between one and ten million dollars were entit led to the most points).  \n \nLSI alleges CBP “found that [its] . . . Task 1 RREP 5 (AR [at] 6882), Task 4 RREP 5 \n(AR [at] 6924), and Task 7 RREP 3 (AR [at] 6961) are the same RREP, . . . [each with a] contract value [of] $758,000, less than the required $1M minimum,” so CBP “removed t hese \nRREPs.”  LSI MJAR at 7 (citing AR at 10139–40 (TAB 73.10) (LSI Track 1 Memorandum); AR at 9702–03 (Tab 63) (LSI Self -score Worksheet)).  According to LSI, “[t]hese RREPs should not \nhave been removed and the deducted points should be restored” because the database used by CBP to validate the value of these RREPs —the Federal Procurement Data System (FPDS) —\n“does not reflect a full picture,” and LSI could “have provided an explanatory note describing the errors in FPDS” had CBP asked for such.  Id. at 7 –8.  Further, LSI alleges its Task 1 RREP 6, a \nDepartment of Commerce (DOC) contract, “should not have been removed.”  Id. at 8.   \n Similarly, according to Arch, each “RREP was to contain, in pertinent part, the associated \n‘Requirement or Project Total Value (project total value of work performed if performed as a sub-contractor).’”  Arch MJAR at 15  (quoting AR at 687 (TAB 18.2) (RFQ Amend. 8)).  Arch \ntherefore “disclosed the value of the Requirement  in question, a separate contract line item . . . as \n$[XXXXXXXX XXXX] ,” even though the “entire task order was valued at \n$[XXXXXXXXXXXX] .”  Id. at 16 (emphasis added).  In other words, unlike CBP, Arch \ninterpreted the RFQ as permitting “offerors . . . to rely on specific contract requirements, as opposed to entire task order values.”  Id. at 17.  Should the Court find CBP’s evaluation of “Arch Systems under Task 5 was . . . consistent with the RFQ,” however, Arch argues there is a “latent \nambiguity in the RFQ,” id. at 19, meaning an ambiguity “‘not apparent on the face of the solicitation [or] . . . ascertainable through reasonable or customary car e,’” warranting injunctive \nrelief.  Id. (citing Input/Output Tech., Inc. v. United States , 44 Fed. Cl. 65, 72 n.10 (1999)).   \n In response to LSI, the government argues “CBP reasonably removed RREPs and their \nassociated points where it could not verify the  projects’ claimed values.”  Gov’t’s Cross -MJAR \nand Resp. to Group 2 at 61 .  Turning to Arch, the government contends Arch’s “extraction of a \ncontract portion was in conflict with the RFQ, which directed quoters to score their RREPs based on the ‘Total Val ue’ of the ‘Requirement or Project.’”  Id.  at 46 (quoting AR at 687 (TAB 18.2) \n(RFQ Amend. 8)).  The government also notes “the Q&A process” further “clarified . . . quoters  Case 1:23-cv-01610-RTH   Document 187   Filed 03/07/24   Page 11 of 108- 12 - \n could not break a requirement or project into subparts in order to reach the highe r point  \ncategory.”  Id. (citing AR at 722 (TAB 18c1) (Track 1 Q&A)).  \n \nC. Additional Challenges by Track 1 Plaintiffs  \n \nTrack 1 plaintiffs Arch and GTS challenge three other aspects of this procurement.   \n \nArch first alleges an additional claim related to its a rgument CBP improperly \ndowngraded its score upon finding its subcontractor  [XXXXXXXXXX]  is not a small business \nunder NAICS code 541511.  Namely, Arch alleges “CBP engaged in disparate treatment during its evaluation of offerors by reducing Arch Systems’ score due to its subcontracting to a purported large business while not deducting points from [awardee Chevo]  for the same \nreason.”   Arch MJAR at 25.   \n \nIn response, the government contends “Arch Systems’ arguments demonstrate its \nfundamental misunderstanding of the evaluation criteria.”   Gov’t’s Cross -MJAR and Resp. to \nGroup 2 at 53–54 (“Beca use CBP treated all three quoters in strict accordance with the terms of \nthe RFQ as they applied to their distinct proposals, the Court should dismiss the  claim.”) . \nNamely, the government clarifies Chevo “awarded [itself] the appropriate score in the first  \ninstance, [so] there was no basis for CBP to deduct points.”   Id. at 54 –55.  On the other hand, \n“Arch Systems . . . submitted RREPs from a large business but had claimed points as though it was a small business,” warranting a point adjustment.  Id. at 5 4.   \n In its final argument, Arch calls out CBP’s award to Catalina explicitly and notes \n“Catalina should have been deemed ineligible for award.”  Arch Systems MJAR at 30.  Arch argues specifically the RFQ required “‘[a] minimum of one (1) RREP must be submi tted by the \nPrime Contractor in each task area.’”  Id. (quoting AR at 686 (TAB 18.2) (Solicitation) ).  \nAccording to Arch, the prime contractor “on Catalina’s proposal is ‘Catalina Solutions, LLC,’ ‘a joint venture between Catalina Associates and Versar Nat ional Security Solutions LLC (formerly \nBayFirst Solutions LLC), a subsidiary of Versar, Inc.’”  Id. at 30 –31 (citing AR at 2226 (TAB \n26a) (Catalina Offer); and AR at  10527 (TAB 87) (Catalina Order)) .  Per Arch, however, \n“Catalina did not provide ‘[a] minimum of one (1) RREP . . . by the Prime Contractor in each task area.’”  Id. at 31 (citing AR at 2244–2338 (TABs 26a –26b2) (Catalina Offer)).  In response, \nthe government alleges Arch misunderstands t he “meaning given to th[e] term [prime contractor] \nin the RFQ and the guidance incorporated into it through the Q&A.”  Gov’t’s Cross -MJAR and \nResp. to Group 2 at 55.  Namely, according to the government, CBP made clear this requirement meant “RREP[s] c[oul d] come from the small [partner], large [partner], or [joint venture].”  Id. \n(quoting AR (TAB 19.2) (Solicitation Clarifications )) (“[A]s a clarification of answers provided \nduring an earlier round of Q&A, [CBP stated] that ‘CBP will consider [RREPs for] w ork done \nand qualifications held individually by each partner to the joint venture as well as any work done by the joint venture itself previously.”).  Catalina therefore “fulfilled the RFQ’s requirement of submitting a minimum of one RREP from the prime c ontractor for each task area.”  Id. at 56 \n(citing AR at 2244–56 (TABs 26a –26b2) (Catalina Offer)).   \n Finally, plaintiff GTS brings a novel challenge  related to both Tracks 1 and 2.  GTS \nargues CBP’s “determination that GTS proposed an inappropriate skill mix for [staffing both Case 1:23-cv-01610-RTH   Document 187   Filed 03/07/24   Page 12 of 108- 13 - \n tracks ] . . . is arbitrary and capricious” because there “is no evidence in the record that . . . any \nevaluator[] meaningfully considered GTS’s proposed mix of labor categories.”  GTS MJAR at \n10.  Specifically, GTS alleges “[t]here i s no substantive discussion in the [source selection \nauthority (SSA) ] memo[randum]” regarding CBP’s conclusion “GTS [] proposed an \ninappropriate skill mix.”  Id.  GTS likewise argues “there is no evidence elsewhere in the record \nthat the Agency performed a substantive analysis of GTS’s proposed labor mix.”  Id. at 16.  \nFurther, for Track 2, GTS alleges the record is unclear and inconsistent regarding why GTS was \neliminated, meaning CBP’s decision was arbitrary and capricious.  GTS Reply at 13 (citing AR at 10161 (TAB 74) (SSA Memorandum)).  According to GTS, CBP “seemed not even to \nunderstand the labor categories that GTS proposed,” which were intentionally broad to “accommodate the diverse scope of work and open- ended nature of future requirements \ncontemplat ed by the Solicitation.”  GTS MJAR at 19, 22 (citing AR at 627 (TAB 18.2) \n(Solicitation) ).   \n The government disagrees with GTS’ characterization of CBP’s review.  Specifically, \naccording to the government, CBP found “that, rather than tailoring its list of labor categories to be proposed for each task under the [scope of work (SOW)], GTS had ‘used a standardized boiler -plate listing of [labor categories] . . . [and] applied that listing to every task.’”  Gov’t’s \nCross -MJAR and Resp. to Group 2 at 16, 17 (quoting AR at 9657 (TAB 61.2) (Chamblin E -\nmail) ) (“‘[GTS’]  quote provided the same entire catalog of more than [XXX]  labor categories for \nall task areas, which did not demonstrate appropriateness for each task area.’”).  Thus, per the government, “CBP c orrectly excluded GTS from competition” because GTS did not follow the \nRFQ’s requirement “the skill mix proposed by a quoter needed to be adequate to perform the task under consideration, and not bloated with irrelevant and inapplicable positions.”  Id. at  28 \n(first citing AR at 627, 688–89 (TAB 18.2) (Solicitation); then citing AR at  733 (TAB 18c1)  \n(Track 1 Q&A); and then citing AR at 747 (TAB 18c2) (Track 2 Q&A)).  \n Overall, plaintiffs argue these point reductions and eliminations were prejudicial and \nentitle them to injunctive relief.  See LSI MJAR at 8 –10; Constellation MJAR at 6 –7; Arch \nSystems MJAR at 9, 33– 40; GTS MJAR at 32–33.  In contrast, in concluding its Re ply, the \ngovernment opposes injunction and notes “should th[e] Court conclude that the record is not adequate for it to examine the agency’s rationale on any particular issue . . . the proper remedy is remand to CBP for more explanation.”  Gov’t’s Group 2 Reply at 32 (citing Fla. Power & Light Co. v. Lorion, 470 U.S. 729, 744 (1985)).  \n \nIII.  Parties’ MJAR Arguments Related to Track 2  \n  Plaintiffs Ekagra, Unissant , AttainX, CMCI, AOI, and Constellation  challenge CBP’s \naward decision related to Track 2.  The Track 2 plaintiffs’ arguments can largely be grouped into the following areas:  (1) challenges related to CBP’s alleged application of unstated criterion; (2) challenges r elated to CBP’s alleged l ack of documentation  and c onsideration of  RREPs ; (3) \nchallenges related to CBP’s alleged disparate treatment of offerors; (4) challenges related to prejudice; and (5) plaintiffs’ requests for a permanent injunction.  The Court describes each, as well as the specifics of the parties’ arguments, in turn.     A.   Challenges Related t o CBP’s Alleged Application of Unstated Criterion  Case 1:23-cv-01610-RTH   Document 187   Filed 03/07/24   Page 13 of 108- 14 - \n  \n Many plaintiffs argue  the agency used unstated, strict evaluation  criteria in determining \nthe “similarity” of plaintiffs’ RREPs with the various tasks.  AR at 689 (TAB 18.2) (Solicitation) (“The RREPS will  be evaluated for similarity in scope and complexity  to the task areas identified \nin the ESB BPA scope of  work.”) (e mphasis added); Ekagra MJAR at 14– 17; Unissant MJAR at \n10–18; AttainX MJAR at 10–11; AOI MJAR at 11 ; CMCI MJAR at 5–9; Constellation MJAR at \n5.  The government argues “ plaintiffs’ arguments are analogous  [because they] . . . argue that the \nagency used unst ated evaluation criteria by insisting that the RREPs be ‘identical,’ rather than \n‘similar’ to the task areas in the SOW.”  Gov’t’s Cross -MJAR and Resp. to Group 1 at 24.   \n  Ekagra argues CBP used unstated evaluation criteria under Task 3 – Artificial \nIntelligence/Machine Learning (AI/ML) Support Services , see supra  Section I.A, in assessing its \nRREP 2 and determining scope and complexity.  Ekagra MJAR at 14–17 (citing AR at 10088 (TAB 71) (ET TET Consolidated Review) ) (“[I]n evaluating Ekagra [’s] second RREP example \nunder Task 3, the Agency deemed the example unacceptable because it did not meet four [performance work statement ( PWS )] ‘requirements’ . . . [R]ather than evaluating Ekagra’s \nRREP 2 to determine whether it was similar in scope and com plexity, the Agency turned its \nbullets into baseline ‘requirements’ and then compared them in rote fashion to Ekagra’s \nsolution.”).   Ekagra explains CBP “ required quotes to be the same as the list for Task 3 instead of \nhaving characteristics in common with  the list in Task 3  . . . [and] thus imposed an ‘identical’ \nrequirement rather than a ‘similarity’ requirement.”  Id.  at 17.   \n  Unissant argues CBP used an unstated evaluation criterion for Tasks 2 – Operational \nMaintenance Support Service , 3 – Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning (AI/ML) Support \nServices , 4 –RPA Support Services , and 5 – Security and Privacy Support , see supra  Section I.A.  \nUnissant MJAR at 10 –18.  For Task 2 - Operational Maintenance Support Service , Unissant  \nargues CBP “irrationally determined that Unissant’s RREP did not demonstrate performance that was similar to the scope of the Task 2 requirements ” “[d]espite the fact that both RREPs for Task \n2 referenced Unissant’s experience performing ‘ Operational Main tenance Support Services ’” \nand “ explained [Unissant’s]  experience providing end- to-end operations and maintenance \nsupport for critical IT Systems, including new applications and systems implemented by Unissant [ XXX XXXXXXXX] under these contr actual efforts. ”  Id.  at 12  (citing AR at 8377 \n(TAB 45b2) (Unissant Offer)).  For Task 3 - Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning (AI/ML) \nSupport Services , Unissant argues CBP’s “ arbitrary and capricious search for key words and \nspecific activities in Un issant’s proposal, which was not included in the evaluation criteria stated \nin the solicitation, resulted in the Agency improperly determining that Unissant’s RREPs were not of similar scope and complexity to the PWS tasks” even though “Unissant discussed how it \nhad built an AI model (or prototype), including ‘data labeling, ontology and annotations needed for the AI model to run.’”  Id.  at 13–14 (quoting AR at 8390 (TAB 45b2) (Unisssant Offer)) .  For \nTask 4 -  RPA Support Services , Unissant  argues CBP “ irrationally concluded that Unissant had \nnot performed RPA work apparently because Unissant did not use the word ‘ robotics ’ in its first \nPrimary RREP for this task  [but] . . . Unissant addresses each of the actual tasks under this Task  \n[in its  RREP ], such as governance activities and the ATO Process.”  Id.  at 16  (comparing AR at \n250 (TAB 10b5) (Task 2, Solicitation) with AR at 8402–03 (TAB 45b2) (Unissant Offer)) .  For \nTask 5 -  Security and Privacy Support , Unissant argues “rather than consider ing whether the \nofferors provided RREPs which reflected ‘similarity in scope and complexity to the task areas in Case 1:23-cv-01610-RTH   Document 187   Filed 03/07/24   Page 14 of 108- 15 - \n the’ PWS . . . the Agency applied a different, unstated requirement that the offerors reference \neach bullet point under the task area ,” as “Uni ssant ’s . . . communication or coordination . . .  \nactivities [in its proposal] were engrained within every step of the processes that Unissant  . . . \ndescribe[d]”  but Unissant was eliminated nonetheless.  Id.  at 17 –18 (quoting AR at 689 (TAB \n18.2) (Solicit ation)) .   \n \n AttainX argues CBP used an unstated evaluation criterion for  Task 2 -  Operational \nMaintenance Support Service  because “t he agency evaluated AttainX as not demonstrating \nsimilarity in scope and complexity with the ‘automated notification of iss ues requirement’” even \nthough AttainX “ demonstrated experience with automated notification of issues requiring \ncorrection”  as “‘[t]he system [in AttainX’s RREP] automatically creates a ticket as soon as it \nreceives an email or voicemail from the system user.’”  AttainX MJAR at 10 –11 (quoting AR at \n10561 (TAB 88c) (AttainX Brief Explanation); and then quoting AR at 1709 (TAB 24b2) \n(AttainX RREPs)).     CMCI also ar gues CBP used an unstated evaluation criterion  in determining “similarity”  \nfor Task 3 and Task 5.  CMCI MJAR at 5–9.  For Task 3 -  Artificial Intelligence/Machine \nLearning (AI/ML) Support Services , CMCI disputes CBP’s conclusion “CMCI’s proposal failed \nto establish its experience [d]eveloping an approach to labeling, annotation, and ontology development to support [the] application of AI  . . . [when]  CMCI’s proposal did show this \nexperience” and counters its RREP established this experience but used the ter m “collation” \nrather than the term “ontology of a program .”  Id. at 8 (internal quotations omitted) .  Also, while \nCBP concluded “ CMCI’s proposal had not demonstrated experience with ‘ [a]pplying labeling \nontology and annotating data of varying types from va rious sources according  to the ontology,’” \nCMCI argues it included AI tools and data robots in its proposal.  Id.  at 8–9.  Further, CBP \n“found lacking CMCI’s experience [e]stablishing and managing a centralized library of \nannotated data for use across the organization for AI model training,” but according to CMCI , its \n“proposal discusses its experience utilizing statistical and predictive models, using home -grown \nand advanced AI/ML tools that allowed CBP to harness real -time, aggregate rich data and gain \nagility for immediate action. ”  Id.  at 9 (internal quotations omitted).  Also, CBP “found that \nCMCI did not show experience [m]anaging and execution of security and accreditation and Authority to Test (ATT) processes and Authority to Operate (ATO) processes for AI/ML technologies, including coordination, identification of any Plan of Action and Milestones (POA&Ms), and support to address them”  even though, per CMCI, “CMCI’s work on all phases \nof Enterprise Life Cycle would encompass promoting applicati ons to live production, which \nwould entail adherence to ATT, ATO processes and mitigations of items collected as part of POAMs.”  Id.  (internal quotations omitted) .  For Task 5 -  Security and Privacy Support , CMCI \nhighlights CBP concluded CMCI has “no indi cation of supporting federal security guidelines per  \nthe SOW” even though (1) “ the RFQ and SOW did not state that ‘supporting federal security \nguidelines’ was required ”; (2) “ CMCI’s proposal  . . . address [ed] federal security guidelines, \ndiscussing its experience with network and Cloud security (in addition to other parts of the write -\nup pertaining to application security) ”; and (3) “ federal security guidelines  . . . cite the need and \nstandards for security at the system/application level .”  Id.  at 5–6.   \n  AOI also argues CBP used an unstated evaluation criterion in determining “similarity” \nfor Task 3 -  Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning (AI/ML) Support Services  and protests Case 1:23-cv-01610-RTH   Document 187   Filed 03/07/24   Page 15 of 108- 16 - \n several CBP conclusions related to Task 3’s sub- bullets, see supra  Section I.A.  AOI MJAR at \n11 (citing AR at 684–90 (TAB 18.2) (Solicitation)) (“ Under any reading, the Solicitation did not \nrequire that a vendor demonstrate identical experience in its RREPs. . .”).  Related to its MJAR \narguments, AOI filed its Motion to Strike the Duneja Declaration attached to the government’s Cross -MJAR to Group 2 plaintiffs from the record because it provided  “extra- record \nexplanations . . . to supplant CBP ’s superficial findings.”  AOI Mot. to Strike  Reply  at 1–2.   \n \nB. Challenges Related t o CBP’s Alleged Lack of Documentation and \nConsideration of R REP s \n  Plaintiffs Ekagra  and Constellation argue CBP did not properly consider, or document its \nconsideration of, their RREPs.  Ekagra MJAR at 9–12; Constellation MJAR at 3 –6.  Ekagra \nargues CBP failed to consider its RREP 2 for Task 1 by “ignor[ing]  Ekagra’s discussion of code \ndevelopment.”  Ekagra MJAR at 9.  Constellation likewise argues CBP improperly evaluated its quote for RREP 1 , Task 2 and RREPs 1 and 2, Task 3.  Constellation MJAR at 3 –6.  \n  Although Unissant, AttainX, CMCI, and AOI  initially made similar claims, at oral \nargument they agreed their arguments related to CBP’s lack of documentation are the same as \ntheir arguments related to unstated criterion.  Tr. at 245:17–22 (“THE COURT:  . . . So your argument is related to CBP ignoring the contents for Tasks 2, 3, 4 and 5 . . . [A]ren ’t these \narguments largely the same as those related to the original arguments of CBP ’s alleged use of \nunstated criteria?  [UNISSANT]:  Yes, Your Honor.”); Tr. at 246:11–17 (“THE COURT: AttainX, . . .  regarding CBP not addressing automating notification of issues requiring correction, . . . does your argument that CBP evaluated the proposal arbitrarily and capriciously largely overlap with the earlier discussed issues of unstated criteria?  [ATTAINX]:  Yes, Your Honor.”); Tr. at 267:23–268:3 (“THE COURT:  . . . [Y]our earlier arguments related to CBP ’s \nalleged application of unstated criteria largely overlapped with these; is that correct?  [CMCI]: Yes, Your Honor.”); Tr. at 269:14–18 (“THE COURT:  Moving on to AOI, . . . your earlier argument s related to CBP’s alleged application of unstated criteria largely overlap with the \narguments related to inadequate documentation; is that correct?  [AOI]:  Yes, Your Honor.”).  The Court will therefore not re -address those arguments.   \n  C.  Challenges R elated to CBP’s Alleged Disparate Treatment of Offerors  \n  Plaintiffs AttainX, Unissant, and AOI bring disparate treatment claims regarding CBP’s \nevaluation of their RREPs.  AttainX MJAR at 19 ; Unissant MJAR at 24 –25; AOI MJAR at 15 –\n16.  The government responds, “[plaintiffs] cannot prevail on a claim of disparate treatment . . . because [th ey] cannot show that CBP ‘unreasonably downgraded [their] proposal[s] for \ndeficiencies that were “substantively indistinguishable” or nearly identical from those contained in other proposals.’”  Gov’t’s Group 1 Reply at 12, 27–28 (quoting Office Design Grp . v. United \nStates , 951 F.3d 1366, 1373 (Fed. Cir. 2020)) .   \n  D.  Challenges R elated to Prejudice  \n  All plaintiffs argue CBP’s award decision has prejudiced them.  Attainx MJAR at 23; \nEkagra MJAR at 19; CMCI MJAR at 10; Unissant MJAR at 29; AOI MJAR at 28; Constellation Case 1:23-cv-01610-RTH   Document 187   Filed 03/07/24   Page 16 of 108- 17 - \n MJAR at 2.  The government responds plaintiffs have “‘not [met] the prejudice requirement [as \ntheir]  allegations, even if proven, would not change the results of the procurement process.’”  \nGov’t’s Cross -MJAR and Resp to Group 1 at 22 (quoting Seaborn Health Care, Inc. v. United \nStates , 101 Fed. Cl. 42, 48 (2011) (citation omitted)). \n  E.  Challenges Related to Injunction  \n  All plaintiffs argue the Court should enter permanent injunction.  Attainx MJAR at 2 6; \nEkagra MJAR at 21; CMCI MJAR at 10; Unissant MJAR at 31–32; AOI MJAR at 2 9; \nConstellation MJAR at 6.  The government responds none of the plaintiffs have  demonstrated \nentitlement to injunctive relief.  Gov’t’s Cross -MJAR and Resp to Group 1 at 71. \n IV. Legal Standards   A. Bid Protest Jurisdiction and APA Review  \n \nThe Tucker Act, as amended by the Administrative Dispute Resolution Act (ADRA), \nprovides this court jurisdiction over “action[s] by an interested party  objecting to a solicitation by \na Federal agency for bids or proposals for a proposed contract or to a proposed award or the \naward of a contract or any alleged violation of statute or regulation in connection with a \nprocurement or a proposed procurement.”  Administrative  Dispute Resolution Act,  Pub. L.  No. \n104-320, 28 U.S.C. § 1491(b)(1) (1996) .  The term “interested party” means “actual or \nprospective bidders or offerors whose direct economic interest would be affected by the award of the contract or by failure to award the contract.”  Am. Fed’n of Gov’t Employees  v. United States , \n258 F.3d 1294, 1302 (Fed. Cir. 2001).  “[T]o prevail in a protest the protester must show not only a significant error in the procurement process, but also that the error prejudiced it.”  Data Gen. Corp. v. Johnson, 78 F.3d 1556, 1562 (Fed. Cir. 1996).   \n \nThe Court evaluates bid protests under the framework laid out in Section 706 of the \nAdministrative Procedure Act .  28 U.S.C. § 1491(b)(4); see also Impresa Construzioni Geom. \nDomenico Garufi v. United States , 238 F.3d 1324, 1332 (Fed. Cir. 2001) ; MATTHEW H. \nSOLOMSON , COURT OF FEDERAL CLAIMS :  JURISDICTION , PRACTICE , AND PROCEDURE  § 8-37 \n(2016) (footnote omitted) (first citing  28 U.S.C. § 1491(b)(4); and then quoting 5 U.S.C. \n§ 706(A), (D)); 28 U.S.C. § 1491(b)(4) (2024)  (“In any action under this subsection, the courts \nshall review the agency’s decision pursuant to the standards set forth in section 706 of title 5.”) ).  \n“[T]he proper standard to be applied in bid protest cases is provided by 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A):  a reviewing court shall set aside the agency action if it is ‘arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.’”  Banknote Corp. of Am., Inc. v. United States , 365 F.3d 1345, 1350–51 (Fed. Cir. 2004) (quoting Adv.  Data Concepts, Inc. v. United \nStates , 216 F.3d 1054, 1057–58 (Fed. Cir. 2000)).  An agency’s action is arbitrary, capricious, or \nan abuse of discretion if “the agency ‘entirely failed to consider an important aspect of the problem, offered an explanation for its decision that runs counter to the evidence before the agency, or . . . is so implausible that it could not be ascribed to a difference in view or the product of agency expertise.’”  Ala. Aircraft Indus., Inc.-Birmingham v. United States , 586 F.3d \n1372, 1375 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (quoting Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass’n of U.S., Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Auto . Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983)).  Since the arbitrary and capricious standard is “highly Case 1:23-cv-01610-RTH   Document 187   Filed 03/07/24   Page 17 of 108- 104 -  \n AR at 3487–88 (TAB 30b2) (Constellation Proposal).  The government argues Constellation \nlisted the correct subtask “heading” in bold, but then describes irrelevant skills thereafter.  For example, at oral argument, the government acknowledged the headings in Constellation’ s RREPs \nmatch the task requirements but described the content of Constellation’ s RREPs as proving the \nability to make “scrambled eggs” when the Solicitation requested “pickup truck services.”  See \nTr. at 255:25–266:11; Tr. at 264:25–266:11 (“[GOVERNMENT]:  But the specifics, Your \nHonor, are completely divorced from what the bold stat ement is.  This is nothing about ontology \ndevelopment or data annotation or data labeling.  They said we provide pickup truck services in \nbold, but then as explaining what that experience is, they talk about making scrambled eggs.  It’s \ncompletely divorced from what that heading is.  So this is my point about they say, ‘ well, we \nhave the right terminology.’   But they didn’ t.  They just put in a couple of buzzwords and then \ntheir experience is completely so far afield from what the Agency was looking for. ”). \n \n Looking at the specific language of both RREPs 1 and 2, neither RREP describes \nexperience resembling the seven subtasks CBP identifies as missing.  Compare AR at 3485–86 (TAB 30b2) (Constellation Proposal)  and AR at 3487–88 (TAB 30b2) (Constellat ion Proposal)  \nwith AR at 10569–70 (TAB 88e3) (CBP Evaluation of Constellation’s Proposal).  While both \nRREPs include the Task 3 subtasks as bolded titles, neither RREP provides actual experience \nwith those subtasks.  Id.   Taking the above example, Constell ation provides “ work on data \nmismatch issues ” in the data loading context in response to the subtasks of “[d]eveloping an \napproach to labeling, annotation, and ontology development to support application of AI at CBP” and “ [a]pplying labeling ontology for CBP and annotate data of varying types from various \nsources according to the ontology.”  Compare  AR at 3487–88 (TAB 30b2) (Constellation \nProposal)  with AR at 10569–70 (TAB 88e3) (CBP Evaluation of Constellation’s Proposal).  As \nstated supra, an ontology requires a sophisticated “knowledge structure,” consisting of a web of \n“terminologies or topics, their definitions and relational information within one or multiple domains.”  Santosa et al. at 161815.  Resolving “data mismatches ” related to data loading is \ndistinct from , and less sophisticated than, creating a knowledge structure by weaving data \ntogether.  See id.   Given Constellation’s RREPs describe experience outside the scope of Task \n3’s requirements, CBP  provide d a rational basis as to why the RREPs are not similar in scope \nand complexity—RREPs 1 and 2 do not describe any AI/ML related work  with any specify or \naccuracy .  Garufi , 238 F.3d at 1332 (“ [T]he procurement official’s decision [did not] lack[] a \nrational basis .”).   \n  C.  Whether CBP Engaged in Disparate Treatment  \n  Plaintiffs AttainX, Unissant, and AOI bring disparate treatment claims regarding CBP’s \nevaluation of their RREPs.  Specifically, AttainX alleges in evaluating RREPs for awardees NiyamIT and Tarkik, “the agen cy provided an exacting standard to AttainX, [but] . . . provided a \nless exacting standard for other entities.”\n19  AttainX MJAR at 19; see AttainX Reply at 8 \n(“AttainX [has] also demonstrated that the agency treated offerors disparately.”).  Plaintiff \n \n19 At oral argument, AttainX confirmed it withdrew the portion of its disparate treatment argument related to \nNiyamIT’s “proposal  with respect to automating notification of issues requiring correction under Task 2.”  Tr. at \n294:6– 10; AttainX Reply at 10 n.5.  AttainX also withdrew its disparate treatment claims related to Novilo.  See Tr. \nat 302:6 –12.   Case 1:23-cv-01610-RTH   Document 187   Filed 03/07/24   Page 104 of 108- 105 - \n Unis sant likewise argues CBP’s “evaluation demonstrates disparate treatment because the \nAgency gave the awardees credit for capabilities simply because they used key words [in their \nRREPs], without evaluating the substance of what the awardees were proposing . . . [but] when the Agency evaluated Unissant’s proposal it determined that Unissant did not meet requirements because it did not . . . use [the same key words] even though it proposed the same capabilities.”  Unissant MJAR at 24 –25.  Finally, plaintiff AOI asserts, with respect to at least four subtasks of \nTask 3, CBP “used different standards to evaluate [different] quotations” and thereby created a record “replete with stark examples of disparate treatment where the evaluators deployed two different grad ing scales.”  AOI MJAR at 15 –16.  In discussing Task 3, which required offerors \nexhibit experience managing a “centralized data library,” AR at 249 (Tab 10b5) (Solicitation), AOI argues it experienced disparate treatment when its RREP, which referenced a “[d]ata [l]ake,” was deemed insufficient even though awardee Novilo’s Task 3 RREP, which discussed a “centralized library of annotated data,” was found to be sufficient by CBP.  AOI MJAR at 20–21 (citing AR at 808 (Tab 21b2) (AOI’s Proposal); and AR at 7358 (Tab 41b2) (Novilo’s Proposal)).     In response to AttainX and Unissant, the government states, “[plaintiffs] cannot prevail on a claim of disparate treatment . . . because [they] cannot show that CBP ‘unreasonably downgraded [their] proposal[s] for defi ciencies that were “substantively indistinguishable” or \nnearly identical from those contained in other proposals.’”  Gov’t’s Group 1 Reply at 12, 27–28 (quoting Office Design Grp. v. United States , 951 F.3d 1366, 1373 (Fed. Cir. 2020) ).  Similarly, \nin resp onding to AOI, the government contends “AOI’s disparate treatment claim is really just a \ndisagreement over the agency’s technical evaluation and conclusion[s].”  Gov’t’s Cross -MJAR \nand Resp. to Group 2 at 72 (citations omitted) .  According to the government, “AOI \nmisunderstands the quotes that the awardees submitted” and cannot satisfy the test set forth in Office Design because the awardees’ quotes are substantively different from AOI’s.  Id. at 70.  \nFAR 1.102-2 requires government agencies to treat “[a]ll contractors and prospective \ncontractors . . . fairly and impartially,” but emphasizes they “ need not be treated the same .”  \nFAR 1.102-2(c)(3) (emphasis added); see also Frawner Corp. v. United States , 161 Fed. Cl. 420, \n452 (2022) (noting under the FAR and Federal Circuit precedent, “a plaintiff must establish more than just varying treatment to meet its burden of showing disparate treatment.”).  Thus, to \nsucceed on a disparate treatment claim, see supra Section V.A.4, a “protestor must show that the \nagency unreasonably downgraded its proposal for deficiencies that were ‘substantively \nindistinguishable’ or nearly identical from those contained in other proposals” or “that the \nagency inconsistently applied objective solicitation requirements between it and other offerors, \nsuch as proposal page limits . . . or submission deadlines.”  O ffice Design Grp. , 951 F.3d at 1372 \n(quoting Enhanced Vets. Sols, Inc. v. United States , 131 Fed. Cl. 565, 588 (2017)).  This test \nensures reviewing courts do not have “free reign to second-guess the agency’s discretionary determinations,” id. at 1373, by limiting judicial review to situations in which a challenger contends an agency disparately treated “nearly identical provisions in the proposals unde r \nconsideration.”  Enhanced Veterans Sols., 131 Fed. Cl. at 588.  Here, all three protestors argue CBP employed a different standard when evaluating their RREPs than when evaluating those of the awardees.  See AttainX MJAR at 19; Unissant MJAR at 24 –25; AO I MJAR at 15 –16.  Citing \nthe rule from Office Design , the government replies, no plaintiff has overcome the “high burden, \ndesigned to separate the Court’s role from the agency’s,” which requires a showing CBP Case 1:23-cv-01610-RTH   Document 187   Filed 03/07/24   Page 105 of 108- 106 - \n “unreasonably downgraded” plaintiffs’ proposals “for deficiencies that were ‘substantively \nindistinguishable’ or nearly identical from those contained in other proposals.”  See Gov’t’s \nCross -MJAR and Resp. to Group 2 at 70 (quoting Office Design Grp. , 951 F.3d at 1373).   \n \nPlaintiffs acknowledged at oral argument “trying to apply the Office Design  standard to \nthis set of facts is difficult,” Tr. at 303:3 –17 (Unissant), because each bidder’s proposal contains \nunique RREPs different in substance and kind than those presented by other offerors.  The government similarly stated at oral argument each offeror’s RREPs are “so far afield” from those of other offerors application of the Office Design test is impractical.  See Tr. at 309:14–310:16.  Both in briefing and at oral argument, plaintiffs acknowledged their proposals differ in meaningful ways from those they allege are “substantively indistinguishable” or nearly identical.  \nOffice Design Grp. , 951 F.3d at 1372 (internal quotations omitted).  For instance, despite arguing \nCBP engaged in disparate treatment  when it “stated Unissant did not address the  . . . [Task 2] \nrequirement” of performing 24x7x365 on-call remote support because “Unissant did not mention 24x7x365 support” in its Task 2 RREPs, Unissant recognizes the “awardees[’] [offers] . . . \n[explicitly] mentioned ‘24x7x365 support’ [in their Task 2 RREPs].”  Unissant MJAR at 24–25.  AttainX makes a similar concession.  Indeed, although contending at oral argument “[t]he focus on 24/7/365 . . . is mi splaced,” Tr. at 298:11–13, AttainX acknowledges such support experience \nis explicitly discussed in the awardees’ proposals but “is not in [AttainX’s] proposal.”  Tr. at 298:16–299:2.  AOI likewise  alleges it experienced disparate treatment without adequately \nshowing its RREPs were “substantively indistinguishable” from those of the awardees discussed \nin its MJAR.  O ffice Design Grp. , 951 F.3d at 1372.  To the contrary, AOI acknowledges its \nRREPs in issue were substantively different from those of the awardees.  Tr. at 309:7–12 (“[AOI:]  So we are not necessarily looking to whether there’s substantively indistinguishable components between these experiences, which by their nature have to be different because they are different experiences, but whether the Ag ency conducted the evaluation fairly and \nevenhandedly.”) ; see AOI MJAR at 15 –27.  Thus, although Unissant, AttainX , and AOI largely \ncontend CBP disparately treated “substantively indistinguishable” proposals, O ffice Design Grp. , \n951 F.3d at 1372 (internal quotations omitted), they  admit their RREPs were substantively \ndifferent than those of the awardees discussed in their MJARs.   \n \nAs expressly stated by the Federal Circuit, a court reviewing an agency’s discretionary \ndeterminat ions does not have “free reign to second guess” agency decisions, including when \nprotestors allege disparate treatment.  O ffice Design Grp. , 951 F.3d at 1373.  Rather, the Court is \npermitted to intervene only when a plaintiff succeeds in showing “ the agency unreasonably \ndowngraded its proposal for deficiencies that were ‘substantively indistinguishable’ or nearly \nidentical from those contained in other proposals.”  Id.  at 1372.  As explained , supra, all three \nplaintiffs argue their proposals were treated disparately from those of awardees, but in doing so, \nthey expressly recognize differences between their RREPs and those they must show are “nearly \nidentical” to theirs in order to prevail on their claims.  Id.  The Court will not “interfere with the \nagency’s broad discretion,” id. at 1373, by substituting its judgment regarding whether individual \nRREPs meet the solicitation’s requirements for CBP’s.  See supra.  Rather, because plaintiffs are \nunable to show their RREPs at issue are “substantively indistinguishable” from those of the \nawardees, “the [C]ourt . . . dismiss[es] the[se] claim[s].”  O ffice Design Grp. , 951 F.3d at 1372–\n73; see also FAR 1.102- 2(c)(3).  \n Case 1:23-cv-01610-RTH   Document 187   Filed 03/07/24   Page 106 of 108- 107 -  \n D.  Whether CBP’s Decision Prejudiced C MCI  and Constellation   \n \nAs noted, supra Section s VI.A.4 and VI.B.2.a , CBP acted arbitrarily and capriciously in:  \n(1) finding CMCI’s RREP 1 for Task 3 did not address the subtask related to “managing a \ncentralized library of annotated data,” AR at 10088 (TAB 71) (Track 2 TET Consolidated \nReview); (2)  failing to adequately explain its reason for deeming CMCI’s Task 5 RREP 2 \ninsufficient, id.; and (3) finding Constellatio n’s RREP 1, Task 3 did “not show an understanding \nof the O&M requirements in the scope of work, ” AR at 10569 (TAB 88e3) (CBP Evaluation of \nConstellation).  T he Solicitation stated “[i]f the Government determines any of the required two \n(2) RREPs are not similar in scope and complexity, the quotation will be ineligible for award and will not be further evaluated ,” see supra Section I.A.  AR at 689 (TAB 18.2) (S olicitation) ; see \nsupra Tr. at 228:15–22 (“[THE COURT:]  [W]hen an offeror submitted an RREP that is not \nsimilar in scope and complexity, CBP would eliminate the offeror from award.  Is it from award for the entire contract or just that a specific task? . . . [THE GOVERNMENT]:  From a full track.  . . .”); Tr. at 19:8–14 (THE COURT: . . . [W]hat do you think it means, “The quotation will be ineligible for award and will not be further evaluated?”  That allows the Government still some discretionary wiggle r oom?  [PLAINTIFF SPOKESPERSON UNISSANT]:  The words mean \nwhat they say.  They will be ineligible for award.”).  CBP’s  reasoning for CMCI’s and \nConstellation ’s other RREP submissions was not arbitrary and capricious , see supra Sections  \nVI.A.4.a and VI.B.2, and CBP therefore properly eliminated them. \n CMCI and Constellation do not have a substantial chance of award because of  their  \nrespective dissimilar RREPs under Task 3 and Task 5, see supra Sections  VI.A.4.a and VI.B.2.  \nCMCI  and Constellation ha ve therefore failed to  “show a significant, prejudicial error in the \nprocurement process.”   Alfa Laval Separation, 175 F.3d at 1367 (“ To prevail in a bid protest, a \nprotestor must show a significant, prejudicial error in the procurement process.  . . . To establish prejudice, a protestor . . . must show ‘that there was a substantial chance it would have received the contract award but for that error.’”); Bannum , 404 F.3d at 1353.   \n  E.  Whether the Court Should Grant An Injunction\n20 \n  Track 1 and Track 2 plaintiffs both argue they are entitled to injunctive relief.   See, \ne.g., LSI MJAR at 8 –10; Constellation MJAR at 6 –7; Arch MJAR at 33–40; GTS MJAR at 32 –\n33; AttainX MJAR at 10 –28; Unissant Reply at 15–18;  Ekagra MJAR at 21 –23; AOI MJA R at \n29–32; CMCI MJAR at 10.  Track 1 plaintiffs explicitly allege:  (1) they  “demonstrated actual \nsuccess on the merits,”  see, e.g ., Arch MJAR at 36; (2) the “significant irreparable injury in the \nform of lost profits, lost critical contracting opportunit ies, and the loss of . . . rights to a fair \ncompetition” tip the balance of hardships in their favor,  id. at 38; (3) and the “strong public interest in maintaining the integrity of the procurement process” entitles them to injunctive relief, id. at 38 –39 ( citations omitted ).  Track 2 plaintiffs similarly allege they are “entitled to injunctive \nrelief,” AttainX MJAR at 10 –28.  See also  Unissant Reply at 15–18 (“[T]he injunctive factors \n \n20 At oral argument, the parties addressed how an injunction would impact the contract roll -out timeline and stated \nthe CBP must award the contract all at once, treating the awardees as a “group,” and  could not  break up or stagger \nawards  in the case of injunction.  See Tr. at 34 1:21–23 (“THE COURT:  So they would all start out as a fixed group? \n[GOVERNMENT]: I think for the two tracks, yes.”).

Plaintiffs here are not entitled to injunctive relief because they do not prevail on the merits.  See supra Sections V –VI.  The Court therefore need not consider the remaining three permanent \ninjunction factors.  Info. Tech., 51 Fed.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: The case involves a motion to centralize multiple lawsuits across different districts, concerning allegations that video game developers and technology companies deliberately designed games with addictive features to trap minors and young adults in prolonged gameplay, potentially leading to addiction. Artificial intelligence (AI) mechanisms, alongside feedback loops, reward systems, and pay-to-win options, are alleged to be part of these addictive features. The court denied the motion for centralization, citing the lack of common factual questions across the actions and the varied defendants and games involved.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the various lawsuits concerning alleged addiction caused by video games should be centralized into one court as part of a multidistrict litigation (MDL).\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court denied the motion to centralize the lawsuits, determining that centralization would not promote the convenience of parties or witnesses nor facilitate the just and efficient conduct of the litigation due to significant differences in the facts of each case and the defendants involved.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine several people from different towns are suing video game companies because they say the games are designed to be as addictive as possible. Some people argue that all these separate lawsuits should be combined into one big case to make things easier. However, the judge looked at the cases and noticed that there are a lot of differences between them, like the different games and companies involved, so it wouldn't really make things simpler to put them all together. So, the judge decided not to combine them into one big case.",

Since the filing of the motion, the Panel has been notified of \nten related actions.   The cases in  this litigation are individual personal injury actions alleging \nthat video game developers , digital app stores, and other technology companies  have developed  \nand sold video games and related products with psychologically addictive features  for the purpose  \nof causing addiction to video games among minors and young adults.  In total, the fifteen actions \nin this docket are pending in ten districts.  \n  All responding defendants oppose centralization.\n1 If the actions are centralized over their \nobjections, they request the Eastern District of Arkansas or the Northern District of Georgia as transferee district.\n2 \n \n On the basis of the papers filed and the hearing session held, we conclude that centralizati on \nwill not serve the convenience of the parties and witnesses or further the just and efficient conduct \nof the litigation.

The differences among the actions, \nhowever, are substantial : there is a broad range of games and defendants in each action, with the \nat-issue games only partially overlapping.  For example, the video games at issue in Dunn are \nBattlefield, Call of Duty, Fortnite, and Rainbow Six; the games at issue in Jiminez  are Fortnite, \nMinecraft, and Roblox; the games at issue in Angelilli are Call of Duty, Fortnite, Roblox, and \nGrand Theft Auto; and the games at issue in Glasscock are Call of Duty, World of Warcraft, and \nOverwatch .3  The related actions also involve over 30 different defendants , and many are involved \nin just one or two action s – e.g., Another Axiom Inc., Banana Analytics, Bluestacks by Now.GG, \nDell, Innersloth LLC, Meta, MSI  Computer Corp., and VR Chat, Inc . \n \n Plaintiffs attempt to overcome the differences among the products and defendants by \nasserting that an alleged common conspiracy supports centralization – specifically, that defendants \n“conspired or acted in co ncert to addict a generation of young video game players.”4  Indeed, a ll \nof the complaints bring a claim for civil conspiracy.   But in each action, the alleged conspiracy \nclaim is pled against a different group of defendants and involves different combina tions of gaming \nproducts.  Given the different products and defendants involved in each alleged conspiracy, \ncentralization  is not warranted.5 \n  Plaintiffs also assert that the number of actions is likely to expand, asserting during oral \nargument that there would be  10,000 additional actions.  But “the mere possibility of additional \nactions does not support centralization, even where thousands of a ctions are predicted.”\n6  We note, \nhowever, that  our decision to deny centralization here is not based on an insufficient number of \nactions, but rather the lack of common factual questions in this litigation.  \n \n Informal coordination is a practicable altern ative to centralization.  Plaintiffs in all \nactions on the motion and seven of the ten potential tag -along actions share counsel  and have \nrepresented in the briefing that they have coordinated, and will continue to coordinate with, other  \ngroups of plaintif fs involved in this litigation.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: This case concerns John Robert Demos, a prisoner who filed a lawsuit against various high-tech and oil companies alleging antitrust violations, including the misuse of artificial intelligence (AI) products. He claimed these companies have created monopolies and engaged in numerous antitrust activities. The court dismissed the case with prejudice, citing a lack of antitrust standing and the speculative nature of the claims.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the plaintiff has antitrust standing to bring claims against high-tech and oil companies for alleged antitrust violations using AI products.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court held that the plaintiff lacks antitrust standing, as the alleged injuries do not demonstrate harm to competition, which is necessary to claim an antitrust violation. The court dismissed the complaint with prejudice, determining that the claims were speculative and could not be cured by additional facts.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine someone is upset that big tech and oil companies are very powerful, and they blame it on the way these companies use technology and work together. This person goes to court saying these companies are cheating in business to become too big. The court looked at the claim and decided it didn't make sense because it didn't show how it affected other businesses or everyday people. They told the person that their case didn’t have the right kind of evidence to continue, so they closed the case for good.",

Plaintiff has been granted \nleave to proceed in forma pauperis  in a separate order.  His complain t (Dkt. No. 1) is now before \nthe Court for review under 28 U.S.C. § 1915A.  \nDISCUSSION  \nA. Standard of Review  \nA federal court must engage in a preliminary screening of any case in which a prisoner \nseeks redress from a governmental entity, or from an officer or an employee of a governmental \nentity.  28 U.S.C. § 1915A(a).  In its review, the Court must identify any cognizable claims, and \ndismiss any claims which are frivolous, malicious, fail to state a claim upon which relief may be \ngranted, or seek monetary r elief from a defendant who is immune from such relief.  See 28 U.S.C. \n§ 1915A(b) (1), (2).  Pro se  pleadings must be liberally construed.  Balistreri v. Pacifica Police \nDep’t, 901 F.2d 696, 699 (9th Cir. 1990).  \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a)(2) requires only “a short and plain statement of the \nclaim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2).  “Specific facts are not Case 4:19-cv-04433-HSG   Document 5   Filed 11/27/19   Page 1 of 4 \n2 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  necessary; the statement need only ‘give the defendant fair notice of what the . . . . claim is and the \ngrounds upon which it rests.’”  Erickson v. Pardus , 551 U.S. 89, 93 (2007) (citations omitted).  \n“[A] plaintiff’s obligation to provide the ‘grounds’ of his ‘entitle[ment] to relief’ requires more \nthan labels and  conclusions, and a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not \ndo. . . . Factual allegations must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level.”  \nBell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly , 550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007) (citation s omitted).  A complaint must \nproffer “enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.”  Id. at 570.  \nB. Complaint  \nThe complaint names as defendants Google, Apple, Oracle, Facebook, Yahoo, You Tube, \nInstagram, Amazon, Intel and AT&T, which the complaint identifies as “high tech” companies.  \nThe complaint also names as defendants certain oil companies:  Mobil, Occidental, Shell, \nStandard Oil, GulfFoil, Sunoco, Phillips 66, Marathon, Texaco, Pennzoil, and Exxon.   \nAccording to the compla int, plaintiff has been a user of “artificial intelligence products” \nand “intellectual property products” for many years while incarcerated in the state of California, \nand continues to be a user of such products while incarcerated in Washington State.  He alleges \nthat the violations enumerated in the complaint took place in the state of California, from 1967 to \n2019.   \nThe high tech industry and oil industry are in a symbiotic relationship.  The high tech \nindustry uses oil to build, construct and power thei r products.  The major oil companies “utilize \nartificial intelligence to facilitate their accounting, business, treasury and corporate functions.”  \nTogether, the identified high tech companies and oil companies have violated anti -trust laws by \noperating mo nopolies; participating in tying arrangements; engaging in illegal tying price fixing, \nreciprocal dealing, collusion, gratuities, predatory pricing, horizontal price fixing, predatory \nmergers and acquisitions, restraint of trade and general corrupt behavio r; committing fraud and \ncorporate malfeasance; misusing intellectual property; imposing vertical restraints on territorial \nsales; placing malfunctioning products on the market and in commerce.  In addition, plaintiff’s life \nis in imminent danger because (1 ) “all of America’s nuclear secrets have been downloaded on \nhard drive computer disc” and there has been a breach of security which compromises plaintiff’s Case 4:19-cv-04433-HSG   Document 5   Filed 11/27/19   Page 2 of 4 \n3 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  health and security; (2) software giants such as Amazon, Google, Yahoo and Apple rule the \ninformatio n highway; (3) America’s defense system is computer driven and security breaches to \ncomputer technology place plaintiff in danger; and (4) the issuance of digital currency by \nFacebook will make every individual a slave of the state and give everyone a mark  of the beast, \nplacing plaintiff in imminent danger.  Defendants’ actions violate the Sherman Act, the Robinson -\nPatman Act, the Clayton Act, the Hart -Scott -Rodino Act, the Wilson Tariff Act, the Sarbanes -\nOxley Act.  Plaintiff seeks antitrust damages in the  amount of $25 million dollars.  See Dkt. No. 1.  \nThe complaint will be DISMISSED with prejudice because plaintiff lacks antitrust \nstanding.  The antitrust laws do not provide a remedy to every party injured by unlawful economic \nconduct.  American Ad Mgmt. , Inc. v. Gen. Tel. Co. of Cal. , 190 F.3d 1051, 1055 (9th Cir. 1999).  \nAntitrust laws are only intended to preserve competition for the benefit of consumers.  See Assoc,  \nGen. Contractors of Calif. , Inc. v. Calif.  State Council of Carpenters , 459 U.S. 519, 530, 538 \n(1983).  A party wishing to bring a private antitrust action must establish antitrust injury.  \nAmerican Ad Mgmt., Inc. v. Gen. Tel. Co. of Cal. , 190 F.3d 1051, 1054 & n.3 (9th Cir. 1999); \nCargill, Inc. v. Monfort of Colorado, Inc. , 479 U.S. 104, 1 10 n.5 (1986) (requiring antitrust injury \nto seek injunctive relief under the Clayton Act).   \n \nTo show antitrust injury, a plaintiff must prove that his loss flows from an anticompetitive \naspect or effect of the defendant’s behavior, since it is inimical t o the antitrust laws to \naward damages for losses stemming from acts that do not hurt competition.  If the injury \nflows from aspects of the defendant’s conduct that are beneficial or neutral to competition, \nthere is no antitrust injury, even if the defendan t’s conduct is illegal per se.  \nRebel Oil Co. v. Atl. Richfield Co. , 51 F.3d 1421, 1433 (9th Cir. 1995) (citing Atl. Richfield Co. v. \nUSA Petroleum, Inc. , 495 U.S. 328, 334 (1990)) (private suit brought under Section 4 of the \nClayton Act).  The losses alle ged by plaintiff are (1) a breach of national security or vulnerabilities \nin our national security system, and (2) being marked as a slave of the state because he will be \nforced to use digital currency.  These alleged losses do not hurt competition, and ar e not antitrust \ninjuries.   \n In addition, the complaint’s speculative and conclusory allegations that numerous \nindividual high tech companies and numerous individual oil companies have coordinated antitrust \nactivities fail to raise a right to relief above the speculative level.  Case 4:19-cv-04433-HSG   Document 5   Filed 11/27/19   Page 3 of 44 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  The Court DISMISSES the complaint with prejudice because the pleading could not \npossibly be cured by the allegation of other facts.  See Ramirez v. Galaza , 334 F.3d 850, 861 (9th \nCir. 2003).  \nCONCLUSION  \nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court DISMISSES this action with prejudice.  The Clerk \nshall enter judgment in favor of defendants and against plaintiff.  \nIT IS SO ORDERED.  \nDated:  11/27/2019 \n______________________________________  \nHAYWOOD S.
