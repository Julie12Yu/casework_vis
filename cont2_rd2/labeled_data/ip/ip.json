    "summary": "**1. Summary:** This court case involves a lawsuit filed by a group of artists against several companies, including Stability AI, Midjourney, and DeviantArt, alleging that these companies used their copyrighted artworks without permission to train an AI software known as Stable Diffusion. The artists claim this AI can produce images that imitate their artistic styles and that this imitation constitutes direct copyright infringement. The court granted in part and denied in part the defendants' motions to dismiss, allowing the copyright claims to proceed but dismissing other claims, such as those under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), due to a lack of sufficient allegations.\n\n**2. Key Legal Issue:** Whether the alleged use of copyrighted artworks to train AI models like Stable Diffusion constitutes direct copyright infringement and whether related claims, like those under the DMCA, are legally viable.\n\n**3. Court's Holding:** The court allowed the direct copyright infringement claims to proceed against all defendants, finding the allegations sufficient to survive the motions to dismiss. However, it dismissed the DMCA claims with prejudice, concluding they failed to meet legal requirements, and also dismissed the unjust enrichment claims with leave to amend, noting possible preemption by the Copyright Act.\n\n**4. ELI5 explanation:** Imagine a group of artists found out their artworks were being used to train a computer program to make new pictures that look like theirs, all without asking for permission. They took the program's creators to court, saying this isn't fair and breaks copyright rules. The judge decided the artists have a good enough reason to argue the copyright part but didn't think their other complaints about misleading license information were strong enough. The artists might get another chance to fix that part of their complaint.",

Nos. 160, 162, 163, 164, 169  \n \nDefendants Stability AI Ltd. and Stability AI, Inc. (collectively “Stability AI”), \nMidjourney, Inc., DeviantArt, Inc. , and Runway AI , Inc. move to dismiss various claims from \nplaintiffs’ First Amended Complaint (“FAC,” Dkt. No. 129).  For the reasons discussed below, \nthose motions are GRANTED in part and DENIED in part.   \nBACKGROUND  \nArtists Sarah Andersen, Kelly McKernan, Karla Ortiz, Hawke Southworth, Grzegorz \nRutkowski, Gregory Manchess, Gerald Brom, Jingna Zhang, Julia Kaye, and Adam Ellis \n(“Plaintiffs”1) filed this putative class action on behalf of artists challenging the defendants’ \ncreation and/or use of Stable Diffusion, an artificial intelligence (“AI”) software product .  They \nallege that Stable Diffusion use d plaintiffs’ artistic works as “training images” and as a result \nStable Diffusion can produce output images “in the style” of those images .  See generally  FAC.  In \nthe FAC, plaintiffs allege claims against the three defendants identified in the original complaint \n(Stability AI , Midjourney,  and DeviantArt ) and against a new defendant, Runway AI.2  Plaintiffs \n \n1 In their FAC, plaintiffs reasserted claims for the three original plaintiffs (Sarah Anderson, Kelly \nMcKernan, and Karla Ortiz) and added – without the court permission – seven additional plaintiffs \n(H. Southworth PKA Hawke Southworth, Grzegorz Rutkowski, G regory Manchess, Gerald Brom, \nJingna Zhang, Julia Kaye, and Adam Ellis).  FAC ¶¶ 14 -23.   \n \n2 The basic factual allegations regarding how defendants’ AI products were trained and work were Case 3:23-cv-00201-WHO     Document 223     Filed 08/12/24     Page 1 of 33 \n2 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  contend that  Runway AI worked with, helped train, and then distribute d Stable Diffusion with \nStability AI.  Plaintiffs assert that Runway ma de a text -to-image generator available via its online \nAI image product called AI Magic Tools.  \nPlaintiffs’ claims center first around the creation of the LAION training sets , where five \nbillion images were allegedly scrap ed into datasets  used by Stability and Runway to train the \nversions of Stable Diffusion .  FAC ¶ 4.  Plaintiffs state that Midjourney likewise trained its \nproduct using Stable Diffusion, and that all four defendants use Stable Diffusion in their AI \nproducts ; in doing so , those four defendants  copy or utilize  versions of plaintiffs’  artistic works.  \nId. ¶¶ 5 -6.  Significantly, plaintiffs allege that the “LAION -5B dataset contains only URLs of \ntraining images, not the actual training images. Therefore, anyone who wishes to use LAION -5B \nfor training their own machine learning model must first acquire copies of the actual training \nimages from their URLs using the img2dataset or other similar tool.”  FAC  ¶ 221.  They also  \nclarif y their theory of direct infringement, adding allegations regarding CLIP -guided diffusion in \nthe training phase but also in use, after training.  Id. ¶¶ 82 -150.   \nPlaintiffs assert  claims on behalf of six different classes:  \n“Injunctive Relief Class ” under Rule 23(b)(2): All persons or entities nationalized or \ndomiciled in the United States that own a copyright interest in any work that was used to train any \nversion of an AI image product that was offered directly or incorporated into another product  by \none or more Defendants during the Class Period.   FAC ¶ 34.  \n“Damages Class ” under Rule 23(b)(3): All persons or entities nationalized or domiciled in \nthe United States that own a copyright interest in any work that was used to train any version of an \nAI image product that was offered directly or incorporated into another product  by one or more \nDefendants during the Class Period.   Id. \n“LAION -5B Damages Subclass ” under Rule 23(b)(3) : All persons or entities nationalized \nor domiciled in the United States that own a registered copyright in any work in the LAION -5B \n \nidentified in my prior Order and will not be repeated here.  See October 30, 2023, Order at Dkt. \nNo. 1 17.  To the extent new, material allegations have been added to the FAC, they will be \naddressed as part of the substantive analysis below.

Bus. & Prof. Code § 17200 and California Common Law on behalf \nof the DeviantArt Plaintiffs.  \nIn October 2023, I largely granted the motions to dismiss brought by defendants Stability, \nMidjourney and DeviantArt.  The only claim that survived was the direct infringement claim Case 3:23-cv-00201-WHO     Document 223     Filed 08/12/24     Page 4 of 33 \n5 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  asserted against Stability, based on Stability’s alleged “ creation and use of ‘Training Images ’ \nscraped from the internet into the LAION datasets and then used to train Stable Diffusion. ” \nOctober 2023 Order  at 7.  The remainder of the claims were dismissed with leave, so that plaintiffs \ncould amend “ to provide clarity regarding their theories of how each defendant separately violated \ntheir copyrights, removed or altered their copyright management information, or violated their \nrights of publicity and plausi ble facts in support .”  Id. at 1. \nAs one  example, I required plaintiffs on amendment to address the following deficiencies \nwith a second theory of direct infringement, separate from the creating and use of images for \ntraining theory : \n \nPlaintiffs will be required to amend to clarify their theory with respect \nto compressed copies of Training Images and to state facts in support \nof how Stable Diffusion – a program that is open source, at least in \npart – operates with respect to the Trainin g Images. If plaintiffs \ncontend Stable Diffusion contains “compressed copies” of the \nTraining Images, they need to define “compressed copies” and \nexplain plausible facts in support. And if plaintiffs’ compressed \ncopies theory is based on a contention that Stable Diffusion contains \nmathematical or statistical methods that can be carried out through \nalgorithms or instructions in order to reconstruct the Training Images \nin whole or in part to create the new Output Images, they need to \nclarify that and provide  plausible facts in support.  \nOctober 2023 Order at 8 -9; see also id . 9 n.7 (“ Plaintiffs’ second theory of direct infringement – \nthat Stable Diffusion is a ‘derivative work ’ because it contains compressed copies of billions of \ncopyrighted images and by incorporating Stable Diffusion into ” defendants’ own AI product s, \ndefendants are “ liable for producing works that have been ‘transformed ’ based on plaintiffs’ works  \n[] fails for the same reasons. ”).   \nPlaintiffs add ed defendant Runway AI and seven new plaintiffs  when it filed the FAC .  \nEach defendant moves to dismiss.  \nLEGAL STANDARD  \nUnder FRCP 12(b)(6), a district court must dismiss a complaint if it fails to state a claim \nupon which relief can be granted.  To survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, the plaintiff must \nallege “enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausibl e on its face.”  Bell Atl. Corp. v.  \nTwombly , 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007).  A claim is facially plausible when the plaintiff pleads facts Case 3:23-cv-00201-WHO     Document 223     Filed 08/12/24     Page 5 of 33 \n6 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  that “allow the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the \nmisconduct alleged.”  Ashcroft v. Iqbal , 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) (citation omitted).  There must \nbe “more than a sheer possibility that a defendant has acted unlawfully.”  Id.  While courts do not \nrequire “heightened fact pleading of specifics,” a plaintiff must allege facts sufficient to “raise a \nright to relief above the speculative level.”  Twombly , 550 U.S. at 555, 570.   \nIn deciding whether the plaintiff has stated a claim upon which relief can be granted, the \nCourt accepts the plaintiff’s allegations as true and draws all reasonable inferences in favor of the \nplaintiff.  See Usher v. City of Los Angeles , 828 F.2d 556, 561 (9th Cir. 1987).  However,  \nthe court is not required to accept as true “allegations that are merely conclusory, unwarranted \ndeductions of fact, or unreasonable inferences.”  In re Gilead Scis. Sec. Litig ., 536 F.3d 1049, \n1055 (9th Cir. 2008).  If the court dismisses the complaint, it “should grant leave to amend even if \nno request to amend the pleading was made, unless it determines that the pleading could not \npossibly be cured by the allegation of other facts.”  Lopez v. Smith , 203 F.3d 1122, 1127 (9th Cir. \n2000).  In making this de termination, the court should consider factors such as “the presence or \nabsence of undue delay, bad faith, dilatory motive, repeated failure to cure deficiencies by \nprevious amendments, undue prejudice to the opposing party and futility of the proposed \namendment.”  Moore v. Kayport Package Express , 885 F.2d 531, 538 (9th Cir. 1989).  \nDISCUSSION  \nI. ADDITION OF NEW PLAINTIFFS & CLAIMS  \nStability objects to the addition of seven new plaintiffs to the FAC, as well as the addition \nof two new claims against it (induced infringement, Count 2) and unjust enrichment (Count 4).  \nStability MTD, Dkt. No. 162 at 13 -14.  DeviantArt similarly objects to the addition of new \nplaintiffs and the addition of the unjust enrichment claim.  DeviantArt MTD, Dkt. No. 163, at 23-\n24.  Defendants argue  that the addition of the new plaintiffs and claims exceeds the scope of the \nleave to amend I allowed plaintiffs i n the October 2023 Order and, therefore, the new plaintiffs \nand claims should be stricken.  \nPlaintiffs respond that  they were given  broad  “leave to amend and attempt to cure the \ndeficiencies identified” in their claims and the ability of the then three named plaintiffs to pursue Case 3:23-cv-00201-WHO     Document 223     Filed 08/12/24     Page 6 of 33 \n7 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  the claims asserted .  Because leave was not cabined to “solely” or exclusively correct the \ndeficiencies , plaintiffs argue that the additions were permissible  and in any event should be \nallowed under Rule 15’s liberal amendment standard .  See Oppo. to Stability, Dkt. No. 174 , at 22; \nOppo. to DeviantArt, Dkt. No. 177 , at 21 -22. \n Plaintiffs are correct that leave  to amend under Rule 15 is “freely given,” especially at the \nstart of a case.  However, once a complaint is dismissed and  a court grants plaintiffs specific leave \nto amend to address  identified  legal or factual deficiencies , adding plaintiffs or claims beyond \nthose previously alleged requires either requesting and securing leave , which plaintiffs did not do, \nor the consent of defendants, which plaintiffs did not seek.  See Fed. R. Civ. P, 15(a)(2) (“In all \nother cases, a pa rty may amend its pleading only with the opposing party’s written consent or the \ncourt’s leave.”).5   \nThat said, I would have granted leave to amend if plaintiffs had sought leave , given the \nlack of prejudice to defendants.   At this juncture, where each d efendant has  addressed the newly \nadded claims and plaintiffs , it would elevate form over substance to grant the motions to dismiss \non this ground.  And I will assume that plaintiffs have implicitly sought  leave to amend to include \nthe new plaintiffs and claims in a Second Amended Complaint.  I will grant leave and address the \narguments defendants make again st the added claims and plaintiffs .6 \nII. STABILITY AI MOTION TO DISMISS  \nA. Induced Copyright  Infringement  \nStability challenges plaintiffs ’ first theory of induced copyright infringement  interpreting \nthe claim as one alleging that the Stable Diffusion models themselves are infringing works .  Under \nthis theory, Stability is inducing infringement by distributing the models when any third -party \n \n5 The only case relied on by plaintiffs is totally inapposite.  It addresses a situation where plaintiffs \nwere given leave to amend to file a second amended complaint and revised motion for class \ncertification by stipulation , and after the court consolidated cases, defendants moved to dismiss the \nnew plaintiffs based on statute of limitations grounds.  See Bos. Ret. Sys. v. Uber Techs., Inc ., No. \n19-CV-06361 -RS, 2021 WL 4503137, at *2 (N.D. Cal. Oct. 1, 2021).  \n \n6 As explained below, the end result is that plaintiffs may file a Second Amended Complaint \nincluding the new plaintiffs and may attempt to plead unjust enrichment claims against any \ndefendant based on theories (if any) t hat are not preempted by the Copyright Act.  \n Case 3:23-cv-00201-WHO     Document 223     Filed 08/12/24     Page 7 of 33 \n8 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  downloads, uses, or deploys  the models provided by Stability.  See FAC, Count Two (alleging \ncontributory infringement by “distributing Stable Diffusion 2.0 and Stable Diffusion XL 1.0 for \nfree” on “behalf of the LAION -5B Registered Plaintiffs and Damages Subclass”) ¶¶ 233 -236.7  \nStability argues , first, that this theory is simply a repackaged direct infringement theory , \nthat by “distributing” Stable Diffusion , Stability violates plaintiffs’ exclusive rights of distribution \nof their works.8  But whether this is a direct infringement claim (where liability is imposed against \nStability for distributing copyrighted works) or more properly characterized as an inducement \nclaim (where liability is imposed because Stability induces or otherwise causes o thers to copy \nprotectible material) depends on how Stable Diffusion works and is implemented by users other \nthan Stability itself.  Any potential overlap – or potential requirement for plaintiffs to elect one \nclaim or another – is better addressed on summa ry judgment, after discovery.  \nStability also argues  that the inducement claim must be dismissed to the extent plaintiffs \nare alleging that Stability encourages the use of Stable Diffusion to create infringing outputs .  That \ntheory is barred, according to Stability, because p laintiffs fail to allege any facts that Stability \npromoted the use of Stable Diffusion to “infringe copyright, as shown by clear expression or other \naffirmative steps taken to foster infringement.” Metro -Goldwyn -Mayer Studios Inc. v. Grokster, \nLtd., 545 U.S. 913, 919 (2005).  Stability argues  that given the lack of  allegations supporting a \nspecific intent by Stability to promote infringement, the claim fails.   \nHowever, p laintiffs point to  one statement by Stability’s CEO that Stability to ok 100,000 \ngigabytes of images and compressed it to a two -gigabyte file that can “recreate ” any of those \nimages .9  Stability  responds  that the “ isolated ” use of the word “create” by its CEO cannot \n \n7 Stability does not challenge plaintiffs’  claim of direct copyright infringement, as that survived \nthe prior motion to dismiss.  October 2023 Order at 7.  \n \n8  Stability also contends this theory is another take on the “derivative” works claim I dismissed in \nthe October 2023 Order.  However, that claim was dismissed in large part because of the \nambiguity and lack of plausible facts that Stable Diffusion was itself  a “derivative work” because \nit contain ed compressed copies of billions of copyrighted images.  See October 2023 Order at 10 \nn.7.  Plaintiffs were given leave to amend their compressed copies theor y in support of direct \ncopyright infringement with respect to the fully trained Stable Diffusion product, and as discussed \nwith respect to the motions to dismiss below, have plausibly done so.    \n \n9 See FAC ¶ 4 (“Emad Mostaque described it thus: ‘Stable Diffusion is the model itself. It’s a Case 3:23-cv-00201-WHO     Document 223     Filed 08/12/24     Page 8 of 33 \n9 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  demonstrate that it  intended to foster infringement.  Stability argues  that “clear allegations of \nactive steps to encourage direct infringement” are especially important here , where plaintiffs do \nnot dispute that Stable Diffusion is capable of substantial noninfringing uses, like creating art from \ninputs that do not reference particular artists or invoke particular artists’ styles or have any \nsubstantial similarity to plaintiff s’ works.  \nThe theory of this case is not similar to – for example – a case asserting contributory \ninfringement based on the sale of VCRs where , after discovery,  plaintiff had no evidence of \ndefendant’s intent to induce infringement.  The Supreme Court explained that, in those \ncircumstances, intent could not be “based on presuming or imputing intent to cause infringement \nsolely from the design or distribution of a product capab le of substantial lawful use, which the \ndistributor knows is in fact used for infringement.”  See Grokster, Ltd ., 545 U.S. at 933 \n(discussing holding of Sony  Corp. of America v. Universal City Studios, Inc ., 464 U.S. 417 \n(1984) ).  Instead, this is a case where plaintiffs allege that Stable Diffusion is built to a significant  \nextent on copyrighted works and that the way the product operates necessarily invokes copies  or \nprotected elements of those works.  The plausible inferences at this juncture are that Stable \nDiffusion by operation  by end users creates copyright infringement and was created to facilitate \nthat infringement by design.  In addition to the commen t of Stability’s CEO, plaintiffs reference \narticles by academics and others that  training images can sometimes be reproduced  as outputs \nfrom the AI products .  FAC ¶¶ 90, 130 -139.  \nWhether true and whether the result of a glitch (as Stability contends) or by design  \n(plaintiffs’ contention)  will be tested at a later date.   The allegations of induced infringement are \nsufficient.  \nB. DMCA  \nStability also moves again to dismiss plaintiffs ’ DMCA claims asserted under 17 U.S.C. \nsection 1202(a) for providing or distributing false copyright management information (“C MI”) \n \ncollaboration that we did with a whole bunch of people … We took 100,000 gigabytes of images \nand compressed it to a two -gigabyte file that can recreate any of those [images] and iterations of \nthose.’”).

At the hearing, plaintiffs argued that it is key for the \ndevelopment o f generative AI models to capture not only images but \nany accompanying text because that accompanying text is necessary \nto the models’ ability to “train” on key words associated with those \nimages. Tr. at 9:13 -24. But there is nothing in the Complaint about  \ntext CMI present in the images the named plaintiffs included with \ntheir online images that they contend was stripped or altered in \nviolation of the DMCA during the training of Stable Diffusion or the \nuse of the end -products. Plaintiffs must, on amendment,  identify the \nparticular types of their CMI from their works that they believe were \nremoved or altered.  \n \nIn addition, plaintiffs must clarify and then allege plausible facts \nregarding which defendants they contend did the stripping or altering \nin violation of the DMCA and when that occurred.  \nOctober 2023 Order at 18.  \n1. Claim Under 1202(a)  \nStability moves to dismiss the subsection (a) claim regarding false CMI.  Plaintiffs allege \nthat “Stability distributes the Stability Models under the MIT License (see, e.g. — \nhttps://github.com/Stability -AI/stablediffusion/blob/main/LICENSE). Within this license, Stability \nasserts copyright in the Stability Models. By asserting copyright in the Stability Models, which \ninfringe the copyrights of the LAION -5B Plaintiffs, Stability is providing and distributing false \nCMI in violation of 17 U.S.C. § 1202(a).”  FAC ¶ 248.  \nStability argues that this claim fails because Stability’s generic license does not suggest \nany association at all with plaintiffs’ works, and therefore was not made “in connection with” \nplaintiffs’ works which is necessary to support a claim under 1202(a).  See Logan v. Meta \nPlatforms, Inc ., 636 F. Supp. 3d 1052, 1062 (N.D. Cal. 2022) (plaintiff failed to allege facts \nshowing defendant “conveyed CMI in connection” with plaintiff’s photos where “Meta’s allegedly \n \n10 Section 1202(a) prohibits the knowing , with the intent to induce or enable infringement , \nprovision or distribution of false CMI.  Section 1202(b)(1) governs unpermitted removal or \nalteration of CMI and distribution of works with removed or altered CMI.  See 17 U.S.C.  § 1202 \net seq.

Course Hero, Inc ., No. 3:21 -CV-1242 (JBA), 2023 WL 5507845, at *4 (D. \nConn. Aug. 25, 2023 ) (“Thus, at the motion to dismiss stage, unless it is ‘implausible ’ that a \nviewer could understand the information to be referring to the defendant as the work’s copyright \nholder, dismissal is inappropriat e.”).  In addition, Stability contends that plaintiffs fail to allege \nfacts plausibly satisfying the “ double scienter ” required  under (a) ; that Stability knowingly \nprovided false CMI with the intent to induce or enable infringement.     \nI agree on both counts.  The generic license that accompanies use of Stable Diffusion on its \nface claims rights to Stable Diffusion as a work , not to the LAION dataset and not any works that \nwere used to create the LAION dataset.  It is implausible that a viewer reading the license \ndisclosure for Stable Diffusion would understand that Stability is claiming rights to or conveying \nany false information r egarding the rights of the plaintiffs  whose copyrighted works  are among the \nbillions of images in the LAION  datasets . \nThe 1202(a) claim is dismissed again, this time with prejudice as plaintiffs do not identify  \na basis for this claim.  \n2. Claim Under 1202(b)(1)  \nSimilarly, Stability contends that plaintiffs have failed to plead plausible facts that Stability \nAI intentionally removed or altered CMI  from plaintiffs’ works  during the training process for \nStable Diffusion , and failed to allege the double -scienter requirement that Stability did so in order \nto facilitate infringement .  In the FAC, p laintiffs allege that “Stability directly copied the LAION -\n5B Works and used these Statutory Copies as training data for the Stability Models. The works \ncopied by Stability in cluded CMI, including in the form of distinctive marks such as watermarks \nor signatures, and as the captions in the image -text pairs. The training process is designed to \nremove or alter CMI from the training images. Therefore, Stability intentionally remov ed or \naltered CMI from the Plaintiffs’ works in violation of 17 U.S.C. § 1202(b)(1).”  FAC ¶ 245.  \nPlaintiffs support that allegation by pointing to some of plaintiffs’ images that were used as \nTraining Images in LAION -5B and that contained CMI, comparing them to images that were Case 3:23-cv-00201-WHO     Document 223     Filed 08/12/24     Page 11 of 33 \n12 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  created, for example, when plaintiffs’ names were used as Midjourney image prompts .  FAC ¶¶ \n189-200.  Plaintiffs have  also, as directed in the October 2023 Order, identified the CMI present \non their works that they contend has been stripped by Stability .  Id. ¶¶ 239-241.  Finally, p laintiffs \nallege that Stability engaged in knowing removal of CMI , as supported by their allegations  \nregarding how the diffusion process works , how training images are used,  and based on plausible \nallegations regarding Stability AI’s prominent role in the funding of LAION.   Id. ¶¶  245 -247. \nStability , however,  raises a new  argument on this round of motions, based on a recent \nopinion from the Hon. Jon S. Tigar.  Doe 1 v. GitHub, Inc ., No. 22 -CV-06823 -JST, 2024 WL \n235217, at *8 (N.D. Cal. Jan. 22, 2024) .  Stability contends that because  the output images are  \nadmittedly  not identical  to the Training Images , there can be no liability for any removal of CMI \nthat occurred during the training process.  That is because f ailing to affix CMI to a “different \nwork” is not “removal” under Section 1202.  Ju dge Tigar wrote:  \n \nDefendants now ask the Court to address an unresolved argument \nfrom the prior briefing —namely, that “[Section] 1202(b) claims lie \nonly when CMI is removed or altered from an identical copy of a \ncopyrighted work.” ECF No. 107 -3 at 20 (emphasis added); see E CF \nNo. 109 -3 at 23 –24. Defendants argue that because Plaintiffs' new \nallegations state that output from Copilot is often a modification of \ntheir licensed works, as opposed to an “identical copy,” they have \neffectively pleaded themselves out of their Sectio n 1202(b)(1) and \n1202(b)(3) claims. ECF No. 109 -3 at 23. Agreeing with Defendants \non both fronts, the Court finds that it is not precluded from analyzing \nthis claim anew and that Section 1202(b) claims require that copies \nbe “identical.”  \nId. * 8; see also Doe 1 v. GitHub, Inc. , No. 22 -CV-06823 -JST, 2024 WL 1643691, at *2 (N.D. \nCal. Apr. 15, 2024) (rejecting motion for reconsideration because there was no allegation that any  \noutput was identical to any plaintiff’s work in its entirety, so there could be no “removal” of CMI \nfor purposes of DMCA) .11   \n Judge Tigar’s analysis disagrees with a case from the Southern District of Texas, where the \n \n11 In so holding, Judge Tigar followed  Advanta -STAR Auto.

App'x 674 (9th Cir. 2017) (no section 1202(b) \nviolation where the allegedly infringing drawing was “not identical”) . \n Case 3:23-cv-00201-WHO     Document 223     Filed 08/12/24     Page 12 of 33 \n13 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  court  rejected the “identicality” requirement.  See ADR Int'l Ltd. v. Inst. for Supply Mgmt. Inc ., \n667 F. Supp. 3d 411, 427 (S.D. Tex. 2023) (“[b]ased on the plain wording of the statute, the Court \nis not persuaded that the DMCA includes an ‘identical copy’ requirement ,” noting the copying \nshould  be “substantially similar” but does not have to be “perfect”).    \nRecognizing that this issue is unsettled, I agree with the reasoning  of Judge Tigar that \nfollowed other district court decision s within the Ninth Circuit.  Because there are no allegations \nthat any output from Stable Diffusion was identical to a plaintiff’s work, the DMCA section \n1202(b) claim fails as well.12 \nThe DMCA claims against Stability are DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE .13   \nC. Unjust Enrichment  \nIn addition  to arguing  that leave to amend was not granted to assert this claim, addressed \nabove, Stability argues that the unjust enrichment claim cannot proceed because it is preempted by \nthe Copyright Act .  It also contends that plaintiffs fai l to allege that they have an inadequate \nremedy at law  as required by Sonner v. Premier Nutrition Corp ., 971 F.3d 834 (9th Cir. 2020).  \nTo support this claim, p laintiffs allege that Stability AI “has unjustly misappropriated the \nLAION -5B Works in order to develop, train and promote the Stability Models, enabling it to \nreceive profit and other benefits.”  FAC ¶252.  “By using Plaintiffs’ works to train, develop an d \npromote the Stability Models, Plaintiffs and the Class were deprived of the benefit of the value of \ntheir works, including monetary damages.”  Id. ¶ 254.  Stability points out  that this  claim is  \nexpressly based on the use of plaintiffs’ copyrighted works  without consent , and as a result is \ncovered by and preempted by the Copyright Act.  \n \n12 The only allegations regarding identical outputs in the FAC are those regarding researcher’s \nability to reproduce identical images to training images – that a s noted above supports the \nplausibility of the copyright infringement claims – but there are no allegations that Stable \nDiffusion can produce a work identical to one of the plaintiffs here, sufficient to show actionable \nremov al of CMI under section 1202(b).  \n \n13 Runway and Midjourney also move to dismiss the DMCA claim asserted against them.  The \narguments raised by those  defendants, and plaintiffs’ responses, are based on the defendants’ use \nof Stable Diffusion and materially identi cal to the arguments addressed above.  As a result, the \nDMCA claims asserted against Runway and Midjourney are likewise DISMISSED  WITH \nPREJUDICE  and will not be addressed further.  Case 3:23-cv-00201-WHO     Document 223     Filed 08/12/24     Page 13 of 33 \n14 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  “Section 301 of the Act seeks ‘to preempt and abolish any rights under the common law or \nstatutes of a State that are equivalent to copyright and that extend to works,’ so long as the rights \nfall ‘within the scope of the Federal copyright law.’ [] ‘We have  adopted a two -part test,’ in \naccordance with section 301, ‘to determine whether a state law claim is preempted by the Act. \nLaws,’ []  First, we decide ‘whether the ‘subject matter’ of the state law claim falls within the \nsubject matter of copyright as des cribed in 17 U.S.C. §§ 102 and 103.’ [] Second, assuming it \ndoes, we determine ‘whether the rights asserted under state law are equivalent to the rights \ncontained in 17 U.S.C. § 106, which articulates the exclusive rights of copyright holders.’” \nMaloney v. T3Media, Inc ., 853 F.3d 1004, 1010 (9th Cir. 2017) (quoting Laws v. Sony Music \nEntm't, Inc ., 448 F.3d 1134, 1137 -38 (9th Cir. 2006) ). \n Plaintiffs correctly note that to “survive preemption, the state cause of action must protect \nrights which are qualitatively different from the copyright rights. The state claim must have an \nextra element which changes the nature of the action.” Laws , 448 F.3d at 1143.  Plaintiffs do not \nidentify an “extra element” required under California’s Unfair Competition Law (“UCL”)  or \ncommon law (which the unjust enrichment claims are based on) that changes the nature of those \nstate law claims to protect something other than rights protected under Copyright Act.  Instead, \nthey assert  that the heart of their unjust enrichment claim is Stability being unjustly enriched by its \n“image product’s ability to mimic Plaintiffs’ artistic style and benefit from their notoriety and \nreputation as sought -after artists.”  Oppo. to Stability AI  at 20.  More specifically, they allege that \nthe Stable Diffusion models use “CLIP -guided diffusion” that rel ies on prompts including artists’ \nnames to generate an image.  Therefore, the “crux ” of plaintiffs’ unjust enrichment claim revolved \nnot around plaintiffs’ works but around plaintiffs themselves and their “artistic personas.”  Id. \n The problem wit h plaintiffs’ theory is that it is not in the FAC.  The unjust enrichment \nclaim against Stability (and the other defendants) is tied instead to use of plaintiffs’ works.  See \nFAC ¶ 42 (“Whether the use of Plaintiffs and Class members’ works to train, develop, and \npromote Defendants AI Image Products constitute an unjust benefit conferred upon Defendants to \nPlaintiffs’ detriment”); see also id . ¶¶ 252 -255 (alleging unjust misappropriat ion of works).  \n As alleged, the unjust enrichment claim against Stability added to the FAC without leave Case 3:23-cv-00201-WHO     Document 223     Filed 08/12/24     Page 14 of 33 \n15 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  of court is preempted by the Copyright Act.  It is DISMISSED.  If plaintiffs have a good faith \ntheory of unjust enrichment that falls outside the scope of the protections provided by the \nCopyright Act, they are given leave to make one last attempt to state an unjust enrichment claim.14 \n Stability’s motion to dismiss is DENIED concerning  the challenged copyright claims, but \nGRANTED for the DMCA claims without leave to amend and GRANTED for the unjust \nenrichment claim with leave to amend.  \nIII. RUNWAY AI MOTION TO DISMISS  \nNewly added defendant Runway AI is primarily alleged to have trained or assisted in the \ntraining at least  Stable Diffusion  1.5, using Training Images from the LAION dataset.  See, e.g ., \nFAC ¶¶  4, 163 , 176, 342 -345.  In addition to challenging plaintiffs’ DMCA and unjust \nenrichment/UCL claims – which fail for the same reasons identified above with respect to \nStability  – Runway argues  that the infringement claims fail  given the allegations alleged with \nrespect to its particular conduct.  \nA. Request for Judicial Notice  \nAs an initial matter, Runway asks me to take judicial notice of a motion to dismiss filed in \nanother case in this District, as well as the complaint from the case.  Runway RJN (Dkt. No. 164), \nExs. A&B.  Plaintiffs oppose , arguing that judicial notice of court records from other cases is \ninappropriate  for the purpose Runway seeks; to encourage me to follow the “approach” of those \nother courts .  “On a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, when a court takes judicial notice of another \ncourt ’s opinion, it may do so ‘not for the truth of the facts recited therein, but for the existence of \nthe opinion, which is not subject to reasonable dispute over its authenticity.’” Southern Cross \nOverseas Agencies, Inc. v. Wah Kwong Shipping Group Ltd ., 181 F.3d 410, 426 –27 (3rd \n \n14 Because of this conclusion, I need not reach Stability’s argument under Sonner v. Premier \nNutrition Corp ., 971 F.3d 834 (9th Cir. 2020 ).  I have however, repeatedly held that a plaintiff \nsatisfies Sonner  at the pleading stage by simpl y pleading inadequate remedies at law.  See Costa v. \nApple, Inc ., No. 23 -CV-01353 -WHO, 2023 WL 7389276, at *4 (N.D. Cal. Aug. 9, 2023) .  If \nplaintiffs reassert unjust enrichment claims in their Second  Amended Complaint, they should \naddress that issue.   The unjust enrichment claims asserted against Runway and Midjourney raise \nidentical issues.  Those claims are, therefore, DISMISSED with one last leave to amend and will \nnot be addressed further .  The unjust enrichment claim asserted against DeviantArt is addressed \nbelow.  Case 3:23-cv-00201-WHO     Document 223     Filed 08/12/24     Page 15 of 33 \n16 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  Cir.1999).” Lee v. City of Los Angeles , 250 F.3d 668, 690 (9th Cir. 2001) .  Notifying me of the  \nexistence of opinions from the judges in other cases may be accomplished by a far simpler \nmethod , citing them as persuasive authority.  Judicial notice is not  an appropriate  method to \nsuggest  that I should follow the analysis of other court s addressing different cases with different \nfacts.    \nRunway also asks me to take judicial notice – under the doctrine of incorporation – of the \nfull conten ts of three academic articles cited in plaintiffs’ FAC.  Id., Exs. C, D & E.  Plaintiffs  \nobject to this request, noting that one article is only mentioned once in the FAC  and the others a \nfew more times as support for the plausibility of plaintiffs’ assertion that Stable Diffusion contains \n“compressed copies” of the Training Images based on how th ese models generally work.  \nPlaintiffs argue that it is inappropriate to take “notice” of the debated truth, meaning or \nimplications of the articles  to foreclose their claims.  I agree.  I will not take judicial notice of the \nfull contents of the acad emic articles to resolve disputes of fact, or the legal implications from \nundisputed facts, at this juncture.   \nRunway’s request for judicial notice is DENIED.  \nB. Direct Copyright Infringement  \nRunway does not move to dismiss first direct copyright infringement claim asserted \nagainst it .  See Count 11, FAC ¶¶ 347 -349.  That claim is  based on Runway’s alleged use of \nTraining Images to train  Stable Diffusion  1.5, a claim t hat survived Stability AI’s prior motion to \ndismiss.  October 2023 Order at 7 (discussing the “Training Theory ”).  Runway does challenge \nplaintiffs’ two other direct infringement theories .  First, the “ Model Theory ” is based on the theory \nthat the Stable Diffusion1.5 product itself – after it was trained – is “an infringing Statutory Copy” \nof plaintiffs’ works or a “Statutory Derivative Work” because it represents a transformation of \nplaintiffs’ works.  See FAC ¶¶ 209, 350.  Second, Runway challen ges plaintiffs ’ “Distribution \nTheory ” of infringement, based on allegations that Runway infringes plaintiffs’ exclusive \ndistribution rights because distributing Stable Diffusion 1.5 is equivalent to distributing plaintiffs’ \nworks.  FAC ¶ 352.  \nAs with Stability, because Runway does not challenge the use of the images for training Case 3:23-cv-00201-WHO     Document 223     Filed 08/12/24     Page 16 of 33 \n17 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  purposes, I need not address the other theories of direct infringement.  However, I note that both \nthe model theory and the distribution theory of direct infringement depend on whether plaintiffs’ \nprotected works are contained, in some manner, in Stable Di ffusion as distributed and operated.  \nThat these works may  be contained in Stable Diffusion as algorithmic or mathematical \nrepresentation s – and are therefore fixed in a different medium than they may have originally been \nproduced in – is not an impediment  to the claim at this juncture.   1 Nimmer on Copyright § \n2.09[D][1]  (2024) (“A work is no less a motion picture (or other audiovisual work) whether the \nimages are embodied in a videotape, videodisc, or any other tangible form.”).   \nPlaintiffs addressed the deficiencies in their prior complaint, alleging additional facts in the \nFAC concerning  how the training images remain in and are used by Stable Diffusion.  See, e.g ., \nFAC ¶¶ 71, 83, 88 -90, 150.15  Plaintiffs rely , with respect to Runway as with Stability, on \ncomments from Stability’s CEO regarding the contents of the model and their ability to reproduce \nworks, as well as academic papers indicating that the Stable Diffusion  models are capable of \nproducing very similar if not identical works to at least some  training images.  FAC ¶¶ 122 -150.  \nAnd plaintiffs also rely on use of their names as prompts in the Runway products to create  outputs \nmimicking aspects of plaintiffs’ protected works as evidence  that their protected works are being \ncopied or distributed in Runway’s product.  Id. ¶¶ 163 -169. \nRunway disputes the accuracy of those assertions  – including the full meaning and import \nof the academic articles relied on by plaintiffs – and argues  that the prompt -examples do not \nsupport assertions of direct copyright infringement  absent express identification of outputs that are \n“substantially similar” to plaintiffs’ copyrighted works .  But the allegations at this juncture a re \nsufficient to allow the direct infringement claims to proceed.   Whether evidence can support each \n \n15 Runway ’s and the other defendants ’ repeated reliance on “run of the mill” copyright cases \nwhere a showing of substantial similarity between works is required when determining whether an \ninference of copying can be supported – see, e.g., Hanagami v. Epic Games, Inc ., 85 F.4th 931, \n935 (9th Cir. 2023) – or liability imposed – see, e.g., Narell v. Freeman , 872 F.2d 907, 910 (9th \nCir. 1989) – are unhelpful  in this case where the copyrighted works themselves are alleged to have \nnot only been used to train the AI models but also invoked in their operation.   Whether that use is \n“substantial enough” either in operation or output of images to qualify for the fair use defense will \nbe tested on summary judgment.  See, e.g., Authors Guild v. Google, Inc ., 804 F.3d 202, 226 (2d \nCir. 2015) (affirming summary judgment that Google’s “program does not allow access in any \nsubstantial way to a book ’s expressive content”).  Case 3:23-cv-00201-WHO     Document 223     Filed 08/12/24     Page 17 of 33 \n29 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  references to the operation of Stable Diffusion 1.4 used by DreamUp, suffice.  See FAC ¶¶ 132 -\n137, 388-397.  For example, in paragraph 393 plaintiffs assert:  \n \nOn information and belief, by the end of training, Stable Diffusion 1.4 \nwas capable of reproducing protected expression from each of the \nLAION -5B Registered Works that was in each case substantially \nsimilar to that registered work, because — a. In the Carli ni Paper, \nNicholas Carlini tested Stable Diffusion 1.4 and found that it could \nemit stored copies of its training images; b. The training procedure \nfor Stable Diffusion 1.4 was very similar to that of Stable Diffusion \n1.5, which was shown in Exhibit E: Run way text prompts and Exhibit \nH: Runway image prompts to be capable of emitting stored copies of \nprotected expression.  \nSee also  ¶ 394 (“Therefore, like Stable Diffusion 1.5, Stable Diffusion 1.4 also qualifies as an \ninfringing Statutory Copy of the LAION -5B Registered Works. Because Stable Diffusion 1.4 \nrepresents a transformation of the LAION -5B Registered Works into an alternati ve form, Stable \nDiffusion 1.4 also qualifies as an infringing Statutory Derivative Work.” ). \nDeviantArt asks me to review to the full content of one of the academic articles plaintiffs \nrely on, the Carlini Stud y, in particular the  article’s conclusion that for the 350,000 training \nimages studied, only 109 output images were “near -copies” of the training images . See DeviantArt \nReply at 4 -5.  DeviantArt argues that it is simply not plausible that LAION 1.4 can reproduce any \nof plaintiffs’  copyrighted works  given that the set of training images Carlini selected were the \n“most -duplicated” examples, numbering in the millions of impressions in the datasets .  Id.  \nPlaintiffs’  reference to Carlini, however, is only one part of the allegations that help make \nplaintiffs’ allegations plausible  regarding how these products operate and how “cop ies” of the \nplaintiffs’ registered works are capture d in some form in the products .  As noted above, it is not \nappropriate to rely on the defendants’ assertions regarding the method or sampl e size used by \nCarlini and their conclusions from it  to foreclose plaintiffs’ claims ; plaintiffs aggressively dispute \nthe implications from the sample size and results of that study.  Finally, while the differences \nbetween Stable Diffusion 1.4 and the other Stable Diffusion versions might be legally significant \nbased on what the evidence shows after discovery , at this juncture the allegations about the \ncommon training of those versions and how they all operate are sufficient to keep plaintiffs’ Case 3:23-cv-00201-WHO     Document 223     Filed 08/12/24     Page 29 of 33 \n30 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  copyright infringement allegations against DeviantArt  alive.26 \nFinally, DeviantArt contends that any use of plaintiffs ’ works in Stable Diffusion 1.4 \nshould be considered fair use as a matter of law , given the huge size of the training datasets  and \nplaintiffs apparent inability to use Stable Diffusion 1.4 to reproduce any works that look similar to \ntheir copyrighted works .  Whether DreamUp operates in a way that could draw upon or otherwise \nreproduce plaintiffs’ works to an extent that violate s the Copyright Act and whether a fair use \ndefense applies are issues that must be tested on an evidentiary basis .  See, e.g., Authors Guild v. \nGoogle, In c., 804 F.3d 202, 226 (2d Cir. 2015) (applying fair use defense upon summary judgment \nrecord).  \nDeviantArt’s motion to dismiss the Copyright Act claims is DENIED.  \nB. Breach of Contract  \nDeviantArt moves again to dismiss the breach of contract claim  that plaintiffs assert based \non the same provision of DeviantArt’s Terms of Service ( “ToS”) that I considered in the October \n2023 Order.  In that Order I explained:  \n \nIn opposition, plaintiffs focus on § 16 of the TOS, a provision not \nidentified or quoted in their Complaint:  \n \n16. Copyright in Your Content  \nDeviantArt does not claim ownership rights in Your Content. \nFor the sole purpose of enabling us to make your Content \navailable through the Service, you grant to DeviantArt a non -\nexclusive, royalty -free license to reproduce, distribute, re -\nformat, store, pr epare derivative works based on, and publicly \ndisplay and perform Your Content. Please note that when you \nupload Content, third parties will be able to copy, distribute \nand display your Content using readily available tools on their \ncomputers for this purp ose although other than by linking to \nyour Content on DeviantArt any use by a third party of your \nContent could violate paragraph 4 of these Terms and \nConditions [preserving copyright rights in the original owner \n \n26 Given this conclusion, I need not separately reach the question of whether plaintiffs can assert a \ntheory of derivative copyright infringement based on the use of the diffusion model itself.  As \ndefendants note, the soundness of this theory was questioned  in my October 2023 Order and by \nother judges in this District, with respect to output images .  See October 2024 Order at 10 -13; \nTremblay v. OpenAI, Inc ., No. 23 -CV-03223 -AMO, 2024 WL 557720, at *3 (N.D. Cal. Feb. 12, \n2024) .  Judge Chhabria also rejected the derivative theory as applied to the AI model in Kadrey v. \nMeta Platforms, Inc ., No. 23 -CV-03417 -VC, 2023 WL 8039640, at *1 (N.D. Cal. Nov. 20, 2023) .  \nBut as noted above, the allegations regarding the training and operation of the language models at \nissue in Kadrey  are significantly different than the image creation models at issue here.  Case 3:23-cv-00201-WHO     Document 223     Filed 08/12/24     Page 30 of 33 \n31 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  of the copyright and disclaiming any ownership interest of \nDeviantArt in the posted work] unless the third party receives \npermission from you by license.  \n \nPlaintiffs argue that DeviantArt breached this provision when “it \nincorporated Stable Diffusion into its own AI Image product knowing \nthat Stability had scraped DeviantArt’s artists’ work.” Oppo to \nDeviantArt MTD [Dkt. No. 65] at 22. However, section 16 pr ovides \na limited license to DeviantArt and warns that third parties may be \nable to copy and violate content -owners’ rights. It does not clearly \ncover the conduct that plaintiffs accuse DeviantArt of in this suit; \noffering for use a product that a third par ty may have created in part \nby using material posted on DeviantArt’s own site. There are no facts \nalleged supporting an allegation that DeviantArt itself  exceeded the \nscope of the limited license.   \n \nDeviantArt also challenges the ability of plaintiff McKernan and the \nunspecified “others” to sue DeviantArt for breach claims based on \ncontractual provisions prohibiting other users (presumably here, \nStability) from using DeviantArt content for commercial uses. The \nComplaint does not allege and is devoid of facts suppor ting the \ninference that Stability is bound by the TOS or that plaintiff \nMcKernan or others are third party beneficiaries of specific \nprovisions in the TOS who may sue to enforce terms of agreements \nentered between DeviantArt and Stability.  \n \nThe breach of contract claim is DISMISSED with leave to amend. If \nplaintiffs attempt to amend this claim, they must identify the exact \nprovisions in the TOS they contend DeviantArt breached and facts in \nsupport of breach of each identified provision. To th e extent plaintiffs \nrely on provisions that appear to protect or benefit DeviantArt but not \nthe users, or contracts.  \nIn the FAC, plaintiffs reallege a violation of Section 16, based on the same theory as \nabove, and DeviantArt argues it fails for the same reason.  See FAC ¶¶ 420 -422.  I agree.  For the \nreasons discussed in the October 2023 Order, plaintiffs cannot state a breach of contract claim as a \nmatter of law based on allegations that DeviantArt knew Stable Diffusion was trained on LAION \ndatasets that had been sc raped in part from DeviantArt ’s website .  As before, there are no \nallegations that DeviantArt did anything to permit the sc raping of images from its site.  Plaintiffs \nadmit that DeviantArt played no role in the scraping or training.  Nothing in the TOS  precludes \nDeviantArt from using Stable Diffusion, even if it had knowledge that some of the images used in \nits training were scraped from its own site and its members’ works.   \nPlaintiffs argue  that DeviantArt breach ed this provision  because it is now using – through \nits use of Stable Diffusion – its members’ works for purposes beyond “ the sole purpose of \nenabling us to make your Content available through the Service .”  But nothing in Section 16 limits Case 3:23-cv-00201-WHO     Document 223     Filed 08/12/24     Page 31 of 33 \n32 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  DeviantArt’s ability to use plaintiffs’ works that are available from another source, i.e., the \nLAION datasets as incorporated into Stable Diffusion.  The breach claim fails, again, as a matter \nof law.  \nPlaintiffs added a breach of the implied covenant claim  in the FAC , premised also on a \nbreach of Section 16 of the ToS.  See ¶ 422b; Dkt. No. 177 at 16.27  “[T]o state a claim for breach \nof the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, a plaintiff must identify the specific \ncontractual provision that was frustrated.” Rockridge Tr. v. Wells Fargo, N.A ., 985 F. Supp. 2d \n1110, 1156 (N.D. Cal. 2013).  DeviantArt argues that the implied covenant claim fails because \nplaintiffs do not identify any contractual provision that obligated  DeviantArt to protect its users \nfrom competition from DeviantArt or anyone else, or to offer protection from data sc raping, or \nthat would  otherwise preclude DeviantArt from using a tool developed by third parties even if that \ntool was based  in part  on works scraped from its site without its involvement.  I agree.   There is no \nbasis to find any provision of the ToS was frustrated by DeviantArt’s alleged conduct.  \nThe breach of contract claim is DISMISSED. As plaintiffs did not contest this claim at oral \nargument, despite my tentative ruling order identifying my intent to dismiss this claim  (Dkt. No. \n193), and did not suggest any facts they could allege to salvage their breach  claim in an amended \ncomplaint, this claim is DISMISSED with prejudice.  \nC. Unjust Enrichment  \nConsistent with the analysis above, the  newly added  unjust enrichment claim against \nDeviantArt based on  use of plaintiffs’ “works to develop and promote DreamUp and the \nDreamUp –CompVis Model” that deprived plaintiffs “the benefit of the value of their works” FAC \n¶ 433, is dismissed as preempted under the Copyright Act.  In their opposition to DeviantArt’s \nmotion, plaintiffs imply that the unjust enrichment claim against DeviantArt could be based upon \n \n27 FAC ¶422b provides: “DeviantArt breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. \nThe release of DreamUp unleashed a flood of AI -generated images on DeviantArt that \nimmediately began drowning out the work of human artists like the DeviantArt P laintiffs. By \nreleasing DreamUp, DeviantArt put itself into competition with the DeviantArt Plaintiffs and its \nother artist members, undermining their very purpose in being on DeviantArt in the first place. \nDeviantArt’s bad faith was further exemplified by  its hasty addition of a permissive new ‘Data \nScraping & Machine Learning Activities ’ provision to its Terms of Service after DeviantArt’s \nmembers complained about the unfairness of DreamUp.”  Case 3:23-cv-00201-WHO     Document 223     Filed 08/12/24     Page 32 of 33 \n33 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  a different ground; misrepresentation s made  by DeviantArt  to plaintiffs .  Plaintiffs’ Oppo. to \nDeviantArt at 19.   Plaintiffs are given one last attempt to amend their unjust enrichment claims  \nagainst each defendant .  If the theory underlying plaintiffs’ unjust enrichment claim against \nDeviantArt rests on different facts and theories from the unjust enrichment claim asserted against \nthe other defendants, plaintiffs should  make that clear.  \nCONCLUSION  \n Defendants’ motion s to dismiss the DMCA claims are GRANTED and the DMCA claims \nare DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE.  Defendants’ motions to dismiss the unjust enrichment \nclaims are GRANTED and those claims are DISMISSED with leave to amend.  Defendants’ \nmotions to dismiss the Copyright Act claims are DENIED.

    "summary": "1. **Summary:**\n   Artists Sarah Anderson, Kelly McKernan, and Karla Ortiz filed a class action against Stability AI, DeviantArt, and Midjourney, alleging that the defendants' AI software product, Stable Diffusion, was trained on the plaintiffs’ copyrighted artworks without permission. The court granted most of the defendants' motions to dismiss, allowing only Anderson's direct copyright infringement claim against Stability to proceed, while dismissing other claims but granting leave to amend.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue:**\n   The main legal issue is whether the defendants infringed on the plaintiffs’ copyrights by using their works to train an AI model without authorization and whether such use constitutes a derivative work or implicates other legal rights under copyright law and the DMCA.\n\n3. **Court's Holding:**\n   The court dismissed most claims, citing insufficient specificity, a need for clearer allegations, and issues with plausibility, particularly regarding how Stable Diffusion could contain \"compressed copies\" of the training images. Only Anderson's direct copyright claim against Stability AI was allowed to proceed, with the court granting plaintiffs leave to amend other claims to address deficiencies.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation:**\n   A group of artists accused several tech companies of stealing their artwork to teach a computer program to make new pictures. The judge said that the artists did not give enough clear information to back up most of their claims, so their case mostly got thrown out. However, one artist's complaint that Stability AI directly used their art without permission will continue unless they fix the other problems in their case and try again.",

Nos. 49, 50, 51, 52, 58  \n \nArtists Sarah Anderson, Kelly McKernan, and Karla Ortiz filed this putative class action \non behalf of themselves and other artists  to challenge th e defendants’ creation or use of Stable \nDiffusion, an artificial intelligence (“AI”) software product .  Plaint iffs allege that Stable Diffusion   \nwas “trained” on plaintiffs’ works of art to be able to produce Output Images “in the style” of \nparticular artists.  See generally Compl., Dkt. No.1.  The three sets of defendants  ((i) Stability AI \nLtd. and Stability AI, Inc. (“Stability”) ; (ii) DeviantArt, Inc .; and (iii) Midjourney, Inc. ) have each  \nfiled separate motions to dismiss and DeviantArt has filed a special motio n to strike  under \nCalifornia Code of Civil Procedure section 425.16 .  Finding that the Complaint is defective in \nnumerous respects , I largely GRANT defendants’ motions to dismiss and  defer  the special motion \nto strike.  Plaintiffs are given leave to amend to provide clarity regarding their theories of how \neach defendant separately violate d their copyrights , removed or altered their copyright \nmanagement information, or violated their rights of publicity and plausible facts in support.   \nBACKGROUND  \nPlaintiff s allege that Stability created and released in August 2022 a “general -purpose” \nsoftware program called Stable Diffusion under a “permission open -source license .”  Compl. ¶¶ 1, \n33, 52, 53.  Stability is alleged to have “downloaded of otherwise acquired cop ies of billions of \ncopyrighted images without permission to create Stable Diffusion,” known as “training images,”  Case 3:23-cv-00201-WHO     Document 117     Filed 10/30/23     Page 1 of 28 \n2 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  Id. ¶¶ 2, 3, 25 -26.  Over five billion images were scraped (and thereby copie d) from the internet \nfor training purposes for Stable Diffusion through the services of an organization (LAION, Large -\nScale Artificial Intelligence Open Network) paid by Stability.  Id. ¶¶ 57, 101, 104 ; see also id . ¶¶ \n2, 25 (defining “Training Images”) .  Stability’s founder and CEO “publicly acknowledged the \nimportance of using licensed training images, saying that future versions of Stable Diffusion \nwould be based on ‘fully licensed’ training images.  But for the current version, he took no steps \nto ob tain or negotiate suitable licenses.”  Id. ¶ 106.  \nStable Diffusion is alleged to be a “software library” providing “image -generating \nservices” to products produced and maintained by the defendants including  “DreamStudio, \nDreamUp, and on information and belief, the Midjourney Product.” Id. ¶¶ 23, 50, 65 .  Consumers \nuse these products by entering text prompts into the programs to create images “in the style” of \nartists .  The new images are created  “through a mat hematical process” that are based entirely on \nthe training images and  are “derivative” of the training images.  Id. ¶¶ 4, 5, 24.   Plaintiffs admit \nthat “[i]n general, none of the Stable Diffusion output images provided in response to a particular \nText Prom pt is likely to be a close match for any specific image in training data.  This stands to \nreason: the use of conditioning data to interpolate multiple latent images means that the resulting \nhybrid image will not look exactly like any of the Training Images  that have been copied into \nthese latent images.”  Id. ¶ 93.  Plaintiffs also allege that “[e]very output image from the system is \nderived exclusive from the latent images, which are copies of copyrighted images.  For these \nreasons, every hybrid image is n ecessarily a derivative work.”  Id. ¶ 95.  \nDreamStudio is Stability’s product, also released in August 2002 ; it functions as an “user \ninterface” accessing “a trained version of Stable Diffusion.”  Id. ¶¶ 33, 55.  Use of DreamStudio is \nbilled in packages of credits that can be used to create images.  Id. ¶ 56.  \nDefendant DeviantArt  was founded in 2000 and has primarily been known as an “online \ncommunity” where digital artists post and share their work.  Id. ¶¶  35, 62. 114.  Deviant Art \nreleased its “DreamUp” product in November 2022.  Id. ¶ 64.  DreamUp is a commercial product \nthat relies on Stable Diffusion to produce images and is only available to customers who pay \nDeviantArt.  Id. ¶¶ 35, 115.  Plaintiffs allege that at least one LAION dataset that was inco rporated Case 3:23-cv-00201-WHO     Document 117     Filed 10/30/23     Page 2 of 28 \n3 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  into Stable Diffusion for training images (the “aesthetic dataset”) was procured by scraping \nprimarily 100 websites, including DeviantArt ’s site .  Id. ¶¶ 109, 110.  As a result, plaintiffs allege \nthat Stability copie d thousands and possible millions of training images from DeviantArt created \nby artists and other DeviantArt subscribers without licensing their works of art.  Id. ¶¶ 116 -117.  \nBy incorporating DreamUp and therefore Stable Diffusion into its website, plaint iffs allege that \nDeviantArt is violating its own terms of service against using content for “commercial” purposes \nand without consent, as well as its privacy policy.  This conduct, according to plaintiffs, represents \n“unfair competition against” DeviantArt ’s artist customers.  Id. ¶¶ 123, 124.  \nDefendant Midjourney, based in San Francisco, created and distributes the “Midjourney \nProduct.”  Id. ¶¶ 34, 134.  The Midjourney Product was launched in beta form in July 2022, and is \nalleged to be a commercial produc t that produces images in response to text prompts  in the same \nmanner as DreamStudio and DreamUp.  Plaintiffs allege that the Midjourney product uses Stable \nDiffusion but also that it was “trained on a subset of the images used to train Stable Diffusion.”  \nId. ¶¶ 34, 62, 134, 135.  The Midjourney Product is offered to online use rs of the internet -chat \nsystem Discord, as well as through an app, for a service fee.  Id. ¶¶ 136, 137, 139.  Midjourney’s \nCEO has stated that Midjourney used large open data sets, t hereby “implying” that Midjourney \nused the LAION dataset s for training .  Id. ¶¶ 148-149.  In August 2022 , Midjourney released a \nbeta version using Stable Diffusion.  Id. ¶ 149.   \nPlaintiff Anderson reside s in Oregon and is a full -time cartoonis t and illustrator.  Plaintiffs \nallege that Anderson “has created and owns a copyright interest in over two hundred Works \nincluded in the Training Data,” and has registered or applied “for an owns copyright registrations \nfor sixteen collections that include Works used as Train ing Images.”  Id. ¶ 28.  Plaintiff McKernan \nresides in Tennessee and is a full -time artist.  McKernan is alleged to have “created and owns a \ncopyright interest in over thirty Works used as Training Images.”  Id. ¶ 20.  Plaintiff Ortiz resides \nin California and is a full -time artist.  Ortiz is alleged to have “created and owns a copyright \ninterest in at least twelve Works that were used as Training Images.”  Id. ¶ 30.   \nPlaintiffs assert the following claims agai nst all three sets of defendants: (1) Direct \nCopyright Infringement, 17 U.S.C. § 106; (2) Vicarious Copyright Infringement, 17 U.S.C. § 106; Case 3:23-cv-00201-WHO     Document 117     Filed 10/30/23     Page 3 of 28 \n4 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  (3) violation of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. §§ 1201 -1205 (“DMCA”); (4) \nviolation of the Right to Publicity, Cal. Civil Code § 3344; (5) violation of the Common Law \nRight of Publicity; (6) Unfair Competition, Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code  § 17200; and (7) Declaratory \nRelief.  Plaintiffs also assert a breach of contract claim against DeviantArt only.   \nEach  defendant separately moves to dismiss, and DeviantArt also moves to strike under \nCalifornia’s anti -SLAPP statute , California Code of Civil Procedure § 425.161. \nLEGAL STANDARD  \nUnder FRCP 12(b)(6), a district court must dismiss a complaint if it fails to s tate a claim \nupon which relief can be granted.  To survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, the plaintiff must \nallege “enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.”  Bell Atl. Corp. v.  \nTwombly , 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007).  A clai m is facially plausible when the plaintiff pleads facts \nthat “allow the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the \nmisconduct alleged.”  Ashcroft v. Iqbal , 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) (citation omitted).  There must \nbe “more t han a sheer possibility that a defendant has acted unlawfully.”  Id.  While courts do not \nrequire “heightened fact pleading of specifics,” a plaintiff must allege facts sufficient to “raise a \nright to relief above the speculative level.”  Twombly , 550 U.S.  at 555, 570.   \nIn deciding whether the plaintiff has stated a claim upon which relief can be granted, the \nCourt accepts the plaintiff’s allegations as true and draws all reasonable inferences in favor of the \nplaintiff.  See Usher v. City of Los Angeles , 828 F.2d 556, 561 (9th Cir. 1987).  However,  \nthe court is not required to accept as true “allegations that are merely conclusory, unwarranted \ndeductions of fact, or unreasonable inferences.”  In re Gilead Scis. Sec. Litig ., 536 F.3d 1049, \n1055 (9th Cir. 20 08).  If the court dismisses the complaint, it “should grant leave to amend even if \nno request to amend the pleading was made, unless it determines that the pleading could not \npossibly be cured by the allegation of other facts.”  Lopez v. Smith , 203 F.3d 1 122, 1127 (9th Cir. \n2000).  In making this determination, the court should consider factors such as “the presence or \nabsence of undue delay, bad faith, dilatory motive, repeated failure to cure deficiencies by \n \n1 Plaintiffs have filed two notices of supplemental authority, Dkt.

Kayport Package Express , 885 F.2d 531, 538 (9th Cir. 1989).  \nDISCUSSION  \nI. MOTIONS  TO DISMISS  \nEach of the defendants separately move to dismiss , but raise substantially similar \narguments addressed  collectively below.2 \nA. Copyright – Counts I & II  \n1. Registration  \nEach defendant argue s that McKernan and Ortiz’s copyright claims must be dismissed \nbecause neither of them  has registered their images with the Copyright Office .  They also move to \n“limit”  Anderson’s copyright claim to infringement based on ly on the 16 collections of works that \nshe has registered.  See, e.g.,  Declaration of Paul M. Schoenhard (Dkt. No.  51-1), ¶¶ 5-6; see also  \nCompl. ¶ 28 & Exs. 1 -16.3 \nIn opposition, plaintiffs do not address , much less contest , McKernan or Ortiz’s asserted \ninability to pursue Copyright Act claims .  At oral argument, plaintiffs ’ counsel clarified that they \nare not asserting copyright claims on behalf of these two plaintiffs.  July 19, 2023 Transcript  (Tr.), \npg. 17:1 -5.  As such, McKernan and Ortiz’s copyright act claims are DISMISSED WITH \nPREJUDICE.  \nLikewise, plaintiffs do not ad dress or dispute that Anderson’s copyright claims should be  \nlimited to the collections Anderson  has registered.   The scope of Anderson’s Copyright Act claims \nare limited to the collections which she has registered.   \n \n2  In an overarching argument, DeviantArt complains that the Complaint contain s undifferentiated \nallegations between the separate defendants  and often lumps “defendants” together.  DeviantArt \nMotion to Dismiss (Dkt. No. 49) at 7 -8.  It points out that group pleading makes it difficult for \neach defendant to figure out what exact cond uct plaintiffs believe each defendant  engaged in.  Id.  \nAs discussed below, I am dismissing the majority of plaintiffs’ claims but granting leave to \namend .  When plaintiffs  amend , plaintiffs should not lump  “defendants” together .  Instead, they  \nshould identify each defendant by name with respect to conduct they allege each defendant \nengaged in . \n \n3 Stability AI moves for judicial notice of the lack of copyright registrations.  Plaintiffs do not \noppose  that judicial notice.  Case 3:23-cv-00201-WHO     Document 117     Filed 10/30/23     Page 5 of 28 \n6 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  2. Identifying Infringed Works  \nAs to Ander son, d efendants argue that she cannot proceed with her copyright infringement \nallegations unless she identifies with specificity each of her  registered  works that she believes \nwere used as Training Images for Stable Diffusion.  In the Complaint, Anderson alleges  that she \n“has created and owns a copyright interest in over two hundred Works included in the Training \nData” and that “[e]xamples of Ms. Andersen’s Works included in the Training Data can be found \nhere: https://haveibeentrained.com/?search_text=sarah%20andersen.cites .”  Compl., ¶ 28 & n.1.  \nDefendants contend  that those allegations are insufficient  and argue that Anderson should  \nbe required to identify which specific works from which of her registered collections she believes \nwere copied into the LAION dataset s and ended up as Training Images for Stable Diffusion .  See, \ne.g., Stability Mot. at 4 -5; DeviantArt Mot. to Dismiss (Dkt. No. 49 ) at 9; Midjourney Mot. (Dkt. \nNo. 77 ) at 8-9.   \nAnderson does not identify which of her specific works covered by a registration  were  \nused as Training Images  but relies  on the output of a search of her name on the \n“ihavebeentrained.com” site  to supp ort the plausibility  and reasonableness of her belief  that her \nworks were, in fact, used in the LAION datasets and  training  for Stable Diffusion .  Compl., ¶ 28 & \nn.1.  She attests that  her review of the output pages  from that search  confirm s that some of her \nregistered works were us ed as Training Images.  That is a sufficient basis to allow her copyright \nclaims to proceed  at this juncture,  particularly in light of the nature of this case, i.e., that LAION \nscraped five billion images to create the T raining Image dataset s.  At this juncture, t he plausible \ninferences are that all of Anderson’s works that were registered as collections and were online \nwere scraped into the training dataset s.4  Her assertions regarding the results of her search on the \n \n4  The scope of the work s scraped from the internet and allegedly used to create the Training \nImages  distinguish this case from those defendants rely on .  For example,  Bespaq Corp. v. \nHaoshen Trading Co ., No. C 04 -3698 PJH, 2005 WL 14841, at *2 (N.D. Cal. Jan. 3, 2005 ), the \ncopyr ight claims were dismissed with leave given the failure of the plaintiff to identify “which \npreexisting works in the registered catalog ” containing pictures of miniature furniture “ have been \ninfringed by the defendants .”  In Cutler v. Enzymes, Inc ., No. C 08-04650 JF(RS), 2009 WL \n482291, at *3 (N.D. Cal. Feb. 25, 2009 ), the case involved “only three copyrighted books” and \n“[a]side from claims of ownership, the complaint is devoid of any other specific facts related to \nthe Published Work and alleged copyrigh t infringement.”  \n Case 3:23-cv-00201-WHO     Document 117     Filed 10/30/23     Page 6 of 28 \n7 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  “haveibeentrained” site supports that inference and makes it reasonable for this case.  While \ndefendants complain  that Anderson’s reference to search results on th e “haveibeentrained” website \nis insufficient, as the output pages show many hundreds of works t hat are not identified by specific \nartists ,5 defendants may test Anderson’s  assertions in discovery.   \n3. Direct Infringement  Allegations Against Stability  \nPlaintiffs ’ primary  theory of direct copyright infringement is based on Stability’s creation \nand use of  “Training Images”  scraped from the internet into the LAION dataset s and then used to \ntrain Stable Diffusion.   Plaintiffs have adequately alleged direct infringement based on the \nallegations that Stability “downloaded or otherwise acquired copies of billions of copyrighted \nimages without permission to create Stable Diffusion,” and used those images (called “Training \nImages”) to train Stable Diffusion and caused those “images to be stored at and incorporated into \nStable Diffusion as compressed copies.”   Compl. ¶¶ 3 -4, 25-26, 57 .  In its “Preliminary Statement” \nin support of its motion to dismiss, Stability opposes the truth of plaintiffs’ assertions .  See \nStability Motion to Dismiss (Dkt. No. 58) at 1.  However, even Stability recognizes that \ndeterminat ion of the truth of these allegations – whether copying in violation of the Copyright Act \noccur red in the context of training Stable Diffusion or occurs when Stable Diffusion is run  – \ncannot be resolved at this juncture.  Id.  Stability does not otherwise oppose the sufficiency of the \nallegations supporting Anderson’s direct copyright infringement claims with respect to the \nTraining Images.  \nStability’s motion to dismiss Count I for direct copyright infringement  is DENIED . \n4. Direct Infringement Allegations Ag ainst DeviantArt  \nPlaintiffs fail to allege specific plausible facts that  DeviantArt played any affirmative role \nin the scraping and using of Anderson ’s and other’s registered works to create the Training \nImages.  The Complaint, instead, admits that the scr aping and creation of Training Images was \ndone by LAION at the direction of  Stability  and that Stability used the Training Images to train \nStable Diffusion .

Id. \n¶¶ 109 -110, 116 .  That, however, does not support a claim of direct copyright infringement by \nDeviantArt itself .   \nIn opposition, plaintiffs offer three theories of DeviantArt’s direct infringement : \n \n(1) direct infringement by distributing Stable Diffusion, which \ncontains compressed copies of the training images, as part of \nDeviantArt’s DreamUp AI imaging product; (2) direct infringement \nby creating and distributing t heir DreamUp, which is itself an \ninfringing derivative work; and (3) generating and distributing output \nimages which are infringing derivative works.  \nDkt. No. 65 at 6.   In support , plaintiffs point to their allegations that: “Stable Diffusion has been \nused as a Software Library within” DreamUp, id. ¶ 23; “DreamUp is a commercial product that \nrelies on Stable Diffusion to produce images,” id. ¶ 35; “DreamUp is a web -based app that \ngenerates images in response to Text Prompts. Like DreamStudio, DreamUp relies  on Stability’s \nStable Diffusion software as its underlying software engine,” id. ¶ 64; that DeviantArt embraced \n“Stable Diffusion by incorporating it into their website via the DreamUp app,” id. ¶ 123; and \nDeviantArt decided to use “‘Stable Diffusion beca use it's the only option for us to take an open \nsource [software engine] and modify it.’” Id. ¶ 129 (quoting DeviantArt CEO).  \nDeviantArt vigorously dispute s the assertion s – made throughout the Complaint – that \n“embedded and stored compressed copies of the  Training Images” are contained within Stable \nDiffusion.  See Compl. ¶¶ 3, 19, 58 ; see also  ¶ 18 ( Output Images are derivative works as they \ncontain “contain compressed copies of the copyrighted works they were trained on.” ).  DeviantArt \n(and Stability and Midjourney) argue  that those assertions are implausible given plaintiffs’ \nallegation  that the training dataset was comprised of five billion images ; five billion images could \nnot possibly be compressed into an active program .  Defendants also  claim that  the “compressed \ncopies”  allegations are contradict ed by  plaintiffs’  descriptions of the diffusion process in the \nComplaint .  Those descriptions admit that the diffusion process involves not copying of images, \nbut instead the application of  math ematical equations and algorithms to capture concepts from the \nTraining Images . Compl. ¶¶ 70, 75, 79.  Finally, defendants  rely heavily on plaintiffs ’ admission  \nthat, “[i]n general, none of the Stable Diffusion output images provided in response to a parti cular Case 3:23-cv-00201-WHO     Document 117     Filed 10/30/23     Page 8 of 28 \n9 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  Text Prompt is likely to be a close match for any specific image in the training data .” Id. ¶ 93 .  In \nlight of that , defendants argue that plaintiffs cannot plausibly plead copying in violation of the \nCopyright Act  based on Output Images . \nTurning to the first theory of direct copyright infringement and the plausibility of \nplaintiffs’ assertion that Stable Diffusion contains “compressed copies” of the Training Images \nand DeviantArt ’s DreamUp product  utilizes those compress copies, DeviantArt is corr ect that the \nComplaint is unclear.  As noted above, the Complaint repeatedly alleges that Stable Diffusion  \ncontains compressed copies of registered works.  But t he Complaint also describes the diffusion \npractice as follows:   \n \nBecause a trained diffusion m odel can produce a copy of any of its \nTraining Images —which could number in the billions —the diffusion \nmodel can be considered an alternative way of storing a copy of those \nimages. In essence, it’s similar to having a directory on your computer \nof billions  of JPEG image files. But the diffusion model uses \nstatistical and mathematical methods to store these images in an even \nmore efficient and compressed manner.  \nCompl. ¶ 75(c).  \n Plaintiffs will be required to amend to clarify  their theory with respect to com pressed \ncopies  of Training Images and to state facts in support of how Stable Diffusion – a program that is \nopen source, at least in part6 – operates with respect to the Training Images .  If plaintiffs contend \nStable Diffusion contains “compressed copies ” of the Training Images , they need to define \n“compressed copies ” and explain plausible facts in support.  And if plaintiffs ’ compressed copies \ntheory is based on a contention that Stable Diffusion contains mathematical or statistical methods  \nthat can be ca rried out through algorithms  or instructions in order  to reconstruct the Training \nImages  in whole or in part to create the new Output Images, they need to clarify that and provide \n \n6 At the hearing, the parties disputed how much information plaintiffs co uld discover from \nreviewing the open source  and or publicly available code for Stable Diffusion . Plaintiffs assert ed \nthat in order to really figure out how Training Images are present in Stable Diffusion, they would \nneed access to information that has not been publicly released by Stability.  Stability responded \nthat the only information that may not be publicly available are  “weight files” that allow users like \nDeviantArt and Midjourney to set different weights and parameters for their output, but are \nirrelevant to the “compressed copies” issue.  Compare  Tr. at 6:13 -20 with Tr. at 28:1 -11.  On \namendment, plaintiffs might cons ider plead ing facts regarding what they can or cannot determine \nfrom review of the Stable Diffusion code.  Case 3:23-cv-00201-WHO     Document 117     Filed 10/30/23     Page 9 of 28 \n10 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  plausible facts in support.    \n Depending on the facts alleged  on amendment , DeviantArt (and Midjourney) may make a \nmore targeted attack on the direct infringement contentions.  It is unclear, for example, if Stable \nDiffusion contains only algorithms and instructions that can be applied to the creation of images \nthat include only a few elements of a copyrighted Training Image, whether Deviant Art or \nMidjourney can be liable for direct infringement by offering their clients use of the Stable \nDiffusion “library” through their own apps and websites.   But if plaintiffs can  plausibly  plead that \ndefendants’ AI products allow users to create new works  by expressly referencing Anderson’s \nworks by name, the inferences about how and how much of Anderson’s protected content remains \nin Stable Diffusion  or is used by the AI end -products  might be stronger.7 \nIn addition to providing clarity regarding their de finition of and theory with respect to the \ninclusion of compressed copies of Training Images  in Stable Diffusion , plaintiffs shall also \nprovide more facts that plausibly show how DeviantArt is liable for direct copyright infringement \nwhen, according to pla intiffs’ current allegations, DeviantArt simply provides its customers access \nto Stable Diffusion as a library.  Plaintiffs do cite testimony from DeviantArt’s CEO that \nDeviantArt uses Stable Diffusion because Stability  allowed DeviantArt to “modify ” Stabl e \nDiffusion. Compl. ¶ 129 .  The problem is that there are no al legations what those modifications \nmight be or why, given the structure of Stable Diffusion, any compressed copies of copyrighted \nworks that may be present in Stable Diffusion would be copied w ithin the meaning of the \nCopyright Act by DeviantArt or its users  when they use DreamUp .  Nor do plaintiffs provide \nplausible facts regarding DeviantArt “distributing” Stable Diffusion to its users when users access \nDreamUp through the app or through Devia ntArt’s website.     \n That leaves p laintiffs’ third theor y of direct infringement ; that DreamUp  produces “Output \nImages” that are all infringing derivative works.8  DeviantArt argues  that to adequately plead this \n \n7 Plaintiffs’ second theory of direct infringement – that Stable Diffusion is a “derivative work” \nbecause it contains compressed copies of billions of  copyrighted images and by incorporating \nStable Diffusion into DreamUp, DeviantArt is liable for producing works that have been \n“transformed” based on plaintiffs ’ works, Dkt. No. 65 at 13 -14 – fails for the same reasons.  \n \n8 See also  17 U.S.C. § 101: “A ‘de rivative work’ is a work based upon one or more preexisting Case 3:23-cv-00201-WHO     Document 117     Filed 10/30/23     Page 10 of 28 \n11 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  claim, plaintiffs must allege the Output Images are substantially similar to the protected works but \nthey cannot do so given plaintiffs’ repeated admission that “none of the Stable Diffusion output \nimages provided in response to a particular Text Prompt is likely to be a close match for any \nspecifi c image in the training data.”  Compl. ¶ 93 ; see Skidmore as Tr. for Randy Craig Wolfe Tr. \nv. Led Zeppelin , 952 F.3d 1051, 1064 (9th Cir. 2020 (“the hallmark of ‘unlawful appropriation’ is \nthat the works share substantial similarities.”).9  Plaintiffs  argue that they do not need to plead or \naddress substantial similarity under Range Rd. Music, Inc. v. E. Coast Foods, Inc ., 668 F.3d 1148  \n(9th Cir. 2012) .  There, addressing allegations that copyrighted music was played fr om a compact \ndisc and performed live , the court held:  \n \nA showing of “substantial similarity” is irrelevant in a case like this \none, in which the Music Companies produced evidence that the public \nperformances entailed direct copying of copyrighted works. []. \n(noting that a demon stration of substantial similarity is only necessary \nto prove infringement “[a]bsent evidence of direct copying”); see also \nNarell v. Freeman , 872 F.2d 907, 910 (9th Cir.1989) (noting that “[a] \nfinding that a defendant copied a plaintiff ’s work, without ap plication \nof a substantial similarity analysis” will be made “when the defendant \nhas engaged in virtual duplication of a plaintiff ’s entire work”); 2 \nHoward B. Abrams, The Law of Copyright § 14:10 (2011) (“Direct \nproof [of copying] can consist of ... testi mony of direct observation of \nthe infringing act....”).  \nId. at 1154 .  Plaintiffs rely on that line of cases and point to their allegation that all elements of \nplaintiff Anderson’s copyrighted works (and the copyrighted works of all other s in the purported \nclass) were copied wholesale as Training Images and the refore the  Output Images  are necessarily \nderivative .  See Compl. ¶ 95 ( “Every output image from the system is derived exclusively from the \nlatent images, which are copies of copyrighted images. For these reasons, every hybrid image is \n \nworks, such as a translation, musical arrangement, dramatization, fictionalization, motion picture \nversion, sound recording, art reproduction, abridgment, condensation, or any other form in which \na work may be recast, transformed, or adapted.

The \nsecond part, the intrinsic test, “test[s] for similarity of expression from the standpoint of the \nordinary reasonable observer, with no expert assistance.” (quoting, Jada Toys, Inc. v.

See supra .  The other problem for plaintiffs \nis that it is simply not plausible that every Training Image  used to train Stable Diffusion was \ncopyrighted (as opposed to copyrightable), or that all DeviantArt users’ Output Images rely upon \n(theoretically) copyrighted Training Images,  and therefore all Output images are derivative \nimages .    \n Even if that clarity is provided and even if plaintiffs narrow their allegations to limit them \nto Output Images that draw upon Training Images based upon copyrighted images, I am not \nconvinced that copyright claims based a derivative theory can survi ve absent “substantial \nsimilarity” type allegations.  T he cases plaintiffs rely on appear to recognize that the alleged \ninfringer’s derivative work must still bear some similarity to the original work or contain the \nprotected elements of the original work.   See, e.g., Jarvis v. K2 Inc ., 486 F.3d 526, 532 (9th Cir. \n2007) (finding works were derivative where plaintiff “delivered the images to K2 in one form, and \nthey were subsequently used in the collage ads in a quite different ( though still recognizable ) \nform.

Direct Infringement Contentions Against Midjourney  \n Plaintiffs allege the following regarding the Midjourney product: “the  Midjourney Product \nis a commercial product that produces images in response to text prompts. On information and \nbelief, Stable Diffusion was used in iterations of the Midjourney Product. On information and \nbelief, the version of the Midjourney Product cur rently available was trained on a subset of the \nimages used to train Stable Diffusion,” Compl. ¶ 34; “Midjourney’s main product is an online AI -\nbased image generator offered under the name “Midjourney.” Like DreamUp and DreamStudio, \nthe Midjourney image ge nerator uses Text Prompts as input and produces digital images as output. \nJust like DreamUp and DreamStudio, Midjourney relies on Stable Diffusion as its underlying \nsoftware engine for generating images,” id. ¶ 134; “Midjourney subscribers also receive acc ess to \nthe Midjourney web app, similar to DreamStudio or DreamUp, which lets users access the \nMidjourney service through a web interface,” id. ¶ 139; “Midjourney relies on appropriating \nmillions of copyrighted images created by artists and using these imag es as Training Images,” id. ¶ \n144; “Midjourney is a collage tool, only capable of producing images that are remixed and \nreassembled from the copyrighted work of others,” id. ¶ 145; Midjou rney’s CEO, when asked how \ndatasets Midjourney uses replied, “[i]t’s just a big scrape of the internet. We use the open data sets \nthat are published and train across those,” id. ¶ 148.  \nIn opposition to Midjourney’s motion to dismiss, plaintiffs identify  theories of direct \ninfringement against Midjourney that differ slightly from  those offered against DeviantArt:  Case 3:23-cv-00201-WHO     Document 117     Filed 10/30/23     Page 13 of 28 \n14 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California   \n(1) direct infringement by reproducing protected works by scraping \n(i.e., copying) and reproducing images used as training images for the \nMidjourney Product; (2) direct infringement by distributing Stable \nDiffusion, whic h contains compressed copies of the training images, \nas part of the Midjourney Product; (3) direct infringement by creating \nand distributing their Midjourney Product, which is itself an \ninfringing derivative work; and (4) generating and distributing output  \nimages which are infringing derivative works.  \nDkt. No. 67 at 5 .  On the first theory, unlike the detailed allegations regarding Stability’s role  with \nLAION and Stability’s connection to the scraping and then use of the  Training Images for Stable \nDiffusion , there are no facts regarding what training, if any, Midjourney conducted  for its \nMidjourney product .  The only reference is to th e comments of Midjourney’s CEO that \nMidjourney uses the open datasets (that plaintiffs presume are from LAION, Compl. ¶ 149)  and \nthey and everyone else “train” across them.  Id. ¶ 148.   However, plaintiffs also allege that \nMidjourney uses Stable Diffusion.  Id. ¶ 23 (“Stable Diffusion has been used as a Software \nLibrary within multiple programs, including DreamStudio, DreamUp, a nd, on information and \nbelief, the Midjourney Product.”) ; see also  ¶ 17 (“‘Work’ or ‘Works’ refers to any image that was \nused to train any version of Stable Diffusion that was offered directly and/or incorporated into \nanother product by one or more Defenda nts during the Class Period .”).  Plaintiffs need to clarify \ntheir theory against Midjourney --is it based on Midjourney’s use of Stable Diffusion , on \nMidjourney’s own independent use of Training Images to train the Midjourney product, or both ? \n With respect to the other theories, each of them fail for the reasons identified above with \nrespect to DeviantArt.   \n Midjourney’s motion to dismiss Claim 1 is GRANTED with leave to amend.10 \n \n10 In its motion and reasserted during  the hearing  on these motions , Midjourney argued l eave to \namend should not be granted  for plaintiffs’  claim of infringement by performance in violation of \n17 U.S.C. § 106(4 ), because there is no performance right in pictorial works and plaintiffs did not \naddress or oppose dismissal in their opposition .

However, to be liable for vicarious copyright infringement, “a plaintiff \nmust allege that the defendant has (1) the right and ability to supervise the infringing  conduct and \n(2) a direct financial interest in the infringing activity.”  Perfect 10, Inc. v.

(defining common \nquestion as “[w]hether Defendants vicariously violated the copyrights of Pl aintiffs and the Class \nwhen third parties used Defendants’ products to create Fakes”); id. ¶¶ 169 -177 (vicarious liability \nbased on third party “imposters” creating “fakes” using defendants’ products).  \nI recognize that if plaintiffs are able to clarify their theory and add plausible facts that \ncopyrighted compressed copies used or invoked by defendants’ products, there are other issues \nwith plaintiffs’ vicarious infringement theory based on “imposters” u sing defendants’ tools to \nproduce “fakes .”  Plaintiffs ’ Complaint is devoid of any allegation that any of Anderson’s works \n \n11 Midjourney also argues that the vicarious liability claim should be dismissed because “a \ndefendant cannot be secondarily liable for their own direct infringement.”  Sound & Color, LLC v. \nSmith , No. 222CV01508ABASX, 2023 WL 2821881, at *16 (C.D. Cal. Feb. 28, 2023).  However, \nonly after the court determines what, if any claims, for direct infringement are adequately alleged \nagainst each defendant, can the court determine whether plaintiffs are attempting to hold a \ndefendant secondarily liable for their own direct infringement or instead hold them liable for \nothers’  infringement when using defendants’ generative AI product s.

Instead, the Complaint \nalleges that based on how the diffusi on process works, none of the Output Images are likely “to be \na close match for any specific image in the training data.”  Compl. ¶ 93.   In opposition, plaintiffs \nappear to back away from reliance on the imposters and fakes assertions, and instead rely on their \ntheory that all Output Images are derivative infringing works.  See Dkt. No. 65 at 11; Dk t. No. 66 \nat 11; Dkt. No. 67 at 10.  The deficiencies  with that theory have been identified above.  \nCount II is DISMISSED as to each defendant with leave to amend . \nB. DMCA  \nSection 1202(b) of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“DMCA”) provides that:  \n \nNo person shall, without the authority of the copyright owner or the \nlaw— \n \n1. intentionally remove or alter any copyright management \ninformation;  \n2. distribute or import for distribution any copyright management \ninformation knowing that the copyright management information \nhas been removed or altered without authority of the copyright \nowner . . . or  \n3. distribute, import for distribution . . . works [or] copies of works . \n. . kno wing that copyright management information has been \nremoved or altered without authority of the copyright owner . . .  \n \nknowing or having reasonable grounds to know that it will induce, \nenable, facilitate or conceal an infringement of any right under this \ntitle.   \n \n17 U.S.C. § 1202(b).   \nSection 1202(c) defines copyright management information (CMI) to include the \nfollowing :  “[the] title and other information identifying the work, including the information set \nforth on a notice of copyright;” “[the] name of, and other identifying information about, the author \nof a work;” and “[the] name of, and other identifying information  about, the copyright owner of \nthe work, including the information set forth in a notice of copyright.”  17 U.S.C. § 1202(c).  \nIn the Ninth Circuit, to establish knowing or having reasonable grounds to know that \nconduct will “induce, enable, facilitate or c onceal,” a plaintiff “must make an affirmative showing, \nsuch as by demonstrating a past ‘pattern of conduct’ or ‘modus operandi,’ that the defendant was \naware or had reasonable grounds to be aware of the probable future impact of its actions.”  Stevens Case 3:23-cv-00201-WHO     Document 117     Filed 10/30/23     Page 16 of 28 \n17 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  v. Corelogic, Inc. , 899 F.3d 666, 674 (9th Cir. 2018).  At the summary judgment stage, this claim \nrequires providing evidence that the alleged infringer knew that the removal of the CMI would \n“induce, enable, facilitate, or conceal” copyright infringement.  Id. at 673.  At the pleading stage, \nthe claimant must plead facts plausibly showing that the alleged infringer had this required mental \nstate.  Philpot v. Alternet Media, Inc. , No. 18 -cv-04479 -TSH, 2018 WL 6267876, at *5 (N.D. Cal. \nNov. 30, 2018).  While “[ a]t the pleading stage, mental conditions generally need not be alleged \nwith specificity,” a plaintiff must still “allege sufficient facts to support the reasonable inference \nthat the defendant ‘knew or had a reasonable basis to know that the removal or al teration of CMI \n... w[ould] aid infringement.’”  Doe 1 v. GitHub, Inc ., No. 22 -CV-06823 -JST, 2023 WL 3449131, \nat *12 (N.D. Cal. May 11, 2023) (quoting Harrison v. Pinterest, Inc ., No. 20 -cv-05290 -EJD, 2022 \nWL 4348460, at * 5 (N.D. Cal. Sept. 19, 2022)).  \nStability  move s to dismiss the DMCA claim because  plaintiffs fail to allege that Stability \nremoved any “copyright management information” (“CMI”) from any particular work  of the \nplaintiffs .  It contends  that there are no allegations in the Complaint that any  of the plaintiffs \nincluded identified CMI in particular works that were available online, or facts plausibly showing \nthat when the images were scraped and included in training datasets plaintiffs’ CMI was removed.  \nFinally, it claims that  there  are no facts alleged that could plausibly show it  – as opposed to \nLAION or others – had the requisite “double -scienter ”: in other words, facts plausibly supporting \nthat each defendant  knew CMI was being scraped from plaintiffs’ works and knowing that conduct \nwould “induce, enable, facilitate, or conceal an infringement.”  17 U.S.C. § 1202(b) ; Stevens , 899 \nF.3d at 674–75 (“the ‘induce, enable, facilitate or conceal’ requirement is intended to limit liability \nin some fashion — specifically, to instances in which the defendant knows or has a reasonable \nbasis  to know that the removal or alteration of CMI or the distribution of works with CMI \nremoved will aid infringement.”).   DeviantArt and Midjourney make similar arguments, albeit \nfrom a  stronger position because there are no allegations that either of them w as involved with \nLAION or directly with the training of Stable Diffusion where, presumably, the removal or Case 3:23-cv-00201-WHO     Document 117     Filed 10/30/23     Page 17 of 28 \n24 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  of any claim under the fraudulent prong, facts that meet  the heightened Rule 9(b) pleading \nstandard.  \n Finally, plaintiffs assert they have pleaded  a “common law” UCL claim , based on use of \ntheir names and use of their art as property . 18  “The common law tort of unfair competition is \ngenerally thought to be synonymous with the act of ‘passing off’ one’s goods as those of another.” \nBank of the W. v. Superior Court , 2 Cal.4th 1254,  1263 (1992) (explaining that the tort provided \n“an equitable remedy against the wrongful exploitation of trade names and common law \ntrademarks that were not otherwise entitled to legal protection ”); see also  Sybersound Recs. , Inc. v. \nUAV Corp ., 517 F.3d 1137, 1153 (9th Cir. 2008).   Given the shifting nature of plaintiffs’ claims – \nfrom misappropriation of their styles or artistic identi ties to misappropriation of  their name s and \nassociating their names with works not their ow n – the common law UCL claim is likewise \ndismissed, but with leave to amend to allow plaintiffs to clarify  their theory and plead facts that \ncould plausibly support a passing off claim.  \n Plaintiffs ’ UCL claim is dismissed with leave to amend to address the  many issues \nidentified.  \nE. Declaratory Relief  \nFinally, each defendant argue s that plaintiffs’ declaratory relief claim – seeking a \ndeclaration that defendants violated various statutes – fails because all of the other claims fail and \nbecause the request for declaratory relief is on face  duplicative of their other claims .  Given the \nunsettled status of the pleadings and the evolving nature of plaintiffs’ theories of liability, the \nmotions to dismiss the declaratory relief claim as duplicative are DENIED without prejudice.  \nHowever, when plaintiffs amend their complaint, they  should identify the scope of declaratory \nrelief sought and in particular provide examples of declaratory relief sought that are not merely \nduplicative of the scope of their statutory claims.  \n \n18 The tort of unfair competition under California law requires plaintiffs to prove: (1) that plaintiffs \nhave invested substantial time, skill or money in developing their property; (2) that defendants \nappropriated and used that property at little or no cost ; (3) that defendants’ appropriation and use \nof plaintiffs’ property was without the authorization or consent; and (4) that plaintiffs were \ninjured. See City Sols., Inc. v. Clear Channel Commc'ns , 365 F.3d 835, 842 (9th Cir. 2004).  \n Case 3:23-cv-00201-WHO     Document 117     Filed 10/30/23     Page 24 of 28 \n25 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  II. BREACH OF CONTRACT CLAIM  \nPlaintiffs  separately  allege a breach of contract claim against DeviantArt based on the \nagreement of McKernan and unspecified “ others” to DeviantArt’s website Terms of Service \n(“TOS,” Compl. Ex. 17, Dkt. No. 1 -17)19 and DeviantArt’s “ Privacy Statement.”  In the \nComplaint, p laintiffs allege that unspecified provisions in the  TOS control how DeviantArt can \nuse artists ’ intellectual property and private information and claim that DeviantArt violated those \nprovisions.  Compl. ¶ 232.  Plaintiffs also rely on unspecified TOS provisio ns prohibiting users \nfrom taking content “for any commercial purpose” and prohibiting commercial advertising on \nDeviantArt’s website without DeviantArt’s written approval .  Compl. ¶ 124 .  Plaintiffs contend \nthat DeviantArt itself breach ed these provisions  by: \n \na. Sharing Plaintiffs’ and the Class’s personal data with unauthorized \nthird parties in violation of the DeviantArt Privacy Statement;  \nb. Selling and distributing Plaintiffs’ and the Class’s personal data in \ncontravention of the DeviantArt’s Policies;  \nc. Use of Plaintiffs’ and the Class’s personal data after the DeviantArt \nPrivacy Statement explicitly claims it will be deleted;  \nd. Use and distribution of Plaintiffs’ and the Class’s personal data \noutside the limitations set forth in the DeviantArt Priva cy Statement.  \nCompl. ¶  232.  They also assert  that DeviantArt “was aware or reasonably should have been \naware” that Stability was “acting in violation of those terms.”  Id. ¶ 125.  \nDeviantArt moves to dismiss the breach claim, contending that plaintiffs hav e failed to \nallege acts of DeviantArt’s conduct (as opposed to Stability ’s conduct) that DeviantArt took or \nfailed to take that could constitute a breach of specific provisions of its TOS or privacy statement.  \nIt points out that there is no evidence that Stability is bound by DeviantArt’s  TOS or Privacy \nPolicy that provide the basis of the breach of contract claim, and instead points to provision s in the \nTOS that give DeviantArt discretion in how to handle infringement on its website.  TOS § 3  \n(“Trademarks”) , § 14 (“Password”) .  It also argues that the only provisions of the TOS relied on  \nby plaintiffs  in their Complaint  do not restrict DeviantArt but instead restrict users’ ability to \nconduct commercial and other activity on the DeviantArt website.  See, e.g.,  TOS §  19 \n(“Conduct,” discussing user conduct ); § 19A (“Commercial Activities”) . \n \n19 Provisions of the TOS  are quoted in the Complaint and the TOS are attached as an exhibit to the \nComplaint.  The TOS, therefore, are incorporated by reference.  Case 3:23-cv-00201-WHO     Document 117     Filed 10/30/23     Page 25 of 28 \n26 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  In opposition, plaintiffs focus on § 16  of the TOS , a provision not  identified or quoted in \ntheir Complaint : \n \n16. Copyright in Your Content  \n \nDeviantArt does not claim ownership rights in Your Content. For the \nsole purpose of enabling us to make your Content available through \nthe Service, you grant to DeviantArt a non -exclusive, royalty -free \nlicense to reproduce, distribute, re -format, store, prepare derivative \nworks based on, and publicly display and perform Your Content. \nPlease note that when you upload Content, third parties will be able \nto copy, distribute and display y our Content using readily available \ntools on their computers for this purpose although other than by \nlinking to your Content on DeviantArt any use by a third party of your \nContent could violate paragraph 4 of these Terms and Conditions \n[preserving copyrigh t rights in the original owner of the copyright and \ndisclaiming any ownership interest of DeviantArt in the posted work] \nunless the third party receives permission from you by license.  \nPlaintiffs argue  that DeviantArt breached this provision when “it incor porated Stable Diffusion \ninto its own AI Image product knowing that Stability had scraped DeviantArt’s artists’ work.”  \nOppo to DeviantArt MTD [Dkt. No. 65] at 22.  However, section 16 provides a limited license to \nDeviantArt and warns that third parties  may be able to copy and violate content -owners’ rights.  It \ndoes not clearly cover  the conduct  that plaintiffs accuse  DeviantArt  of in this suit ; offering for use \na product that a third party  may have created in part by using material posted on DeviantArt’s  own \nsite.  There are no facts alleged supporting an allegation that DeviantArt itself  exceeded the scope \nof the limited license.  \n DeviantArt also challenges the ability of plaintiff McKernan and the unspecified “others” \nto sue DeviantArt for breach claims  based on  contractual provisions  prohibiting other  users \n(presumably here, Stability)  from using DeviantArt content for commercial uses.  The Complaint \ndoes not allege and is devoid of facts supporting the inference that Stability is bound by the TOS \nor that plaintiff McKernan or others are third party beneficiaries of specific provisions in the TOS \nwho may sue to enforce terms  of agreements entered between DeviantArt and Stability .     \n The breach of contract claim is DISMISSED with leave to amend.  If plaintiffs attempt to  \namend  this claim, they must i dentify the exact provisions in the TOS they contend DeviantArt \nbreached and facts in suppo rt of breach  of each identified provision .  To the extent plaintiffs rely \non provisions that appear to protect or benefit DeviantArt but not the users, or contracts Case 3:23-cv-00201-WHO     Document 117     Filed 10/30/23     Page 26 of 28 \n27 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  DeviantArt entered into with other entities, plaintiffs must identify  those precise provisi ons and \nfacts in support of breach,  but also facts supporting plaintiffs’  theory that they are intended third \nparty beneficiaries of those provisions.  \nIII. CLASS ALLEGATIONS  \nMidjourney separately moves to strike plaintiffs’ class action allegations.  Dkt. No. 523 at \n21-25.  Midjourney recognizes my many decisions  rejecting pleading -stage challenges to whether \nallegation s support class certification under Rule 23.  Id. at 22.  It nonetheless argues  that the class \nallegations should be stricken in this case because no d amages class or injunctive relief class can \nbe pleaded given the inherently fact -intensive inquiries regarding copyright  ownership and \nregistration, similarity and confusion determinations, as well as standing and consent to use  issues \nthat routinely arise  in copyright  and other branches of intellectual property  litigation.   \nThe motion to strike the class allegations is DENIED.  Whether or not the types of  claims \nthat remain after the pleadings are settled  are certifiable – in whole or in part, for damages under \nRule 23(b)(3) or for resolution of common issues under Rule 23(b)(1) or (b)(2) – is better \ndetermined at the class certification stage and not at the motion to dismiss stage.  At this juncture, \npreclud ing the possibility of resolution of issues or claims through a class action is premature.    \nIV. DEVIANTART SPECIAL MOTION TO STRIKE  \n DeviantArt moves to strike the plaintiffs’ right of publicity claims, arguing their conduct is \nprotected activity under Calif ornia’s anti -SLAPP statute.  California Code of Civil Procedure § \n425.16.20  Assuming the anti -SLAPP statute applies – in other words, that DeviantArt’s conduct in \nproviding the DreamUp program is expressive conduct protected by the statute – the merits of  the \nspecial motion to strike depends on the same arguments defendants assert in their motions to \ndismiss , namely, whether the right to publicity claims are preempted by the Copyright Act and \nwhether they have otherwise been adequately alleged.   \n Because I have dismissed the right to publicity claim with leave to amend, I defer ruling on \nDeviantArt’s special motion to strike.  When plaintiffs reallege the right to publicity claim, then \n \n20 The other defendants joint DeviantArt’s special motion to strike.  Dkt. Nos. 54, 5 9, 79 , 80.

Plaintiffs are given leave to amend and \nattempt to cure the deficiencies identified above.  The amended complaint, if any, must be filed \nwithin thirty (30) days of the date of this Order.  \nIT IS SO ORDERED.  \nDated:  October 30, 2023  \n \n  \nWilliam H.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: This case involves a group of visual artists suing five companies, including Stability AI, for allegedly using their artworks without permission to train a generative AI model, Stable Diffusion. The artists claim this constitutes widespread copyright infringement. The court decision primarily addresses disputes regarding the protocols for discovery, including the production of electronically stored information (ESI) and the mechanics of depositions.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: The primary legal issue centers on the management of ESI protocols, particularly how to accommodate large volumes of data and determine the scope and method of discovery in a complex case involving AI technologies.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court resolves disputes over the terms of ESI protocol, protective order definitions, and deposition limits. Notably, the court allows for thirty depositions instead of the initially proposed sixty, considering the complexity of the case but mindful of the burdens on defendants. The parties are instructed to finalize and file revised protocols according to the court's modifications.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine you are part of a group of artists who find out that a famous art-making robot used your artworks to learn how to paint, without asking you. You take them to court to say they shouldn't have used your art like that. The big debate isn't just about that, but also how both sides need to share their emails, files, and notes with each other to see what happened. The court helps decide how many people you can chat with and how much information they need to give you so it's fair but not too hard for the companies.",

INTRODUCTIONCase No.  23-cv-00201-WHO   (LJC) \nORDER ON ES I PROTOCOL ; \nPROTECTIVE ORDE R; DEPOSITION \nPROTOCOL \nRe: Dkt. Nos. 248, 249, 257\nPlaintiffs, a group of visual artists whose works were allegedly used to train a generative\nartificial intelligence (AI) model called Stable Diffusion, brought this putative class action on \nbehalf other similarly situated artists against Defendants , five companies that created and/or used \nStable Diffusion.   Among other claims, Plaintiffs allege  that Defendants have engaged in \nwidespread copyright infringement.  See generally  ECF No. 238 (Second Amended Complaint). \nThis matter was referred to the undersigned  for discovery.   ECF No. 250.  The parties have been  \nunable to agree on the terms of a stipulated electronically stored information protocol (ESI \nProtocol) and stipulated protective order (Protective Order)  and have submitted competing \nproposals for both.  The parties have also been unable to agree on the number of depositions of \nDefendants’ fact witnesses that Plaintiffs may conduct.  \nII. ESI PROTOCOL\nJudge Orrick’s Standing Order specifies that parties who seek an order on ESI discovery\nprotocols “shall use” one of the Northern District’s models, “unless good cause exists to depart \nfrom the model order.”  Standing Order ¶ 5.   The parties have agreed to use th e Northern District’s \nModel Stipulated Order Regarding Discovery of ESI (Model ESI Order) as a starting point and Case 3:23-cv-00201-WHO     Document 260     Filed 03/19/25     Page 1 of 17 \n2 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  adapt it to fit their needs but  disagree about the  appropriate  extent of modifications.  In some \ninstances, Defendants have advocated for certain language from the district’s Model Stipulated \nOrder re Discovery of Electronically Stored Information for Patent Litigation (Patent Model ESI \nOrder).  Given the nature of the lawsuit, the Court anticipates that there will be a large volume of \nESI in diverse forms.  A detailed ESI protocol, similar to what Plaintiffs  have proposed, is \nwarranted.  See Harden v. Mendocino Coast District Hospital , 17-cv-05554, 2019 WL 4256383, \nat *1 (N.D. Cal. Sept. 9, 2019) (“[A]n ESI protocol has to be specific or it doesn’t mean \nanything.”).   \nA. Paragraphs 1  and 2  \nThe Court rejects  Defendants’ proposed addition to Paragraphs 1  and accepts Defendants’ \nproposed language to Paragraph 2 that incorporates language from th is district’s  Model Patent \nOrder .  Thus, Paragraph s 1 and 2 shall read:  \n1. PURPOSE  \n \nThis Order will govern discovery of electronically stored information \n(“ESI”) in this  case as a supplement to the Federal Rules of Civil \nProcedure, this Court’s Guidelines for the  Discovery of Electronically \nStored Information, and any other applicable orders and rules.  \n \n2. COOPERATION  \n \nThe parties are aware of the importance the Court places on \ncooperation and commit to cooperate in good faith throughout the \nmatter consistent with this Court’s Guidelines for the Discovery of \nESI.  As in all cases, costs may be shifted for disproportionate ESI \nproduction requests pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26. \nLikewise, a party’s nonresponsive or dilatory discovery tactics are \ncost-shifting considerations.  \nB. Paragraph 4  \nThe Court accepts the parties’ largely agreed upon Paragraph 4.  See ECF No. 248 -3 ¶ 4. \nAs to Defendants’ modification to Plaintiffs’ addition to Paragraph 4, the Court expects  that the \n“reasonable steps” the parties will take to implement litigation holds include establishing \nprocedures to make sure that notices of the holds are  easily understood, and received by the \nnecessary parties  and acted upon.  See ECF No. 249 -4 ¶ 4.   Accordingly, Paragraph 4  has been \nmodified slightly for clarity and shall read : \nThe parties have an obligation to take reasonable steps to preserve Case 3:23-cv-00201-WHO     Document 260     Filed 03/19/25     Page 2 of 17 \n3 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  discoverable information in the parties’ possession, custody, or \ncontrol, which includes Metadata where applicable, consistent with \nthe Federal Rules.   \nThe parties that are business entities have issued, or immediately after \nthis Order has taken effect shall issue, litigation hold notices to those \ninternal departments, divisions, committees, teams, and individuals \nlikely to possess potentially responsive information, and to persons or \nentities responsible for maintenance of non -custodial sources, likely \nto contain potentially responsive information .  These business entities \nshall establish procedures, if they have not already done so, to ensure \nthat the no tices are easily understood , and have been received and \nappropriately acted upon.      \nC. Paragraph 5  and its subparagraphs  \nPlaintiffs and Defendants have presented competing proposals under the heading s “Search”  \nand “ESI Search,” respectively .  Plaintiff s propose a series of five subparagraphs that address \ndisclosures, search methodology, search terms, hit reports, and validation.  Defendants propose a \nsingle paragraph that focuses on the selection of search terms and search strings.  The Court \nadopts in part Plaintiffs ’ approach because it sets parameters for a series of topics related to ESI \nsearch  that will clarify and advan ce cooperation for purposes of ESI discovery .     \nPlaintiffs’ first proposed subparagraph, Paragraph 5.a is adopted to the extent it is \nconsistent with this district’s Guidelines for  the Discovery of Electronically Stored Information  \n(ESI Guidelines) .  The ESI  Guidelines encourage the parties to discuss certain ESI -related  topics \nas part of the required  Rule 26(f) meet and confer  conference, including the sources, scope, and \ntype of ESI , as well as date ranges and other details.  See ESI Guideline 2.02.   \nPlaintiffs’ proposed Paragraph 5.a also requires the disclosure of certain preservation -\nrelated information in writing , namely the specific reasons why categories or sources of \ndiscoverable information have not been preserved or should not be preserved .  In contrast, \nDefendants’ proposed protocol does not address disclosures or discussions regarding the scope of \npreservation .  It is well recognized that early discussion of the scope of preservation can reduce \ndisputes and the need for court intervention.  See Sedona Principles, Third Edition, Principle 3  \n(“As soon as practicable, parties should confer and seek to reach agreement regarding the \npreservation and production of electronically stored information.”); Comment 3.a.  (noting that \nparties may seek to resolve early the identification of data sources that will be subject to Case 3:23-cv-00201-WHO     Document 260     Filed 03/19/25     Page 3 of 17 \n4 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  preservation, and the relevant time period, among other issues).  T he Court modifies Paragraph 5.a \nto align it with the ESI Guidelines’ recommendations  and Rule 26(b)(2)(B) of the Federal Rules of \nCivil Procedure .  At the outset of the discovery process, this protocol does not require Defendants \nto detail in writing the specific reasons why categories or sources of discoverable information have \nnot been preserved or should not be preserved .  See ESI Guideline 2.01(e).  \nThe parties also disagree  on the number of custodians.   Plaintiffs propose that each party \nidentify the twenty -four custodians believed to most likely have discoverable ESI, while \nDefendants ’ counterproposal  provides that “the parties will identify up to five (5) custodians \nbelieved to most likely have discoverable ESI.”   In this action there are eight  individual named \nPlaintiffs1 and multiple Defendants: Stability AI Ltd. and Stability AI, Inc. (collectively “Stability \nAI”), Midjourney, Inc., DeviantArt,  Inc., and Runway AI, Inc.  On one hand, g iven the number of \nindividual named Plaintiffs, Plaintiffs’ proposal raises the prospect of a significant, perhaps \nexcessive number of custodians relative to the number and size of each Defendant and the issues \ninvolved in this case.   At the same time, i t is not clear from the record the number of employees at \neach defendant company, and whether each Defendant is a similarly sized company.   On the other \nhand, Defendants’ counter proposal appears overly restrictive.  To resolve the number of \ncustodians, the Court directs that a Requesting Party may request up to twelve custodians per \nProducing Party.  Named Plaintiffs are collectively considered a single “Requesting Party,” and \n“Producing Party.”   See Nazemian v. NVIDIA , 24-cv-01454 -JST, Order Regarding Discovery of \nElectronically Stored Information  (Nazemian  ESI Order) , ECF No. 98 at 3.   Stability AI Ltd. and \nStability AI, Inc., collectively Stability AI, is considered a single Requesting and Producing Party.              \nThus, incorporating the Court’s modifications  discussed above , Paragraph 5.a, regarding \ndisclosures shall state:  \nConsistent with the Parties’ obligations under the Rules, the Parties \nwill meet and confer to plan for discovery.  This will include a \ndisclosure of custodians, data sources, anticipated date ranges of \nrelevant documents, and categories of documents or ESI  that contain \ninformation relevant to this litigation.  \n \n1 The Second Amended Complaint names ten individual Plaintiffs, though Kelly McKernan and \nHawke Southworth later dismissed their claims and withdrew from the action.  ECF No. 241.   Case 3:23-cv-00201-WHO     Document 260     Filed 03/19/25     Page 4 of 17 \n5 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California   \nThe Parties shall endeavor to reach an agreement regarding the data \nsources subject to preservation and discovery.  To advance that effort, \nthe Parties shall disclose (a) categories or sources of relevant \ninformation that are not reasonably accessible because of undue \nburden or cost , and (b) categories of data or sources that a party \nbelieves could contain relevant information, but are not discoverable \nand should not be preserved under the proportionality factors.  A \nRequesting Party may request up to twelve custodians per Producing \nParty.  Named Plaintiffs are collectively considered a single \n“Requesting Party,” and a single “Producing Party.”  Stability AI Ltd. \nand Stability AI, Inc., collectively Stability AI, is considered a single \nRequesting and a single Producing Party.  The parties may jointly \nagree to modify these limits without the Court’s leave.  The Parties \nmay request inclusion of additional custodians as discovery \nprogresses.  The Court shall consider con tested requests for additional \ncustodians, based upon a showing of proportionality to the needs of \nthe case as that Phrase is used in Rule 26 of the Federal Rules of Civil \nProcedure.              \nNext , Plaintiffs’ proposed Paragraph 5.b.  addresses  search methodology  by requiring a \nProducing Party to disclose certain information, namely search terms, keywords, date limitations \nand custodians, prior  to using a search methodology to identify documents for production.   ECF \nNo. 249 -4 at 4 -5.  Defendants’ proposed protocol does not contain an equivalent requirement.  See \nECF No. 248 -3 at 4.  The parties, however, have agreed that in responding to a request for \nproduction of documents under Federal Rule of  Civil Procedure 34, they will “meet and confer \nabout methods to search ESI[.]”  Id.; ECF No. 249 -4 at 4.       \nPlaintiffs’ p roposed Paragraph 5.b does not dictate what methodologies a Producing Party \nmust use or authorize the Requesting Party to choose the search methodolog(ies).  The paragraph \ncontemplates that by being informed of certain aspects of the search method(s), the Requesting \nParty will be able to independently evaluate the search method being used to collect ESI  before it \nis deployed .  The mere disclosure of this information does not run afoul of the Sedona principle \nobserved in NuVasive, Inc. v. Alphatec Holdings, Inc. , No. 18-cv-0347, 2019 WL 4934477, at *2 \n(S.D. Cal. Oct. 7, 2019), which recognized that the responding party is generally best situated to \nevaluate procedures and methodologies appropriate for producing their own ESI.  Id.  The Court’s \nconcern, however, is that the strict timing for the disclosure —prior to a party’s use of a search \nmethod —is an unnecessary, preemptive restraint on responding parties.   \nThe Sedona Conference  is a source for guidance related to ESI discovery, and its  Case 3:23-cv-00201-WHO     Document 260     Filed 03/19/25     Page 5 of 17 \n6 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  commentary related to this issue is nuanced.  On one hand, the Sedona Conference’s Comment 6.b \nexplain s, “as a general matter, neither a requesting party nor the court should prescribe or detail \nthe steps that a responding party must take to meet its discovery obligations, and there should be \nno discovery on discovery, absent an agreement between the partie s, or specific, tangible, \nevidence -based indicia (versus general allegations of deficiencies or mere “speculation”) of a \nmaterial failure by the responding part y to meet its obligations.”   The Sedona Principles, Third \nEdition: Best Practices, Recommendations & Principles for Addressing Electronic Document \nProduction , 19 Sedona Conf. J. 1, 1 23 (2018) .  At the same time, the Sedona Conference and this \ndistrict have recognized that search and retrieval parameters and techniques are appropriate topics \nfor discussion at an early meet and confer session.  Id. at 83 ; ESI Guideline 2.02 (stating that it \nmay be useful for the parties to discuss, as part of their Rule 26(f) meet and confer conference \n“planned methods to identify discoverable ESI and filter out ESI that is not subject to discovery.”) . \nThe Court expects cooperation relating to the search and production of ESI, and \n“[c]ooperation in reasonably limiting ESI discovery requests on the one hand, and in reasonably \nresponding to ESI discovery requests on the other hand, tends to reduce litigati on costs and delay.”  \nESI Guideline 1.02; see also  Comment 3.b. , 19 Sedona Conf. J. at 76 (“Cooperation among \ncounsel can enhance the meet and confer process, reduce unnecessary delay and expense \nassociated with non -merit issues, and foster the overriding objectives of Rule 1.”).  Pursuant to the \nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure, t he parties are required to confer on and prepare a discovery \nplan, and their conference must address ESI issues .  Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(f)(3)(C).  The Northern \nDistrict’s accompanying Checklist for Rule 26(f) meet and confers regarding ESI guides the \nparties to discuss  “search method(s), including specific words or phrases or other methodology, \nthat will be used to identify discoverable ESI and filter out ESI that is not subject to discovery,” as \nwell as the “time period during which discoverable information was most li kely to have been \ncreated or received”  and custodians.2  The Checklist does not specify “the timing of the discussion \nof the discussion about these topics, [which] may depend on the nature and complexity of the \n \n2 https://cand.uscourts.gov/filelibrary/1118/ESI_Checklist -12-1-2015.pdf  Case 3:23-cv-00201-WHO     Document 260     Filed 03/19/25     Page 6 of 17 \n7 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  matter.”           \nTo strike the appropriate balance, the Court modifies Plaintiffs proposed Paragraph 5.b as \nfollows : \nAt the appropriate time, a Party that intends to use or is using a search \nmethodology (if any) to identify documents for production,  shall \ndisclose to the Requesting Party, the search terms, keywords, date \nlimitations, and custodians , and shall specify what custodial and non -\ncustodial sources that the  search methodology will or was run against. \nThe custodial sources will presumptively be those identified in the \ndisclosures set forth in Paragraph 5.a.  The parties shall discuss search \nmethods at an early mee t and confer conference, including the \nretrieval parameters identified in th e preceding sentence , to engage in \nmeaningful cooperation that reduces the costs and risk associated with \nESI production.  \n \nWhile the ea rly meet and confer conference may not entail an \nexhaustive discussion of every search to be deployed, the Requesting \nParty may , at a later point in the discovery process,  request a meet and \nconfer to address the adequacy of a search method or search term, if \nthere is a specific, tangible concern that the Requesting Party has \nidentified to the Producing Party.  In such instances, the Producing \nParty shall provide to the Requesting Party any information that it has \nnot already provided that is ne cessary to evaluate the effectiveness of \nthe method or the search, such as the search term hit reports pursuant \nto 5.d. \n \nAt the early meet and confer conference where the parties address ESI \nsearch methods, the parties shall also discuss what method(s) will be \nused for documents that are reasonably believed to be responsive and \nfor which text -based search technologies are fundamentally in \neffective, such as images, spreadsheets, hard copy documents, or \ncertain foreign language documents where the parties do not have \nsuitable search terms in such language.  The Producing Party shall \ndisclose to the Requesting Party the specifi c method(s) it intends to \nuse to search for such documents, and the Requesting Party may make \na reasonable request for information that relates to the method(s)’ \neffectiveness.   \n \nShould a Producing Party wish to use any method or methodology not \nspecifically  addressed by this Order to exclude documents from any \nreview or production, notice to the  Receiving Party must be made \nprior to the use of any such method or methodology. If a Party  intends \nto use Technology Assisted Review (“TAR”) (including Continuous \nActive Learning),  the Parties will agree to a separate TAR protocol to \ngovern that process. If the Parties are unable  to reach agreement on a \nTAR protocol, they will submit any disputed issues to the Court or its  \ndesignee for resolution.   \nPlaintiffs ’ proposed Paragraph s 5.c and 5.d address search terms  and hit reports , \nrespectively .  In Paragraph 5.c  Plaintiffs propose that  the parties shall meet and confer to discuss Case 3:23-cv-00201-WHO     Document 260     Filed 03/19/25     Page 7 of 17 \n8 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  the Producing Party’s proposed search terms and methodology, and prior to or during such meet \nand confers, the Producing Party shall provide all associated information required by the Court.   \nDefendants do not appear to object to meeting and conferring regarding search terms : they have \nagreed to meet and confer about methods to search ESI ; they propose a sentence stating, “The \nCourt encourages the parties to confer on a process to test the efficacy of the search terms [;]” and \nthey agree that the parties may agree jointly to modify limits on the number of search terms that \nthe Court may impose.  Defendants appear amenable to meeting and conferring regarding the \nselection of search terms and to di scuss their efficacy .  For clarity , the Court adopts Plaintiff’s \nproposed language in Paragraph 5.c requiring that the parties shall meet and confer to discuss the \nProducing Party’s proposed search terms and methodology .  The Court also adopts Defendant’s \nproposed language, with certain modifications, concerning the tailoring of search terms.   \nThe parties’ proposals diverge with respect t o establishing a requirement that the \nProducing Party provide search term hit reports in certain circumstances, and limit ing the number \nof search terms.  Plaintiffs ’ propos ed Paragraph 5.c provides that p rior to or during meet and \nconfers  addressing search terms , “the Producing Party shall provide all associated information \nrequired by this Order.”  The proposed Paragraph 5.b states, “At all meet and confers w here the \ntopic is adequacy of search terms to identify  documents subject to production, the Producing Party \nshall be required to provide search term hit reports pursuant to paragraph 5.D, below.”   \nDefendants’ proposed protocol does not address hit reports.     \nThe eff ectiveness  of meet and confers depends on the parties’ candor , and this is especially \ntrue whe n the parties are addressing potential search terms .  Defendants are evidently open to \nengaging in a process to test the efficacy of the search terms, but their proposal does not offer an \nalternative to Plaintiffs’ position that the Producing Party provide hit reports containing certain \ndata points.   Accordingly, t he Court accepts Plaintiffs’ proposal that hit reports be provided as part \nof the meet and conf er process regarding search terms .   \nTurning to the number of search terms, Defendants propose that each requesting party limit \nits ESI production requests to five search terms per custodian per party —the same limited \nimposed by the Patent Model ESI Order.  ECF No. 248 -3 at 4.  Plaintiffs do not propose to limit Case 3:23-cv-00201-WHO     Document 260     Filed 03/19/25     Page 8 of 17 \n9 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  the number of search terms that a requesting party may use.  Defendants, however, have not \npersuaded the Court that the default limit imposed by the Patent Model ESI Order ought to apply \nto this case.  Instead, the Court sets a limit of fifteen search term s per custodian per Party, which \nwas the limit in the Nazemian  ESI Order.   \nIn light of the Court’s determinations above, Paragraph 5.c shall read as follows:  \nWhere the Parties agree that potentially responsive ESI shall be \nsearched using search  terms, the Parties shall meet and confer to \ndiscuss the Producing Party’s proposed search terms  and \nmethodology.  Prior to or during such meet and confers, the Producing \nParty shall provide  all associated information required by this Order.   \nAt all meet and confers w here the topic is adequacy of search terms \nto identify documents subject to production, the Producing Party shall \nprovide search term hit reports pursuant to Paragraph 5.d, unless the \nparties agree otherwise.  \n \nEach Requesting Party shall limit its ESI production requests to a total \nof fifteen search terms per custodian per party.  The search terms shall \nbe narrowly tailored to particular issues.  Indiscriminate terms , such \nas the producing company’s name or its product name, which are \ninappropriate unless  combined with narrowing search criteria that \nsufficiently reduce the risk of overproduction .  A conjunctive \ncombination of multiple words or phrases (e.g., “computer” and \n“system”) narrows  the search and shall count as a single search term. \nA disjunctive combination of multiple words  or phrases (e.g., \n“computer” or “system”) broadens the search, and thus each word or \nphrase  shall count as a separate search term unless they are variants \nof the same word. Use of  narrowing search criteria (e.g., “and,” “but \nnot,” “w/x”) is encouraged to limit the production.    \n \nIf, after disclosure of the Producing Party’s proposed search method, \nsearch parameters,  and search terms, and after a reasonable meet -and-\nconfer process, a Requesting Party has a specific, tangible, evidence \nbased reason to believe that the Producing Party’s proposals regarding \nsearch, retrieval, and production  would result in deficiencies in \nproduction, the Requesting Party may object to the proposal and  make \nrequests for different or additional search methods, parameters, or \nsearch terms. Such  requests s hall only be made after the Parties have \nmet and conferred as to the alleged  deficiencies identified by the \nRequesting Party. If the issue is not resolved within fourteen (14)  \ncalendar days after the objection, either Party may thereafter \nimmediately submit the dispute to  the Court or its designee for \nresolution.   \nPlaintiffs’ proposed Paragraph 5.d is adopted in full.  \nPlaintiffs ’ proposed Paragraph 5.e  states that the parties “will meet and confer about \nmethods to validate each Producing Party’s review process[.]” ECF No. 249 -4 at 6.  Defendants’ \nproposed ESI protocol does not address validation.  It is appropriate for the ESI protocol to Case 3:23-cv-00201-WHO     Document 260     Filed 03/19/25     Page 9 of 17 \n10 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  meaningfully address validation procedures, and the Court modifies Plaintiff’s proposed \nParagraph 5.e as follows , modified from In re Social Media Adolescent Addiction , 2024 WL \n1786293, at *6 -7: \nEach Producing Party shall take reasonable steps to validate its own \nreview process (i.e., using quality control measures to determine \nwhether its production is missing relevant ESI or contains substantial \namounts of irrelevant ESI) and shall take necessar y adjustments to its \nprocess. After a  Requesting Party reviews a Producing Party’s \nproduction , the Requesting Party may req uest additional information \nregarding the validation method(s) used by the Producing Party  and \nthe Producing Party shall disclose the  level of end -to-end recall (the \npercentage of responsive documents in the collection that were \nidentified as responsive by the Producing Party’s methodology). If \nthere are remaining disputes after the Producing Party discloses the \nlevel of end -to-end reca ll, the parties shall meet and confer in good \nfaith to resolve any remaining disputes. Such meet and confer efforts \nshall include a discussion of the tool and parameters used to calculate \nrecall levels.  \n  \nD. Paragraph 6  \nPlaintiffs propose adding a paragraph addressing “Enterprise messaging, mobile device \ndata, and other communication tools.”  ECF No. 249 -4 ¶ 6.  The Court recognizes that the parties’ \nmessaging platforms used during the course of business (Slack, Microsoft Teams, Telegram, etc.) \nand mobile devices may contain responsive ESI and accordingly approves the addition of \nPlaintiffs’ Paragraph 6.  Id.   \nE. Paragraph 7 and 8  \nThe Court approves Plaintiffs’ proposed edits to Paragraph 7.   ECF No. 249 -4 ¶ 7.  It \nlikewise approves the parties’ agreed -upon changes to Plaintiffs’ Paragraph 8 (Defendants’ \nParagraph 7 ) addressing phasing ESI production.  Id. ¶ 8; 248 -3 ¶ 7.  \nF. Paragraph 9  \nPlaintiffs, at Paragraph 9, and Defendants, at Paragraph 8, propose adding specifications \nabout  deduplication.   Defendants’ proposal includes more permissive language (“the Producing \nParty shall  take reasonable steps  to produce  only one such identical copy”) while Plaintiffs’ \nproposal is more direct (“the Producing Party shall produce  only one such identical copy”) but the \nproposals are otherwise the same .  ECF No. 249 -3 ¶ 8.  The Court directs the parties to use the Case 3:23-cv-00201-WHO     Document 260     Filed 03/19/25     Page 10 of 17 \n11 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  language in Defendants’  proposed Paragraph 8 .   \nG. Paragraphs 10 and 11  \nPlaintiffs propose protocols for handling embedded files (Paragraph 10).  Defendants \nobject to producing embedded files , asserting that such an obligation  would be unduly \nburdensome .  Defendants, however, do not explain why such a production would be unduly \nburdensome when embedded files are included in ESI production  in several other comparable \ncases .  See e.g. , Nazemian  ESI Order at 7 -8; In re Uber Techs., Inc., Passenger Sexual Assault \nLitig. , No. 23 -md-03084 -CRB -LJC, 2024 WL 1772832, at *6 (N.D. Cal. Apr. 23, 2024) ; In re \nFacebook, Inc. Consumer Priv. User Profile Litig. , No. 18 -md-2843 VC (JSC), 2021 WL \n10282215, at *30 (N.D. Cal. Sept. 29, 2021).   The Court grants Plaintiffs’ request to add \nParagraph 10, requiring the production of embedded files.   \nPlaintiffs propose protocols for handling the production of hyperlinked documents \n(Paragraph 11).  Defendants ’ arguments misapprehend Plaintiffs’ proposal .  Defendants claim that \nPlaintiffs’ proposal would require the production of any hyperlinks that appear in any document or \ncommunication , along with metadata connecting the document in native format to the document.  \nPlaintiffs, however, appear to acknowledge , to some extent , that technological limitations will \nrestrict which hyperlinks may be “automatica lly produced,” and propose that upon a reasonable \nrequest by the Receiving Par ty, the Producing Party will produce such hyperlinked documents.   \nECF No. 249 -4 at 8.   In addition, Plaintiffs’ proposal calls upon the Producing Party to use \n“available technology” to match hyperlinked documents with email or familial documents , and the \nproduction of related metadata, e.g. BEGATTACH and ENDATTACH, would only be required \nwhere the technology is available to extract such information.  Plaintiffs’ proposal does not appear \nas onerous as Defendants contend, though it leaves out important details, such as how many \nhyperlinks may be requested by a receiving party.   \nTo enhance the ESI protocol’s clarity, the Court adopts , with some modifications,  the \nprovisions for hyperlinks, the production of hyperlinked documents, and hyperlink metadata from \nNazemian  ESI Order at 8 -9 (Section  16).  Accordingly, Paragraph 11 and its subparagraphs shall \nread as follows:  Case 3:23-cv-00201-WHO     Document 260     Filed 03/19/25     Page 11 of 17 \n12 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  11. HYPERLINKS  \nExcept as provided in this paragraph and its subparagraphs , the \nProducing Party shall not be required to produce documents solely \nbecause they are hyperlinked within the Producing Party’s \nproduction.  For purposes of this protocol , “hyperlinked documents” \ninclude but are not limited to documents shared via Google \nWorkspace, Microsoft Office’s “Share Documents via Link” feature, \nor similar cloud -based document storage and sharing platforms.  \n \nThe Parties agree to meet and confer in good faith to resolve any  \ndisputes concerning the appropriateness of production of the \nrequested documents and metadata. Nothing in this paragraph and its \nsubparagraphs shall prevent the Producing Party from producing \nhyperlinked documents that are relevant or responsive to discove ry \nrequests in addition to the documents produced by specific  \nrequest by the Receiving Party.  \n \n a. PRODUCTION OF HYPERLINKED DOCUMENTS  \nThe Parties may request the production of the current version or \ncontemporaneous version of a responsive and non -privileged \ndocument or communication that is within the Producing Party’s \npossession, custody, or control and is hyperlinked within the \nProduci ng Party’s production by providing to the Producing Party a \nlist of hyperlinks and corresponding Bates numbers in which the \nhyperlinked document is referenced.  If the hyperlinked document has \nalready been produced, the Producing Party may alternatively pr ovide \nthe Receiving Party with the document’s Bates number.  Each Party \n(with Named Plaintiffs constituting a single Party, and Stability AI \nentities constituting a single Party) may make up to two hundred such \nrequests.  The parties agree to meet and conf er in good faith to resolve \nany disputes concerning the appropriateness of the production of the \nrequested documents and communications and any reasonable request \nto increase the limit on the total number of hyperlinked documents \nand communications to be p roduced.  If a Requesting Party believes \nthat more requests are warranted and the Receiving Party has not \nagreed to produce additional hyperlinked documents, the Requesting \nParty may initiate the joint letter -brief process pursuant to the Court’s \ndispute r esolution procedures set forth in Standing Order, Section F.5.  \n \n b. PRODUCTION OF HYPERLINK METADATA  \nThe Parties acknowledge that the current version of the hyperlinked \ndocument (i.e., the version produced pursuant to the paragraphs \nconcerning hyperlinks) may differ from the version of the document \nat the time the hyperlink was sent.  The Parties also ack nowledge that \nthe metadata of such document(s) may not reflect the metadata for \nrequested documents at the time the documents were hyperlinked.   \nFor h yperlinked documents  produced pursuant to th ese paragraphs \nconcerning hyperlinks , the Producing Party will  use available \ntechnology to match hyperlinked documents with the email or \nfamilial document to which the documents were attached in Native \nformat, and the Producing Party will use available technology to \nprovide the BEGATTACH and ENDATTACH metadata  fields to \nshow the family relationship.

Paragraph 12  \nAt Paragraph 12, Plaintiffs propose adding specifications about how a producing party \nmust collect and produce structured data, including requirements that the producing party inform \nthe receiving party about all possible formats for the structured data, a nd, if parties cannot agree \non the method of production, the producing party “make the information available for inspection \non this system where it is currently maintained, or otherwise provide direct access to the data.”   \nECF No. 249 -4 ¶ 12.  Defendants a rgue that such process could provide the receiving party \n“unfettered access to their IT infrastructure with no specific showing of burden, need, or \nproportionality[.]”  ECF No. 248 at 5.  Plaintiffs recognize that “it is important for the parties to \ndiscuss at the outset how [structured data] should be handled.”   ECF No. 249 -1 (Saveri Decl.) \n¶ 12.  It is unclear if the parties have engaged in any meaningful discussion about the production \nof structured data.  The parties are therefore ordered to meet and confer to develop a stipulated \nprotocol for producing and reviewing structured data.  \nI. Paragraph 13  \nThe Court accepts Plaintiffs’ addition of Paragraph 13  to the extent that Defendants  have \nnot proposed deleti ng certain text .  ECF Nos. 249 -4 ¶ 4; 248 -3 ¶ 9.  The examples of how Model \nData may be produced, set forth in Plaintiffs ’ proposed Paragraph 13 , do not obligate Defendants \nto produce Model Data in those formats and the inclusion of this sentence do not waive any \narguments Defendants might wish to make about producing Model Data.   The parties may discuss \nthose examples during their meet and confer conference regarding model data.   Paragraph 13 shall \nread as follows:  \nTo the extent such data is not addressed in this protocol, the Parties \nwill meet and confer to address the production of data related to the \nModels at issue.  Given the size, structure and format of such data, the \nParties agree to discuss how Model Data, i f any, should be produced.   \nJ. Paragraphs 14 and 15  \nPlaintiffs propose adding detailed specifications  about  what information must be included \nin privilege logs and a procedure for challenging asserted privileges.  ECF No. 249 -4 ¶¶ 14 -15.  \nThe Court agrees that not establishing clear requirements for privilege logs and privilege log \ndisputes at the outset of discovery  will likely  invite future disputes .  Defendants have objected to Case 3:23-cv-00201-WHO     Document 260     Filed 03/19/25     Page 13 of 17 \n14 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  Plaintiffs’ proposed specifications for the privilege logs, but these requirements are in line with \nprivilege log requirements in other cases, see e.g ., Nazemian  ESI Order at 9 -11; In re Uber Techs., \nInc., Passenger Sexual Assault Litig. , No. 23 -md-03084 -CRB -LJC,  at ECF No. 396 (¶¶  14-17), \nand Defendants fail to cite to any specific authority that discourages against these provisions.  The \nCourt accepts Plaintiffs’ proposal for privilege logs and the procedure for challenging asserted \nprivileges at Paragraph s 14 and 15, respectively .   \nK. Paragraph 16  \nThe parties agree regarding “DOCUMENTS PROTECTED FROM DISCOVERY” .  See \nPlaintiffs Paragraph 16 , ECF No. 249 -4 at 12;  Defendants’ Paragraph 11 , ECF No. 24 8-3 at 6 .  \nL. Appendices  \nPlaintiffs have proposed two appendices: Appendix A, which sets forth technical \nspecifications for the production of ESI, and Appendix B, which addresses metadata fields.  \nDefendants object to both, though they only provide a counterproposal for metadata f ields.  \nDefendants make only a conclusory argument that Plaintiffs’ proposal for technical specifications \nfor ESI production is onerous.  Therefore, the Court adopts Plaintiffs’ proposed Appendix A, ECF \nNo. 249 -4 at 15 -17.   \nWith regard to the appendix for metadata fields, g iven Defendants’ representation that \ncomplying with Plaintiffs’ proposal would require manual entry, be  “technically onerous [,]” and \nlikely to result in error, the Court directs the parties to use Defendants’ metadata fields.  ECF No s. \n248 at 5 ; 248 -3 at 9 -11.  This ruling is made without prejudice and Plaintiffs may renew their \nrequest for the additional fields upon showing that their  need outweighs the burden on Defendants.  \nIII. PROTECTIVE ORDER  \nThe parties ’ only outstanding dispute regarding their protective order is the definition of \n“source code.”  See ECF No. 248 -5 at 4.  Plaintiffs define source code as “the human readable set \nof instructions written in a programming language that defines the operations of a software \napplication, including the algorithms, logic, and functions that shape the program’s behavior.”  \nECF No. 249 -3 § 2.18.  Defendants seek to use the definition provided in the Patent Model \nProtective Order, which defines source code as “computer code and associated comments and Case 3:23-cv-00201-WHO     Document 260     Filed 03/19/25     Page 14 of 17 \n15 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  revisions histories, formulas, engineering specifications, or schematics that define or otherwise \ndescribe in detail the algorithms or structure of software or hardware designs , disclosure of which \nto another Party or Non -Party would create a substantial risk of serious harm that could not be \navoided by less restrictive means .”  ECF No. 248 -2 § 2.9 ; Model  Protective  Order  for Litigation \nInvolving Patents, Highly Sensitive Confidential Information and/or Trade Secrets , U.S. District \nCourt, Northern District of California, https://www.cand.uscourts.gov/forms/model -protective -\norders/ (last visited Jan. 22, 2025) .  Although the parties are not required to use the Patent Model \nProtective Order definition, the Court agrees with Defendants that using the broader definition \nprovided in  the Patent Model Protective Order  is appropriate here.  See In re Meta Pixel \nHealthcare Litigation , No. 22 -cv-03580, 2023 WL 3483296 , at *1 (N.D. Cal. May 16, 2023) \n(adopting a definition of “source code” that “generally tracks” the language in the Patent Model \nProtective Order ).  The Court recognizes that “comments and revisions histories, formulas, \nengineering specifications, or schematics” that define or describe code may be as sensitive —and \nthus warrant the same safeguards —as the code itself.  ECF No. 248 -2 § 2.9.  The parties are \nordered use the Patent Model Protective Order’s definition of source code.  \nIV. DEPOSITION PROTOCOL  \nThe parties submitted an additional dispute regarding their deposition protocol.   ECF No. \n257.  Plaintiffs request to conduct up to 60 depositions of Defendants’ fact witnesses.  Defendants \nobject, countering that each side should be entitled to take up to twelve depositions.  \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 30(a) provides that a party may take up to ten depositions \nwithout leave of the court. C ourts “may alter the limits … on the number of depositions …or on \nthe length of depositions under Rule 30.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(2)A).  In determining whether to \npermit more than ten depositions, the court must consider “whether: (i) the discovery sought is \nunreasonably cumulative or duplicative, or is obtainable from some other source that is more \nconvenient, less burdensome, or less expe nsive; (ii) the party seeking discovery has had ample \nopportunity by discovery in the action to obtain the information sought; or (iii) the burden or \nexpense of the proposed discovery outweighs its likely benefit[.]”  Authentec , Inc. v. Atrua Techs., \nInc., No. C 08 -1423 PJH, 2008 WL 5120767, at *1 (N.D. Cal. Dec. 4, 2008).   Although “courts Case 3:23-cv-00201-WHO     Document 260     Filed 03/19/25     Page 15 of 17 \n16 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  will generally not grant leave to expand the number of depositions until the moving party has \nexhausted the ten depositions permitted as of right” ( id.), the Northern District regularly departs \n“from this rule where the complexity of the case clearly warranted more than ten depositions.” \nSayce v. Forescout Techs., Inc. , No. 20 -cv-00076, 2024 WL 3579002, at *1 (N.D. Cal. July 11, \n2024); see Del Campo v. American Corrective Counseling Servs., Inc. , No. C -01, 2007 WL \n3306496 (N.D. Cal. Nov. 6, 2007); Kadrey v.  Meta Platforms, Inc. , No. 23 -cv-03417, 2024 WL \n4502099, at *2 (N.D. Cal. Oct. 15, 2024) (permitting Plaintiff to take twenty -five fact depositions \nin copyright dispute regarding generative AI).  “A party seeking to exceed the presumptive \nnumber of depositions must make a particularized showing of the need for the additional \ndiscovery.”  Authentec , 2008 WL 5120767, at *1.  \nPlaintiffs argue they are entitled to sixty  depositions because of “the number of corporate \ndefendants, the technical nature of the infringement, and the vast scale of the alleged misconduct.” \nECF No. 257 at 1.  They reason that taking sixty depositions, or fifteen per defendant, is \nreasonable given the scope of the case.  Id. at 2. This will permit them to take twenty to twenty -\nfive depositions of “core technical witnesses”, fifteen to twenty  depositions of witnesses in \ncorporate leadership roles (includin g “executive leadership, project managers, and strategic \ndecision -makers”), and fifteen to twenty  depositions of Defendants’ “business operations \npersonnel.”   Id. at 2-3.  Defendants object, arguing that Plaintiffs’ request “lacks any particularized \njustification ” and that Plaintiffs’ “proposed breakdown of total deponents…is arbitrary and \nuntethered to any document, filing, or fact specific to any Defendant .”  Id. at 4.  They contend that \nmost of the Defendant companies are “early -stage, lean startups”  with relatively few employees, \nand permitting Plaintiffs to depose “extraneous employees” would result in duplicative testimony \nand pose a significant burden on Defendants.  Id. at 4-5.  \nThe Court agrees with Plaintiffs’ overall position that exceeding the ten -deposition limit is \nwarranted here given the “complexity of the case[ ,]” but is mindful of the potential burden on \nDefendants and the risk that allowing Plaintiffs sixty depositions would be unreasonably \ncumulative or duplicative.   Sayce , 2024 WL 3579002, at *1 ; see Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b) . The Court \nfinds it appropriate at this time to grant Plaintiffs leave to take thirty depositions , to be allocated at Case 3:23-cv-00201-WHO     Document 260     Filed 03/19/25     Page 16 of 1717 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  Plaintiffs’ discretion.   Plaintiffs may renew their request for additional depositions if they \ndetermine they are necessary after taking the first thirty  depositions.  The thirty -deposition limit \ndoes not include depositions of non -parties, expert witnesses, of former employees.  This limit \ndoes not change the parties’ agreement regarding 30(b)(6) depositions at ¶ 22 of the Stipulated \nOrder Entering Deposition Protocol. ECF No. 25 7-1 ¶ 22.  \nV. CONCLUSION\nHaving resolved the disputes discussed above concerning the terms of the ESI protocol, the\nparties are ordered to incorporate the Court’ s rulings from this Order into a fina l Stipulated and \n[Proposed] ESI Protocol, to be filed with the Court by March 31, 2025.  Before March 31, 2025, \nthe parties shall also meet and confer regarding the outst anding issues related to structured data \nand model data.  If the parties are able to reach a n agreement to resolve these issues, they shall \ninclude the necessary provisions in the final Stipulated and [Proposed] ESI Protocol.  If parties are \nunable to reach a n agreement they shall file by April 7, 2025 a joint discovery lette r concerning \ntheir respective proposals, following the procedure in Section F.5 of the undersigned ’s Standing \nOrder.     \nThe parties shall file a Stipulated Protective Order, consistent with this Order, by March \n31, 2025.  \nIT IS SO ORDERED. \nDated:  3/19/2025\nLISA J.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: This case involves a putative class action against OpenAI, alleging that ChatGPT, its AI language model, was trained using copyrighted books without the authors' consent, leading to potential copyright infringement. The court partly granted and partly denied OpenAI's motion to dismiss, leaving open the plaintiff's claims of direct copyright infringement and unfair competition while dismissing other claims related to vicarious copyright infringement, DMCA violations, negligence, and unjust enrichment, with an opportunity for plaintiffs to amend their complaints.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether OpenAI engaged in copyright infringement and other unfair business practices by using copyrighted materials to train its AI language models without authorization from the copyright holders.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court allowed the direct copyright infringement claim to proceed and found that the allegations might support a claim under the \"unfair\" prong of California's Unfair Competition Law (UCL). However, it dismissed the claims of vicarious copyright infringement, DMCA violations, negligence, and unjust enrichment, granting leave for plaintiffs to amend and provide additional supporting details.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine you wrote a book, and then someone built a smart robot that learns from lots of books, including yours, without asking you. You sue them for using your work. The judge says you might have a point about them using your book without permission, but other complaints you made—like them being careless or breaking a special digital rule—need more proof or fixing before they can be considered. The judge tells you to try again with clearer explanations.",

BACKGROUND  \nBefore the Court are two nearly identical putative class complaints in Tremblay et al v. \nOpenAI, Inc. et al , 23-cv-3223 and Silverman et al v. OpenAI, Inc. et al , 23-cv-3416.  Plaintiffs are \nauthors of books who allege that their boo ks were used to train OpenAI language models that \noperate the artificial intelligence (“AI”) software ChatGPT.1  Silverman Compl. ¶¶ 1 -4; Tremblay \nCompl. ¶¶  1-4.  Plaintiffs Paul Tremblay, Sarah Silverman, Christopher Golden, and Richard \nKadrey  (collectively, “Plaintiffs”) hold registered copyrights in their books.  Tremblay Compl. ¶¶ \n \n1 For the purposes of th e motion to dismiss  at bar , the Court accepts all factual allegations in the \nComplaint as true and construes the pleadings in the light most favorable to the Plaintiffs.  \nManzarek v. St. Paul Fire & Marine Ins. Co. , 519 F.3d 1025, 1031 (9th Cir. 2008).  \n Case 3:23-cv-03223-AMO     Document 104     Filed 02/12/24     Page 1 of 13 \n2 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  10, 12, Ex.

Tremblay Compl. ¶ 23.  These language models are “trained” by inputting large \namounts of texts known as the “training dataset.”  Id.  The language m odels copy  text from the \ntraining dataset and extract “expressive information.”  Id.  ChatGPT is an OpenAI language model \nthat allows paying  users to enter text prompts to which ChatGPT will respond and “simulate \nhuman reasoning,” including answering quest ions or summarizing books.  Id.  ¶¶ 22, 36 -38.  \nChatGPT generates its output based on “patterns and connections” from the training data.  Id. ¶ 39.  \nOpenAI copied Plaintiffs’ copyrighted books and used them in its training dataset.  Id. ¶ \n24.  When prompted  to summarize books written by each of the Plaintiffs, ChatGPT generated \naccurate summaries of the books’ content and themes.  Id. ¶ 41 (citing Ex.

Plaintiffs assert six causes of action against \nvarious OpenAI entities: (1) direct copyright infr ingement (Count I); (2) vicarious infringement \n(Count II); (3) violation of  Section 1202(b) of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“DMCA”) \n(Count III); (4) unfair  competition under Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code Section 17200 (Count IV); (5) \nnegligence (Count V); and (6) unjust enrichment (Count VI).  \n OpenAI filed the instant motions to dismiss on August 28, 2023, seeking dismissal of \nCounts II through VI.  ECF 33 (“Motion”).4 \n \n2 Plaintiff Mona Awad volunt arily dismissed her claims without prejudice.  ECF 29.  \n \n3 Defendants are seven entities that Plaintiffs collectively refer to as “OpenAI.”  ECF 33 \n(“Motion ”) at 14 (citing Tremblay Compl. ¶¶ 13 -19; Silverman Compl . ¶¶ 14 -20).  The Court \nfollows this naming convention.  \n \n4 Defendants’ motion to dismiss addresses both the Silverman and the Tremblay complaints and \nwas filed concurrently on both dockets.  Motion at 1 n1.  \n Case 3:23-cv-03223-AMO     Document 104     Filed 02/12/24     Page 2 of 13 \n3 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  II. LEGAL STANDARD  \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a) requires that a complaint  contain “a short and plain \nstatement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.”  A defendant may move to \ndismiss a complaint for failing to state a claim upon which relief can be granted under Federal \nRule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6).  “Dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) is appropriate only where the \ncomplaint lacks a cognizable legal theory or sufficient facts to support a cognizable legal theory.”  \nMendiondo v. Centinela Hosp. Med. Ctr. , 521 F.3d 1097, 1104 (9th Cir. 2008).  To survive a Ru le \n12(b)(6) motion, a plaintiff must plead “enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on \nits face.”  Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly , 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007).  A claim is facially plausible \nwhen a plaintiff pleads “factual content that allows t he court to draw the reasonable inference that \nthe defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.”  Ashcroft v. Iqbal , 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009).  \nIn reviewing the plausibility of a complaint, courts “accept factual allegations in the \ncomplaint as true and construe the pleadings in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.” \nManzarek , 519 F.3d at 1031.  Nonetheless, courts do not “accept as true allegations that are merely \nconclusory, unwarranted deductions of fact, or unreasonable inferences.”  In re Gilead Scis. Secs. \nLitig. , 536 F.3d 1049, 1055 (9th Cir. 2008)  (citation omitted) . \nIII. ANALYSIS  \nDefendants seek dismissal of all causes of action except for the claim for  direct copyright \ninfringement.  Motion at 18.  Defendants seek dismissal of Count II for vicarious copyright \ninfringement; Count III for violation of Section 1202(b) of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act \n(“DMCA); Count IV for Unfair Competition under Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code § 17200; Count V for \nnegligence; and Count VI for unjust enrichment.  Id.  The Court addresses each in turn.  \nA. Vicarious Copyright Infringement (Count I I) \nThe Copyright Act grants the copyright holder exclusive rights to (1) “reproduce the \ncopyrighted work in  copies,” (2) “prepare derivate works,” and (3) “distribute copies .  . . of the \ncopyrighted work to the public. ”  17 U.S.C. § 106(1) -(3).  Copyright protection does not extend to \n“every idea, theory, and fact” underlying a copyrighted work.  Eldred v. Ashcroft , 537 U.S. 186, \n219 (2003); see 17 U.S.C. § 102(b).  Indeed, “[t]he mere fact that a work is copyrighted does not Case 3:23-cv-03223-AMO     Document 104     Filed 02/12/24     Page 3 of 13 \n4 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  mean that every element of the work may be protected.”  Corbello v. Valli , 974 F.3d 965, 973 (9th \nCir. 2020) (citation omitted).  \nCopyright infringement requires that a plaintiff show (1) “he owns as valid copyright” and \n(2) the defendant “copied aspects of his work.”  Corbello , 974 F.3d at 973.  The second prong \n“contains two separate components: ‘copying’ and ‘unlawful appropriatio n.’”  Id. at 974.  \n“Copying can be demonstrated either through direct evidence or by showing that the defendant \nhad access to the plaintiff’s work and that the two works share similarities probative of copying, \nwhile the hallmark of ‘unlawful appropriation ’ is that the works share substantial similarities.”  Id. \n(citations and internal quotations omitted); see Skidmore as Tr. for Randy Craig Wolfe Tr. v. Led \nZeppelin , 952 F.3d 1051, 1064 (9th Cir. 2020) (“the hallmark of ‘unlawful appropriation’ is that \nthe works share substantial  similarities”)  (emphasis in original) . \nA claim of vicarious infringement requires  a threshold showing of direct infringement , \nPerfect 10, Inc. v. Amazon.com, Inc. , 508 F.3d 1146, 1169 (9th Cir. 2007) (“ Amazon.com ”); see \nA&M Recs., Inc. v. Napster, Inc. , 239 F.3d 1004, 1013 n.2 (9th Cir. 2001) aff’d, 284 F.3d 1091 \n(2002) (“Secondary liability for copyright infringement does not exist in the absence of direct \ninfringement by a third party”).   A plaintiff must then show  that “the defen dant has (1) the right \nand ability to supervise the infringing conduct and (2) a direct financial interest in the infringing \nactivity.”  Perfect 10, Inc. v. Giganews, Inc. , 847 F.3d 657, 673 (9th Cir. 2017) (“ Giganews ”) \n(citation omitted).    \nDefendants arg ue that the vicarious infringement claim fails for three reasons: (1) Plaintiffs \nhave not alleged that direct infringement occurred; (2) Plaintiffs have not alleged that Defendants \nhad the  “right and ability to supervise”; and (3) Plaintiffs have not alleg ed “direct financial \ninterest.”  Motion at 19 -21.  The Court first considers  whether Plaintiffs have adequately alleged \ndirect infringement  and, ultimately, does not reach Defendants’ latter two arguments . \nPlaintiffs suggest  that they do not need to allege a “substantial similarity” because they \nhave evidence of “direct copying .”  ECF 48 (“Response”) at 15.   They  argue that because \nDefendants directly copied the copyrighted books to train the language models, Plaintiffs need not \nshow substantial similarity.  Id. at 15 (citing Range Rd.

Plaintiff s misunderstand Range Rd.   There, the court did not need to find \nsubstantial similarity  because the infringement  was the public performance of copyrighted songs at \na bar.   Range Rd. , 668 F.3d at 1151 -52, 1154 .  Since the  plaintiffs provided unrebutted evidence \nthat the performed songs were the protected songs , they did not need to show that they were \nsubstantially similar.  Id. at 1154.   Distinctly, Plaintiffs  here have not alleged  that the ChatGPT \noutputs contain direct copies of the copyrighted books.  Because they fail to allege direct copying , \nthey must show a substantial similarity between the outputs and the copyrighted materials.  See \nSkidmore , 952 F.3d at 1064; Corbel lo, 974 F.3d at 973 -74. \nPlaintiff s’ allegation that “every output  of the OpenAI Language Model s is an infringing \nderivative work ” is insufficient.  Tremblay Compl. ¶ 59; Silverman Compl. ¶ 60 .  Plaintiffs fail to \nexplain what the outputs entail or allege t hat any particular output is substantially similar  – or \nsimilar at all – to their books.  Accordingly, the Court dismisses th e vicarious copyright \ninfringement claim with leave to amend.  \nB. Section 1202(b) of the DMCA (Count III)  \nIn addition to protecting aga inst vicarious and direct infringement, “[c]opyright law \nrestricts the removal or alteration of copyright management information ( ‘CMI ’) – information \nsuch as the title, the author, the copyright owner, the terms and conditions for use of the work, and \nother identifying information set forth in a copyright notice or conveyed in connection with the \nwork.”  Stevens v. Corelogic, Inc. , 899 F.3d 666, 671 (9th Cir. 2018).  Section 1202(b) of the \nDigital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) provides that one cannot, w ithout authority, (1) \n“intentionally remove or alter any” CMI, (2) “distribute . . . [CMI] knowing that the [CMI] has \nbeen removed or altered,” or (3) “distribute . . . copies of works . . . knowing that [CMI] has been \nremoved or altered .”  17 U.S.C. § 120 2(b).  To state a Section 1202 claim for removal or alteration \nof CMI, plaintiffs must first identify “what the removed or altered CMI was.”  Free Speech Sys., \nLLC v. Menzel , 390 F. Supp. 3d 1162, 1175 (N.D. Cal. 2019).  Plaintiffs must also show the \nrequi site mental state , as each of the three forms of Section 1202(b) violations  requires “knowing, Case 3:23-cv-03223-AMO     Document 104     Filed 02/12/24     Page 5 of 13 \n6 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  or . . . having reasonable grounds to know, that [intentionally removing CMI]  will induce, enable, \nfacilitate, or conceal” infringement.  17 U.S.C. § 1202(b).  \nOpenAI argues that the Section 1202(b)(1) claim fails because Plaintiffs do not plausibly \nallege that OpenAI intentionally removed CMI during the training process  or intended  to conceal \nor induce infringement, and the Section 1202(b)(3) claim fails because  Plaintiffs do not allege that \nDefendant distributed the copyrighted works or copies.  Motion at 21-22.  The Court begins  by \nanalyzing the 1202(b)(1) claim.  \n1. Section 1202(b)(1) – Intentionally Remove or Alter  CMI  \nSection 1202(b) requires knowledge or “reaso nable grounds to know” that the  CMI  \nremoval would “induce, enable, facilitate, or conceal an infringement.”  In the Ninth Circuit, a \nplaintiff “must make an affirmative showing, such as by demonstrating a past ‘pattern of conduct’ \nor ‘modus operandi,’ that  the defendant was aware or had reasonable grounds to be aware of the \nprobable future impact of its actions.”  Stevens , 899 F.3d at 674.  At the pleading stage, this \nrequires pleading facts “plausibly showing that the alleged infringer had this required me ntal \nstate.”  Andersen v. Stability AI Ltd. , No. 23 -CV-00201 -WHO, 2023 WL 7132064, at *10 (N.D. \nCal. Oct. 30, 2023); see Philpot v. Alternet Media, Inc. , No. 18 -CV-04479 -TSH, 2018 WL \n6267876, at *5 (N.D. Cal. Nov. 30, 2018) (dismissing DMCA claim where pla intiff “fail[ed] to \nplead any facts showing that [defendant] had the required mental state”).  \nPlaintiffs allege that “ [b]y design,” Defendants remove CMI from the  copyrighted  books \nused during the training process.  Tremblay Compl. ¶ 64; Silverman Compl. ¶  65.  However, \nPlaintiffs provide no facts supporting this assertion.  Indeed, the Complaints include excerpts of \nChatGPT outputs that include multiple references to Plaintiffs’ names, suggesting that OpenAI did \nnot remove all references to “the name of th e author.”  See, e.g. , Tremblay Compl. Ex. B at 3 \n(“Throughout these chapters, Tremblay masterfully maintains the suspense and psychological \nterror”); Silverman Compl. Ex B. at 1  (“Silverman uses her sharp wit to lend a comedic touch”) .  \nMoreover, there ar e no facts to support the assertion that “ [b]y design, the training process does \nnot preserve any CMI.”  Tremblay Compl. ¶ 64.  In Doe 1 v. GitHub, Inc. , No. 22 -CV-06823 -JST, \n2023 WL 3449131, at *11 (N.D. Cal. May 11, 2023) , plaintiffs alleged where the CMI typically Case 3:23-cv-03223-AMO     Document 104     Filed 02/12/24     Page 6 of 13 \n7 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  appeared, that defendants were aware that the CMI appeared repeatedly, and that defendants \nsubsequently “trained these programs to ignore or remove CMI and therefore stop producing it.”   \nThat was sufficient to s upport a “reasonable inference that Defendants intentionally designed the \nprograms to remove CMI . . .”  Id.  By contrast , Plaintiffs here only make conclusory allegations \nthat “[b]y design, the training process does not preserve any CMI.”  Tremblay Compl.  ¶ 64.  \nEven if Plaintiffs provided facts showing Defendants’ knowing removal of CMI from the \nbooks during the training process, Plaintiffs have not shown how omitting CMI in the copies used \nin the training set gave Defendants reasonable grounds to know tha t ChatGPT’s output would \ninduce, enable, facilitate, or conceal infringement.   See Stevens , 899 F.3d  at 673 (finding that \nallegations  that “someone might be able to use [the copyrighted work] undetected  . . . simply \nidentifies a general possibility that ex ists whenever CMI is removed ,” and fails to show the \nnecessary mental state ).  Plaintiffs argue that OpenAI’s failure to state which internet books it uses \nto train ChatGPT shows that it knowingly enabled infringement, because ChatGPT users will not \nknow i f any output is infringing.  Response at 21 -22.  However, Plaintiffs do not point to any \ncaselaw to suggest that failure to reveal such information has any bearing on whether the alleged \nremoval of CMI in an internal database will knowingly enable infringe ment.   Plaintiffs have failed \nto state a claim under Section 12(b)(1).  \n2. Section 1202(b)(3) – Distribute Works or Copies  \nPlaintiffs also allege that Defendants violated Section 1202(b)(3) because OpenAI created \nderivative works - ChatGPT outputs  - and distri buted th ose outputs  without the CMI included.  \nTremblay Compl. ¶ 65; Silverman Compl. ¶ 66.  The DMCA “does not prohibit merely omitting \nCMI from an infringing work.”  Dolls Kill, Inc. v. Zoetop Bus. Co. , No. 222CV01463RGKMAA, \n2022 WL 16961477, at *3 (C.D. Cal. Aug. 25, 2022).  While it may be unlawful to recreate \nanother’s work (e.g., under the Copyright Act), this conduct does not necessarily implicate the \nDMCA.  See, e.g. , Kirk Kara Corp. v. W. Stone &  Metal Corp. , No. CV 20 -1931 -DMG (EX), \n2020 WL 5991503, at *6 (C.D. Cal. Aug. 14, 2020) (emphasis in original) (dismissing claim \nbecause “while the works may be substantially similar , Defendant did not make identical  copies \nof Plaintiff’s works and then re move the engraved CMI”).  Case 3:23-cv-03223-AMO     Document 104     Filed 02/12/24     Page 7 of 13 \n8 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  Under the plain language of the statute , liability requires distributing the original “works” \nor “copies of [the] works.”  17 U.S.C. § 1202(b)(3).  Plaintiffs have not alleged that Defendants \ndistributed their books or copies of their books.  Instead, they have  allege d that “every output from \nthe OpenAI La nguage Models is an infringing derivative work” without providing any indication \nas to what such outputs entail – i.e., whether they are the copyrighted books or copies of the \nbooks .  That is insufficient  to support this cause of action under the DMCA .   \nPlaintiffs compare their claim to that in Doe 1, however, the plaintiffs in Doe 1 alleged that \nthe defendants “distributed copies of [plaintiff’s licensed] code knowing that CMI had been \nremoved or altered.”  Doe 1 , 2023 WL 3449131, at *11 .  The Doe 1  plain tiffs alleged that \ndefendants knew that the programs “reproduced training data,” such as the licensed code, as \noutput.  Id.  Plaintiffs here have not alleged that ChatGPT reproduces Plaintiffs copyrighted works  \nwithout CMI .  \n Accordingly, the Court dismiss es the DMCA claims with leave to amend.  \nC. UCL (Count IV)  \nOpenAI also seeks to dismiss Plaintiffs’ UCL claims.  “A business act or practice may \nviolate the UCL if it is either ‘unlawful,’ ‘unfair,’ or ‘fraudulent.’  Each of these three adjectives \ncaptures ‘a separate and distinct theory of liability.’”  Rubio v. Cap. One Bank , 613 F.3d 1195, \n1203 (9th Cir. 2010) (ci ting Kearns v. Ford Motor Co. , 567 F.3d 1120, 1127 (9th Cir. 2009)).  \n“The UCL’s coverage is sweeping, and its standard for wrongful business conduct intentionally \nbroad.”  Moore v. Apple, Inc. , 73 F. Supp. 3d 1191, 1204 (N.D. Cal. 2014).  Plaintiffs advan ce \nUCL claims under each prong , and the Court considers each in turn . \n1. Unlawful  \n Plaintiffs allege that Defendants engaged in “unlawful business practices” by violating the \nDMCA.  Tremblay Compl. ¶¶ 69 -70; Silverman Compl. ¶ 70 -71.  As the Court has dismiss ed the \npredicate DMCA claims, the derivate UCL claims cannot remain .  See Eidmann v. Walgreen Co. , \n522 F. Supp. 3d 634, 647 (N.D. Cal. 2021) (“If the ‘plaintiff cannot state a claim under the \npredicate law . . . [the UCL] claim also fails.’”) (alterations in original) (quoting Hadley v. Kellogg \nSales Co. , 243 F. Supp. 3d 1074, 1094 (N.D. Cal. 2017)); see Armstrong -Harris v. Wells Fargo Case 3:23-cv-03223-AMO     Document 104     Filed 02/12/24     Page 8 of 13 \n9 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  Bank, N.A. , No. 21 -CV-07637 -HSG, 2022 WL 3348426, at *3 (N.D. Cal. Aug. 12, 2022)  (citing \ncases ).   \nEven if Plaintiffs can bring claims under the DMCA, they must show economic injury \ncaused by the unfair business practice.  See Davis v. RiverSource Life Ins. Co. , 240 F. Supp. 3d \n1011, 1017 (N.D. Cal. 2017) (quoting Kwikset Corp. v. Superior Ct. , 51 Cal. 4th 310, 322 (2011)).  \nDefendants argue that Plaintiffs have not alleged that they have “lost money or property.”  Motion \nat 29 -30; see Kwikset Corp. , 51 Cal. 4th at 322-23.  Plaintiffs counter  that they have lost \nintellectual property in connection with the DMCA claims because of the “risk of future damage \nto intellectual property that results the moment a defendant removes CMI from digital copies of \nPlaintiffs’ work  – copies that can be reproduced and distributed online at near zero marginal cost.”  \nResponse at 28.  However, no where in Plaintiffs’ complaint do they allege that Defendants \nreproduced and distributed copies of their books.   Accordingly, any injury is speculative , and the \nunlawful prong of the UCL claim fails for this additional reason . \n2. Fraudulent  \n Plaintiffs also argue that they pleaded UCL violations based on “fraudulent” conduct .  \nResponse at 26 -27.  They point to a paragraph  in the complaint  that states that “consumers are \nlikely to be deceived” by Defendants’ unlawful practices and that Defendan ts “deceptively \ndesigned ChatGPT to output without any CMI.”  Tremblay Compl. ¶ 72.  The allegation’s \nreferences to CMI demonstrates that Plaintiffs ’ claims rest on a violation of the DMC A, and thus \nfail as the Court has dismissed the underlying DMCA claim .  Supra Sections B, C(1).  To the \nextent that Plaintiffs ground their claim in fraudulent  business practices, Plaintiffs fail to indicate \nwhere they have pleaded allegations of fraud.  Thus, they fail to satisfy the heightened pleading \nrequirements of Rul e 9(b)  which apply to  UCL fraud claims.  See Armstrong -Harris , 2022 WL \n3348246, at *2.  Therefore, the UCL claim based on fraudulent conduct also fails.  \n3. Unfair  \n Under  the unfair prong  of the UCL , Plaintiffs allege  that Defendants used Plaintiffs’ \ncopyright ed works to train ChatGPT without Plaintiffs’ authorization.  Tremblay Compl. ¶ 71; \nSilverman Compl. ¶  72.  California courts have defined “unfair” broadly .  For example, the Case 3:23-cv-03223-AMO     Document 104     Filed 02/12/24     Page 9 of 13 \n10 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  California Court of Appeal stated,  “California’s unfair competition law prohibits  not only \nunlawful business practices but also unfair business practices.  The statute is intentionally broad to \ngive the court maximum discretion to control whatever new schemes may be contrived, even \nthough they are not yet forbidden by law.”   People ex rel. Renne v. Servantes , 86 Cal.App.4th \n1081, 1095 (2001).  The Court of Appeal explained further , “[o]ne test for determining an ‘unfair’ \npractice is [whether] the gravity of the harm to the victim outweighs the utility of the defendant ’s \nconduct.”  Id. at 1095 .5  \n Assuming the truth of Plaintiffs’ allegations  - that Defendants used Plaintiffs’ copyrighted \nworks to train their language models for commercial profit  - the Court concludes that Defendants’ \nconduct may constitute  an unfair pr actice.6  Therefore, this portion of the UCL claim may proceed.  \nD. Negligence (Count V)  \nNegligence claims require that a plaintiff establish (1) duty; (2) breach; (3) causation; and \n(4) damages.  Corales v. Bennett , 567 F.3d 554, 572 (9th Cir. 2009 ) (citatio n omitted) .  There is a \n“general duty of care on a defendant . . . who has created a risk of harm to the plaintiff.”  Brown v. \nUSA Taekwondo , 11 Cal. 5th 204, 21 4 (2021), reh’g denied  (May 12, 2021) (citations omitted).  \nHowever, “not every defendant owes every plaintiff a duty of care.”  Id. at 213.  \nPlaintiffs allege that Defendants owed them a duty of care based on the control of Plaintiffs \ninformation in their possession and breached their duty by “negligently, carelessly, and recklessly \ncollecting, main taining, and controlling systems  – including ChatGPT  – which are trained on \nPlaintiffs’ [copyrighted] works.”  Tremblay Compl. ¶ ¶ 74-75; Silverman Compl. ¶ ¶ 75-76.  \nDefendants seek to dismiss the negligence claim, arguing that 1) Plaintiffs have not establ ished \n \n5 Defendants allege that the “unfair” prong requires alleging that the conduct “threatens an \nincipient vio lation of an antitrust law.”  ECF 54 (“Reply”)  at 18 (quoting Cel–Tech Commc'ns, \nInc. v. L.A. Cellular Tel. Co. , 20 Cal.4th 163 , 164  (1999)).  However, that is the definition for \nunfair acts “among competitors.”  Sybersound Recs., Inc. v. UAV Corp. , 517 F. 3d 1137, 1152 (9th \nCir. 2008) (quoting id.).  As that is not the basis of the allegations here, the definition does not \napply.  \n \n6 As OpenAI  does not raise p reemption, the Court does not consider it.  However, the Court notes \nthe possibility that to the ext ent the UCL claim alleges the same violations as the copyright claim, \nit may be preempted by the Copyright Act.   \n Case 3:23-cv-03223-AMO     Document 104     Filed 02/12/24     Page 10 of 13 \n11 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  that OpenAI owes them a duty and 2) the Complaints only challenge intentional acts.   Motion at \n30-31. \nThe Complaints allege that Defendants negligently maintained and controlled information \nin their possession.  Tremblay Compl. ¶ ¶ 74-75; Silverman Compl. ¶ ¶ 75-76.  Plaintiffs argue \nwithout legal support that Defendants owed a duty to safeguard Plaintiffs’ works.  Response at 30.  \nPlaintiffs do not identify what duty exists to “maintain[] and control[]” the public  information \ncontained in Plaintiffs’ copyrighted books.   The negligence claim fails on this basis.  \nPlaintiffs’ argument that there is a “special relationship” between the parties also fails.  See \nResponse at 30.  Nowhere in the Complaint s do Plaintiffs allege that there is any fiduciary or \ncustodial relationship between the parties.  Plaintiffs do not explain how merely possessing their \nbooks creates a special relationship, citing only to an inapposite case where defendants were \ncustodians of plaintiffs’ “personal and confidenti al information.”  Witriol v. LexisNexis Grp. , No. \nC05-02392 MJJ, 2006 WL 4725713, at *8 (N.D. Cal. Feb. 10, 2006).7 \n As Plaintiffs have not alleged that Defendants owed them a legal duty, the Court dismisses \nthis claim with leave to amend.  \nE. Unjust Enrichment (Count VI)  \nIn the sixth cause of action, Plaintiffs bring an unjust enrichment claim for OpenAI’s use \nof the copyri ghted books to train ChatGPT.  Tremblay Compl. ¶¶ 79 -86; Silverman Compl. ¶¶ 80 -\n87.  The Ninth Circuit allows  an unjust enrichment claim as either an independent cause of action \nor as  a “quasi -contract claim for restitution.”  ESG Cap. Partners, LP v. Stra tos, 828 F.3d 1023, \n1038 (9th Cir. 2016).   “To allege unjust enrichment as an independent cause of action, a plaintiff \n \n7 Defendants do not raise the economic loss doctrine, but it may also preclude recovery.  See N. \nAm. Chem. Co. v. Superior Ct. , 59 Cal.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: The court case involves UAB Planner 5D accusing Facebook, Inc., Princeton University, and others of copyright infringement and trade secret misappropriation. The plaintiff claims that defendants used automated \"scraping\" to illegally download its proprietary 3D design data, which is crucial for AI-driven scene recognition technology. The court granted the motion to dismiss due to insufficient claims but allowed Planner 5D to amend its complaint.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether Planner 5D sufficiently stated claims for copyright infringement and trade secret misappropriation under U.S. law.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court found that Planner 5D did not sufficiently allege its copyright claims as it failed to demonstrate registration compliance, originality, and specific misuse. It also failed to adequately allege reasonable measures taken to maintain the secrecy of its trade secrets and improper acquisition by defendants. The dismissal was granted but with leave to amend.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine you created a special tool online, and a company took parts of it without asking to build their robot's brain.

Nos. 31, 33  \n \n \nINTRODUCTION  \nUAB Planner 5D (“Planner 5D”) brings copyright infringement and trade secret \nmisappropriations claims against Facebook, Inc., Facebook Technologies, LLC (collectively \n“Facebook”), and The Trustees of Princeton University (“Princeton”).  Complaint (“Compl.” ) \n[Dkt. No. 1].  Planner 5D operates a home design website that allows users to create virtual \ninterior design scenes using a library of virtual objects (such as tables, chairs, and sofas) to \npopulate the scenes.  It claims that it owns copyright s in these  three -dimensional objects and \nscenes, and in the compilation of objects and scenes, as well as trade secret s in the underlying data \nfiles of these objects and scenes.    \nPrinceton and Facebook move to dismiss for failure to state a claim, and I will GRANT \ntheir motions.  Planner 5D  does not sufficiently allege a copyright infringement claim because  it \ndoes not allege : (i) that it has met  the threshold registration requirement of  17 U.S.C. §  411(a) or \nthat it is  exempt from that requirement as a non -United States work ; (ii) the originality or \ncreativity of the objects, scenes, and compilations of objects and scenes ; and (iii) that \ncopyrightable elements were copied .  Planner 5D also fails to sufficiently allege a  trade secret \nmisappropriation claim because  it does not explain : (i) how the structure of its website and the Case 3:19-cv-03132-WHO     Document 52     Filed 11/21/19     Page 1 of 19 \n2 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  Terms of Services maintained secrecy of the underlying data files of the objects and scenes; and \n(ii) what improper means Princeton and Facebook took to obtain these files.  Planner 5D may have \nleave to amend  to address these deficiencies .  \nBACKGROUND  \nI. FACTUAL BACKGROUND  \nA. Planner 5D’s Home Design Website  \nIn 2011, Planner 5D created a website that it describes as a “user -friendly home design tool \nthat allowed anyone to quickly and easily create their own home, office or landscape designs.”  \nCompl. ¶ 27.  Planner 5D offers its users access to a digital libra ry of thousands of household \nobjects, including “structural features,” “furniture,” “bathroom appurtenances,” “electrical \nappliances,” and “exterior features.”  Id.  Users can create unique designs by “simply dragging any \nof these objects onto or around a chosen floor plan.”  Id.  Once added to a design, these objects \ncan be “easily moved, rotated, tilted, re -sized, or otherwise manipulated to create the desired \ndesign.”  Id.  Users can also “easily toggle between two - and three -dimensional renderings of th e \ndesign,” and can rotate and ti lt three -dimensional renderings “to any desired perspective.”  Id.  \nPlanner 5D claims that it currently has over 40 million users worldwide  and that it owns “a \ncollection of over a million hand -crafted, digitized, and realis tic three -dimensional objects and \nscenes, depicting a wide variety of household and office designs.”  Id. ¶¶ 5, 28. \n1. Alleged Copyright in Objects and Compilation of Objects  \nPlanner 5D alleges that it created the “library of realistic, digitized objects over  a span of \nmore than seven years, at the cost of millions of dollars.”  Compl. ¶ 29.  The library consists of \nover 4,500 objects.  Id.  Planner 5D contends that it holds copyright in “[e]ach object  individually,  \nand the compilation  of object s together,” as well as in “the data files underlying each object, and \nin the compilation of individual data files.”  Id.  All of these works were allegedly “authored in \nEurope or Russia,” and “neither Planner 5D no r any individual object modelers are nati onals, \ndomiciliaries, or habitual residents of the U.S., or legal entities with headquarters in the U.S.”  Id. \n2. Alleged Copyright in Scenes and Compilation of Scenes  \nPlanner 5D also alleges that it owns copyright in the “compilation  of design scenes made Case 3:19-cv-03132-WHO     Document 52     Filed 11/21/19     Page 2 of 19 \n3 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  from arrangements of these individual objects. ”  Compl. ¶ 30.  These “scenes” consist of “floor \nplans created within the Planner 5D application using Planner 5D’s objects.”  Id.  Planner 5D \ncontends that each scene in its collection “was individually created  by a human designer,” and the \ncompilation of scenes now includes over 1,000,000 scenes.  Id.  All of these works were allegedly \n“authored in Europe by Planner 5D,” which is a “Lithuanian corporation not headquartered in the \nU.S.”  Id.  \n3. Alleged Trade Secre t in Underlying Data Files  \nIn addition to the copyrights Planner 5D claims it owns in the objects and scenes, it also \nclaims that the  vast collection of underl ying data files of these objects and scenes are confidential \nand proprietary trade secrets of the  company.  Compl. ¶ 33.  These trade secrets and Planner 5D’s \ncopyrights “are the company’s core assets.”  Id.  \n4. Access to Planner 5D’s Objects and Scenes  \nPlanner 5D claims that third parties can only access its objects and scenes “using Planner \n5D’s propr ietary software” by navigating to the company’s website, found at \nhttps://planner5d.com/ .  Compl. ¶ 31.1  It contends  in Paragraph 32 of the Complaint  that its \n“terms of services and the structures of [its] website pr ohibit users from directly accessing, \ndownloading, or otherwise using the data files defining Planner 5D’s objects and scenes.”  Id. ¶ \n32.  It further asserts that users “may never . . . access, use, or download the underlying data files,” \nand may never “m ake their own copies of the three -dimensional renderings of these files, [and] not \nuse the renderings other than while on Planner 5D’s website designing floor plans.”  Id.  \nParagraph 32 is the only paragraph in the Complaint that mentions the “structure” o f Planner 5D ’s \nwebsite.  The Complaint  does not allege  how the “structure” of its website prevents users from \n                                                 \n1 Planner 5D’s request for judicial notice of its website homepage as saved on September 13, 2019 \nfrom the URL https://planner5d.com/  is granted.  See Planner 5D Request for Judicial Notice, Ex. \n1 [Dkt. No. 39 -2].  Under the “incorporation by reference” doctrine, a court may “consider \nmaterials incorporated into the complaint or matters of public record,” including “documents in \nsituations where the complaint necessarily relies upon a document or the contents of the doc ument \nare alleged in a complaint, the document ’s authenticity is not in question and there are no disputed \nissues as to the document ’s relevance.”   Coto Settlement v. Eisenberg , 593 F.3d 1031, 1038 (9th \nCir. 2010).  Because Planner 5D  repeatedly refers to its website  and includes its web address in the \nComplaint, the website is incorporated by reference.   Case 3:19-cv-03132-WHO     Document 52     Filed 11/21/19     Page 3 of 19 \n4 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  accessing its objects and scenes  and/or its underlying data files . \nPlanner 5D’s Terms of Service prohibit use of any “‘page -scrape,’ ‘robot,’ ‘spi der[,]’ or \nother automatic device, program, algorithm or methodology which perform[s] similar functions[,] \nto access, acquire, copy, or monitor any portion of the Planner 5D project.”  Compl. ¶ 45.  The \nTerms also prohibit “download[ing] (other than page c aching) any portion of the Planner 5D \nproject, the Materials or any information contained therein or use [of] the Planner 5D project or \nthe Materials other than for their intended purposes.”  Id.2  \n5. Planner 5D Evolves Into Artificial Intelligence and Scene Recognition  \nPlanner 5D alleges that since its founding in 2011, the company’s core business objective \nevolved from providing home design tools “to becoming the leader and innovator in computer \nscene recognition.”  Compl. ¶ 34.  Scene -recognition technology is the abil ity of machines to \nrecognize three -dimensional scenes.  Id. ¶ 1.  It has  been estimated that the computer vision  \nmarket will reach $48 billion by 2023, and $60 billion by 2025.  Id.   \nThere is a major roadblock in developing this technology – finding enoug h data.  Id. ¶¶ 2, \n37.  Teaching machines to recognize three -dimensional settings requires “feeding them large \nvolumes of realistic, digitized renderings of such places —digitalized doors, walls, furniture, and \nthe like, arranged into plausible interiors an d rendered in three dimensions.”  Id.  Planner 5D \nclaims that creating lifelike digital scenes is “extremely time - and labor -intensive,” and that to \ncreate truly “realistic” scenes, “human designers must arrange the objects in real -life \nconfigurations .”  Id.  “Large collections of these kinds of three -dimensional settings are thus \nexceedingly rare.”  Id.   \nPlanner 5D cites a presentation by a senior Princeton computer scientist who stated  that \n“data” is the main roadblock for 3D scene understanding and rese arch.  Id. ¶ 4.  Accordingly, \n                                                 \n2 Princeton’s request of judicial notice of the Terms of Service is granted.  See Princeton Request \nfor Judicial Notice, Ex. 1 [Dkt.  No. 32 -1].  Planner 5D quotes from the Terms of Service \nthroughout its Complaint, and the court may therefore take judicial notice of the entire document.  \nSee Salinas Valley Mem’l Healthcare Sys. v. Monterey Peninsula Horticulture, Inc. , No. 17 -cv-\n7076 -LHK, 2019 WL 2569545, at *4 (N.D. Cal. June 21, 2019) (taking judicial notice of contract \nreferenced in complaint).  \n Case 3:19-cv-03132-WHO     Document 52     Filed 11/21/19     Page 4 of 19 \n5 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  Planner 5D argues that its vast collection of objects and scenes, estimated at over a million, have \nbecome more valuable over time as “no other collection in the world numbers even in the tens of \nthousands.”  Id. ¶ 5.  It main tains that over the past several years it has “invested significantly in \ndeveloping algorithms that capitalize on [its] catalog of three -dimensional files to achieve market -\nleading 3D recognition.”  Id. ¶ 35.   \nB. Princeton Downloads Planner 5D’s Data to Crea te the SUNCG Dataset  \nPlanner 5D alleges that computer scientists at Princeton “were eager to use this uniquely \nlarge, uniquely realistic collection of data,” and “decided to download the entirety of Planner 5D’s \ndata collection.”  Compl. ¶ 6.  It claims  that its data is especially desirable given that its objects \nand scenes are designed by humans, mak ing it more likely to be “realistic,” a feature vital for \naccurate scene -recognition technology.  Id. ¶ 39.  \nThe method by which Princeton allegedly downloaded Planner 5D’s data is contested . \nPlanner 5D claims that Princeton “created compute r code that crawled through thousands or tens \nof thousands of pages within Planner 5D’s servers, progressively cataloging the locations of all \navailable objects and scenes.”  Id. ¶¶ 6, 43.  Through this method, which Planner 5D characterizes \nas “scrap[ing]” for data ,” Princeton was able to download over five gigabytes of data, including \n2,644  of Planner 5D’s objects  and 45, 622 of its scenes.  Id. ¶¶ 6, 7, 43.   Together, Planner 5D \nalleges that Princeton scraped each of the over 48,000 desired files from Planner 5D’s servers.  Id. \n¶ 43.  \n Planner 5D claims that Princeton then used this scraped data to bolster its scene -\nrecognition activities.  Compl. ¶ 7.  Princ eton researchers “did not disguise” that the data they used \nin research was derived from Planner 5D’s website.  Id.  (citing to a research article by Princeton \nthat states “We use a collection of 3D scene models downloaded from the Planner 5D website”).  \nNot only did Princeton use this data for their own research purposes, but Planner 5D also claims \nthat Princeton  posted the data to a publicly -accessible Princeton URL and labeled it the “SUNCG \ndataset.”  Id. ¶ 8.  It states  that more than 99.9% of the files in the  SUNCG dataset are identical \ncopies of files from Planner 5D’s collection, with only a few that have been slightly altered.  Id. ¶ \n44.  Some of the SUNCG dataset’s files “even continue to bear Planner 5D’s registered Case 3:19-cv-03132-WHO     Document 52     Filed 11/21/19     Page 5 of 19 \n6 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  trademark.”  Id.  Planner 5D claims tha t these actions by Princeton both violate its Terms of \nService and the “structure” of its website.   Id. ¶¶ 32, 45.   \nC. Facebook Uses the SUNCG Dataset for its SUMO Challenge and Other \nObject -Recognition Projects  \nPlanner 5D claims that Facebook was also inter ested in its objects and scenes collection \nthat would help it tap into the commercial potential of scene recognition technology.  Compl. ¶¶ 9, \n46.  Facebook launched an international scene -recognition competition, called the Scene \nUnderstanding and Modelli ng Challenge (“SUMO Challenge”), which encouraged entrants to \nsubmit scene -recognition papers and algorithms for the chance of winning cash prizes and \nspeaking at a “SUMO Challenge conference.”  Id. ¶¶ 10, 11, 47.  Planner 5D alleges that \nFacebook facilita ted contestants’ work by providing them with a copy of the SUNCG dataset, \nwhich it published on a URL belonging to Stanford University.  Id. ¶¶ 11, 51.  It claims that \nFacebook, aided by others including Stanford and Princeton, made its own copy of the Pri nceton \nSUNCG dataset.  Id. ¶ 51.  Planner 5D believes that “dozens of copies or more of this copy of the \nSUNCG dataset have been downloaded and used, by an unknown number of users.”  Id.  Current \nand former Stanford and Princeton researches have also serve d as SUMO Challenge organizers, \nadvisors, or program committee members.”  Id. ¶ 48.  Planner 5D further alleges that both \ndefendants are connected because “Facebook has supported Princeton and its researche rs \nfinancially.”  Id. ¶ 49.  It argues that Facebo ok’s activities “strike[] at the heart of Planner 5D’s \nbusiness objective,” given that Facebook has explicitly secured rights to commercialize the fruits \nof SUMO Challenge participants’ work.  Id. \nPlanner 5D also alleges that Facebook made at least one oth er copy of the SUNCG dataset \nfor Facebook’s “House 3D environment” project.  Id.  ¶ 53.  According to Facebook, House 3D “is \na rich environment containing thousands of human -designed 3D scenes of visually realistic houses \nwith fully labeled 3D objects, tex tures, and scene layouts.”  Id.  Planner 5D claims that Facebook \nobtained these objects and scenes by extracting them from the SUNCG dataset.  Id.  It argues that , \nlike Princeton, Facebook is also exploiting Planner 5D’s dataset “for the same purpos e Planner 5D \nhas set for itself: to train artificial intelligence applications to recognize 3D interior scenes.”  Id. ¶ Case 3:19-cv-03132-WHO     Document 52     Filed 11/21/19     Page 6 of 19 \n7 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  54.   \nPlanner 5D alleges that the  gigabytes of data Princeton, Facebook, and an unknown \nnumber of others have downloaded and used are its intellectual property .  Its data was allegedly \nscraped, copied, and used without its knowledge or permission.  “Defendants’ copying, use,  and \npublic disclosure and dissemination of Planner 5D’s core asset has caused catastrophic and \npotentially permanent damage to the company.”  Compl. ¶ 13.  \nII. PROCEDURAL HISTORY  \nOn March 14, 2019, Planner 5D wrote Facebook, Princeton, and others, demanding th at \nthey cease and desist infringement of Planner 5D’s copyrights.  Compl. ¶ 55; see also  Princeton \nRequest for Judicial Notice, Ex. 2 [Dkt. No. 32 -2] (copy of cease and desist letter sent to \nPrinceton).3  On June 5, 2019, Planner 5D filed this Complaint ag ainst Princeton, Facebook, and \nother unknown entities and persons, alleging claims for copyright infringement and trade secret \nmisappropriation.  See Compl.  Both Princeton and Facebook move to dismiss the Complaint \nunder 12(b)(6) grounds for fa ilure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.  See Princeton \nMotion to Dismiss (“Princeton Mot.”) [Dkt. No. 31]; Facebook Motion to Dismiss (“Facebook \nMot.”) [Dkt. No. 33].  I heard oral arguments on November 6, 2019.  \nLEGAL STANDARD  \nUnder Federa l Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), a district court must dismiss a complaint \nif it fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.  To survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to \ndismiss, the plaintiff must allege “enough facts to state a claim to relief t hat is plausible on its \nface.”  See Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly , 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007).  A claim is facially plausible \nwhen the plaintiff pleads facts that “allow the court to draw the reasonable inference that the \ndefendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.”  See Ashcroft v. Iqbal , 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009)  \n(citation omitted).  There must be “more than a sheer possibility that a defendant has acted \nunlawfully.”  Id.  While courts do not require “heightened fact pleading of specifics,” a plaintiff \n                                                 \n3 Princeton’s request of judicial notice of the cease and desist letter is granted.  Planner 5D \nexpressly references this letter in its Comp laint, rendering it judicially noticeable.  See Kao v. \nAbbott Laboratories Inc. , No. 17 -cv-2790 -JST, 2017 WL 5257041, at *3 (N.D. Cal. Nov. 13, \n2017) (taking judicial notice of party’s letter that was “explicitly referenced in the complaint”).  Case 3:19-cv-03132-WHO     Document 52     Filed 11/21/19     Page 7 of 19 \n8 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  must  allege facts sufficient to “raise a right to relief above the speculative level.”  See Twombly , \n550 U.S. at 555, 570.    \n In deciding whether the plaintiff has stated a claim upon which relief can be granted, the \ncourt accepts the plaintiff’s allegations a s true and draws all reasonable inferences in favor of the \nplaintiff.  See Usher v. City of Los Angeles , 828 F.2d 556, 561 (9th Cir. 1987).  However, the court \nis not required to accept as true “allegations that are merely conclusory, unwarranted deduction s of \nfact, or unreasonable inferences.”  See In re Gilead Scis. Sec. Litig. , 536 F.3d 1049, 1055 (9th Cir. \n2008).  \n If the court dismisses the complaint, it “should grant leave to amend even if no request to \namend the pleading was made, unless it determines  that the pleading could not possibly be cured \nby the allegation of other facts.”  See Lopez v. Smith , 203 F.3d 1122, 1127 (9th Cir. 2000).  In \nmaking this determination, the court should consider factors such as “the presence or absence of \nundue delay, ba d faith, dilatory motive, repeated failure to cure deficiencies by previous \namendments, undue prejudice to the opposing party and futility of the proposed amendment.”  See \nMoore v. Kayport Package Express , 885 F.2d 531, 538 (9th Cir. 1989).  \nDISCUSSION  \nI. COPYRIGHT CLAIM S \nTo state a claim for copyright infringement, a plaintiff  must plausibly allege two elements : \n(1) ownership of a valid copyright, and (2) copying of elements of the work that are original.  \nRentmeester v. Nike, Inc. , 883 F.3d 1111, 1116 – 17 (9th Cir. 2018) (citing Feist Publications, Inc. \nv. Rural Telephone Service Co. , 499 U.S. 340, 361  (1991) ).  As to first element, both Princeton \nand Facebook argue that Planner 5D has not plausibly alleged compliance with the thr eshold \nregistration requirement of 17 U.S.C. § 411(a), which acts a gatekeeper on copyrightable claims.  \nPrinceton Mot. 6; Facebook Mot. 8.  Facebook further argues that Planner 5D has failed to \nplausibly allege that its works are copyrightable because the y are not original and creative.  \nFacebook Mot. 12.  As to the second element, Facebook argues that the Complaint “lacks \nspecificity —both as to the scope of Planner 5D’s ownership and to Facebook’s alleged \ninfringement —[and therefore] fails to provide adeq uate notice to Facebook as to Planner 5D’s Case 3:19-cv-03132-WHO     Document 52     Filed 11/21/19     Page 8 of 19 \n9 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  claim and is grounds for dismissal .”  Facebook Mot. 12.  \nA. Threshold Requirement Under to Section 411(a)  \n1. Plaintiffs are Required to Allege Whether Works are Registered or Exempt \nfrom Registration Under Section 411(a)  \nThe first element of a copyright claim requires a plaintiff to plausibly allege  that it owns a \nvalid copyright registration for its work pursuant to 17 U.S.C. § 411(a).  Section 411(a) of the \nCopyright Act provide s that “no civil action for infringement o f the copyright in any United States \nwork shall be instituted until preregistration or registration of the copyright claim has been made” \nwith the Copyright Office.  17 U.S.C. § 411(a) ; see Unicolors, Inc. v. Urban Outfitters, Inc. , 853 \nF.3d 980, 988 (9th Cir. 2017) (“[Plaintiff] was required to show registration as an element of an \ninfringement claim.”); Fourth Estate Pub. Benefit Corp. v. Wall -Street.com, LLC , 139 S. Ct. 881, \n887 (2019) (“[A]lthough an owner’s rights exists apart from registration, regist ration is akin to an \nadministrative exhaustion requirement that the owner must satisfy before suing to enforce \nownership rights.”) (citations omitted).  The registration requirement applies only to “United \nStates work[s].”  17 U.S.C. § 411(a).   \nBoth Princ eton and Facebook argue that Planner 5D has failed to meet this threshold \nrequirement because the Complaint does not plausibly allege that any of Planner 5D’s works are \nregistered as “United States works” or exempted from registration as “non -United States  works.”  \nPrinceton Mot. 6; Facebook Mot. 8.  If Planner 5D’s alleged works are considered United States \nworks, then it automatically compels dismissal because a complaint cannot be filed before \nregistration.  Facebook Mot. 9.  If Planner 5D’s alleged work s are considered non -United States \nworks, then the Complaint insufficiently alleges that Planner 5D is  exempt from the registration \nrequirement.  Id.  \n Planner 5D contends that it is not required to plead Section 411(a) inapplicability because \nonly owners of United States works must register before suing for copyright infringement.  Oppo. \nFacebook. 5.  While it is true that the Section 411(a) registration requirement only applies  to \nUnited States works, a plaintiff must adequately allege that it s works are  not United States work s \nin order to be exempt from that requirement.  The “ omission  of allegations indicating that the work Case 3:19-cv-03132-WHO     Document 52     Filed 11/21/19     Page 9 of 19 \n10 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  is a United States work” is insufficient  because  otherwise , “any party seeking to surmount the \nregistration requirement could simply  omit any allegation of first publication.”  DigitAlb, Sh.a v. \nSetplex, LLC , 284 F. Supp. 3d 547 , 555  (S.D.N.Y. 2018)  (emphasis in original).   \nPlanner 5D is wrong to argue  that it is not required to plead Section 411(a) inapplicability.  \nIf a plaintiff be lieves that the registration requirement in Section 411(a) does not apply because its \nwork is not a United States work , the plaintiff  “must allege that the work [is] not [a] United States \nwork [] within the meaning of § 101.”  DigitAlb , 284 F. Supp. 3d at 555; see also  Epikhin v. Game \nInsight N. Am. , 145 F. Supp. 3d 896, 902 (N.D. Cal. 2015) (noting that  “[a]lthough the registration \nrequirement is not jurisdictional, it is a precondition to suit ”) (internal citation and quotation marks \nomitted) .   \n2. Definition of a “United States Work”  and “Publication”  \n The Copyright Act defines  a “United States work ” differently depending on whether the \nalleged work is a published work or an unpublished work.  A pu blished “United States work” is \ndefined as a work that is first published –  \n(A) in the United States;  \n(B) simultaneously in the United States and another treaty party. . .  \n(C) simultaneously in the United States and a foreign nation that is \nnot a treaty  party; or  \n(D) in a foreign nation that is not a treaty party, and all of the authors \nof the work are nationals, domiciliaries , or habitual residents of, or in \nthe case of audiovisual work legal entities with headquarters in, the \nUnited States.”   \n17 U.S.C . § 101.  An unpublished “United States work” is defined as  a work in which  “all the \nauthors of the work are nationals, domiciliaries, or habitual residents of the United States, or, in \nthe case of an unpublished audiovisual work, all the authors are legal  entities with headquarters in \nthe United States .”  Id.   \n Planner 5D argues that its alleged works are “unpublished,” so it is only required to allege \nthat “all authors” of the work are not affiliated with the United States.  Oppo. Facebook Mot. 9.  \nAccordingly, it argues, the allegation in the Complaint that the alleged works “were authored in \nEurope or Russia” by person s who ar e not “nationals, domiciliaries, or habitual residents of the \nU.S.” is sufficient to show that it is exempt from Section 411(a)’s registration requirement.  \nCompl. ¶ 29; see also id.  ¶ 30 (describing Planner 5D as a Lithuanian corporation).   Defendants Case 3:19-cv-03132-WHO     Document 52     Filed 11/21/19     Page 10 of 19 \n11 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  counter that Planner 5D’s alleged works were “published,” so the former definition under Section  \n101 applies and shows that Planner 5D’s works are “United States works” because they were \nsimultaneously published in the United States when Planner 5D published its works online on its \nwebsite.  \n Taking as true Planner 5D’s allegation that its works were authored by non -United States \npersons, the question remains whether it has also sufficiently allege d that its works are \nunpublished such that they can be considere d non -United States work s that are exempt from the \nSection 411(a) registration requirement.  The Copyright Act defines “publication” as the \n“distribution of copies or phonorecords of a work to the public by sale or other transfer of \nownership,” and adds th at a “public performance or display of a work does not itself constitute \npublication.”   17 U.S.C. § 101.  Defendants argue that the works were published on Planner 5D’s \nwebsite because the works were publicly available on the internet.   Princeton Mot. 11; Facebook \nMot. 9.4   \nPlanner 5D responds that its alleged works were not published because the works were \nmerely “displayed” on its website.  Oppo. Facebook 8 ; Oppo. Facebook Mot. 7 (citing Compl. ¶¶ \n27, 29 –30).  However, it only describe s of the library of works (the kinds of objects and scenes, \nand how many there are in the library), alleges that it owns copyright in all of these works, and \nconclus orily  alleges that these works were authored outside of the United States.  Compl. ¶¶ 27, \n29–30.  The Complaint does not allege how these works were merely displayed on its website  \nrather than being  publicly available s o that any user can obtain copies of them .  While Planner 5D \nasserts  that it has over “40 million users worldwide” who can “only access Planner 5D’s objects \nand scenes using Planner 5D’s proprietary software ,” it does not sufficiently allege how users’ \naccess is restricted  so that the works are merely displayed.   Id. ¶¶ 28, 31.   \nPlanner 5D alleges  that access and use of the objects  and scenes is “strictly limited” by its  \nTerms of Services  and prohibited by the “structure” of its website .  Id. ¶¶ 31 –32.  That is  not \n                                                 \n4 Although t he parties dispute whether Planner 5D’s works were actually published when they \nwere  posted online on its website , the question  now is whether Planner 5D has sufficiently alleged \nthat its works were “unpublished” and did not require Section 411(a) registra tion.  Case 3:19-cv-03132-WHO     Document 52     Filed 11/21/19     Page 11 of 19 \n12 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  enough to plead that Planner 5D’s works were merely displayed and not published.  Planner 5D \nmust allege facts that sho w that users were not able to copy the works on its website.  Doing so \nwill require Planner 5D to explain the “structure” of its website and how it prevents users from \naccessing object s and scenes, as well as the underlying data files.5  While Planner 5D h as alleged \nthat it authored its works outside the United States, in order to be exempt from the Section 411(a ) \nregistration requirement Planner 5D must also sufficiently allege  that it s works were unpublished .  \nAlternatively, if Planner 5D’s work s are considered to be United States  work s, then it \ncannot proceed with this case .  A plaintiff cannot cure its failure to meet the preconditions set forth \nin 17 U.S.C. § 411(a) by amending its pending complaint.  See Izmo, Inc. v. Roadster, Inc. , No. \n18-cv-06092-NC, 2019 WL 2359228, at *2 (N.D. Cal. June 4, 2019) (granting motion to dismiss \nwithout leave to amend even though plaintiff had a pending application for a registration because \n“permitting amendment to cure a claimant’s failure to register its copyrigh t before suing would \nundermine the objectives animating the Supreme Court’s decision in Fourth Estate ”).  Therefore, \nPlanner 5D can either amend its Complaint to sufficiently allege that it s works are non-United \nStates work s that are exempt from registrati on, or dismiss this suit and bring another suit after \nregistering with the Copyright Office.  \nB. Originality and Creativity of Planner 5D’s Alleged Works  \n1. Objects and Scenes  \nTo allege ownership of a valid copyright, the claimed work must be original and creati ve.  \nSee Phantomalert, Inc. v. Google, Inc. , No. 15 -cv-03986 -JCS, 2016 WL 879758, at *8 (N.D. Cal. \nMar. 8, 2016) (quoting Feist , 499 U.S. at 361).  “Original,” as used in copyright law, means only \nthat a work be “independently created by the author (as opp osed to copied from other works), and \nthat it possesses at least some minimal degree of creativity.”  Feist , 499 U.S. at 345.  “[T]he \nrequisite level of creativity is extremely low; even a slight amount will suffice.  The vast majority \nof works make the gr ade quite easily, as they possess some creative spark,  no matter how crude, \nhumble or obvious it might be.” Id. (internal citation and quotation marks omitted).   Facebook \n                                                 \n5 This issue is also addressed  in Section II.A of this Order, discussing whether Planner 5D has \nalleged  that it maintained secrecy  sufficient  to bring a trade secret misappropriation claim.  Case 3:19-cv-03132-WHO     Document 52     Filed 11/21/19     Page 12 of 19 \n13 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  argues that the first element of valid copyright ownership is not plausibly alleged b ecause Planner \n5D’s alleged works are not original or creative, and therefore  are not eligible for copyright \nprotection.  Facebook Mot. 12.   \nFacebook a sserts  that Planner 5D’s works are “realistic” and “exact digital renderings of \nreal-world objects.”  Fa cebook Mot. 13.  It points to allegations in the Complaint where Planner \n5D alleges that “human modelers must personally craft each three -dimensional object” in order to \nobtain “truly realistic scenes.”  Compl. ¶ 3.  Planner 5D contends that it spent time,  money and \neffort to make their objects and compilations, although that does not necessarily allege that any \ncreative expression was added into the renderings of real -life objects.  See Compl. ¶¶ 5,8 \n(describing Planner 5D grew its company “over many years , at the cost of millions of dollars,” and \n“painstakingly developed” the objects and scenes).  But t he “sweat of the  brow” approach does not \nestablish originality or creativity.  Feist , 499 U.S. at 359; see also Etrailer Corp. v. Automatic \nEquip. Mfg. Co. , No.  18 Civ. 351, 2019 WL 1596833, at *3 (D. Neb. Apr. 15, 2019) (dismissing \ncomplaint which only emphasized the time and money spent in creating unoriginal photographs) . \nIn its opposition, Planner 5D argues that its website reveals “‘hand -crafted’ ob jects with \nvarious colors, textures, features and embellishments.”  Oppo. Facebook Mot. 13.  This is not \nalleged in the Complaint , and even if it was, these allegations are not enough .  Planner 5D must \nsufficiently allege more than the time and effort that  went into making the three -dimensional \nobjects and scenes.  \n2. Compilation of Objects and Scenes  \nIn order to allege copyright protection in a compilation, a plaintiff must allege that it made \ncreative “choices as to selection and arrangement” of the compilati on’s elements such that they \n“are made independently by the complier and entail a minimal degree of creativity.”  Fiest , 499 \nU.S. at 348.  Facebook argues that Planner 5D fails to allege copyright protection in its alleged \nobject compilation and scene compilation.  Facebook Mot. 15.  It contends  that Planner 5D’s \ncompilations are merely a “repository” of all the scenes created by its users an d that there is no \nindication that Planner 5D made any creative choices in selecting which objects or scenes to \ninclude in the compilations or that it arranged or organized them in any creative way.  Facebook Case 3:19-cv-03132-WHO     Document 52     Filed 11/21/19     Page 13 of 19 \n14 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  Mot. 15.   \nAs to the object compilations, Plann er 5D argues that its website shows that Planner 5D’s \ndesigners selected, from practically unlimited possibilities, a subset of interior design objects that \nallow users to “create [their] dream home.”  Oppo. Facebook Mot. 15.   Nothing in the Complaint \nsupp orts this point.  Planner 5D does not allege that it has rendered any objects which were \nomitted from the compilation, and it does not allege any creative choices in selecting certain \nobjects among many that it had rendered to include in the compilation.  As Facebook points out , \nselecting all object s to include in the object compilation is not a “creative” selection that is \nprotectable by copyright.  Facebook Reply 8; see 1 Nimmer on Copyright § 3.02 (2019) (noting \nthat House Report of Copyright Act of 1976  states that a compilation “must be of the ‘discrete’ \nwritings of a given author [because] if the collection consists of all of a given author’s writings, \nthe process of selection would then involve no originality or authorship”).  Similarly, Planner 5D \nhas not sufficiently alleged any creative selection process behind its scene compilation.  It has not \nalleged that it exercised any creativity in selecting  among the user -generated scenes, nor does it \nidentify any scenes that it omitted from the compilation.    \nC. Specificity of Works Owned by Planner 5D that are the Subject of Its \nCopyright Claims  \nAs to the second element, Facebook argues that the Complaint “lacks specificity —both as \nto the scope of Planner 5D’s ownership and to Facebook’s alleged infringement —[and therefore] \nfails to provide adequate notice to Facebook as to Planner 5D’s claim and is grounds for \ndismissal. ”  Facebook Mot. 12.   Alleging the “copying  of elements of the work that are original ” \nrequires a plaintiff to specify the works  that are at issue .  See MultiCraft Imports, Inc. v. Mariposa \nUSA, Inc. , No. 16 -cv-3975 -DMG, 2017 WL 5664996, at *3 (C.D. Cal. Sept. 14, 2017)  (finding \ncomplaint failed to allege enough  facts that show copying because it is not clear what works are at \nissue).  If a plaintiff  “never makes clear what Defendant copied,” it makes it “impossible for the \nCourt to find Plaintiff’s [copyright infringement claim s plausible. ]”  Synopsys, Inc. v. ATopTech, \nInc., No. 13 -cv-02965 -SC, 2013 WL 5770542, at *4 (N.D. Cal.

Facebook \nargues that Planner 5D has failed to plead a plausible claim of copyright infringement because the \nComplaint does not plead the asserted copyright interests with sufficient detail or provide any \nrepresentative infringements.  Facebook Mot. 10.   \nPlanner 5D alleges that it owns copyr ights in over 4,500 objects, and that Princeton \nallegedly copied 2,644 objects for its  SUNCG dataset.  Id. ¶¶ 29, 43.  Planner 5D also alleges that \nit owns copyright s in over 1,000,000 scenes, and that Princeton allegedly copied 45,622 scenes for \nits SUNCG  dataset.  Id. ¶¶ 30, 43.  Altogether, Planner 5D alleges that Princeton copied over \n48,000 underlying files, comprised of the 2,644 objects and 45,622 scenes.  Id. ¶ 43.  Facebook \nargues that this does not give defendants adequate notice because the Compl aint “does not specify \nwhich Objects or Scene make up these compilations or which Objects or Scene were allegedly \ncopied and included in the SUNCG dataset.”  Facebook Mot. 11 –12.   \nFacebook’s argument misses the mark.  It states that Planner 5D owns copyri ght in a \ncertain amount of objects and scenes  yet only alleges that Princeton copied some of its objects and \nscenes ; accordingly, it  has not sufficiently alleged which works were infringed (2,644 objects \ncopied out of the total of over 4,500 objects Planne r 5D owns  and 45,622 scenes copied out of the \ntotal of over 1,000,000 scenes Plan ner 5D owns).  But Planner 5D does allege which works were \ninfringing works —all work s copied and placed into the SUNCG dataset are the allegedly \ninfringing works.  Compl. ¶¶ 4 3; see also id. ¶ 44 ( “[M]ore than 99.9% of the files in the SUNCG \ndataset are alleged to be identical copies of the files from Planner 5D’s collection .”).  The SUNCG \ndataset “thus is the copyrighted material whose infringement Planner 5D alleges.”  Oppo. \nFacebook 10  (emphasis in original) .     \nThat said , the question of “copying requires the Court to consider whether the ‘protectable \nelements ’ of [plaintiff’s] copyrights and defendants’ accused works are ‘substantially similar .’”  \nMultiCraft Imports , 2017  WL 5664996, at *4  (quoting  Funky Films, Inc. v. Time Warner Entm ’t \nCo., 462 F.3d 1072, 1077 (9th Cir. 2006) ).  Even if Planner 5D has identified  all the files in the \nSUNCG dataset a s the infringed works, it does not identify what copyrightable element s Princeton \ncopied  when it allegedly took those objects, scenes, and/or underlying files .  See supra  Section I.B  Case 3:19-cv-03132-WHO     Document 52     Filed 11/21/19     Page 15 of 19 \n16 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  (discussion on originality and creativity of Planner 5D’s alleged works).   This should be addressed \nin the amended complaint.  \nII. TRADE SECRET CLAIM S \nPlanner 5D claims misappropriation of trade s ecrets under the federal Defend Trade \nSecrets Act (“DTSA”) and California’s Uniform Trade Secrets Act (“CUTSA”) , which both  \n“require a plaintiff to show [1] that it possessed a trade secret, [2] that the defendant \nmisapprop riated the trade secret, and [3] that the defendant’s conduct damaged the plaintiff.”  \nWeRide Corp. v. Kun Huang , 379 F. Supp. 3d 834, 845 (N.D. Cal. 2019).  Planner 5D claims it \nhas a trade secret in the underlying data files that embody its objects and s cenes, and alleges that \ndefendants misappropriated that secret by obtaining downloads of the data files.  Compl. ¶¶ 33, 38.  \nA. Alleged Works as Trade Secrets  \nTo constitute a trade secret, the information must both (1) derive “independent economic \nvalue . . . from not being generally known to the public . . .” and (2) be “the subject of efforts that \nare reasonable under the circumstances to maintain its secrecy.”  Cal. Civ. Code §§ 3426.1(d)(1), \n(2); see also Veronica Foods Co. v. Ecklin , No. 16 -cv-07223 -JCS, 2 017 WL 2806706, at *12 \n(N.D. Cal. June 29, 2017) (definition of “trade secret” in the CUTSA is “substantially identical” to \nthe definition in the DTSA).  Defendants argue that Planner 5D does not  allege that its data files \ndefining the objects and scenes w ere secret because the Complaint makes clear that they are \npublicly available on the Planner 5D website.  Facebook Mot. 17; Princeton Mot. 18.  \nPlanner 5D a sserts  that it took reasonable efforts to maintain secrecy of its data files \nbecause the “structure” of its website “prohibit[s] users from directly accessing, downloading, or \notherwise using the data files.”  Compl. ¶ 32.  This allegation is not enough to plausibly allege that \nPlanner 5D’s underlying data files were not publicly available .  As I wrote ea rlier, Planner 5D \nonly mentions the structure of its website in conclusory terms in Paragraph 32 of its Complaint.  It \ndoes not describe how t he “structure” of the website operates as a lock .  It does not define how it \nbuilt the lock, and why nobody could get around that lock or at least should not have been able to \nget around that lock.    \nPlanner 5D also contends that its Terms of Service prohibit users from “download[ing] . . . Case 3:19-cv-03132-WHO     Document 52     Filed 11/21/19     Page 16 of 19 \n17 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  any portion of the Planner 5D project . . . or us[ing] the Planner 5D pr oject . . . other than for their \nintended purposes.”  Compl. ¶¶ 31, 45.  The sole “intended purpose” of Planner 5D’s website is \ninterior design.  Id. ¶ 27.  It follows, Planner 5D argues , that the Terms prohibit exactly what \nPrinceton did – “crawling throu gh thousands of Planner 5D web pages to identify each of Planner \n5D’s object and scene files, then scraping those files,” and using them “for its scene -recognition \nactivities .”  Id. ¶¶ 7, 68.   This is not enough .  While allegations about terms of service m ight be \nevidence of secrecy if parties are bound to that contract, here Planner 5D has not alleged that any \nportion of Planner 5D’s website was confidential or that the website requires users to treat it as \nconfidential .  See Broker Genius, Inc. v. Zalta , 280 F. Supp. 3d 495, 521 -22 (S.D.N.Y. 2017) \n(denying preliminary injunction as unlikely to succeed on the merits because plaintiff disclosed its \nalleged trade secrets to its users and its terms of service did not include a confidentiality \nprovision).   \nPrinceton and Facebook also contest the enforceability of the Terms of Service because \nPlanner 5D is not a party to these Terms  – Farminers Limited  is.  Princeton Mot. 19.  Planner 5D \nresponds that it is an express intended beneficiary of the Terms because th e Terms protect Planner \n5D’s project.  Oppo. Princeton Mot. 23.  It also states that because Princeton brought up this issue, \nit had no opportunity to plead its relationship with Farminers.  Id.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: In this case, thirteen authors sued Meta Platforms, Inc., alleging copyright infringement for using their books as training data to develop generative AI models, specifically Meta's Llama large language models. The court granted Meta's motion for partial summary judgment, holding that while Meta's use of the books was highly transformative, the plaintiffs failed to provide sufficient evidence of how this use negatively impacted the market for their works. Thus, the court ruled that Meta's use was protected under the fair use doctrine.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether Meta's use of the plaintiffs’ copyrighted works to train its generative AI models qualifies as fair use under copyright law.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court held that Meta's use of the copyrighted works was transformative and the plaintiffs failed to present evidence of market harm sufficient to overcome the fair use defense. Consequently, the court granted summary judgment in favor of Meta, allowing the use under the fair use doctrine.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine you wrote a story and someone used it to help teach a computer how to create new stories. The court had to decide if this was okay or if it was like someone copying your work without permission. The judge said it's okay because the computer wasn't using your exact story to make money directly from it but was learning to do new things, like creating different types of stories. Plus, you couldn't show how this teaching hurt you in selling your story. So, the court said the computer user didn't break any rules because they were making something new and not taking away from your story's value.",

Nos. 482, 501  \n \n \nCompanies are presently racing to develop generative artificial intelligence  models —\nsoftware products that are capable of generating text, images, videos, or sound based on \nmaterials the y’ve previously been “trained” on . Because the performance of a generative AI \nmodel depends on the amount and quality of data it absorb s as part of its training, companies \nhave been unable to resist the temptation to feed copyright -protected materials into the ir \nmodels —without getting permission from the copyright holders  or paying them for the right to \nuse their works for this purpose . This case presents the questi on whether such conduct is illegal.   \nAlthough the devil is in the details, in most cases the answer will likely be yes. What \ncopyright law cares about, above all else, is preserving  the incentive for human beings to create  \nartistic and scientific works . Therefore, it is generally illegal to copy protected  works  without \npermission . And the doctrine of “fair use,” which provides a defense to certain claims of \ncopyright infringement, typically doesn’t apply to copying  that will significantly diminish the \nability of copyright holder s to make money  from their works  (thus significantly diminish ing the \nincentive to create in the future ). Generative AI has the potential to flood the market with endless Case 3:23-cv-03417-VC     Document 598     Filed 06/25/25     Page 1 of 40 \n2 amounts of images, songs, articles, books, and more. People can prompt generative AI models to \nproduce  these outputs  using a tiny fraction of the time and creativity that would otherwise be \nrequired . So by training generative AI models with copyrighted works, companies are creating \nsomething that often will dramatically  undermine the market for th ose w orks, and thus \ndramatically undermine the incentive for human beings to create things the old -fashioned way . \nTake, for example,  biographies. If a company uses copyrighted biographies  to train a \nmodel, and if the model is thus capable of generating endless amounts of biographies , the market \nfor many of the copied biographies could be severely harmed . Perhaps not the market for Robert \nCaro’s Master of the Senate , because that book is at the top of so many people’s list s of \nbiographies  to read . But you can bet that the market for lesser-known  biographies  of Lyndon  B. \nJohnson  will be affected . And this, in turn, will diminish the incentive to write  biographies in the \nfuture.  \nOr take magazine articles. If a company uses copyrighted magazine articles to train a \nmodel capable of generating similar articles, it’s easy  to imagine the market for the copied \narticles diminishing substantiall y. Especially if the AI-generated articles are made available for \nfree. And again,  how will this affect the incentive for human beings to put in the effort necessary \nto produce high -quality magazine article s?  \nWith some types of works, the picture is a bit murkier. For example,  it’s not clear how \ngenerative AI would affect the market for memoirs or autobiographies, since by definition people \nread those works because of who wrote them. W ith fiction, i t might depend on the type of book.  \nPerhaps classic works of literature  like The Catcher in the Rye  would not see their market s \ndiminished. But the market for the typical  human -created  romance or spy novel could be  \ndiminished substantially by the proliferation of similar AI -created works. And again, the \nproliferation of such works would presumably diminish the incentive for human beings to write \nromance or spy novels  in the first place .    \nSome students of copyright law respond that none of this matters because when \ncompanies use copyrighted works to train generative AI models, they are using the works in a Case 3:23-cv-03417-VC     Document 598     Filed 06/25/25     Page 2 of 40 \n3 way that’s highly creative in its own right. In the language of copyright law, the companies’ use \nof the works is “transformative.” As a factual matter, there’s no disputing tha t. And as a legal \nmatter, it’s true that you’re less likely to be liable for copyright infringement if you’re copying \nthe work for a transformative purpose. In that situation, you’re more likely to be protected by the \nfair use doctrine. But as the Supreme Court has emphasized, the fair use inquiry is highly fact  \ndependent, and there are few bright -line rules. There is certainly no rule that when your use of a \nprotected work is “transformative,” this automatically inoculates you from a claim of copyright \ninfringement. And here, copying the protected works, however transformative, involves the \ncreation of a product with the ability to severely harm the market for the works being copied, and \nthus severely undermine the incentive for human beings to create. Under the fair use doctrine, \nharm to the market for the copyrighted work is more im portant than the purpose for which the \ncopies are made.  \nSpeaking of which, i n a recent ruling  on this topic,  Judge Alsup  focused heavily on the \ntransformative nature of generative AI while brushing aside  concern s about the harm it can \ninflict on the market for the works it gets trained on. Such harm  would be no different, he \nreasoned, than  the harm caused by  using the works for “training schoolchildren to write well ,” \nwhich could “result in an explosion of competing works.” Order on Fair Use at 28, Bartz v. \nAnthropic  PBC , No. 24 -cv-5417 (N.D. Cal. June 23, 2025) , Dkt. No. 231 . According to Judge \nAlsup, this “is not the kind of competitive or creative displacement that concerns the Copyright \nAct.” Id. But when it comes to market effects, using book s to teach child ren to write is  not \nremotely like using books to create a product that a single individual could employ to generate \ncountless competing works with a  miniscule  fraction of the time and creativity  it would \notherwise take . This inapt analogy is not a basis for blowing off the most important factor in the \nfair use analysis.        \nAnother argument offered in support of the companies is more rhetorical than legal : \nDon’t rule against them, or you’ll stop the development of this groundbreaking technology. The \ntechnology is certainly groundbreaking . But the suggestion that adverse copyright rulings would  Case 3:23-cv-03417-VC     Document 598     Filed 06/25/25     Page 3 of 40 \n4 stop this technology in its tracks  is ridiculous.  These products are expected to generate billions, \neven trillions , of dollars for the  companies that are developing them. If using copyrighted works \nto train the models is as necessary as the companies say, they will figure out a way to \ncompensate copyright holders for  it.   \nThe upshot is that in many circumstances it will be illegal to copy copyright -protected \nworks to train generative AI models without permission. Which means that the companies, to \navoid liability for copyright infringement, will  generally  need to pay copyright holders for the \nright to use their materials.  \nBut t hat brings us to this particular case. The above discussion is based in significant part \non th is Court’s general understanding of generative AI models and their capabilities. Courts can’t \ndecide cases based on general understandings. They must decide cases based on the evidence \npresented by the parties.  \nIn this case, thirteen  authors —mostly famous fiction writers —have sued Meta for \ndownloading their books from online “shadow libraries” and using the  books  to train Meta’ s \ngenerative AI model s (specifically, its large language model s, called Llama). The parties have \nfiled cross -motions for partial summary judgment , with the plaintiffs arguing that Meta’s \nconduct cannot possibly be fair use, and with Meta responding that its conduct must be \nconsidered fair use as a matter of law. In connection with these fair  use arguments, the plaintiffs \noffer two  primary  theories  for how the markets for their works are affected  by Meta’s copying . \nThey contend that Llama is  capable of reproducing small snippets of text from their books. And \nthey contend that Meta, by using their works for training without permission, has diminished the \nauthors’ ability to license their works for the purpose of training large language models. As \nexplained below, both  of these arguments are clear losers. Llama  is not capable of generating \nenough  text from the plaintiffs’ books to matter, and the plaintiffs are not entitled to the market \nfor licensing their works as AI training data. As for the potentially winning argument —that Meta \nhas copied their works to create a product that will likely flood the market with similar works , \ncausing market dilution —the plaintiffs  barely give th is issue lip service, and they present no  Case 3:23-cv-03417-VC     Document 598     Filed 06/25/25     Page 4 of 40 \n5 evidence about how the current or expected outputs from Meta’s model s would di lute the market \nfor their own works.   \nGiven the state of the record , the Court  has no choice but to grant summary judgment to \nMeta on the plaintiffs’ claim that the company violated copyright law by training its model s with \ntheir books. But in the grand scheme of things, the consequences of this ruling are limited. This \nis not a class action, so the ruling only affects the rights of these thirteen authors —not the \ncountless others whose works Meta used to train its models . And , as should now be clear,  this \nruling does not stand for the proposition that Meta’s use of copyrighted materi als to train its \nlanguage model s is lawful. It stands only for the proposition that these plaintiffs  made the wrong \narguments and failed to develop a record in support of the right one.  \nI. COPYRIGHT LAW AND FAIR USE  \nThe goal of copyright law is to promote  “broad public availability of literature, music, \nand the other arts.” Twentieth Century Music Corp. v. Aiken , 422 U.S. 151, 156 (197 5). To this \nend, copyright law incentivizes creativity by giving authors of original works a bundle of \nexclusive rights —for instance, the rights to prevent others from reproduc ing or distribut ing the \nwork s. 17 U.S.C. §  106. At the same time, however, copyright law “trades off the benefits of \nincentives to create against the costs of restr ictions on copying.” Andy Warhol Foundation for \nthe Visual Arts, Inc. v. Goldsmith , 598 U.S. 508, 526 (2023). For example, copyright only \nprotects expression, not underlying ideas, and the duration of copyright protection is limited. See \nid. (citing 17 U.S.C. §§  102, 302 –305).  \nOne major way the Copyright Act strikes a balance between protecting ownership and \nleaving room for innovation is through the affirmative defense of fair use. Under this doctrine, \n“the fair use of a copyrighted work  . . . for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, \nteaching  . . . , scholarship, or research, is not an infringement of copyright.” 17 U.S.C. § 107. \nFair use “ permits courts to avoid rigid application of the copyright statute when, on occasion, it \nwould stifle the very creativity which that law is designed to foster.” Google LLC v. Oracle \nAmerica, Inc. , 593 U.S. 1, 18 (2021) (quoting Stewart v. Abend , 495 U.S. 207, 236 (1990) ). Case 3:23-cv-03417-VC     Document 598     Filed 06/25/25     Page 5 of 40 \n6 The Copyright Act lists four factors to be considered in determining whether a given use \nis fair:  \n1. the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use \nis of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes;  \n \n2. the nature of the copyrighted work;  \n \n3. the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the \ncopyrighted work as a whole; and  \n \n4. the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the \ncopyrighted work.  \n17 U.S.C. § 107.  \n While the statute lists these four factors, fair use is a “flexible concept.” Warhol , 598 U.S. \nat 527  (quotation ma rks omitted) (quoting Oracle , 593 U.S. at 20). The list is not exhaustive . A \nparticular factor “may prove more important in some contexts than in others .” Oracle , 593 U.S. \nat 19.  And application of the factors “requires judicial balancing, depending upon relevant \ncircumstances, including ‘significant changes in technology. ’” Id. (quoting Sony Corp. of \nAmerica v. Universal City Studios,  Inc., 464 U.S. 417, 430 (1984)) . The factors may also overlap \nsuch that facts relevant to one factor are  also relevant to others . See A.V. ex rel. Vanderhye v. \niParadigms , LLC , 562 F. 3d 630, 642 (4th Cir. 2009).  Overall, the factors are not meant to be \napplied mechanically, but to contribute “to a holistic inquiry”: whether the secondary work is \nlikely to substitute for the original work in the marketplace and therefore undermine the \nincentive to create. See Romanova v. Amilus Inc. , 138 F.4th 104, 117 n.9  (2d Cir. 2025) (Leval, \nJ.); see also Warhol , 598 U.S. at 528 (referring to substitution as “copyright’s bête noire”) .  \nBecause it  “focuses on actual or potential market substitution,” Warhol , 598 U.S. at 536 \nn.12, the fourth factor is “undoubtedly the single most important element of fair use,” Harper & \nRow Publishers, Inc. v. Nation Enterprises , 471 U.S. 539, 566 (1985).  If the law allowed people \nto copy your creations in a way that would diminish the market for your works, this w ould \ndiminish your incentive to create more  in the future.  Thus, the key question in virtually any case \nwhere a defendant has copied someone’s or iginal work without permission is whether allowing \npeople to engage in that sort of conduct would substantially diminish the market for the original Case 3:23-cv-03417-VC     Document 598     Filed 06/25/25     Page 6 of 40 \n7 work.  See Campbell  v. Acuff -Rose Music, Inc. , 510 U.S.  569, 590 (1994).   \n Because fair use is an affirmative defense, the burden of proof is on the party invoking it. \nDr. Seuss Enterprises, L.P. v. ComicMix LLC , 983 F.3d 443, 459 (9th Cir. 2020), abrogated on \nother grounds by Jack Daniel’s Properties, Inc. v. VIP Products LLC , 599 U.S. 140 (2023). In \nparticular, because the fourth factor is the most important, t he secondary user (generally, the \ndefendant ) will “have difficulty carrying the burden of demonstrating fair use without favorable \nevidence about relevant markets.” Campbe ll, 510 U.S. at 590. But while the rightsholder need \nnot prove or present evidence of market harm,  they “may bear some initial burden of identifying  \nrelevant markets.” Hachette Book Group, Inc. v. Internet Archive , 115 F.4th 163, 194 (2d Cir. \n2024) ; see also Newegg Inc. v. Ezra Sutton, P.A. , No. CV 15 -01395, 2016 WL 6747629, at *2 \n(C.D. Cal. Sep. 13, 2016).  Moreover, b ecause fair use is a holistic inquiry, the party invoking it \n“bears the burden on the defense as a whole,” not as to each individual factor. William F. Patry, \nPatry on Fair Use  § 2:5 (May 2025 ed.).  \n Fair use is a mixed question of law and fact, but the “question primarily involves legal \nwork.” Oracle , 593 U.S. at 24. Therefore, fair use can be addressed at summary judgment where \nthere are no genuine issues of material fact relevant to fair use. Leadsinger, Inc. v. BMG Music \nPublishing , 512 F.3d 522, 530 (9th Cir. 2008). By contrast, where there are genuine factual \ndisputes that might affect whether the defendant’s use was fair, those disputes must be resolved \nby a jury. See Oracle , 593 U.S. at 2 3–25. Once a jury finds the facts, whether those facts support \nfair use “is a legal question for judges to decide.” Id. at 23 –24.  \n It bears emphasis  that where a fair use defense fails, the consequence isn’t necessarily \nthat the defendant must stop  whatever they were doing. The consequence will often  be that the \ndefendant needs to pay the copyright owner for  a license that grants  them  permission to do \nwhatever they were doing . This way , the defendant compensates the copyright owner for the fact \nthat the defendant’s conduct will otherwise  harm  the market for the original work.  The defendant \nwill only be forced to stop what they’re doin g if they’re unwilling or unable to pay for the right \nto do it . Case 3:23-cv-03417-VC     Document 598     Filed 06/25/25     Page 7 of 40 \n8 II. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY  \nA \n“Generative AI” is a type of artificial intelligence that creates new content, such as text, \nimages, videos, or sound.1 Generative AI models do this , as Meta describes it,  by extracting  \n“increasingly complex mathematical patterns from training data, enabling the network to output \na prediction or decision based on the patterns derived.”  To put it more simply, generative AI \nmodels are “trained” to identify common patterns across large training datasets. They can then \ncreate, in response to user prompts, new content based on the patterns they have recognized in \nthat training data. By the same token, a model’s outputs are limited based on the patterns that \nexisted in its training data. For ins tance, if the only bridge in an image -generating model’s \ntraining data was the Golden Gate Bridge, and a user told that model to generate an image of a \nbridge, it would likely generate an orange -red suspension bridge, because that is the pattern of a \nbridge that would emerge from its training data.  \nA large language model, or LLM, is a particular type of generative AI model designed to \nunderstand and generate text. Users can prompt LLMs to do a wide range of things, such as draft \nemails, summarize documents, or write computer code. Well -known LLMs inc lude OpenAI’s \nChatGPT models and Google’s Gemini  models.  \nLLMs learn to understand language by analyzing relationships among words and \npunctuation marks in their training data. The units of text —words and punctuation marks —on \nwhich LLMs are trained are often referred to as “tokens.”  LLMs are trained on an immense \namount of text and thereby learn an immense amount about the statistical relationships among  \nwords . Based on what they learned from their training data , LLMs can create new text by \npredicting  what words are most likely to come next in sequence s. This allo ws them to generate \ntext responses to basically any user prompt. Model developers may also “post -train” or \n“finetune” their models to improve their performance at specific tasks or otherwise adjust their \noutputs, such as to prevent generation of offensive statements.  Therefore, as with other \n \n1 Except as noted, the parties do not dispute the facts described  in this section.  Case 3:23-cv-03417-VC     Document 598     Filed 06/25/25     Page 8 of 40 \n9 generative AI models, LLMs’ outputs are limited by their training data. To be able to generate a \nwide range of text —in different languages or styles, or regarding different subject matter —an \nLLM’s training dataset must be large and diverse.  As one Meta witness put it, “If a model only \nsaw social media posts, for example, it would not do well in generating source computer code.”  \nBut while a variety of text is necessary for training, books make for especially valuable \ntraining data . This is  because they provide very high-quality data for  training  an LLM ’s \n“memory” and allowing it to work with larger amounts of text at once . (The technical term for \nhow many tokens an LLM can hold in its memory at once is its  “context window .”) For instance, \nan LLM with a  better memory  will be able to process and respond to longer prompts, incorporate \nmore information into outputs, and remember things from earlier in an exchange, resulting in \nsmoother “conversations.” Books are good data for  training LLMs’ memories because , in the \nwords of one of Meta’s expert  witnesses , they are “long but consistent,” maintaining a particular \nstyle and coherent structure. They are also high quality in the sense that they generally are well \nwritten and use proper grammar (especially compared to text from the internet , which var ies \nwidely on these metrics).  \nB \nMeta Platforms owns and operates social media services including Facebook, Instagram, \nand WhatsApp . It is also the developer of a series of LLMs named “Llama.” Meta released \nLlama 1 in February 2023 and Llama 2 that July. Llama 3 —along with  Meta AI, an easily \naccessible AI chatbot (analogous to ChatGPT) that incorporates Llama 3 —was released in April \n2024 . Llama 4 is planned for release later in 2025 . As Meta explains, each new Llama edition \nimproved in certain ways over its predecessor: Llama 2 was finetun ed “to improve the safety, \nquality, and consistency” of its outputs; Llama 3 made “significant improvements in \nperformance and efficiency”; and Llama 4 is  generally “larger ” and  “more advanced.” Subject to \ncertain restrictions, members of the public can download all of the Llama models for free for \nnoncommercial use; Llama 2 and 3 are also free to download for commercial use. While the \nLlama models are free to download , Meta estimates that its total revenue from generative AI will Case 3:23-cv-03417-VC     Document 598     Filed 06/25/25     Page 9 of 40 \n10 range from $2 to $3 billion in 2025, and from $460 billion to $1.4 trillion  over the next ten years . \nSee Pls. MSJ Ex. 8 at 12. \nTo get the varied and extensive text necessary to train its models, Meta cast a wide net. \nApproximately two -thirds of the data used to train Llama 1 and 2 came from Common Crawl, a \nnonprofit organization that collect s and provides free access to website data, metadata, and text. \nThe remainder came from websites and databases including Wikipedia, GitHub, ArXiv, Stack \nExchange, and a combination of Project Gutenberg and Books3 (two book data bases ).2 With the \nexception of Books3, none of the sources contain ed any copyrighted material at issue in this \ncase.  \nAlthough Meta needed (and acquired and used) a wide range of training data, it \nespecially needed books because, as discussed above, books make for high -quality data. Meta AI \nresearchers and engineers repeatedly discussed the benefits  of using books as training data , as \nwell as the need to acquire more books  for this use. One Meta employee s aid that the “best \nresources we can think of are definitely books.”  Pls. MSJ Ex. 1 8 at 2. Another said it was “really \nimportant for us to get books data ASAP.” Id. Ex. 40 at 2. So as Meta expanded its datasets \ngenerally, it also continued to look for more books in particular.  \nAt first, Meta wanted to license books and so tried to negotiate licensing deals with \nseveral major publishers.  Meta’s head of generative AI discussed spending up to $100 million on \nlicensing. But as negotiations proceeded, Meta realized that licensing would be more difficult \nthan anticipated. For one thing, publishers generally d o not hold the subsidiary rights to license \nbooks for AI training . These rights are instead held by individual authors, and there is no \norganization for collective licensing of suc h rights. Sinkinson  Decl. ISO Meta MSJ ¶¶  58–59, 62. \nEven where publishers d o hold AI training licensing rights, they d o so regionally rather than \nglobally. Meta MSJ Ex. 34 at 22:22 –25:15. For another thing, some publishers apparently \n \n2 According to Meta, GitHub is “a leading cloud -based platform where coders store and share \ncode, frequently on an open -source basis.” ArXiv is “a free online archive of math, science, and \neconomics papers.” Stack Exchange is “a network of question -and-answer websites for sharing \ntechnical knowledge, geared toward the programming community.”  Case 3:23-cv-03417-VC     Document 598     Filed 06/25/25     Page 10 of 40 \n11 ignored Meta’s outreach, and only one gave Meta a pricing proposal. Id. at 23:11 –14, 24:2 –10. \nEventually, Meta began investigating the possibility of procuring the books (and other \ntext) needed for training by downloading them from “shadow libraries.” A shadow library is an \nonline repository that provides  things like books, academic journal articles, music, or films for \nfree download , regardless of whether that media is copyrighted. Meta first used a shadow library \nin October 2022, when it downloaded the Library Genesis (“LibGen”) database to investigate \nwhether there was value in training Llama on the works it contained. Pls. MSJ Ex. 32 at 3. If the \nanswer was yes , the plan was to then set up licensing agreement s for those or similar works. Id. \nBut in spring 2023, after failing to acquire licenses and following escalation to CEO Mark \nZuckerberg, Meta decided to just use the works acquired from LibGen as training data. Id. Ex. 61 \nat 5. And after confirming that LibGen contained most of the works available for license from \ncertain publishers with which it had been negotiating, Meta abandoned its licens ing efforts. Id. \nEx. 50 at 131:1 –132:10, 383:5 –384:12 ; id. Ex. 57 at 2; id. Ex. 58 at 3; see also  id. Ex. 92 at 12. \nIn early 2024, Meta also downloaded Anna’s Archive, a compilation of shadow libraries \nincluding LibGen, Z -Library, and others. See id. Ex. 66 at 2 –3. \nTo download these large datasets more quickly and without unnecessarily slowing down \nits networks, Meta torrented them. “Torrenting” is a filesharing technique that entails the \nsimultaneous distribution of small portions of a larger file from many different sources. To be \nmore precise,  those sources are many other computer systems that also contain that file. So, for \ninstance, one who torrented LibGen would download small pieces of each book LibGen contains \nfrom other users who had copies of LibGen on their  computer and who were participating in the \ntorrenting network. The torrenting software would then take those pieces and reassemble them \ninto the original files on the downloader’s computer.3  \nCertain torrenting protocols —including the one used by Meta, called BitTorrent —are, by \n \n3 See generally  David Gerwitz, What Is Torrenting? , ZDNET (Aug. 6, 2024), \nhttps://www.zdnet.com/article/what -is-torrenting -and-how-does-it-work  [https://perma.cc/8PG5 -\nH7UW ]. Case 3:23-cv-03417-VC     Document 598     Filed 06/25/25     Page 11 of 40 \n12 default, configured so that files downloaded via torrenting may also be reuploaded to other  \ncomputer systems . This reuploading can occur both while files are still being downloaded (which \nthe parties refer to as “leeching”) and after those files have been fully downloaded (which the \nparties refer to as “seeding”). Some torrent ing protocols —including BitTorrent —are designed to \nprioritize downloads to users who are also uploading.  \nThere is no dispute that Meta torrent ed LibGen and Anna’s Archive, but the parties \ndispute w hether and to what  extent Meta uploaded (via leeching or seeding) the data it torrented. \nA Meta engineer involved in the torrenting wrote a script to prevent seeding, but apparently not \nleeching. See Pls. MSJ at 13; id. Ex. 71 ¶¶  16–17, 19; id. Ex. 67 at 3, 6 –7, 13 –16, 24 –26; see also  \nMeta MSJ Ex. 38 at 4 –5. Therefore, say the plaintiffs, because BitTorrent’s default settings allow \nfor leeching, and because Meta did nothing to change those default settings, Meta must have \nreuploaded “at least some” of the data Meta downloaded  via torrent. The plaintiffs assert further \nthat Meta chose not to take any steps to prevent leeching because that would have slowed its \ndownload  speeds . Meta responds that, even if it reuploaded some of what it downloaded, that \ndoesn’t mean it reuploaded any of the plaintiffs’  books. It also notes that leeching was not clearly \nan issue in the case  until recently, and so  it has not yet had a chance to fully develop evidence to \naddress the plaintiffs’ assertions.   \nEither way,  Meta added  the books it downloaded to the datasets it used to train the Llama \nmodels. It also post-trained its models to prevent them from “memorizing” and outputting certain \ntext from their training data, including copyrighted material.  These training efforts, which Meta \ncalls “mitigations,” appear to have been successful . Meta’s expert  witness  tested them  using a \nmethod designed to get LLMs to regurgitate material from its training data  (which Meta calls \n“adversarial prompting”). Even using that method, the expert  could get no model to generate \nmore than 50 words and punctuation marks  (that is, “tokens”)  from the plaintiffs’ books . And the \nplaintiffs’ expert could only get the Llama model best at regurgitation to generate 50 words and \npunctuation marks from the plaintiffs’ books in 60% of tests . She also testified that Llama was \nnot able to reproduce “any significant percentage” of th em. Meta MSJ Ex. 24 at 237:16 –19; see Case 3:23-cv-03417-VC     Document 598     Filed 06/25/25     Page 12 of 40 \n13 also Pls. Ex. 79 ¶¶ 70 –72, 79, 82 –83, 92; Meta MSJ Ex. 23 at 179:22 –25, 180:17 –181:16 . In \nshort, Llama cannot currently be used to read or otherwise meaningfully access the plaintiffs’  \nbooks.  \nC \nThe plaintiffs are thirteen published authors who have  written , and who hold copyright \nin, various works . Those works  are mostly novels, but also include plays, short stories, memoirs, \nessays, and nonfiction books. Examples  include  Sarah Silverman’s The Bedwetter , a comic \nmemoir; Rachel Louise Snyder’s No Visible Bruises: What We Don’t Know About Domestic \nViolence Can Kill Us , a nonfiction book about domestic violence and how to combat it; Junot \nDíaz’s  Pulitzer Prize –winning novel , The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao ; and Andrew Sean \nGreer’s Less, also a Pulitzer Prize –winning novel.  All of the books in which the plaintiffs hold \ncopyright c an be found in the datasets Meta downloaded, including both Books3 and the Anna’s \nArchive databases . In total, Meta downloaded at least 666 copies of books whose copyrights the \nplaintiffs hold.  \nEach plaintiff says that they would be open to licensing their books for use as generative \nAI training data, but that Meta did not approach them about this licensing. No plaintiff has \nlicensed a book to any company for use as LLM training data or been asked by any company to \nlicense a book for that purpose.  \nThe plaintiffs filed this lawsuit seeking to represent a class of all owners of copyrighted \nworks used as training data for Llama. They brought claims for direct copyright infringement  \n(based on Meta’s reproduction of their books) , vicarious copyright infringement, removal of \ncopyright management information in violation of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act  \n(DMCA) , unfair competition, unjust enrichment, and negligence. The plaintiffs  seek damages, \nrestitution, and injunctive and declaratory relief, altho ugh it is not entirely clear what exactly \nthey seek to enjoin. They did not , for instance, seek a preliminary injunction preventing Meta \nfrom using their works as training data or requiring Meta to retrain the existing Llama models on \ndata excluding their books. Cf. Concord Music Group, Inc. v. Anthropic PBC , No. 24 -cv-3811, Case 3:23-cv-03417-VC     Document 598     Filed 06/25/25     Page 13 of 40 \n14 2025 WL 904333, at *3 –4 (N.D. Cal. Mar. 25, 2025) (discussing music publishers’ motion for a \npreliminary injunction seeking relief based on future training of AI model s).  \nAll of the claims except the direct copyright infringement claim were dismissed  early on . \nThe plaintiffs were later granted leave to amend to expand their copyright claim to encompass a \ntheory of infringement by distribution  (based on the allegation that Meta was reuploading the \ndata it torrented) , and to add both a different  DMCA claim and a claim under the California \nComprehensive Computer Data Access and Fraud Act (CDAFA). Meta moved to dismiss th e \nnew claims , and its motion was granted as to the CDAFA c laim but denied as to the DMCA \nclaim .  \nOften, the next step in a case like this is a motion for  class certification  by the named \nplaintiffs . But sometimes the parties will first move for summary judgment regarding the \nindividual claims of the named plaintiffs. For defendants in such cases, there is a trade -off. On \nthe one hand, a defendant could benefit by getting a favorable ruling and disposing of the case \nbefore being subjected to expensive and burdensome class -related discovery and motion practice. \nOn the other hand, this favorabl e ruling fo r the defendant binds only the individual named \nplaintiffs, leaving all other members of the proposed class free to sue on the same claims. In this \ncase, Meta proposed doing  summary judgment regarding the individual claims of the named \nplaintiffs first, and the Court accepted this approach.    \nThus,  after the close of discovery relating to the merits of the named plaintiffs’ claims,  \nthe plaintiffs moved for partial summary judgment , arguing that they had made out a facial claim \nfor copyright infringement and that Meta’s fair use defense could not possibly apply to negate \nthat claim.  Meta  did not dispute that the plaintiffs established a  facial case of infringement of \ntheir rights of reproduction . But Meta  opposed the plaintiffs’  motion —and indeed filed its own \ncross -motion —on the ground that its reproduction was fair use  as a matter of law .  \nMeta  also moved for summary judgment as to the plaintiffs’ DMCA claim; that motion \nwill be granted in a separate order.  With respect to the plaintiffs’ claim that Meta infringed their \ncopyrights by distributing their works  (via leeching or seeding ), neither side moved for summary Case 3:23-cv-03417-VC     Document 598     Filed 06/25/25     Page 14 of 40 \n15 judgment , so this will remain a live issue in the case .4  \n Six friend -of-the-court briefs (that is, amicus briefs) were also  filed. An assortment of \nintellectual property law professors and the Electronic Frontier Foundation (a  civil liberties  \norganization ) filed briefs in support of Meta. An assortment of copyright professors; the \nCopyright Alliance (an organization of creators); the Association of American Publishers; and \nthe International Association of Scientific, Technical and Medical Publishers filed briefs in \nsupport of the plaintiffs.  \nIII. FACTOR ONE : THE PURPOSE AND CHARACTER OF THE USE  \nThe first factor “ considers the reasons for, and nature of, the copier’s use of an original \nwork .” Warhol , 598 U.S. at 528.  Several things can be relevant to the “purpose and character” of \na use. One is whether that use is “of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational \npurposes .” 17 U.S.C. §  107(1). Another might be whether it was made in good or bad faith  \n(although whether this is relevant  is unclear under current law) . See Oracle , 593 U.S. at 32–33.  \nPrimarily, however, the first factor focuses on whether the secondary use is \n“transformative” —that is, on whether and to what extent “the new work merely supersedes the \n \n4 The plaintiffs moved for summary judgment only on the grounds that “Meta copied [their] \ncopyrighted books without permission” and that  its “reproduction  . . . without permission  . . . is \nnot fair use.” Pls. MSJ at vii, 19. The plaintiffs did at times suggest that their motion \nencompassed their distribution  claim. See, e.g. , id. at 22 (“Meta’s initial reproduction” was not \nfair use because it “result[ed] in distributing copyrighted material.”). But reproduction and \ndistribution are separate rights that must be considered separately. See 17 U.S.C. §  106(1), (3); \nColumbia Pictures Industries, Inc. v. Fun , 710 F.3d 1020, 1034 (9th Cir. 2013) (“Both uploading \nand downloading copyrighted material are infringing acts. The former violates the copyright \nholder’s right to distribution, the latter the right to reproduction.”).  \nAs discussed below, the specific manner of Meta’s reproduction (that is, torrenting the \nplaintiffs’ books from shadow libraries) is still relevant to whether that reproduction was fair use. \nBut Meta’s alleged distribution must be addressed independently  (unless, maybe , its acquisition \nnecessarily  involved distribution, which does not appear to be the case, see Pls. Ex. 67 at \n106:14 –108:25 , 246:13–248:23, 2 70:12–16 (explaining that default settings could be changed \nsuch that leeching was not always occurring) ). Even if the plaintiffs had moved for summary \njudgment as to whether any distribution was fair use, the record on Meta’s alleged distribution is \nincomplete, making summary judgment on that issue improper at this point in the case. See \nOrder Granting as Modified Meta’s Request for Leave to File a Rebuttal Expert Report, Dkt. No. \n499 (giving Meta leave to serve  supplemental expert report on distribution, with deadline after \nMeta’s deadline to oppose the plaintiffs’ motion  for summary judgment).  \n Case 3:23-cv-03417-VC     Document 598     Filed 06/25/25     Page 15 of 40 \n16 objects of the original creation (supplanting the original), or instead adds something new, with a \nfurther purpose or different character.” Warhol , 598 U.S.  at 528 (cleaned up). A llowing  a use \nwith a “distinct purpose”  is often consistent with the goals of copyright because it encourages the \ndevelopment of new expression “without diminishing the incentive to create.” Id. at 531. On the \nother hand, a secondary use with the same purpose as the original work is “more likely to \nprovide the public with a substan tial substitute for” the original. Id. at 531 –32 (cleaned up).  \nThis factor favors Meta. There is no serious question that Meta’s use of the plaintiffs’ \nbooks had a “further purpose” and “different character” than the books —that it was highly \ntransformative . The purpose of Meta’s copying was to train its LLMs, which are innovative tools \nthat can be used to generate diverse text and perform a wide range of functions. Cf. Oracle , 593 \nU.S. at 30  (transformative to use copyrighted computer code “to create a new platform that could \nbe readily used by programmers”) . Users can ask Llama to edit an email they have written, \ntranslate an excerpt from or into a foreign language, write a skit based on a hypothetical scenario , \nor do any number of other tasks . The purpose of the plaintiffs’ books , by contrast, is to be read \nfor entertainment or education.  \nThe plaintiffs do not meaningfully disagree  about Llama’s purpose . To the contrary, they \nacknowledge that LLMs have “end uses” including serving “as a personal tutor,” assisting “with \ncreative ideation, ” and helping users “generate business reports.” And several of the  plaintiffs  \ntestified to using LLMs for various purposes , all distinct from creating or reading an expressive \nwork like a novel or biography —for instance, to find recipes, get tax or medical advice, translate \ndocuments, or conduct research. All of these functions are different from the use to which the \nplaintiffs’ books are generally put . So copying the books to develop a tool that can perform th ose \nfunctions  is a use with a different purpose and character than the books themselves.  \nA \nThe plaintiffs’ law professor amici  argue that Meta’s use has the same purpose and \ncharacter as the books because an LLM training on a book is akin to a human reading  one. One \nmight also analogize Meta ’s copying of the books to train Llama to a situation in which a Case 3:23-cv-03417-VC     Document 598     Filed 06/25/25     Page 16 of 40 \n17 professor copies a book and gives it to a student so that the student can use the knowledge from \nthe book (along with knowledge they get from other books) to go do great things. But there are a \nfew important differences.  \nFirst, an LLM’s consumption of a book is different than a person’s. An LLM ingests text \nto learn “statistical patterns” of how words are used together in different contexts.  It does so by \ntaking a piece  of text from its training data , removing a word from that text, predicting what that \nword will be, and updating its general understanding of language based on whether it was right \nor wrong —and then repeating this  exercise  billions or trillions of times with different text. This \nis not how a human reads a book .  \nSecond, unlike the hypothetical professor, Meta did not just give the plaintiffs’ books to \none person. Meta  copied the plaintiffs’ books as part of an effort to create a tool that can generate \na wide range of text . Any person can use that tool to help them create further expression, whether \nby having it help them brainstorm or research for a creative writing project (like plaintiff David \nHenry Hwang, a playwright and screenwriter) or by having it write code to develop new software \nprograms (like Lockheed Ma rtin).  By creating a tool that anyone can use, Meta’s copying has the \npotential to  exponentially  multiply creative expression in a way that teaching  individual people  \ndoes not. Cf. Oracle , 593 U.S. at 30 . \nIn contrast to the copyright professors, the plaintiffs make different  (and much weaker)  \narguments for why Meta’s use is not transformative. For example , the plaintiffs suggest that \nLlama has “no critical bearing” on their books, the way criticism or parody would. But “critique \nor commentary on the original” are not “the only uses that will furnish a justification ultimately \nqualifying as fair use.” Romanova , 138 F.4th at 115 . To the contrary, a use that enables “the \nfurnishing of valuable information on an y subject of public interest ” or renders “a valuable \nservice to the public” might be justified, especially where that benefit is “provided without \nallowing public access to the copy.” Id.  \nIn addition, the  plaintiffs argue that Meta’s use is not transformative because Llama will \noutput material that “mimics” the plaintiffs’ work or writing styles if prompted to do so. Case 3:23-cv-03417-VC     Document 598     Filed 06/25/25     Page 17 of 40 \n36 because it was trained on copyrighted material. In Hachette , on the other hand, the only \nnecessary inference was that readers might choose to download the plaintiffs’ books for free \ninstead of paying for them —a much shorter (and more obvious) inferential leap. Cf. Am erican  \nSociety for Testing & Materials v. Public.Resource.Org , 82 F.4th 1262, 1271 –72 (D.C. Cir. \n2023).  \nOn this record, then, Meta has defeated the plaintiffs’ half-hearted argument that its \ncopying causes or threatens significant market harm. That conclusion may be in  significant  \ntension with reality, but it’s dictated by the choice the plaintiffs made to put forward two flawed \ntheories of market harm while failing to present meaningful evidence on the effect of training \nLLMs like Llama with their books on the market for those books.14   \nD \n Two other issues are relevant to the fourth factor. First, as noted above, is whether Meta’s \nuse of shadow libraries benefited those libraries or their other users. If it did, then this would be \nrelevant to the fourth factor . It would mean that Meta’s copying helped others acquire \ncopyrighted works, potentially including the plaintiffs’  works , without paying for them (and \nwithout any indication that those other people were acquiring the works for fair use purposes). \nBut although the plaintiffs discussed Me ta’s use of shadow libraries at length, they did not argue \nthat it had these effects or was relevant to the fourth factor beyond allowing Meta to get the \nbooks without paying. At the hearing, the plaintiffs’ counsel did suggest that, by using shadow \nlibraries, Meta (and other companies like it) would reduce the stigma associated with shadow \n \n14 The plaintiffs also assert that the market for their works was harmed in the more narrow sense \nthat, if Meta had  not downloaded the books from a shadow library, it would have been required \nto buy the books. But as already discussed, even though that downloading is a separate use, it \nmust be considered in light of its overall purpose.  For instance, imagine a researcher who \ndownloaded books from a shadow library  in the process of writing an article on shadow libraries, \nand only did so for their research. That downloading would almost certainly be a fair use. Of \ncourse, in that example, the downloader has less ability to procure the books elsewhere than \nMeta did. But the point is that downloading from a shadow library, which the plaintiffs refer to \nas “unmitigated piracy,” must be viewed in light of its ultimate end.  Because Meta’s purpose of \nLLM training is so transformative, the plaintiffs need ed to win decisively on the fourth factor. \nThe loss of isolated sales to AI developers is not the kind of market harm that could tip the scales \nfor the plaintiffs.   Case 3:23-cv-03417-VC     Document 598     Filed 06/25/25     Page 36 of 40 \n37 libraries and encourage more people to use them. May 1 Hr’g Tr. at 92 –93. It’s not clear whether \nthis would matter in the overall analysis.  But in any event,  counsel conceded that the record \ncontains no evidence of this dynamic playing out. Id. at 93–94.15 \n Second is the public benefit associated with Meta’s copying. Neither side’s presentation \non this front does much to move the needle. The plaintiffs say that sanctioning Meta’s conduct  \nwould encourage piracy by incentivizing other LLM companies to pirate and to “support and \ndefend” shadow libraries “that make stolen works available for free.” There is no evidence in the \nrecord that Meta (or any other LLM developer) is actively supporting or otherwise encouraging \nwidespread use of shadow libraries. As for inc entivizing other LLM developers to use shadow \nlibraries, the plaintiffs again beg the question —whether LLM developers should have to pay for \nthe books they use as training data is the issue  addressed in this opinion  (and, obviously, a fact -\nspecific one that can’t be answered uniformly across the board) . Meta, for its part, mostly \ndiscusses the various ways that LLMs can be useful. But the public benefits most relevant to the \nfourth factor are those “related to copyright’s concern for the creative production  of new \nexpression.” Oracle , 593 U.S. at 35.  So the  fact that Llama can help someone  do their taxes , for \nexample,  is not especially relevant here. Nevertheless, Meta’s use of copyrighted works as \ntraining data will likely help Llama create new expression, whether by making it better at helping \nusers generate creative text or by improving its “memory” and thereby making it more useful to \nthe researchers who use it to develop software . Public benefit considerations thus slightly favor \n \n15 One of Meta’s expert  witnesses  did testify at her deposition that, depending on how it \nconfigured its torrenting software, it was more likely than not that Meta contributed to the \nBitTorrent network’s “bandwidth, content, storage, and processing  power.” Pls. MSJ Ex. 67 at \n103:3–104:5. But there is no evidence of whether Meta  actually  had the right settings to do so or \nof how much it might have contributed  to this network . More importantly, there is no indication \nthat any computing power Meta contributed to the BitTorrent network  would have assisted the \nshadow libraries  from which Meta torrented (or otherwise contributed to infringement of the \nplaintiffs’ copyrights ). To the contrary, the plaintiffs cite a source indicating that the vast \nmajority of torrented files are movies, TV shows, video games, and music —which are generally \ncopyrighted but are not at issue in this case —and that books comprise less than one percent of \ntorrented material. Jacqui Cheng, BitTorrent Census: About 99% of Files Copyright Infringing , \nArs Technica (Jan. 29, 2010), https://arstechnica.com/information -\ntechnology/2010/01/bittorrent -census -about -99-of-files-copyright -infringing  \n[https://perma.cc/KZ7N -R9BN ].  Case 3:23-cv-03417-VC     Document 598     Filed 06/25/25     Page 37 of 40 \n38 Meta , confirming that it wins on factor four . \nE \n Relatedly,  Meta argues that the “public interest” would be “badly disserved” by \npreventing Meta (and other AI developers) from using copyrighted text as training data without \npaying to do so.  Meta seems to imply that such a ruling would stop the development of LLMs \nand other generative AI technologies in its tracks.  This is nonsense.  \n As mentioned  earlier , a ruling that certain copying isn’t fair use doesn’t necessarily mean \nthe copier has to stop  their copying —it means that they have to get permission  for it . So where \ncopying for LLM training isn’t fair use, LLM developers (including Meta) won’t need to stop \nusing copyrighted works to train their models. They will need only to pay rightsholders for \nlicenses for that training.  \nPresumably , where copying for AI training isn’t fair use,  AI developers will simply \nfigure out a way to license the works they wish to use as training data. Meta’s contention that \nmarkets for this licensing can’t or won’t develop is hard to believe.  If books are as good for LLM \ntraining as Meta says they are, then it seems nearly certain that LLM developers would be \nwilling to pay for licenses. (Indeed, Meta itself was willing to pay to license books —it just found \nlicensing too logistically difficult .) Even  if the value of any particular book as training data is too \nlow to justify negotiating licensing deals book by book, LLM developers would still presumably \nbe interested in licensing large numbers of books at once. Publishers may not currently hold the \nsubsidiary rights necessary to make group licensing possible. But  it’s hard to believe that they \nwon’t soon start negotiating those rights with their authors so that they can engage in large -scale \nnegotiation and licensing with LLM developers —assuming they ha ven’t already started to do so. \nIt seems especially likely that these licensing markets will arise if LLM developers’ only choices \nare to  get license s or forgo the use of copyrighted books as training data.  If they instead choose \nto use only public domain works as training data (instead of licensing copyrighted works), that \nwould indicate that they don’t actually need the copyrighted works as badly  as they say they do . \n So if it isn’t fair use for Meta and other LLM developers to use copyrighted books as Case 3:23-cv-03417-VC     Document 598     Filed 06/25/25     Page 38 of 40 \n39 training data without permission, they won’t have to stop working on their LLMs altogether. \nThey’ll just have to pay for licenses or use books that aren’t copyrighted. Either way, it may be \nthat LLM companies move somewhat more slowly or make somewhat less money. But the \nsuggestion that the growth of LLM technology would come to a halt (or anything close) doesn’t \npass the straight face test .  \nVII. CONCLUSION  \nFair use is a fact-specific doctrine that requires case -by-case analysis that is sensitive to \nnew technologies and their potential consequences . No previous case has involved a use that is \nboth as transformative and as capable of diluting the market for the original works as LLM \ntraining is. So no previous case answers the question whether Meta’s copying was fair use. That \nquestion must be answered by flexibly applying the fair use factors and considering Meta’s \ncopying in light of the purp ose of copyright and fair use: protecting the incentive to create by \npreventing copiers from  creat ing works that  substitut e for the original s in the marketplace .  \nIn cases involving uses like Meta’s , it seems like the plaintiffs will often win , at least \nwhere those cases have better -developed records on the market effects of the defendant’s use.  No \nmatter how transformative LLM training may be,  it’s hard to imagine that it can be fair use to \nuse copyrighted books to develop a tool to make billions or trillions of dollars while enabl ing the \ncreation of a potentially endless stream of  competing works that could significantly harm the \nmarket for those books. And some cases might present even stronger arguments against fair use. \nFor instance, as discussed above, it seems that markets for certain types of works (like news \narticles) might be even more vulnerable to indirect competition from AI outputs. On the oth er \nhand, though,  tweak some facts and defendants might win . For example, using copyrighted \nbooks to train an LLM for nonprofit purposes, like national security or medical research, might \nbe fair use even in the face of some amount of market dilution. See Oracle , 593 U.S. at 32 (“[A] \nfinding that copying was not commercial in nature  tips the scales in favor of fair use.”). Or \nplaintiffs whose works are unlikely to face meaningful competition from AI -generated ones  may \nbe unable to defeat a fair use defense.   Case 3:23-cv-03417-VC     Document 598     Filed 06/25/25     Page 39 of 40 \n40 \nIn this case, because Meta’s use of the works of these thirteen authors  is highly \ntransformative, the plaintiffs needed to win decisively on the fourth  factor to win on fair use . See, \ne.g., Perfect 10 , 508 F.3d at 1168 (fair use where secondary use was “significant[ly] \ntransformative” and fourth factor “favor[ed] neither party”).  And to stave off summary judgment, \nthey needed to create a genuine issue of material fact as to that factor . Because the issue of \nmarket dilution is so important in this context, had the plaintiffs presented any evidence that a \njury could use to find in their favor on the issue, factor four would have needed to go to a jury.  \nOr perhaps the plaintiffs could even have  made a strong enough showing to win on the fair use \nissue at summary judgment.  But the plaintiffs presented no meaningful evidence on market \ndilution  at all . Absent such evidence  and in light of Meta’s evidence , the fourth factor can only \nfavor Meta.  Therefore, on this record,  Meta is entitled to summary judgment on  its fair use \ndefense to the claim that copying these plaintiffs’ books for use as LLM training data was \ninfringement.  \nAs previously noted, summary judgment will be granted for Meta  in a separate ruling  on \nthe plaintiffs’ DMCA claim. A Zoom case management conference is scheduled for July 11, \n2025 , at 10:00 a.m. to discuss how to proceed on the plaintiffs’ separate  claim  that Meta \nunlawfully distributed their protected works during the torrenting process.  \nIT IS SO ORDERED.  \nDated:  June 25, 2025  \n______________________________________  \nVINCE CHHABRIA  \nUnited States District Judge  \n Case 3:23-cv-03417-VC     Document 598     Filed 06/25/25     Page 40 of 40",

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: In this case, the plaintiffs, Sage Global Services Limited and Sage Software, Inc., accused the defendant, 4th Paradigm (Beijing) Technology Co., Ltd., of trademark infringement in connection with software and AI products using the SAGE mark. The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California granted the defendant’s motion to dismiss the case due to the lack of personal jurisdiction, as 4th Paradigm’s connections to California and the United States were found to be insufficient.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: The key legal issue was whether the U.S. District Court could exercise personal jurisdiction over 4th Paradigm, a Chinese company, based on its alleged business activities in California and the United States.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court held that it lacked personal jurisdiction over 4th Paradigm because the plaintiffs failed to demonstrate that 4th Paradigm had sufficient minimum contacts with California or the United States necessary to establish general or specific jurisdiction.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine a British and a U.S. company (Sage) are upset because they think a Chinese company (4th Paradigm) is using their brand name \"SAGE\" for its products in an unfair way. They wanted to bring the Chinese company to court in California, but the court said, \"We can't handle this case here because the Chinese company doesn't really do enough business or have strong enough ties to California or even the United States.\" Essentially, the court was saying, \"You can't sue them here because they aren't connected to California (or the U.S.) enough for us to have the power to judge this case.\"",

Id. at 55:14 -\n17. To the best of 4th Paradigm’s knowledge, the flyers it passed out at the CES Event \ndid not contain the term “Sage.” ECF 61 -5 at 8.  \nII. LEGAL STANDARD  \nUnder Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(2), a party may move to dismiss a pleading for \n“lack of personal jurisdiction.”  “Federal courts ordinarily follow state law in determining the bounds \nof their jurisdiction over persons.”  Walden v. Fiore , 571 U.S. 277, 283 (2014) (quoting Daimler AG \nv. Bauman , 571 U.S. 117, 125 (2014)).  California's long -arm statute is coextensive with federal due \nprocess requirements . See Schwarzenegger v. Fred Martin Motor Co. , 374 F.3d 797, 800 –801 (9th \nCir. 2004).  “Although a nonresident's physical presence within the territorial jurisdiction of the court \nis not required, the nonresident generally must have ‘certain minimum contacts .  . . such that the \nmaintenance of the suit does not offend tr aditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.’”  Case 5:23-cv-04534-BLF     Document 70     Filed 07/30/25     Page 5 of 18 \n6 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  Walden , 571 U.S. at 283 (quoting Int'l Shoe Co. v. Washington , 326 U.S. 310, 316 (1945)).  \nPersonal Jurisdiction may be either general or specific. General personal jurisdiction exists \nwhen the defendant's contacts “are so continuous and systematic as to render [it] essentially at home \nin the forum State.” Daimler , 571 U.S. at 127 (quotation marks and citation omitted). Specific \npersonal jurisdiction exists when the defendant's contacts with the forum state are more limited but \nthe plaintiff's claims arise out of or relate to those contacts.  Id. at 127 –28. \n “In opposition to a defendant's motion to dismiss for lack of  personal  jurisdiction, the \nplaintiff bears the burden of establishing that jurisdiction is proper.”  Boschetto v. Hansing , 539 F.3d \n1011, 1015 (9th Cir. 2008). Challenge  to personal  jurisdiction  under  Rule  12(b)(2)  may be based on \nmaterials outside the complaint.  Schwarzenegger v. Fred Martin Motor Co. , 374 F.3d 797, 800 (9th \nCir. 2004). “[I]n a factual attack, the challenger disputes the truth of the allegations that, by \nthemselves, would other wise invoke federal jurisdiction.” Safe Air for Everyone v. Meyer , 373 F.3d \n1035, 1039 (9th Cir. 2004). “In resolving a  factual  attack  on jurisdiction, the district court may \nreview evidence beyond the complaint without converting the motion to dismiss into a motion for \nsummary judgment.”  Id. “Although the plaintiff cannot simply rest on the bare allegations of its \ncomplaint, uncontroverted allegations in the complaint must be taken as true. Conflicts between \nparties over statements contained in affidavits must be resolved in the plaintiff ’s \nfavor.”  Schwarzenegger , 374 F.3d at 800  (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).  \nIII. DISCUSSION  \nA. General Jurisdiction  \nIn the opposition, Sage states that it “do[es] not contend that the Court has general personal \njurisdiction over [4th Paradigm].” Opp.  at 4 n.1.  As the Court previously found in the Order Granting \nDefendant’s Motion to Dismiss for Lack of Personal Jurisdiction Without Prejudice and Granting \nPlaintiffs’ Request to Conduct Jurisdictional Discovery, 4th Paradigm is not subject to general \njurisdiction in California because it is incorporated under Chinese law and maintains its principal \nplace of business in Chi na. ECF 55 at 4.  \nB. Specific Jurisdiction  \n4th Paradigm argues that , after jurisdiction discovery,  Sage has  still failed to establish that Case 5:23-cv-04534-BLF     Document 70     Filed 07/30/25     Page 6 of 18 \n7 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  the Court can exercise specific jurisdiction over 4th Paradigm. Mot. at 10. In response, Sage argues \nthat the Court can exercise personal jurisdiction over 4th Paradigm pursuant to California’s long -\narm statute, Cal. Civ. Proc. Code § 410.10 or the federal long -arm statute, Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(k)(2). \nOpp.  at 3.  \nSpecific jurisdiction arises when a defendant's specific contacts with the forum state give \nrise or relate to the claim in question. Helicopteros Nacionales de Colombia S.A. v. Hall , 466 U.S. \n408, 414 –16 (1984). “A court exercises specific jurisdiction where the cause of action arises out of \nor has a substantial connection to the defendant's contacts with the forum.” Glencore Grain  \nRotterdam BV v. Shivnath Rai Harnarain Co. , 284 F.3d 1114, 1123 (9th Cir. 2002).  \n1. Personal Jurisdiction under California’s Long -Arm Statute  \nTo analyze specific personal jurisdiction, courts “consider the extent of the defendant’s \ncontacts with the forum and the degree to which the plaintiff’s suit is related to those contacts.” \nYahoo! Inc. v. La Ligue Contre Le Racisme Et L'Antisemitisme , 433 F.3d 1199, 1210 (9th Cir. 2006). \nThe Ninth Circuit has established a three -prong test for whether a court can exercise specific \npersonal jurisdiction over a non -resident defendant: (1) the defendant “must purposefully direct his \nactivities or consummate so me transaction with the forum or resident thereof; or perform some act \nby which he purposefully avails himself of the privilege of conducting activities in the forum, \nthereby invoking the benefits and protections of its laws”; (2) “the claim must be one wh ich arises \nout of or relates to the defendant's forum -related activities”; and (3) “the exercise of jurisdiction \nmust comport with fair play and substantial justice, i.e. it must be reasonable.” Schwarzenegger , \n374 F.3d at 802. The plaintiff bears the burd en on the first two prongs. Id. “If the plaintiff fails to \nsatisfy either of these prongs, personal jurisdiction is not established in the forum state.” Id. “If the \nplaintiff succeeds in satisfying both of the first two prongs, the burden then shifts to the defendant \nto present a compelling case that the exercise of jurisdiction would not be reasonable.” Id. (internal \nquotation marks and citation omitted).  \na. Purposeful Direction  \nThe first prong of the analysis asks whether a defendant has “purposefully direct[ed] his \nactivities or consummate[d] some transaction with the forum or resident thereof; or perform[ed] Case 5:23-cv-04534-BLF     Document 70     Filed 07/30/25     Page 7 of 18 \n8 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  some act by which he purposefully avails himself of the privilege of conducting activities in the \nforum, thereby invoking the benefits and protections of its laws.” Schwarzenegger , 374 F.3d at 802.  \n“Purposeful direction” and “purposeful availment” are two different concepts, the former most often \nused in suits sounding in tort and the latter in suits sounding in contract. Id. Here, a purposeful \ndirection analysis is most appropriate because this action involves a dispute over possible trademark \ninfringement , which is most analogous to a tort. Deal Point Trading v. Standard Process, Inc. , 2020 \nWL 6106617, at *3 (S.D. Cal. Apr. 20, 2020) (trademark infringement).  \nUnder the purposeful direction test, “a defendant purposefully directed his activities at the \nforum if he : ‘(1) committed an intentional act, (2) expressly aimed at the forum state, (3) causing \nharm that the defendant knows is likely to be suffered in the forum state. ’ ” Picot v. Weston , 780 \nF.3d 1206, 1212 (9th Cir. 2015) ( quoting  Calder v. Jones , 465 U.S. 783 (1984)).  The analysis of \nthese factors must focus on the “defendant’s contacts with the forum state itself, not the defendant’s \ncontacts with persons who reside there.” Walden v. Fiore , 134 S. Ct. 1115, 1122 (2014). “[M]ere \ninjury to a forum resident is not a sufficient connection to the forum. . . . The proper question is not \nwhere the plaintiff experienced a particular injury or effe ct but whether the defendant’s conduct \nconnects him to the forum in a meaningful way.” Id. at 1125.  \ni. Intentional Acts  \nAn “intentional act” is “an actual, physical act in the real world” that the actor has the “intent \nto perform.” Schwarzenegger , 374 F.3d at 806. The Court finds  that the Sage has identified contacts \nthat are “intentional acts”  in the FAC.   \nIn the FAC , Sage alleges the following acts by 4th Paradigm : 1) 4th Paradigm has sold its \nsoftware solutions and services to businesses throughout California, FAC ¶ 21; 2) 4th Paradigm has \nbusiness relationships with companies based in the United States, id. ¶¶ 22 -23; 3) in January 2020, \n4th Paradigm attended the Consumer Electronics Show (the “CES Event”) in Las Vegas, Nevada, \nwhere 4th Paradigm marked its products under the SAGE Mark at the event, id. ¶¶ 24 -26; 4) in \nDecember 2020, 4th Paradigm announced an agreement with the California -based Yescom to install \nand deploy 4th Paradigm’s Sage EE platform for Yescom in California, id. ¶ 28; 5) 4th Paradigm \nhas received significant investments from investment firms and financial institutions in the United Case 5:23-cv-04534-BLF     Document 70     Filed 07/30/25     Page 8 of 18 \n9 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  States, id. ¶ 29; 6) in August 2020, 4th Paradigm participated in the KDD Cup in San Diego and co -\nsponsored a competition with Stanford University and Google at the KDD Cup, id. ¶ 30; 7) 4th \nParadigm has received several awards and recognition from industry groups based in the United \nStates, including an award from the IDSA for 4th Paradigm’s Sage AIOS operating system in 2022, \nid. ¶ 31; 8) 4th Paradigm’s CEO Day Wenyuan stated in an interview with Bloomberg in June 2024 \nthat 4th Paradigm has U.S. companies as its cust omers, id. ¶ 33; and 9) at least three business left \nreviews on Gartner’s website stating that they purchased 4th Paradigm’s SAGE -branded products \nand deployed those products in the United States, id. ¶ 34.  \nAs a result of jurisdictional discovery, 4th Paradigm has submitted evidence that directly \ncontradicts some of Sage’s allegations : 1) 4th Paradigm received investments from Sequoia Capital \nChina and Goldman Sachs Asia team. See ECF 61 -4, Rutowski Decl., Ex. C., Deposition of Chai \nYifei, at 46:15 -47:15; 2) 4th Paradigm does not work with any American research institutions, id. \nat 47:16 -48:5; 3) 4th Paradigm never delivered any products under the Sage mark to any customers \nin California, id. at 13:17 -23, 15:5 -10, 62:14 -18, 70:2 -16; 4) the Yescom Agreement was never \ncarried out and no services or software were provided under the Yescom Agreement , id.  at 38:22 -\n25; 42:8 -9; 5) 4th Paradigm’s participation in the KDD Cup did not involve any Sage branded \nproducts, id. at 49:10 -20; 6) 4th Paradigm’s UI design team communicated remotely with the IDSA \nto receive the award for its Sage AIOS operating system in 2022, id. at 52:16 -53:5; 7) 4th Paradigm \nattended the CES Event in Nevada in 2020, id. at 55:14 -17.  \nWhile  some of  Sage’s allegations are undermined  by evidence from jurisdictional discovery, \nthe Court finds that Sage has met its burden of establishing that 4th Paradigm performed “intentional \nacts.”  \nii. Expressly Aimed at the Forum  \nThe intentional contact must be “expressly aimed at the forum state.” Life360, Inc.  v. \nAdvanced Ground Info. Sys., Inc. , 2015 WL 5612008, at *6 (N.D. Cal. Sept. 21, 2015). The analysis \nfocuses on the “defendant’s contacts with the forum state itself, not the defendant’s contacts with \nthe persons who reside there.” Walden , 571 U.S. at 285 .  \n4th Paradigm argue s that the allegations in the  FAC  are still not sufficient to satisfy the Case 5:23-cv-04534-BLF     Document 70     Filed 07/30/25     Page 9 of 18 \n10 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  “express aiming” prong. Mot. at 15. In response, Sage argues that it has alleged sufficient facts \nsupporting that 4th Paradigm has purposefully directed its activities to California. Opp. at 5.  \nThe Court finds that Sage has failed to make a prima facie case establishing that 4th \nParadigm “purposefully direct[s]” its activities to California or that Sage’s claims arise out of or \nrelate to such contacts.  As to 4th Paradigm’s received investments from the United States, Compl. \n¶¶ 5, 29, jurisdictional discovery shows that 4th Paradigm did not engage in investment discussions \nin Californi a, but instead  received those investments from Goldman Sachs Asia and Sequoia’s China \nbranch. ECF 39 -1 at 9; ECF 61 -4, Rutowski Decl., Ex. C., Deposition of Chai Yifei, at 46:15 -48:5; \nsee X Corp. v.  Ctr. for Countering Digital Hate Ltd. , 724 F. Supp. 3d 921, 941 (N.D. Cal. 2024) \n(“[M]erely receiving generalized donations from California donors, and not aiming any activity at \nthe forum specifically, cannot confer jurisdiction.”).  \nAs to 4th Paradigm’s collaboration with research institutions in this District, Compl. ¶ 5, \njurisdictional discovery shows 4th Paradigm does not collaborate with Stanford or any research \ninstitution in the United States. ECF 61 -4, Rutowski Decl. Ex C., Dep osition of Chai Yifei, at 47:16 -\n48:5.  Absent evidentiary support, Sage’s general allegations of 4th Paradigm’s connection to \nresearch institutions based in California are insufficient to establish that 4th Paradigm’s acts \n“expressly aimed” at California. Medimpact Healthcare Sys., Inc. v. IQVIA Holdings Inc. , No. 19 -\ncv-01865, 2020 WL 1433327, at *12 (S.D. Cal. Mar. 24, 2020) (holding that the establishment of a \njoint venture with a California -based plaintiff is insufficient to show defendant ’s act  expressly aimed \nat California).  \n As to 4th Paradigm’s business relationship with U.S. companies, Compl. ¶¶ 22 -23, 33, \njurisdictional  discovery shows that, other than the Yescom Agreement , 4th Paradigm’s business \nrelationship s are with those companies’  Chinese branch es or subsidiar ies in China. See ECF 61-4, \nRutowski Decl., Ex. C., Deposition of Chai Yifei, at 30:23 -31:24, 33:19 -35:24 (stating that 4th \nParadigm’s customers include Starbucks China, Burger King’s Chinese company, Yum China (the \nChinese operator of KFC), Mazda’s Chinese team, NBA China, L’O real China, and AB InBev. \nChina).  As to 4th Paradigm’s Yescom Agreement involving the sale of 4th Paradigm’s software \nsolutions and products in California, the agreement was negotiated in China, in Chinese, and Case 5:23-cv-04534-BLF     Document 70     Filed 07/30/25     Page 10 of 18 \n11 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  contained a clause that the agreement was to be governed by relevant Chinese law. ECF 39 -1, Chai \nYifei Decl., ¶ 5. Jurisdictional discovery also confirms that the  relationship was terminated before \nany products or services were provided  to Yescom. Id.; ECF 61 -4, Rutowski Decl., Ex. C., \nDeposition of Chai Yifei, at 37:17 -20, 38:22 -25, 42:8 -9, 44:10 -13. The Court finds the Yescom \nAgreement is insufficient to establish that 4th Paradigm expressly aimed at California. See Walden , \n571 U.S. at 285 (personal juris diction analysis focuses on the “defendant’s contacts with the forum \nstate itself, not the defendant’s contacts with the persons who reside there”); Boschetto v. Hansing , \n539 F.3d 1011, 1019 (9th Cir. 2008) (emphasizing that a one -time contract or isolated transaction \ndoes not create a substantial connection or ongoing obligations with the forum state). Accordingly, \nthe Court finds that those allegations are insufficient to establish 4th Paradigm conducted an \nintentional act that aimed at California. See Sc hwarzenegger , 374 F.3d at 802 .  \nAs to 4th Paradigm’s participation in the KDD Cup in San Diego and the IDSA competition, \nFAC ¶ 30 -31, the Court finds that those contacts were  not expressly aimed at California. \nJurisdictional discovery shows that the KDD Cup “is an algorithm or model competition” that does \nnot involve commercialized SAGE products. ECF 61 -4, Rutowski Decl., Ex. C., Deposition of Chai \nYifei, at 49:10 -20. As to the IDSA competition, jurisdictional discovery shows that 4th Paradigm’s \nUI design tea m participated in the competition remotely. Id. at 52:16 -53:5. The Court finds that this \nevidence does not show 4th Paradigm connect ed to California “in a meaningful way.” Walden 571 \nU.S. 277 at 29 0; see Davis  v. Cranfield Aerospace Sols., Ltd. , 71 F.4th 1154, 1162 (9th Cir. 2023) \n(holding a defendant cannot be “haled into a jurisdiction solely as a result of random, fortuitous, or \nattenuated contacts.”).  \nAs to the third -party reviews of 4th Paradigm’s SAGE -branded products on Gartner’s \nwebsite, FAC ¶ 34, the Court previously found those reviews do not support an inference that \ninfringing products were sold in California. ECF 55 at 6. Jurisdictional discovery has not established  \nanything to the contrary.  See Rutowski Decl. Ex. C at 44:10 -13 (“[4th Paradigm has] never issued \na product license to the United  States under the Sage mark.”).  Sage argues that, because 4th \nParadigm “has no response for how these deployments of [4th Paradigm’s] SAGE -branded products \nand services in the United States took place,” the Court should resolve this disputed fact in Sage’s Case 5:23-cv-04534-BLF     Document 70     Filed 07/30/25     Page 11 of 18 \n12 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  favor. Opp. at 8, 12. The  Court notes that Sage acknowledges that “[t]here is, admittedly, not much \nevidence on this point.” Opp. at 12. Here, jurisdictional discovery shows that 4th Paradigm did not \n“intentionally sell a Sage product to a California, United States, customer,” and 4th Paradigm would \nnot have known if a customer used the product in the United States. ECF 64 -2, Weinberger Decl., \nEx. A at 59:17 -60:10. Resolving  this disputed fact in Sage’s favor  still does not show intentional \nconduct by 4th P aradigm expressly aimed at California. Rather, the deployment of any Sage -branded \nproduct by 4th Paradigm’s customers is at best unilateral activity of  a third party. See Walden , 571 \nU.S. at 284 (“[The] unilateral activity of another party or a third person is not an appropriate \nconsideration when determining whether a defendant has sufficient contacts with a forum State to \njustify an assertion of jurisdiction.”) (alteration in o riginal).  \nAs to 4th Paradigm ’s attendance at the CES Event in Las Vegas, Nevada in 2020, Sage \nalleges that 4th Paradigm promoted its SAGE -branded products and services at the CES Event, and \nits attendance was covered by news outlets that reach United States consumers. FAC ¶ 26; Opp. at \n6. Jurisdictional discovery shows that 4th Paradigm showed one SAGE device and one conceptual \ndesign at the CES Event. ECF 61 -5, Rutowski Decl., Ex. D, 4th Paradigm’s Suppl. Resp. and Objs. \nto Plaintiffs’ Jurisdictional Interrogs., at 6; Rutowski Decl. Ex. C at 55:14 -17, 62:23 -63:12. \nJurisdictional discovery also shows that, to 4th Paradigm’s best knowledge, the flyers distributed at \nthe CES Event “were a general introduction to 4 th Paradigm and did not use the term ‘Sage.’” ECF \n61-5, Rutowski Decl., Ex. D, at 8. As to Sage’s allegation on the news coverage on 4 th Paradigm’s \nattendance at the CES Event, the Court notes that the English article published on \nfashionnetwork.com does not mention “Sage” or “4th Paradigm” while the two article s published \non sohu.com and k.sina.com.cn are in Chinese. See ECF 61 -7, Rutowski Decl. Ex. F. The Court \nfinds that t his evidence  does not show  that 4th Paradigm expressly aimed at California  through its \nattendance at the CES Event five years ago in Nevada . See SDS Korea Co. v. SDS USA, Inc. , 732 F. \nSupp. 2d 1062, 1072 (S.D. Cal. 2010) (holding that defendant’s attendance of a trade show in Las \nVegas did not demonstrate conduct directed toward California despite approximately 2,400 \nCalifornia residents attended the trade show). The Court is not persuaded by Sage’s reliance on \nPortrait Displays  and Temming . Opp. at 9  (citing Portrait Displays, Inc. v. Speece , 04-CV-1501 Case 5:23-cv-04534-BLF     Document 70     Filed 07/30/25     Page 12 of 18 \n13 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  (RMW), 2004 WL 1964506, at *6 (N.D. Cal. Sept. 3, 2004) and Temming v. Summus Holdings, \nLLC, 21 -CV-4858 (LB) , 2021 WL 5014854, at *5 (N.D. Cal. Oct. 28, 2021)). In both cases, the \nCourt found personal jurisdiction over defendants who attended a trade show in California. See \nPortrait Displays , 2004 WL 1964506, at *6; Temming , 2021 WL 5014854, at *1, 5. Unlike those \ncases, 4th Paradigm attended the CES Event in Nevada.  \nThe Court is also unpersuaded by Sage’s argument that the effect of 4th Paradigm’s \nattendance at the CES Event was felt in California,  and that 4th Paradigm knew that promoting its \nSAGE -branded products at the CES Event “would resonate in California.” Opp. at 9.  Under the \neffects test, “purposeful availment of the privilege of conducting activities in the forum state can be \nmet by the ‘purposeful direction of a foreign act having effect in the forum state.’” CE Distribution, \nLLC v. New Sensor Corp. , 380 F.3 d 1107, 1111 (9th Cir. 2004) (quoting Harris Rutsky & Co. Ins. \nServs., Inc. v. Bell & Clements Ltd.,  328 F.3d 1122, 1130 (9th Cir.2003)). In CE Distribution , the \ndefendant had a business relationship with plaintiff “spanning a period of several years,” was aware \nthat plaintiff was based in Arizona and was the sole distributor of Jensen speakers in the United \nStates. CE Distribution , 380 F.3d at 1111. Under these circumstances, considering plaintiff’s \nallegation that defendant intended to undermine plaintiff’s status as the sole distributor in the United \nStates, the Ninth Circuit found that defendant had “every reason to know that th e effect of the \ntransactions w ould resonate in Arizona.” Id. Unlike CE Distribution , here, Sage has not show n any \nevidence that would warrant an inference that 4th Paradigm knew that its attendance at the CES \nEvent in Nevada would cause harm to Sage  in California  years later . Indeed, Sage’s own corporate \nwitness testified that he could not identify any harm felt by Sage due to 4th Paradigm’s conduct. \nECF 61 -6, Rutowski Decl. Ex. E, Sage 30(b)(6) Dep. Tr., at 57:21 -58:14.  \nSage’s “convergence” theory also fails. Opp. at 11 -12. As discussed above, Sage still has \nnot alleged an intentional act by 4th Paradigm that was expressly aimed at California  that has not \nbeen undermined by jurisdictional discovery . The Court is unpersuaded by Sage’s reliance on \nSinatra . Opp. at 11 (citing Sinatra v. Nat’l Enquirer, Inc. , 854 F.2d 1191, 1195 (9th Cir. 1988)). In \nSinatra , the Ninth Circuit found the defendant directed its activities at California by advertising in \nCalifornia to promote its business and was aware that “its services were known to or used by Case 5:23-cv-04534-BLF     Document 70     Filed 07/30/25     Page 13 of 18 \n14 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  California clients.” Sinatra , 854 F.2d at 1197. Here, there is no evidence showing that the Yescom \ncontract , which was negotiated in China and entered  into in China,  had resulted  from 4th Paradigm’s \nattendance at the CES Event. Id. at 1195 (“[T]he solicitation of business in the forum state that \nresults in business being transacted or contract negotiations will probably be considered purposeful \navailment.”).  \nThe Court is also unpersuaded by Sage’s reliance on the “stream of commerce” theory. Opp. \nat 12. “Placing a product into the stream of commerce —even if the defendant is aware that the \nstream of commerce may or will sweep the product into the forum state —does not convert the mere \nact of placing the product into the stream of commerce into an act of purposeful availment.” LNS \nEnters. LLC v. Cont’l Motors, Inc. , 22 F.4th 852, 860 (9th Cir. 2022). As discussed above, \njurisdictional discovery does not show that 4th Paradigm established a distribution channel or sold \nits SAGE branded goods to California. See Pinkerton Tobacco Co. v. Art Factory AB , No. 2:20 -CV-\n01322 -SB-MRW, 2021 WL 541441, at * 2 (C.D. Cal. Jan. 28, 2021) ( holding the existence of at \nlease fifty -two infringing fans in the forum state did not support the inference that a distribution \nchannel was intentionally established).  \nAccordingly, the Court concludes that the second prong of the purposeful direction test is \nnot satisfied.  \niii. Causing Harm Likely to be Suffered in the Forum State  \n4th Paradigm argues  that harm in California was not foreseeable as Sage Global is a British \ncompany with its principal place of business in the United Kingdom and Sage Software is a Virginia \ncompany with its principal place of business in Georgia. Mot.  at 20 -21. In response, Sage argue s \nthat 4th Paradigm should have known that Sage would suffer harm because Silicon Valley is the \n“preeminent hub for software and technological innovation.” Opp. at 13.  \nThe Court finds that Sage has failed to satisfy its burden to show that 4th Paradigm’s alleged \nacts caused harm that 4th Paradigm knew was likely to be suffered by Sage in California. In the \nFAC , Sage alleges that Sage Global is a British company with its principal place of business in the \nUnited Kingdom and Sage Software is a Virginia corporation with its principal place of business in \nGeorgia. FAC ¶¶ 7 -8. Sage also alleges that it employs nearly 500 people in California with over Case 5:23-cv-04534-BLF     Document 70     Filed 07/30/25     Page 14 of 18 \n15 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  300 based in the San Jose office. FAC ¶ 46. Sage also alleges that , in fiscal year 2024,  sales in \nCalifornia accounted for over 10% of its sales revenue in the United States. Id. But Sage  is neither \nincorporated under California law nor maintains its principal place of business in California, and \nSage has not established that 4th Paradigm could have foreseen that Sage was likely to suffer harm \nin California . See X Corp. v. Ctr. for Countering Digital Hate Ltd. , 724 F. Supp. 3d 921 (N.D. Cal. \n2024) (“For jur isdictional purposes, a corporation incurs economic loss in the forum of its principal \nplace of business.”); Imageline, Inc. v. Hendricks , No. 09 -cv-01870, 2009 WL 10286181, at 4 \n(“[T]here is no evidence that Defendants, residents of Washington, would reasonably know that \nPlaintiff, a Virginia corporation, would be likely to suffer harm in California as a result of the \nallegedly infringing behavior such that Defendants would be subject to a lawsuit in California.”). \nIndeed , jurisdictional discovery shows th at Sage’s own corporate deponent did not have knowledge \nof 4th Paradigm and could not identify any harm that was felt by Sage due to 4th Paradigm’s \ninfringing conduct in the United  States. ECF 61 -6, Rutowski Decl., Ex. E, Deposition of Dan Miller, \n21:9-24, 57:21 -58:14. Sage’s reliance on Panavision and CollegeSource  is misplaced. Opp. at 13 \n(citing Panavision Int’l, L.P. v. Toeppen , 141 F.3d 1316, 1321 (9th Cir. 1998) and CollegeSource, \nInc. v. AcademyOne, Inc. , 653 F.3d 1066, 1079 (9th Cir. 2011)). In both  Panavision  and \nCollegeSource , the plaintiffs had their principal place of business in California. See Panavision , 141 \nF.3d at 1321; CollegeSource , 653 F.3d at 1079.  \nAccordingly, the Court concludes that the third prong of the purposeful direction test is not \nsatisfied.  \n* * *  \n Jurisdictional discovery overall favored 4th Paradigm’s positio n. Where Sage submitted \nsome evidence to refute 4th Paradigm’s evidence, the Court has credited Sage’s allegations, but \nmany of Sa ge’s allegations have been successfully refuted. Even so, on balance,  the Court finds that \nSage has failed to establish that 4th Paradigm conducted an intentional act aimed at California. \nBecause Sage has not met its burden to satisfy the first prong of the personal jurisdiction test, the \nCourt need  not reach the sec ond and third prongs of the test. See Axiom Foods, Inc. v. Acerchem \nInt'l, Inc. , 874 F.3d 1064, 1068 -69 (9th Cir. 2017).  Case 5:23-cv-04534-BLF     Document 70     Filed 07/30/25     Page 15 of 18 \n16 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  2. Personal Jurisdiction under Federal Long -Arm Statute Under Fed. R. Civ. \nP. 4(k)  \nWhere an international defendant has insufficient contacts with a particular state to warrant \njurisdiction, Federal Rule  of Civil Procedure  4(k)(2) provides a basis for establishing jurisdiction if \n“the United States serves as the relevant forum for a minimum contacts analysis.” Pebble Beach Co. \nv. Caddy , 453 F.3d 1151, 1154 (9th Cir. 2006) (citation omitted). Under Rule 4(k)(2), personal \njurisdiction is proper where (1) the claim against the defendant arises under federal law, (2) the \ndefendant is not “subject to the personal jurisdiction of any state court of general jurisdiction,” and \n(3) “the federal court's exercise of personal jurisdiction must comport with due proce ss.” Id. at 1159.  \n“The due process analysis under Rule 4(k)(2) is nearly identical to the traditional personal \njurisdiction analysis with one significant difference: rather than considering contacts between the \n[defendants] and the forum state, we consider  contacts with the nation as a whole.” Holland Am. \nLine Inc. v. Wartsila N. Am., Inc. , 485 F.3d 450, 462 (9th Cir. 2007).  \n4th Paradigm argues that Sage fails to allege personal jurisdiction under Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(k) \nbecause the Complaint fails to allege “any activities related to its claims purposefully directed \nanywhere in the United  States.” Mot. at 25. In response, Sage argues that “the first two prongs are \nsatisfied because (1) this lawsuit arises under the Lanham Act . . .; and (2) Defendant has not \nidentified any state court of general jurisdiction to which it is subject to perso nal jurisdiction.” Opp. \nat 18. As to the third prong, Sage argues that 4th Paradigm sells its infringing products to consumers \nin the United States as evidenced by 4th Paradigm ’s placement  on the U.S. Department of \nCommerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security blacklist . Id. Sage also argues that 4th Paradigm has \ndeveloped su fficient “minimum contacts” because 4th Paradigm “places its products in a stream of \ncommerce that foreseeably . . . culminates in the United States.” Id.   \nThe Court agrees with Sage that the first two prongs of the test are satisfied. As to the first \nprong, here , Sage asserts a federal trademark infringement claim under 15 U.S.C. § 1114(1), FAC \n¶¶ 51 -58, and a federal unfair competition and false designation of origin claim under 15 U.S.C. § \n1125(a)(1)(A), FAC ¶¶ 59 -67. As to the second prong, 4th Paradigm does not identify  any statement  \nin which it would be subject to personal jurisdiction , and thus this requirement is met. Holland Am. Case 5:23-cv-04534-BLF     Document 70     Filed 07/30/25     Page 16 of 18 \n17 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  Line Inc. , 485 F.3d at 462.  \nAs to the third prong, the Court finds  that 4th Paradigm performed  the following acts directed \nto the United States: 1) in 2020, 4th Paradigm attended the CES Event in Las Vegas, Nevada, FAC \n¶¶ 24 -26; 2) in August 2020, 4th Paradigm participated in the KDD Cup held in San Diego, \nCalifornia, id. ¶ 30; 3) in 2022, 4th Paradigm participated in the IDSA competition, id. ¶ 31; and 4) \nin March 2023,  the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security blacklisted \n4th Paradigm and added 4th Paradigm to its “Entity List,” Id. ¶ 32. Nonetheless, the Court finds that \nthose contacts are “too insignificant to invoke nationwide jurisdiction.” Holland Am. Line Inc. , 485 \nF.3d at 462 . 4th Paradigm’s placement on the Entity List does not support an inference that it sells \nSage branded products to consumers in the United States. See 15 C.F.R. Part 744 (2023)  (exports, \nreexports  and selected transfers are restricted without a license for Listed Entities).  Instead, as \nconfirmed by jurisdictional discovery, 4th Paradigm does not sell SAGE -branded products to \ncustomers in the United States. ECF 61 -4, Rutowski Decl. Ex C at 15:5 -10, 29:8 -30:5, 30:23 -31:24, \n32:9-17, 33:19 -35:24. Jurisdictional discovery also shows that 4th Paradigm has never issued a \nproduct license in the United States under the Sage mark. Id. at 44:10 -13. Sage does not allege, and \nthe record does not show that 4th Pa radigm has any “offices, employees, or other related connections \nin the United  States. ” Holland Am. Line Inc. , 485 F.3d at 462. Thus, the Court finds that 4th \nParadigm’s contacts with the United  States are “scant, fleeting, and attenuated” and are insufficient \nto support a nationwide jurisdiction in the United  States. Holland Am. Line Inc. , 485 F.3d at 462  \n((holding that defendants’ contacts with the United States, including giving a presentation on a \ncruise ship, sponsoring a reception and dinner tables, and occasional visits to cruise ships and \nadvertising in various marine publications, “hardly constitut e significant contacts” and declining to \nexercise jurisdiction under Rule 4(k)(2)). The Court is also not persuaded by Sage’s argument that \nbecause 4th Paradigm placed its products in a stream of commerce, 4th Paradigm “has developed \nsufficient ‘minimum co ntacts’”  with the United States  because it could foresee its products would \nculminate in the United  States. Opp. at 18. Placing a product in the stream of commerce, “without \nmore,” is not sufficient to establish a purposeful act “directed toward a forum state.” Holland Am. \nLine Inc. , 485 F.3d at 459 (citing Asahi Metal Indus .

Opp. at 19 (citing Ayla, LLC v. Alya Skin Pty. \nLtd., 11 F.4th 972, 983 (9th Cir. 2021)). In Ayla, the Ninth Circuit found Alya Skin did “more than \nmerely place its products into the stream of commerce” based on the facts that: 1) Alya Skin’s sales \nto American consumers were “substantial;” 2) Alya Skin offered its products directly for sale to the \nUnite d States on its website; 3) Alya Skin contracted with a fulfilment center in Idaho to ship its \nproducts throug hout the United States; and 4)  as evidenced by  Alya Skin ’s purported FDA approval, \nAlya Skin  “sought out the benefits afforded by” regulatory regime in the United States. Id. at 981 -\n82.  Unlike Ayla, here, none of those contacts are present and any contacts between 4th Paradigm \nand the United States are at best “random, isolated, or fortuitous.” Id. at 981 (citing Keeton v. Hustler \nMagazine, Inc. , 465 U.S. 770, 774 (1984).  \nFor the above reasons, the Court GRANTS 4th Paradigm’s motion to dismiss on the grounds  \nthat Sage has failed to allege personal jurisdiction under Fed.

    "summary": "1. **Summary:** The opinion involves a discovery order regarding a lawsuit against Meta Platforms, Inc., where plaintiffs allege that Meta used copyrighted books in training its Llama AI models without permission. The court addressed various requests by plaintiffs concerning Meta's dataset usage, responses to requests for admission, and other discovery-related disputes. The case involves the use of AI as plaintiffs claim that Meta's large language models, such as Llama, were trained on datasets containing copyrighted works.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue:** Whether Meta improperly used copyrighted materials to train its AI models without authorization and the sufficiency of Meta's responses and objections in the discovery process.\n\n3. **Court's Holding:** The court granted in part and denied in part the plaintiffs' motions to compel Meta to provide proper responses to requests for admissions and production, focusing on the relevance and specificity of information requested. The court ordered Meta to amend responses on several points, including the inclusion of Llama 5 in discovery definitions, and compelled the provision of full documents instead of summaries or limited disclosures in certain requests.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation:** Imagine you have a robot that learns by reading lots of books. Some people are worried that the robot might have read books it's not supposed to without asking first. A group of people is asking the court to make sure the robot's owner tells them exactly which books it read and if the owner got permission. The court looked at these questions one by one and decided where the robot's owner must share more details and where they're okay as is.",

RFAs 3 -6, 17, 20, 23, 34, 43, 45 -89, 90 -96 \nRFAs 3 -6 asked Meta to admit that the datasets used to trained Llama 1, 2 and 3 and used \nor that will be used to train Llama 4 “included copyrighted books.”  For each, Meta “ admits that \ntext from a published and commercially -available version of one or more books is included in a \nDataset used to train Llama [1, 2 or 3 or that may be used to train Llama 4].  As Meta lacks \nknowledge as to whether that text also appeared in the deposit copies submitted to the U.S. \nCopyright Office, which delimits what is covered by the corresponding copyright registrations for \nthose books, Meta de nies this RFA.”  \nRFAs 17, 20 and 23 asked Meta to admit that three particular databases “contain[] \ncopyrighted works.”   For each Meta responded that it “ admits that text from a published and \ncommercially -available version of one or more books appears in the [name of database].  As Meta \nlacks knowledge as to whether that text also appeared in the deposit copies submitted to the U.S. \nCopyright Office, which delimit what is covered by the corresponding copyright registrations for \nthose works, Meta denies this RFA.”  Case 3:23-cv-03417-VC     Document 315     Filed 12/06/24     Page 1 of 12 \n2 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  RFA 34 asked Meta to admit that the publicly available data used to train the Llama \nmodels included copyrighted works.  RFA 43 asked Meta to admit that the Llama models that \nwere trained with copyrighted material had at least in part a commercial purpose.  Meta similarly \nadmitted that the data used to train the models included text from a published and commercially -\navailable version of one or more copyrighted works, but denied the RFA s on the ground that it \nlacked knowledge of whether the text appeared in t he deposit copies submitted to the U.S. \nCopyright Office.   \nRFAs 45-89 asked Meta to “[a]dmit that the Books3 database contains” specific works by \nPlaintiffs.  In each response, Meta says that it “Meta lacks information sufficient to admit or deny \nthat [name of book], which is the subject of [name of Plaintiff’s]  claim and allegedly subject to \ncopyright protection, is contained in the Books3 dataset because Meta does not possess, and \nPlaintiffs failed to produce, the deposit copy for [name of book]  submitted to the U.S. Copyright \nOffice, which delimits what is cover ed by the corresponding copyright registration.  Meta admits \nthat text from a published and commercially -available version of [name of book]  is included in the \ndataset commonly known as Books3.  As Meta lacks knowledge as to whether that text is also \nincluded in the deposit copy for this work, Meta denies this RFA.”  \nRFAs 90 -96 asked Meta to “[a]dmit that [name of book] by [plaintiff] was included in a \ndataset used to train Your large language models.”  For RFAs 90, 91, 94 and 96, Meta states that it \n“lacks information sufficient to admit or deny that [name of book] , which is the subject of [name \nof plaintiff’s]  claim and allegedly subject to copyright protection, is contained in a dataset used to  \ntrain Meta’s large language models because [name of plaintiff]  has not produced, and Meta does  \nnot possess, the deposit copy  for [name of book]  submitted to the U.S. Copyright Office, which \ndelimits  what is covered by the corresponding copyright registration.  Meta admits that text from a \npublished  and commercially -available version of [name of book]  is included in a dataset used to \ntrain Meta’s  large language models, as that term is construed above.  As Meta lacks knowledge as \nto whether that text (or all of that text) is also included in the deposit copy for this work, Meta \ndenies this RFA. ”  For RFAs 92, 93 and 95, Meta does not respond at all, objecting that those \nbooks are not at issue in this action.  Case 3:23-cv-03417-VC     Document 315     Filed 12/06/24     Page 2 of 12 \n3 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  For all of these RFAs, Plaintiffs argue that Meta’s objection that it does not know if a work \nis copyrighted because it does not have the deposit copy is meritless.  Plaintiffs argue that publicly \navailable information about a copyright, such as a registra tion or a copyright notice, is prima facie \nevidence of knowledge, and can be evidence of willfulness.  Plaintiffs cite cases holding that a \nplaintiff need not produce a deposit copy to prove copyright ownership or infringement.  Plaintiffs \nask the Court to  order Meta to drop its “deposit copy” objections.  Meta, by contrast, argues that \nthe deposit copies define the boundaries of what is copyrighted.  As Meta says that it does not \nhave the deposit copies, Meta says that it cannot determine whether the works in question are \ncopyrighted.  \nMeta is wrong.  All or nearly all of the books at issue that were written since the Copyright \nAct of 1976 took effect are copyrighted.1  Do you know why?  Because they are books.  “ The \nCopyright Act of 1976 made copyright automatic upon fixation of a work in a tangible medium, \nand that regime persists today, meaning mandatory deposit remains unnecessary to gain \ncopyright. ”  Valancourt Books, LLC v. Garland , 82 F.4th 1222, 1233  (D.C. Cir. 2023); see also \nGeorgia v. Publ ic.Resource.Org, Inc. , 590 U.S. 255, 275 (2020) (“ Unlike other forms of \nintellectual property, copyright protection is both instant and automatic.  It vests as soon as a work \nis captured in a tangible form, triggering a panoply of exclusive rights that can last over a \ncentury. ”); 17 U.S.C. § 102(a) (“ Copyright protection subsists, in accordance with this title, in \noriginal works of authorship fixed in any tang ible medium of expression, now known or later \ndeveloped, from which they can be perceived, reproduced, or otherwise communicated, either \ndirectly or with the aid of a machine or device. ”).  It is telling that Meta’s argument to the contrary \nrelies on two cases that applied the Copyright Act of 1909.  See Skidmore v. Led Zeppelin , 952 \nF.3d 1051, 1064 (9th Cir. 2020); Structured Asset Sales, LLC v. Sheeran , 559 F. Supp. 3d 172, \n174 (S.D.N.Y. 2021).  \nIt is true that, in general, a copyright registration is required in order to file a civil action \n \n1 There are some exceptions for materials that cannot be copyrighted.  See, e.g., \nPublic.Resource.Org , 590 U.S. at 259 (government edicts doctrine); Feist Publications, Inc. v. \nRural Telephone Service Co., Inc. , 499 U.S. 340, 362 (1991) (telephone white pages not original \nor creative).

But these RFAs do not ask about copyright \nregistrations .   RFAs 3-6, 17, 20, 23, 34 and 43  ask about “copyrighted books,” “copyrighted \nworks,” and “copyrighted material.”  Half a century ago Congress amended the Copyright Act to \nprovide that a copyright and a copyright registration are different things.  RFAs 3-6, 17, 20, 23, 34 \nand 43  ask about copyrights, and Meta is not a llowed to answer in terms of registrations.  For \nthese RFAs , Meta can deny based on its “deposit copy” objection only if it has a good faith belief \nthat all of the works at issue in each RFA were written before the Copyright Act of 1976 took \neffect .  For works written after the Copyright Act of 1976 took effect, whether the works  are \nregistered and what the deposit copies are have simply nothing to do with whether the works are \ncopyrighted.   \nFurther, Meta’s “deposit copy” objection is frivolous as to RFAs 45 -89, 90, 91, 94 and 96.  \nNot only did those RFAs not ask about registrations, they didn’t ask about copyrights either.  \nRFAs 45 -89 asked Meta to admit that the Books3 database contains particular works.  And RFAs \n90, 91, 94 and 96 asked Meta to admit that particular books were in the datasets used to train large \nlanguage models.  Meta’s answers about copyright protection, registrations and deposit copies \nhave nothing to do with the RFAs.  Fu rther, i f you parse through all the legalese in Meta’s \nresponses, you can figure out that despite the uniform denials, the answer in every case is actually \nyes.  Meta is being evasive and did not answer these RFAs as required.   \nThe Court GRANTS  Plaintiffs’ motion to compel as to RFAs 3 -6, 17, 20 -, 23, 34, 43, 45 -\n89, 90, 91, 94 and 96.  The Court DENIES  Plaintiffs’ motion as to RFAs 92, 93 and 95, as Meta \ndid not make the “deposit copy” objection in those responses, and Plaintiffs did not brief Meta’s \nactual objection (i.e., that the particular work asked about is not at issue in this lawsuit).  \n2. RFAs 8, 9, 18, 21, 24, 10 -13, 1  \na. RFAs 8, 9, 18, 21, 24  \nThese RFAs asked Meta to admit that it did not obtain permission from Plaintiffs or \ncompensate Plaintiffs to do certain things, and that Meta was not authorized by all copyright \nowners to do certain things.  In each response, Meta stated that it did not se ek, obtain, or need  Case 3:23-cv-03417-VC     Document 315     Filed 12/06/24     Page 4 of 12 \n5 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  permission, to compensate, or authorization.   \nThe Court agrees with Plaintiffs that Meta has improperly refused to answer the RFAs as \nwritten and instead rewrote them .  Plaintiffs did not ask Meta for its opinion about what it needed \nto do.  The Court GRANTS  Plaintiffs’ motion to compel as to these RFAs and ORDERS  Meta to \nremove the language about what it needed or didn’t need to do from its responses.  \nb. RFAs 10 -13 \nThese RFAs asked Meta to “[a]dmit that You have made Llama [1, 2, 3, 4] available for \nuse by Third Parties.”  For RFAs 10 -12, Meta states:  “ Meta admits that it has made Llama [1, 2, \n3] available for use by Third Parties under certain circumstances and subject to certain terms and \nrestrictions.  Except as expressly admitted, Meta denies the Request.”  For RFA 13, Meta admits \n“that it currently intends to make Llama 4 available for use by Third Parties at some point in the \nfuture under certain circumstances and subject to certain terms and restrictions.  Except as \nexpressly admitted, Meta denies the Request.”  \nPlaintiffs ask the Court to order Meta to remove the language about certain circumstances \nand subject to certain terms and conditions.  The Court DENIES  Plaintiffs’ motion to compel as to \nthese RFAs because these RFAs as written are vague.  Meta’s qualifying language is appropriate.  \nc. RFA 1  \nThis RFA asked Meta to “[a] dmit that Meta created and maintains the large language \nmodels known as Llama.”  Meta responded that it “admits that it created a family of generative \nartificial intelligence (‘AI’) large language models known under variations of the ‘Llama’ name \n(i.e., Ll ama 1, Llama 2, Llama 3), which Meta released under open source licenses.  Except as \nexpressly admitted, Meta denies the Request.”  \nPlaintiffs object to Meta’s reference to releasing the LLMs under open source licenses, \nwhich they say is not responsive to the RFA.  Meta argues that that the models were released \nunder open source licenses and therefore that users can fine -tune, distill and deploy the models \nanywhere.  \nThe Court GRANTS  Plaintiffs’ motion to compel as to this RFA.  Meta’s response \nanswers the question about creation, but Meta’s answer does not say whether or not Meta Case 3:23-cv-03417-VC     Document 315     Filed 12/06/24     Page 5 of 12 \n6 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  maintains the models.  Meta must answer that part of the RFA.  If Meta maintains the models, but \nit does not exclusively maintain them, it would be an appropriate qualification to say who else also \nmaintains them.  If the open source licenses mean that others maintain the models, Meta has to say \nthat.  The current reference to open source licenses has nothing to do with the RFA.  \n3. RFA 7  \nThis RFA asked Meta to “[a] dmit that You did not obtain permission or consent from the \nrelevant copyright owners to use all copyrighted books in the Datasets used to train Llama \nModels.”  Meta responds that it “is unable to respond to this Request and on that basis denies the \nRequest. Meta is willing to meet and confer to understand how to interpret this Request.”  \nPlaintiffs seek an order compelling a response.  Meta claims that “[i] t is wholly unclear \nwhat is  meant by ‘relevant copyright owners ’ and ‘all copyrighted books. ’  Among other things, is \nthis limited to registered copyrights in the US? ” \nThe Court GRANTS  Plaintiffs’ motion to compel as to this RFA.  It is perfectly clear.  \nThe relevant copyright owners are the ones who own the copyrights to the books in the datasets \nused to train Llama model s.  The copyrighted books are the ones in those datasets.  Since this case \narises under U.S. copyright law, the reference to copyrights means copyrights under U.S. law.  \nAnd no, this RFA is not limited to registered copyrights.  Half a century  ago Congress rewrote the \nCopyright Act to extend protection t o works of authorship fixed in any tangible medium of \nexpression.  Th ose are the copyrights this RFA is asking about.  \n4. Llama 5  \nPlaintiffs say that for the same reasons as stated in their letter brief in ECF No. 294, Meta’s \ninterpretation of “Llama Models” to exclude Llama 5 in its RFA responses is improper.  Meta \nstates that Llama 5 is far out in the future and RFAs about it are s peculative and hypothetical.   The \nCourt agrees with Plaintiffs and ORDER S Meta to include Llama 5 in the term “Llama Models.”  \nOf course, if the answer to any particular RFA is different for Llama 5 than it is for the earlier \nLlama models, Meta can say tha t in its responses.  Case 3:23-cv-03417-VC     Document 315     Filed 12/06/24     Page 6 of 12 \n7 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  B. ECF No. 294 (Plaintiffs’ Requests for Production)  \n1. Definitions  \na. “Llama Models”  \nPlaintiffs argue that Llama 5 is relevant.  They do not make that argument in connection \nwith any particular RFP.  Meta’s position is unclear.  Meta says that Llama 5 is even more nascent \nthan Llama 4, which is still under development.  But Meta also says that it is not withholding \nresponsive materials on the ground that they concern Llama 5.  Meta says that its search terms to \nidentify responsive documents are not limited to specific Llama models.  \nThe Court agrees with Plaintiffs that Llama 5 is relevant and ORDERS  that Meta may not \ndecline to produce otherwise responsive documents on the ground that they concern Llama 5.  \nb. “Shadow Datasets”  \nRFP 81 asked for “[a] ll Documents and Communications related to the decision to use \nShadow Datasets for  training Llama Models. ”  Plaintiffs define the term “Shadow Datasets” as the \ntype of databases described in paragraph 37 of the Complaint, which alleges “ Bibliotik is one of a \nnumber of notorious ‘shadow library’ websites that also includes Library Genesis (aka LibGen), \nZ-Library (aka B -ok), Sci -Hub, and Anna’s Archive.  The books and other materials aggregated \nby these websites have also been available in bulk via torrent systems.  These shadow libraries \nhave long been of interest to th e AI-training community because of the large quantity of \ncopyrighted material they host.  For that reason, these shadow libraries are also flagrantly illegal.”  \nPlaintiffs complain that Meta’s response to RFP 81 is limited to the specific examples of \nShadow Datasets that Plaintiffs identified, when they said “including but not limited to” the \nspecific examples.  Meta says it doesn’t know what the “Shadow Datasets” are other than as \nidentified by Plaintiffs.  Meta adds that it has disclosed all datasets that were used for Llama 1, 2 \nand 3 and has produced documents sufficient to show various other datasets that hav e been or are \nbeing considered for use with future m odels.  \nRule 34 requires an RFP to “describe with particularity each item or category of items to \nbe inspected . . .”  Fed. R. Civ. Proc. 34(b)(1)(A).  Whether a dataset is a Shadow Dataset appears \nto depend on whether it is a notorious shadow library, which sound s like a matter of opinion.  And Case 3:23-cv-03417-VC     Document 315     Filed 12/06/24     Page 7 of 12 \n8 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  the question is not whether Meta thinks that the dataset is notorious , because Plaintiffs seem to be \nasking Meta about datasets that other people think are notorious.  Nor is this a situation where a \nlitigant is being asked to use common sense and interpret terms the way a regular person would, as \nthe typical person has likely never heard of these things and probably has no opinions about them .  \nThere is apparently some specialized community in which people have opinions about which \ndatasets are notorious s hadow library websites.  The Court thinks that the “including but not \nlimited to” portion of the definition of Shadow Data sets does not describe anything with \nparticularity.  It’s too much to ask Meta to guess what opinions some specialized community has \nabout certain websites.  As Meta has disclosed all the datasets that were used for Llama 1, 2 and 3, \nPlaintiffs can tell Meta which of those are Shadow Datasets.  Plaintiffs’ motion to compel is \nDENIED  on this issue.  \nc. “Agreements”  \nRFP 91 asked for “[a] ll Documents and Communications related to any licensing \nagreements for Llama Models,  including terms, conditions, and consideration. ”  RFP 130 asked \nfor “[a] ll Documents and Communications, including discussions, deliberations, or negotiations  \nrelated to any actual, proposed, or contemplated licensing agreements (even if never written or  \nexecuted) for AI training data, including any actual, proposed, or contemplated terms, conditions,  \nand consideration. ” \nPlaintiffs complain that Meta interprets the word “agreement” in both RFPs to mean only \nwritten contracts.  Meta states that from the outset of discovery, Plaintiffs have defined \n“agreements” broadly to encompass, among other things, any oral contract, arrangement or \nunderstanding, whether formal or informal.  Meta has objected and complains that Plaintiffs have \nnot explained how there will be documents about oral agreements or understandings, let alone \ninformal ones.  \nThe Court GRANTS  Plaintiffs’ motion to compel on this issue.  Meta cannot unilaterally \nlimit the meaning of “agreements” to written contracts.  It can also include oral contracts, \narrangements or understandings, whether formal or informal.  If there are any such things, i nternal \ncompany communications could easily refer to them.  Plaintiffs do not need to prove the existence Case 3:23-cv-03417-VC     Document 315     Filed 12/06/24     Page 8 of 12 \n9 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  of something to ask for it in discovery.  \n2. Relevance Objections  \na. RFP 114  \nThis RFP seeks documents related to Meta’s partnerships with celebrities whose voices are \nused to train Meta’s AI chatbot.  Plaintiffs say these documents are relevant to fair use.  Meta says \nthese documents are irrelevant because they relate to publicity rights.  The Court agrees with \nMeta.  The use of celebrity likenesses, including their voice, is governed by the right of publicity; \nthe subject matter of these documents is distinct from copyright.  The Court DENIES  Plaintiffs’ \nmotion to compel as to RFP 114. \nb. RFP 115  \nThis RFP seeks documents related to Meta’s decision not to release its newest AI models \nto the European Union, which Plaintiffs say is because of EU data privacy regulations.  The Court \nDENIES  Plaintiffs’ motion to compel as to RFP 115.  Meta’s response to EU regulations is a \nlarge subject that will sweep in many documents, but it has little or nothing to do with this case, so \nthis discovery is not proportional to the needs of the case.  \nc. RFP 117  \nThis RFP seeks documents about Meta’s decision not to publicly disclose the databases it \nuses to train more recent Llama models.  Plaintiffs says this decision was likely made because the \ntraining databases contain pirated versions of copyrighted works.  M eta says this decision has no \nrelevance to the case, and that Plaintiffs’ theory for why this decision was made is conclusory \nspeculation.  \nThe Court DENIES  Plaintiffs’ motion to compel RFP 117.  Meta’s decision not to publicly \ndisclose the databases it uses to train Llama models is not by itself relevant to the case.  The \nsuggestion that responsive documents will yield damaging admissions that would be relevant to \nthe case is entirely speculative.  \n3. “Sufficient to Show” Limitations  \na. RFP 91  \nThis RFP sought “[a] ll Documents and Communications related to any licensing Case 3:23-cv-03417-VC     Document 315     Filed 12/06/24     Page 9 of 12 \n10 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  agreements for Llama Models,  including terms, conditions, and consideration. ”  Meta’s response \nis limited to documents “sufficient to show” any agreements entered by Meta to license use of the \nLlama models.  Plaintiffs object to the “sufficient to show” limitation.   \nThe Court agrees with Meta that this RFP is about licensing agreement s for Llama models, \nsuch as licenses under which the models were distributed, or any other licenses that confer rights \nor entitlements to anyone outside of Meta concerning Llama models.  However, the Court thinks \nthat the full scope of this RFP 91 is releva nt and proportional to the needs of the case.  Discussions \nof agreements and the negotiation of agreements concerning the licensing of Llama models is \nrelevant, not just the final agreem ents.  These communications may shed light on how or why the \nagreements were developed, which may not be evident from the agreements themselves.  This \ninformation all relates to how Meta may have benefited or attempted to benefit from the allegedly \ninfring ing conduct.  Accordingly, the Court GRANTS  Plaintiffs’ motion to compel as to RFP 91.  \nb. RFPs 94, 100, 101  \nThese RFPs sought “all documents and communications” concerning certain financial \ninformation about the Llama models.  The Court agrees with Meta that these RFPs are overbroad \nand that documents “sufficient to show” the requested financial information are sufficient.  \nAccordingly, the Court DENIES  Plaintiffs’ motion to compel as to these RFPs.  \nc. RFP 106  \nThis RFP asked for “[a] ll Documents and Communications related to Meta guidelines for \nincluding or excluding  copyrighted material from data used to train Llama Models. ”  The Court \nagrees with Plaintiffs that this RFP seeks important information that is highly relevant to the case, \nand therefore Meta’s “sufficient to show” limitation is improper.  The Court is also concerned that \nif there is a dispute about whether Meta com plies with its own guidelines, a “sufficient to show” \nresponse lets Meta pick and choo se wh ich documents to produce and may let Meta choose \ndocuments that support its “official” policy and omit departures from the guidelines.  Further, \nbecause any searches are limited to identified custodians and non -custodial sources, despite the \nwording of the RF P, it’s not true that Meta actually has to produce “all” responsive documents – \njust the responsive documents within the scope of what Meta is searching.  Accordingly, the Court Case 3:23-cv-03417-VC     Document 315     Filed 12/06/24     Page 10 of 12 \n11 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  GRANTS  Plaintiffs’ motion to compel as to RFP 106.  \nd. RFP 123  \nThis RFP asked for “[a] ll non -privileged Communications with third parties regarding \nPlaintiffs ’ allegations and  Meta ’s actual or contemplated defenses, including fair use. ”  Meta \nstated that it would produce documents “sufficient to show” those communications.  \nThis RFP seems to ask for relevant documents, and the Court does not understand what the \n“sufficient to show” limitations means.  Meta also does not discuss this RFP in its section of the \nletter brief, waiving the issue.  The Court GRANTS  Plaintiffs’ motion to compel as to RFP 123.  \n4. Commits and Pull Requests  \nRFP 120 requested “[a] ll Documents and Communications, including source code, relating \nto actual or  contemplated source code changes within Llama Models, including source code \n‘commits ’ and ‘pull requests. ’”  Plaintiffs move to compel the production of the commits and pull \nrequests as text files.  Meta says it will do so.  Accordingly, the Court ORDERS  Meta to produce \nthe commits and pull requests as text files.  \n5. Privilege  \nRFP 125 asked for “[d] ocuments sufficient to show the identity of persons included on the \nfollowing ‘list serv ’ accounts identified on Meta ’s privilege log(s): ‘GenAI Trust & RAI, ’ ‘GenAI \nLLM Research, ’ ‘GenAI - Leadership, ’ ‘MPI in house. ’”  These are apparently listservs referenced \nin Meta’s privilege logs.  RFP 126 asked for “[a] ll Documents and Communications related to \nMeta ’s decision to use the SRT for obtaining  or relaying legal advice. ”  SRT is apparently a tool \nused by Meta employees for communicating with counsel.  \nMeta argues that RFP 125 is discovery into Meta’s privilege log, and therefore concerned \n“existing written discovery” (ECF No. 279 at 2) and was subject to an October 23, 2024 deadline \nto raise with the Court.  ECF No. 238.  The Court disagrees.  While it is true that RFP 125 \nconcerns Meta’s privilege log, Plaintiffs are moving on Meta’s November 8, 2024 RFP responses, \nwhich did not exist at the time the order at ECF No. 238 was issued.  Meta clearly thinks that \ndisputes as to the other RFPs in Plaintiffs’ fifth set of RFPs are timely under the scheduling order; \nthere is no reason why RFP 125 would be different.  On the merits, the Court declines to order this Case 3:23-cv-03417-VC     Document 315     Filed 12/06/24     Page 11 of 12 \n12 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  information produced.  This is discovery about discovery, and there is no good reason for it.  The \nidentity of the people included on the listservs would show who might or could have provided \nlegal advice, but Plaintiffs do not explain how that would enabl e them to assess any particular \nclaim of privilege.    \nRFP 126 seeks irrelevant information.  It doesn’t matter why Meta decided to use the SRT \nfor obtaining  or relaying legal advice . \nPlaintiffs’ motion to compel is DENIED  as to RF Ps 125 and 12 6. \n* * * \nIn summary, Plaintiffs’ motions to compel at ECF Nos. 293 and 294 are GRANTED IN \nPART  and DENIED IN PART  as stated above.  \nIT IS SO ORDERED.  \n \nDated:  December 6, 2024  \n  \nTHOMAS S.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: The dispute involves Plaintiffs Hangzhou Jicai Procurement Co., Ltd. and Beijing AliCloud Apsara Information Technology Co., Ltd. seeking a declaratory judgment against Defendant Anaconda, Inc., concerning the validity and breach of contracts related to Anaconda's AI technology software. The court dismissed the case, ruling that the Plaintiffs lacked standing as they were neither directly involved in the breach of contract suit in Texas nor demonstrated an immediate, substantial threat of injury, as they were not parties to the underlying agreements.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether Jicai and AliCloud have the legal standing necessary to seek a declaratory judgment regarding the Anaconda Agreements when they were not directly involved or named in the Texas breach of contract litigation against other Alibaba Group entities.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court held that Jicai and AliCloud lacked Article III standing to pursue their declaratory judgment action because they failed to establish adverse legal interests or an immediate and real threat of future harm from Anaconda's pending litigation. Consequently, the court dismissed the case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Think of standing as a ticket you need to get into a legal fight. Jicai and AliCloud tried to jump into a fight about whether they broke some rules using Anaconda's computer technology, but they weren't directly involved or threatened with any action by Anaconda. They didn't have the right ticket (standing), so the judge kicked them out of the courtroom until they have a reason to show why they're involved.",

(Jicai) and Beijing \nAliCloud Apsara Information Technology Co., Ltd. (AliCloud) have sued \nDefendant Anaconda, Inc. (Anaconda) for a declaratory judgment with respect to \nthe validity, enforceability, and breach of two contracts. Pending before me is \nAnaconda's Renewed Motion to Dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \n12(6)(1) (D.I. 21). Anaconda also moves for me to decline to exercise my \ndiscretionary jurisdiction under the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. § 2201. \nD.I. 21. \nI. BACKGROUND \nThis action arises out of a breach of contract case that Anaconda filed in \nTexas state comi. Anaconda is a Delaware company that develops and provides a \nplatform that enables businesses to use open-source and artificial intelligence \nsoftware solutions. D.I. 24 ,r,r 3-4. Anaconda offers both free and paid plans. \nSee D.I. 24 ,r 6; D.I. 24-1 at 3-5. Under the free plan, individuals and businesses \nwith fewer than 200 employees may use Anaconda's platform without charge. \nD.I. 24 ,r 6; D.I. 24-1 at 3-4. Businesses with more than 200 employees, however, \nmust pay a license fee to download and use the software. See D.I. 24 ,r 6; D.I. 24-1 \nat 4 (\"Using the Free Offerings for a Commercial Purpose requires a Paid Plan Case 1:24-cv-01092-CFC     Document 32     Filed 08/19/25     Page 2 of 22 PageID #:\n<pageID>with Anaconda.\"). The license fee requirement for commercial use of Anaconda's \nservices appears in two click-wrap agreements-the Terms of Service and the End \nUser License Agreement (collectively, the Anaconda Agreements). See D.I. 24-1 \nat 4; D.I. 24-2 at 4. Before installing Anaconda's software, a user must \naffirmatively agree to the End User License Agreement. D.I.24116-7; see also \nD.I. 19-1 at 49. \nOn April 15, 2024, Anaconda sued Alibaba Group Holding Limited \n(AGHL), Alibaba Cloud (Singapore) Private Limited (AliCloud Singapore), and \nAlibaba Cloud US LLC (AliCloud US) (collectively, the Texas Defendants) in \nTexas state court. See D.I. 19-1 at 31-42; D.I.2418. Anaconda alleged that the \nTexas Defendants breached the Anaconda Agreements by engaging in commercial \nuse of Anaconda's software without paying license fees. See D.I. 19-1 at 37-40; \nD.I. 24116-7. \nA few weeks after Anaconda filed the Texas suit, the parties began \nsettlement negotiations. See D.I. 241 11. To facilitate these settlement \ndiscussions, Anaconda and the Texas Defendants entered into two agreements, \neffective as of May 10, 2024: a Mutual Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) and a \nTolling Agreement. D.I. 24 1 11. The only parties to these agreements were \nAnaconda and the Texas Defendants. D.I. 23-1 at 2; D.I. 23-2 at 2. In the Tolling \nAgreement, Anaconda agreed to dismiss the Texas suit without prejudice. D.I. 24 \n2 Case 1:24-cv-01092-CFC     Document 32     Filed 08/19/25     Page 3 of 22 PageID #:\n<pageID>,r 12; D.I. 23-1 at 2. Anaconda and the Texas Defendants also agreed to toll the \nstatute of limitations until the parties executed a settlement agreement, Anaconda \nrefiled its suit, or one of the parties exercised its right to terminate the Tolling \nAgreement. D.I. 23-1 at 2-3; see also D.I. 24 ,r 12. Anaconda dismissed its Texas \nsuit on May 10, 2024. D.I. 24 ,r 14. \nAnaconda and the Texas Defendants continued to eng~ge in settlement \nnegotiations for the next four months. D.I. 24 ,r 15. Plaintiffs Jicai and AliCloud \nallege in their Amended Complaint that they \"attempted in good faith for more \nthan four months to resolve Anaconda's claims after Anaconda dismissed the \nTexas lawsuit.\" D.I. 19 ,r 27. More specifically, Plaintiffs allege that both Jicai \nand Ali Cloud attended, \"through in-house and outside counsel,\" a May 16, 2024 \nvideoconference to discuss Anaconda's allegations. D.I. 19 ,r,r 28-29. After this \nvideoconference, Plaintiffs allegedly \"continued to negotiate a potential resolution \nin good faith through counsel-led discussions with Anaconda.\" D.I. 19 ,r 30. \nAnaconda disputes these factual allegations. According to Anaconda's \nChief Commercial Officer, Jane Kim, Jicai and Ali Cloud \"were never mentioned \nto Anaconda when negotiating with [the Texas Defendants] with regard to the \nApril 2024 Texas Action or when executing the Non-Disclosure Agreement to \nfacilitate discussion of commercial licensing terms.\" D.I. 24 ,r 16. Kim also states \nthat before Plaintiffs filed this declaratory judgment action, \"Anaconda had no \n3 Case 1:24-cv-01092-CFC     Document 32     Filed 08/19/25     Page 4 of 22 PageID #:\n<pageID>knowledge of Plaintiffs or their connection to the dispute at issue, if any.\" D.I. 24 \niJ 17. \nSettlement negotiations between the Texas Defendants and Anaconda \nultimately stalled in August or September of 2024. See D.I. 19 ,i 31 (alleging that \n\"[n]egotiations broke down in August 2024\"); D.I. 24 ,i 15 (alleging that \n\"negotiations broke down in or around September 2024\"). On September 23, \n2024, counsel for Anaconda notified counsel for the Texas Defendants that it \nseemed like the parties were \"too far apart\" to reach a resolution. D.I. 23-3 at 2. \nConsequently, at its October 2024 board meeting, Anaconda planned to secure \nboard approval to refile suit in Texas. See D.I. 23-3 at 2. \nA week later, on September 30, 2024, Jicai and AliCloud-nonparties to \nAnaconda's Texas suit-filed this declaratory judgment action. D.I. 1. Jicai and \nAliCloud are Chinese corporations with their principal places of business in \nHangzhou, China and Beijing, China, respectively. D.I. 19 ,i,i 6, 7. Jicai and \nAliCloud are both affiliates of AGHL, a holding company that has no employees \nor direct business operations. D.I. 19 ,i,i 15-16. AGHL has several affiliates, \nincluding Jicai and AliCloud, all of which combine to form the Alibaba Group. \nSee D.I. 19 ,i 16. Jicai \"provides centralized procurement management services to \nvarious businesses and entities within the Alibaba Group.\" D.I. 19 ,i 17. Jicai's \nresponsibilities therefore include \"negotiat[ing] terms of group-wide software \n4 Case 1:24-cv-01092-CFC     Document 32     Filed 08/19/25     Page 5 of 22 PageID #:\n<pageID>procurement, execut[ing] procurement agreements, and handl[ing] disputes that \narise out of such agreements.\" D.I. 191 17. Ali Cloud \"manages technology \ncollaboration and partnership for Alibaba Group's cloud computing products and \nservices,\" a role that requires AliCloud to \"negotiate[] terms of such collaboration \nand partnership, execute[] pertinent agreements, and handle[] disputes that arise \nout of such agreements.\" D.I. 19118. \nPlaintiffs seek by this action a judgment declaring that: ( 1) the Terms of \nService and the End User License Agreement do not constitute \"valid and \nenforceable contract[s] between Alibaba and Anaconda\"; (2) \"Alibaba did not \nbreach\" the Terms of Service and the End User License Agreement; and \n(3) \"Anaconda did not suffer any damages as a result of the alleged breach\" of the \nTerms of Service and the End User License Agreement.' D.I. 19 at 8. Plaintiffs \nalso request a judgment \" [ a ]warding Alibaba its costs and attorneys' fees and \nexpenses\" as well as \"such other relief as this Court deems just and proper.\" \nD.I. 19 at 8. \nOn November 20, 2024, Anaconda refiled in Texas its suit against the Texas \nDefendants. D.I. 19-1 at 45-57. The next day, Anaconda filed in this action a \nmotion to dismiss Plaintiffs' Complaint pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil \n1 In their Amended Complaint, Plaintiffs define \"Alibaba\" to refer only to Jicai and \nAliCloud.

Anaconda also moved for me to decline \nto exercise my discretionary jurisdiction under the Declaratory Judgment Act. \nD.I. 11. On January 6, 2025, Plaintiffs filed an unopposed motion for leave to file \nan amended complaint. D.I. 17. Plaintiffs subsequently filed their Amended \nComplaint on January 9, 2025. D.I. 19. On January 23, 2025, Anaconda filed the \npresent motion. D.I. 21. \nII. LEGAL STANDARDS \nA. Declaratory Judgment Standing \n\"The party invoking federal jurisdiction bears the burden of establishing [the \nexistence of a justiciable controversy].\" Lujan v. Deft. of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, \n561 (1992). The Declaratory Judgment Act provides that \"[i]n a case of actual \ncontroversy within its jurisdiction ... any court of the United States ... may \ndeclare the rights and other legal relations of any interested party seeking such \ndeclaration, whether or not further relief is or could be sought.\" 28 U.S.C. \n§ 220l(a).

A declaratory judgment can be \nsought \"in advance of the full harm expected,\" but the action still must involve \"a \njusticiable controversy rather than abstract, hypothetical or contingent questions.\" \nId. (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). The party seeking a declaratory \njudgment must therefore \"allege facts from which it appears there is a substantial \nlikelihood that he will suffer injury in the future.\" Lattaker v.

P. 12(6)(1). \"A motion \nto dismiss for want of standing is ... properly brought pursuant to Rule 12(6 )( l ), \n7 Case 1:24-cv-01092-CFC     Document 32     Filed 08/19/25     Page 8 of 22 PageID #:\n<pageID>because standing is a jurisdictional matter.\" Ballentine v. United States, 486 F.3d \n806, 810 (3d Cir. 2007), A motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(l) is characterized \nas either a facial or factual challenge to the court's subject matter jurisdiction. See \nDavis v. Wells Fargo, 824 F.3d 333, 346 (3d Cir, 2016), A facial challenge attacks \nsubject matter jurisdiction \"without disputing the facts alleged in the complaint.\" \nId. When deciding a facial challenge, comis must therefore \"consider the \nallegations of the complaint as true.\" Mortenson v. First Fed. Sav. & Loan Ass 'n, \n549 F.2d 884, 891 (3d Cir. 1977). A factual challenge, by contrast, \"attacks the \nfactual allegations underlying the complaint's asse1iion of jurisdiction, either \nthrough the filing of an answer or 'otherwise present[ing] competing facts.\"' \nDavis, 824 F.3d at 346 (quoting Const. Party of Pa. v. Aichele, 757 F.3d 347,358 \n(3d Cir. 2014)) (alteration in the original). A defendant may establish a factual \nchallenge by submitting a signed declaration that disputes the plaintiffs factual \nallegations. See Davis, 824 F.3d at 346. With factual challenges, courts may \nconsider evidence outside the pleadings, and the plaintiffs allegations are not \npresumed to be true, Id. \nIII. DISCUSSION \nA. Article III Subject Matter Jurisdiction \nAnaconda argues that I lack subject matter jurisdiction over this action \nbecause Plaintiffs do not have standing under Article III, See D.I, 22 at 7-11, \n8 Case 1:24-cv-01092-CFC     Document 32     Filed 08/19/25     Page 9 of 22 PageID #:\n<pageID>The pa1iies first dispute whether Anaconda has made a facial or factual \nchallenge to subject matter jurisdiction. See D.I. 22 at 8-11; D.I. 27 at 6; D.I. 28 at \n2-3. Plaintiffs argue that Anaconda's challenge is facial because Anaconda \"did \nnot challenge the validity of any of the Plaintiffs' factual claims as part of its \nmotion.\" See D.I. 27 at 6 (quoting In re Horizon Healthcare Servs. Inc. Data \nBreach Litig., 846 F.3d 625, 632 (3d Cir. 2017)). Not so. By submitting a signed \ndeclaration that disputes Plaintiffs' factual allegations, Anaconda has made a \nfactual challenge. See Davis, 824 F.3d at 346. \nThe Amended Complaint seeks to connect Plaintiffs to the Texas action, in \npaii alleging that \"Plaintiffs Jicai and AliCloud attempted in good faith for more \nthan four months to resolve Anaconda's claims after Anaconda dismissed the \nTexas lawsuit.\" D.I. 19 ,r 27. The Amended Complaint also alleges that Plaintiffs \nparticipated in settlement negotiations by attending a May 2024 videoconference \nand engaging in \"counsel-led discussions with Anaconda.\" D.I. 19 ,r,r 28-30. \nAnaconda disputes these allegations in its opening brief, asse1iing that \n\"Plaintiffs never informed Anaconda of their existence, let alone their participation \nin the negotiation process.\" D.I. 22 at 9. To support this assertion, Anaconda \nsubmits a signed declaration from Jane Kim, Anaconda's Chief Commercial \nOfficer. D.I. 24. In her declaration, Kim states that \"Plaintiffs in this action were \nnever mentioned to Anaconda when negotiating with [the Texas Defendants] with \n9 Case 1:24-cv-01092-CFC     Document 32     Filed 08/19/25     Page 10 of 22 PageID #:\n<pageID>regard to the April 2024 Texas Action or when executing the Non-Disclosure \nAgreement to facilitate discussion of commercial licensing terms.\" D.I. 24 ~ 16. \nShe also states that \"[p]rior to the filing of this declaratory judgment action, \nAnaconda had no knowledge of Plaintiffs or their connection to the dispute at \nissue, if any.\" D.I. 24 ~ 17. Anaconda further points to the NDA and Tolling \nAgreement, noting how the Texas Defendants and Anaconda are the only \nsignatories. D.I. 22 at 10; D.I. 24 ~ 11; D.I. 23-1 at 2; D.I. 23-2 at 2. Because \nAnaconda has asserted a factual challenge to standing, and therefore subject matter \njurisdiction, I will not presume the allegations in Plaintiffs' Amended Complaint to \nbe true. See Mortenson, 549 F.2d at 891. And when evaluating Anaconda's \npresent motion to dismiss, I may consider evidence outside of the pleadings. See \nDavis, 824 F.3d at 346. \nI turn then to whether Plaintiffs have standing to bring this declaratory \njudgment action. The parties' dispute centers on two elements of declaratory \njudgment standing-adverse legal interests as well as immediacy and reality. See \nD.I. 22 at 8-11; D.I. 27 at 7-11. \n1. Adverse Legal Interests \nThe patties do not dispute that Anaconda and particular Alibaba Group \nentities-the Texas Defendants-have adverse legal interests. See D.I. 22 at 1 \n(stating that \"there is and has for some time been a dispute between Anaconda and \n10 Case 1:24-cv-01092-CFC     Document 32     Filed 08/19/25     Page 11 of 22 PageID #:\n<pageID>certain Alibaba entities-other than Plaintiffs-in Texas\") (emphasis in the \noriginal); D.I. 27 at 7 (arguing that \"Anaconda readily concedes the existence of a \nsubstantial controversy between itself and Alibaba Group\"). The patties dispute, \nhowever, whether Plaintiffs-Alibaba Group entities that are not patties to the \nTexas lawsuit-have adverse legal interests with Anaconda. See D.I. 22 at 8-9; \nD.I. 27 at 7-9. Plaintiffs argue that their legal interests are adverse to Anaconda \nbecause \"they would be parties to the purported form agreements [ with \nAnaconda]\" and therefore \"are the correct Alibaba Group entities to this contract \ndispute.\" D.I. 27 at 7. But the Amended Complaint fails to plausibly establish \nhow Plaintiffs are parties to the agreements between Anaconda and the Texas \nDefendants. Plaintiffs and Anaconda therefore do not have adverse legal interests. \nPlaintiffs insist, based on the language of the Anaconda Agreements, that \"if \nany of the Alibaba Group entities entered into contracts with Anaconda, Jicai \nwould be a party to the Anaconda Agreements.\" D.I. 27 at 8. The patties do not \ndispute that the contracts at issue are form, click-wrap agreements that are not \nsigned by either Anaconda or the Texas Defendants. See D.I. 22 at 9 (describing \nthe Anaconda Agreements as \"click-wrap software agreements to access Anaconda \nsoftware\"); D.I. 27 at 8 (\"[T]he contracts at issue are form agreements not actually \nsigned by any Alibaba Group entities.\"). The Anaconda Agreements each state \nthat the contract is between Anaconda and \"the individual or entity acquiring \n11 Case 1:24-cv-01092-CFC     Document 32     Filed 08/19/25     Page 12 of 22 PageID #:\n<pageID>and/or providing access to\" the relevant software. D.I. 24-1 at 2; D.I. 24-2 at 2. \nPlaintiffs rely on this language-as well as the Amended Complaint's allegations \nwith respect to Plaintiffs' organizational responsibilities-to argue that Plaintiffs \n\"would be\" parties to the Anaconda Agreements. See D.I. 27 at 8. \nBut nowhere in the Amended Complaint do Plaintiffs allege that they were \nthe \"entit[ies] acquiring and/or providing access to\" the Anaconda software at \nissue. Instead, the Amended Complaint broadly alleges that Jicai \"provides \ncentralized procurement management services to various businesses and entities \nwithin the Alibaba Group,\" D.I. 19 ,r 17, \"including the Texas Defendants,\" \nD.I. 19 ,r 23, and that, as part of its duties, \"Jicai negotiates terms of group-wide \nsoftware procurement, executes procurement agreements, and handles disputes that \narise out of such agreements,\" D .I. 19 ,r 17. The Amended Complaint similarly \nalleges that AliCloud \"manages technology collaboration and partnership for \nAlibaba Group's cloud computing products and services,\" a responsibility that \ninvolves \"negotiat[ing] terms of such collaboration and partnership, execut[ing] \npertinent agreements, and handl[ing] disputes that arise out of such agreements.\" \nD.I. 19 ,r 18. \nNone of Plaintiffs' responsibilities, as stated in the Amended Complaint, are \ndirected expressly to the alleged misuse of Anaconda's software. The Amended \nComplaint does not allege that Plaintiffs ever procured Anaconda's software for \n12 Case 1:24-cv-01092-CFC     Document 32     Filed 08/19/25     Page 13 of 22 PageID #:\n<pageID>the Texas Defendants. See, e.g., D.I. 19123 (stating only that \"Plaintiff Jicai \nmanages centralized procurement for Alibaba Group entities' employees, including \nthe Texas Defendants\"). Even if Plaintiffs did procure the software, the Amended \nComplaint does not allege anything about the process by which Plaintiffs procured \nAnaconda's software, what software was procured, or how Plaintiffs provided \naccess to the Texas Defendants. Instead, as stated above, the Amended Complaint \nmerely recites high-level descriptions of Plaintiffs' responsibilities without any \nmention of Anaconda's software. See D.I. 191117-24. \nBased on the Amended Complaint's allegations, Plaintiffs are simply \nhypothetical patties to the Anaconda Agreements. Although \"[d]eclaratory \njudgments are often forward-looking,\" comis \"may review only 'concrete legal \nissues, presented in actual cases, not abstractions.\"' Sherwin-Williams Co. v. \nCounty of Delaware, 968 F .3d 264, 269 (3d Cir. 2020) ( quoting Golden v. \nZwick/er, 394 U.S. 103, 108 (1969)). Even if, as Plaintiffs argue, Plaintiffs need \nnot concede liability to state a claim, D.l. 27 at 9, they must still allege facts that \nestablish a specific connection to Anaconda's dispute with the Texas Defendants. \nPlaintiffs have not done so. Plaintiffs therefore have not established that their legal \ninterests are adverse to those of Anaconda. \n13 Case 1:24-cv-01092-CFC     Document 32     Filed 08/19/25     Page 14 of 22 PageID #:\n<pageID>2. Immediacy and Reality \nEven if Plaintiffs and Anaconda had adverse legal interests, Plaintiffs have \nstill failed to establish the immediacy and reality requirement of Article III \nstanding. \"As far as timing, the general rule is that a plaintiff in federal court must \nhave Article III standing on the date the lawsuit was commenced.\" Lutter v. \nJNESCO, 86 F.4th 111, 124 (3d Cir. 2023); see Ltifan, 504 U.S. at 570 n.5 \n(\"[S]tanding is to be determined as of the commencement of suit.\"). A declaratory \njudgment plaintiff need not have suffered \"the full harm expected.\" St. Thomas-St. \nJohn Hotel, 218 F.3d at 240. But a plaintiff must \"allege facts from which it \nappears there is a substantial likelihood that [it] will suffer injury in the future.\" \nLattaker, 269 F. App'x at 233 (internal citation omitted). That is, when a plaintiff \n\"seek[s] a declaratory judgment to protect against a feared future event, [a] \nplaintiff must demonstrate that the probability of that future event occurring is real \nand substantial.\" Salvation Army v. Dep 't of Cmty. Affe. of N.J., 919 F .2d 183, 192 \n(3d Cir. 1990). Direct threats of litigation, however, are not necessary. See \nSimmonds Aerocessories, Ltd. v. Elastic Stop Nut C01p. of Am., 257 F.2d 485,490 \n(3d Cir. 1958) (noting that \"it is not essential that there be a direct threat of \nlitigation in order to invoke the Declaratory Judgment Act\"). \nHere, Plaintiffs have failed to allege any threat of future harm. In the \nAmended Complaint, Plaintiffs state that \"an actual controversy of sufficient \n14 Case 1:24-cv-01092-CFC     Document 32     Filed 08/19/25     Page 15 of 22 PageID #:\n<pageID>immediacy and reality exists between Alibaba and Anaconda\" because \"Anaconda \nclaims that Alibaba breached Anaconda's Terms of Service ... and End User \nLicense Agreement.\" D.I. 19 ,r 2. This allegation is misleading. The Amended \nComplaint defines \"Alibaba\" to refer to Plaintiffs only. See D.I. 19 at 1 (referring \nto Plaintiffs Jicai and AliCloud together as \"Alibaba\"). By using this language, the \nAmended Complaint thus suggests that Anaconda has accused Plaintiffs Jicai and \nAliCloud of breaching the Anaconda Agreements. But Anaconda has sued only the \nTexas Defendants, not Plaintiffs, in the Texas breach of contract action. See \nD.I. 19-1 at 45-57. \nNowhere in the Amended Complaint do Plaintiffs allege that Anaconda has \naccused them of breaching the Anaconda Agreements. Instead, Plaintiffs allege \nthat \"Anaconda's dispute threatens Plaintiffs Jicai and AliCloud\" because Jicai and \nAli Cloud are the proper respondents to Anaconda's Texas suit. D.I. 19 ,r 21; see \nD.I. 19 ,r,r 22-24. But Plaintiffs have not demonstrated how the probability of \nbeing named as parties in the Texas suit is \"real and substantial.\" Salvation Army, \n919 F.2d at 192. Plaintiffs also do not allege whether and how they would be \nresponsible for any damages awarded in the Texas action. Moreover, it is hard to \nbelieve that, at the time of filing their initial Complaint, Plaintiffs faced a serious \nthreat of harm from Anaconda. According to Anaconda's Chief Commercial \nOfficer, Anaconda had no previous knowledge of or interactions with Plaintiffs \n15 Case 1:24-cv-01092-CFC     Document 32     Filed 08/19/25     Page 16 of 22 PageID #:\n<pageID>before Plaintiffs filed this declaratory judgment action. See D.I. 24 ,r,r 16-17; see \nalso D.I. 23-1 at 2; D.I. 23-2 at 2 (showing that Anaconda and the Texas \nDefendants were the only signatories to the Tolling Agreement and NDA executed \nduring settlement negotiations). \nPlaintiffs argue that \"Anaconda's litigation activities against third parties \nshow that the dispute between Plaintiffs and Anaconda is of sufficient immediacy \nand reality to warrant the issuance ofa declaratory judgment.\" D.I. 27 at 10. To \nsupport this assertion, Plaintiffs point to Anaconda's suit against some of \nPlaintiffs' affiliates, the Texas Defendants. D.I. 27 at 9-10. Anaconda's dispute \nwith the Texas Defendants falls short of what is necessary to support Plaintiffs' \ndeclaratory judgment standing. \nPlaintiffs direct me to In re Mobile Telecommunications Technologies, LLC, \n247 F. Supp. 3d 456 (D. Del. 2017) as \"instructive\" authority. D.I. 27 at 10. But \nthe declaratory judgment plaintiff in In re Mobile Telecommunications faced a \nmuch more significant threat of harm than Plaintiffs do here. The declaratory \nplaintiffs in In re Mobile Telecommunications sold networking equipment to cable \nnetwork operators. Id. at 458. The defendant in that case, Mobile \nTelecommunications (MTel), had previously sued some of the plaintiffs' \ncustomers, alleging patent infringement. Id. at 457-58. In the customer lawsuits, \nMTel alleged that the plaintiffs' products \"directly infringe[d] the asse1ted \n16 Case 1:24-cv-01092-CFC     Document 32     Filed 08/19/25     Page 17 of 22 PageID #:\n<pageID>patents.\" Id. at 460. MTel specifically mentioned the plaintiffs' products as \n' \nexamples of equipment that constituted direct infringement. Id. at 460-61. \nThe plaintiffs in In re Mobile Telecommunications sought a declaratory \njudgment that neither they nor purchasers of their products infringed MTel's \npatents. Id. at 457. MTel moved to dismiss the action, arguing that the plaintiffs \nhad not pleaded an actual case or controversy between the parties. Id. at 460. The \ncourt held that the connections between MTel's third-party customer suits and the \nplaintiffs \"may give rise to a substantial controversy.\" Id. at 461 (internal \nquotation marks omitted). Even though MTel had not made specific threats of \nlitigation against the plaintiffs, MTel's \"repeated references [in the customer suits] \nidentifying [the plaintiffs'] products as infringing\" weighed in favor of subject \nmatter jurisdiction. Id. at 461. The court also considered the nature ofMTel's \naccusations against the plaintiffs' customers, holding that \"suing identically \nsituated parties and asserting identical ... claims involving identical standards and \nidentical ... conduct\" constituted a \"real and immediate threat.\" Id. at 462. \nHere, neither the connection between Plaintiffs and Anaconda's suit against \nthe Texas Defendants nor the nature of Anaconda's allegations against the Texas \nDefendants establishes that Plaintiffs have standing. In In re Mobile \nTelecommunications, a connection existed between the plaintiffs and MTel's \nlitigation against third-patty customers because the customers and the plaintiffs \n17 Case 1:24-cv-01092-CFC     Document 32     Filed 08/19/25     Page 18 of 22 PageID #:\n<pageID>sold the same, allegedly infringing products. Id. at 460-61. In their opposition in \nthis case, Plaintiffs identify only one connection between themselves and \nAnaconda's action against the Texas Defendants-Plaintiffs \"would be paiiies\" to \nthe Anaconda Agreements. See D.I. 27 at 10. Aside from vague allegations that \nPlaintiffs manage software procurement and collaboration for the Texas \nDefendants, see D.I. 19 ,r,r 23-24, it is unclear how, if at all, Plaintiffs are \nconnected to Anaconda's suit against the Texas Defendants. \nThe nature of Anaconda's allegations against the Texas Defendants also \ndiffers from MTel's allegations against the customers of the plaintiffs in In re \nMobile Telecommunications. In that case, \"the underlying circumstances giving \nrise to potential suits against [the plaintiffs] [were] no different than they [were] for \na suit against [the plaintiffs'] customers.\" 247 F. Supp. 3d at 462. Here, the \nparties are not \"identically situated.\" Id. The Texas Defendants are subject to \npotential liability for breach of contract by allegedly entering into the Anaconda \nAgreements and engaging in unauthorized commercial use of Anaconda's \nsoftware. See D.I. 19-1 at 52-55 (alleging that \"several IP addresses can be traced \nto [the Texas Defendants] that amount to thousands of unauthorized installs of the \nAnaconda product\"). To resolve this dispute, the Texas Defendants negotiated \nwith Anaconda for four months. See D.I. 24 ,r,r 11-15. After settlement \nnegotiations failed, Anaconda refiled suit against the same parties-the Texas \n18 Case 1:24-cv-01092-CFC     Document 32     Filed 08/19/25     Page 19 of 22 PageID #:\n<pageID>Defendants. See D.I. 19-1 at 45-57 (Anaconda refiling a breach of contract claim \nagainst the Texas Defendants on November 20, 2024). \nPlaintiffs, however, are simply entities within the Alibaba Group that have \nnot been accused of engaging in or facilitating unauthorized commercial use of \nAnaconda's software. And Plaintiffs' involvement in resolving Anaconda's claims \nagainst the Texas Defendants is disputed, as evidenced in pait by Plaintiffs not \nbeing signatories to the NDA and Tolling Agreement executed during settlement \nnegotiations. See D.I. 19 ,i,i 27-30; D.I. 24 ,i,i 15-17; D.I. 23-1 at 2; D.I. 23-2 at 2. \nPlaintiffs also maintain that Jicai has standing to seek a declaratory judgment \nbecause \"Anaconda has made allegations implicating other Alibaba Group entities \nwho are not parties to the Texas lawsuits.\" D.I. 27 at 10. Plaintiffs seem to argue \nthat because the Texas Defendants do not have enough employees to engage in \nunauthorized commercial use of Anaconda's software, \"Anaconda has thus \nnecessarily accused other entities within the Alibaba Group for whom Jicai \nsimilarly manages software procurement of breach of contract.\" D.I. 27 at 11. \nThis argument fails for the same reasons stated above. Plaintiffs have not alleged \nsufficient facts to demonstrate how Jicai's general software procurement \nresponsibilities expose Jicai to an immediate and real threat of future harm. \n19 Case 1:24-cv-01092-CFC     Document 32     Filed 08/19/25     Page 20 of 22 PageID #:\n<pageID>B. Discretionary Declaratory Judgment Act Jurisdiction \nFinally, Plaintiffs argue that I should use my discretion to exercise \ndeclaratory judgment jurisdiction. See D.I. 27 at 13-14 (arguing that the factors \noutlined in Reifer v. Westport Insurance Corp., 751 F.3d 129 (3d Cir. 2014) \ncounsel the exercise of declaratory judgment jurisdiction). The Declaratory \nJudgment Act \"does not itself create an independent basis for federal jurisdiction \nbut instead provides a remedy for controversies otherwise properly within the \ncourt's subject matter jurisdiction.\" Auto-Owners Ins. Co. v. Stevens & Ricci, Inc., \n835 F.3d 388, 394 (3d Cir. 2016). A district court's discretion to exercise its \ndeclaratory judgment jurisdiction therefore presupposes the existence of subject \nmatter jurisdiction. See Wilton v. Seven Falls Co., 515 U.S. 277,282 (1995) \n(\"[D]istrict comis possess discretion in determining whether and when to entertain \nan action under the Declaratory Judgment Act, even when the suit otherwise \nsatisfies subject matter jurisdictional prerequisites.\"). Accordingly, if a district \ncourt lacks subject matter jurisdiction over a claim, it need not consider whether to \nexercise its discretion under the Declaratory Judgment Act. See Allen v. DeBello, \n861 F.3d 433,444 (3d Cir. 2017) (holding that a district comi \"did not need to \nconsider whether to exercise its discretion using the [Reifer] factors\" because the \ncourt \"correctly determined that the [d]efendants were not properly sued in th[e] \naction\"). Because Plaintiffs have failed to establish that they have Article III \n20 Case 1:24-cv-01092-CFC     Document 32     Filed 08/19/25     Page 21 of 22 PageID #:\n<pageID>standing, I lack subject matter jurisdiction over this action. I therefore need not \nconsider whether to exercise my discretion under the Reifer factors. \nIV. CONCLUSION \nFor the reasons stated above, I will grant Anaconda's motion to dismiss. \nThe Comi will issue an Order consistent with this Memorandum Opinion. \n21 Case 1:24-cv-01092-CFC     Document 32     Filed 08/19/25     Page 22 of 22 PageID #:\n<pageID>",

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: This opinion involves a protective order in two consolidated cases, Nazemian v. NVIDIA Inc. and Dubus v. NVIDIA Inc., regarding the disclosure of sensitive information, including proprietary technology related to artificial intelligence (AI). The cases involve the production and handling of Confidential and Highly Confidential information, particularly source code for machine learning models and AI systems. The order delineates how material is to be protected, accessed, and handled, and it also incorporates procedures under U.S. civil procedures for addressing such material in court filings.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: The central legal issue is the extent and manner in which sensitive, proprietary information, including AI technology and machine learning models, should be protected during litigation to prevent unauthorized disclosure and ensure fair proceedings.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court issued a stipulated protective order that outlines specific procedures for designating and handling confidential material in the litigation, requiring parties to follow strict guidelines for disclosure, access, and the filing of protected materials, especially when dealing with AI-related proprietary information.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine two companies are fighting in court, and they want to use very detailed and secret recipes (like Coca-Cola's secret formula) in their arguments. The court is saying, \"Okay, you can show us your secret recipe, but you have to follow these special rules to keep it secret from the public and from everyone who doesn’t need to see it.\" This is especially important because the secrets involve how computers teach themselves new tricks, which is pretty cutting-edge tech.",

DESIGNATING PROTECTED MATERIAL  \n5.1 Exercise of Restraint and Care in Designating Material for Protection .  \nEach Party or Non -Party that designates information or items for protection under this \nOrder must take care to limit any such designation to specific material that qualifies under the \nappropriate standards. To the extent it is practical to do so, the Desig nating Party must designate \nfor protection only those parts of material, documents, items, or oral or written communications \nthat qualify – so that other portions of the material, documents, items, or communications for \nwhich protection is not warranted ar e not swept unjustifiably within the ambit of this Order.  \nMass, indiscriminate, or routinized designations are prohibited. Designations that are \nshown to be clearly unjustified or that have been made for an improper purpose (e.g., to \nunnecessarily encumber or retard the case development process or to impose unnec essary \nexpenses and burdens on other parties) expose the Designating Party to sanctions.  \nIf it comes to a Designating Party ’s attention that information or items that it designated \nfor protection do not qualify for protection at all or do not qualify for the level of protection \ninitially asserted, that Designating Party must promptly notify all other parties that it is \nwithdraw ing the mistaken designation.  \n5.2 Manner and Timing of Designations . Except as otherwise provided in this Order \n(see, e.g., second paragraph of section 5.2(a) below), or as otherwise stipulated or ordered, \nDisclosure or Discovery Material that qualifies for protection under this Order must be clearly so \ndesignated before the material is disclosed or produced.  Case 4:24-cv-01454-JST     Document 99     Filed 01/08/25     Page 5 of 21 \n6 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  Designation in conformity with this Order requires:  \n(a) for information in documentary form  (e.g., paper or electronic documents, but \nexcluding transcripts of depositions or other pretrial or trial proceedings), that the Producing Party \naffix the legend “CONFIDENTIAL ” or “HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL – ATTORNEYS ’ EYES \nONLY ” or “HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL – SOURCE CODE ” to each page that contains protected \nmaterial. If only a portion or portions of the material on a page qualifies for protection, the \nProducing Party also must clearly identify the protected portion(s) (e.g., by making appropriate \nmarkings in the m argins) and must specify, for each portion, the level of protection being asserted.  \nA Party or Non -Party that makes original documents or materials available for inspection \nneed not designate them for protection until after the inspecting Party has indicated which material \nit would like copied and produced. During the inspection and befor e the designation, all of the \nmaterial made available for inspection shall be deemed “HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL – \nATTORNEYS ’ EYES ONLY. ” After the inspecting Party has identified the documents it wants \ncopied and produced, the Producing Party must determine whic h documents, or portions thereof, \nqualify for protection under this Order. Then, before producing the specified documents, the \nProducing Party must affix the appropriate legend ( “CONFIDENTIAL ” or “HIGHLY \nCONFIDENTIAL – ATTORNEYS ’ EYES ONLY ” or “HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL – SOURCE \nCODE) to each page that contains Protected Material. If only a portion or portions of the material \non a page qualifies for protection, the Producing Party also must clearly identify the protected \nportion(s) (e.g., by making app ropriate ma rkings in the margins) and must specify, for each \nportion, the level of protection being asserted.  \n(b) for testimony given in deposition or in other pretrial or trial proceedings , that the \nDesignating Party identify on the record, before the close of the deposition, hearing, or other \nproceeding, all protected testimony and specify the level of protection being asserted. When it is \nimpractical to identify separately each portion of  testimony that is entitled to protection and it \nappears that substantial portions of the testimony may qualify for protection, the Designating Party \nmay invoke on the record (b efore the deposition, hearing, or other proceeding is concluded) a right \nto have up to 21 days to identify the specific portions of the testimony as to which protection is Case 4:24-cv-01454-JST     Document 99     Filed 01/08/25     Page 6 of 21 \n7 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  sought and to specify the level of protection being asserted. Only those portions of the testimony \nthat are appropriately designated for protection within the 21 days shall be covered by the \nprovisions of this Stipulated Protective Order.  Alternatively, a Designating Party may specify, at \nthe deposition or up to 21 days afterwards if that period is properly invoked, that the entire \ntranscript shall be treated as “CONFIDENTIAL ” or “HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL – \nATTORNEYS ’ EYES ONLY. ” \nParties shall give the other parties notice if they reasonably expect a deposition, hearing or \nother proceeding to include Protected Material so that the other parties can ensure that only \nauthorized individuals who have signed the “Acknowledgment and Agreement to Be Bound ” \n(Exhibit A) are present at those proceedings.  The use of a document as an exhibit at a deposition \nshall not in any way affect its designation as “CONFIDENTIAL ” or “HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL \n– ATTORNEYS ’ EYES ONLY. ” \nTranscripts containing Protected Material shall have an obvious legend on the title page \nthat the transcript contains Protected Material, and the title page shall be followed by a list of all \npages (including line numbers as appropriate) that have been des ignated as Protected Material and \nthe level of protection being asserted by the Designating Party. The Designating Party shall inform \nthe court reporter of these requirements. Any transcript that is prepared before the expiration of a \n21-day period for des ignation shall be treated during that period as if it had been designated \n“HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL – ATTORNEYS ’ EYES ONLY ” in its entirety unless otherwise \nagreed. After the expiration of that period, the transcript shall be treated only as actually \ndesignated.  \n(c) for information produced in some form other than documentary and for any other \ntangible items , that the Producing Party affix in a prominent place on the exterior of the container \nor containers in which the information or item is stored the legend “CONFIDENTIAL ” or \n“HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL – ATTORNEYS ’ EYES ONLY ” or “HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL – \nSOURCE CODE. ” If only a portion or portions of the information or item warrant protection, the \nProducing Party, to the extent practicable, shall identify the protected por tion(s) and specify the \nlevel of protection being asserted.

If timely corrected, an inadvertent failure to \ndesignate qualified information or items does not, standing alone, waive the Designating Party ’s \nright to secure protection under this Order for such material. Upon timely correction of a \ndesignation, the Receiving Party must make reasonable efforts to assure that the material is treated \nin accordance with the provisions of this Order.  \n5. CHALLENGING CONFIDENTIALITY DESIGNATIONS  \n6.1 Timing of Challenges . Any Party or Non -Party may challenge a designation of \nconfidentiality at any time. Unless a prompt challenge to a Designating Party ’s confidentiality \ndesignation is necessary to avoid foreseeable, substantial unfairness, unnecessary economic \nburdens, or a significant disruption or delay of the litigation, a Party does not waive its right to \nchallenge a confidentiality designation by el ecting not to mount a challenge promptly after the \noriginal designation is disclosed.  \n6.2 Meet and Confer . The Challenging Party shall initiate the dispute resolution \nprocess by providing written notice of each designation it is challenging and describing the basis \nfor each challenge. To avoid ambiguity as to whether a challenge has been made, the written \nnotice must recite that the challenge to confidentiality is being made in accordance with this \nspecific paragraph of the Protective Order. The parties shall attempt to resolve each challenge in \ngood faith and must begin the process by confe rring directly (in voice to voice dialogue; other \nforms of communication are not sufficient) within 14 days of the date of service of notice. In \nconferring, the Challenging Party must explain the basis for its belief that the confidentiality \ndesignation wa s not proper and must give the Designating Party an opportunity to review the \ndesignated material, to reconsider the circumstances, and, if no change in designation is offered, to \nexplain the basis for the chosen designation. A Challenging Party may procee d to the next stage of \nthe challenge process only if it has engaged in this meet and confer process first or establishes that \nthe Designating Party is unwilling to participate in the meet and confer process in a timely \nmanner.  \n6.3 Judicial Intervention . If the Parties cannot resolve a challenge without Court \nintervention, the Designating Party shall file and serve a motion to retain confidentiality under Case 4:24-cv-01454-JST     Document 99     Filed 01/08/25     Page 8 of 21 \n9 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  Civil Local Rule 7 (and in compliance with Civil Local Rule 79 -5, if applicable) within 21 days of \nthe initial notice of challenge or within 14 days of the parties agreeing that the meet and confer \nprocess will not resolve their dispute, whichever is earli er. Each such motion must be \naccompanied by a competent declaration affirming that the movant has complied with the meet \nand confer requirements imposed in the preceding paragraph. Failure by the Designating Party to \nmake such a motion including the requir ed declaration within 21 days (or 14 days, if applicable) \nshall automatically waive the confidentiality designation for each challenged designation. In \naddition, the Challenging Party may file a motion challenging a confidentiality designation at any \ntime if there is good cause for doing so, including a challenge to the designation of a deposition \ntranscript or any portions thereof. Any motion brought pursuant to this provision must be \naccompanied by a competent declaration affirming that the movant has com plied with the meet \nand confer requirements imposed by the preceding paragraph.  \nThe burden of persuasion in any such challenge proceeding shall be on the Designating \nParty. Frivolous challenges and those made for an improper purpose (e.g., to harass or impose \nunnecessary expenses and burdens on other parties) may expose the Challengin g Party to \nsanctions. Unless the Designating Party has waived the confidentiality designation by failing to \nfile a motion to retain confidentiality as described above, all parties shall continue to afford the \nmaterial in question the level of protection to  which it is entitled under the Producing Party ’s \ndesignation until the Court rules on the challenge.  \n6. ACCESS TO AND USE OF PROTECTED MATERIAL  \n7.1 Basic Principles . A Receiving Party may use Protected Material that is disclosed \nor produced by another Party or by a Non -Party in connection with this case only for prosecuting, \ndefending, or attempting to settle this litigation. Such Protected Material may be disclosed only to \nthe categories of persons and under the conditions described in this Order. When the litigation has \nbeen terminated, a Receiving Party must comply with the provisions of section 15 below (FINAL \nDISPOSITION).  \nProtected Material must be stored and maintained by a Receiving Party at a location and in \na secure manner that ensures that access is limited to the persons authorized under this Order.

PROSECUTION BAR  \nAbsent written consent from the Producing Party, any individual who receives access to \n“HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL – ATTORNEYS ’ EYES ONLY ” or “HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL – \nSOURCE CODE ” information shall not be involved in the prosecution of patents or patent \napplications relating to artificial intelligence, machine learning, neural networks, or large language \nmodels including without limitation the patents asserted in this action and any patent or \napplication claiming priority to or otherwise related to the patents asser ted in this action, before \nany foreign or domestic agency, including the United States Patent and Trademark Office ( “the \nPatent Office ”). For purposes of this paragraph, “prosecution ” includes directly or indirectly \ndrafting, amending, advising, or otherwise affecting the scope or maintenance of patent claims.

This Prosecution Bar shall begin \nwhen access to “HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL – ATTORNEYS ’ EYES ONLY ” or “HIGHLY \nCONFIDENTIAL – SOURCE CODE ” information is first received by the affected individual and \nshall end two (2) years after final termination of this actio n.  \n8. SOURCE CODE  \n(a) To the extent production of source code becomes necessary in this case, a Producing \nParty may designate source code as “HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL - SOURCE CODE ” as provided \nin Section 2.9.  \n(b) Protected Material designated as “HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL – SOURCE CODE ” \nshall be subject to all of the protections afforded to “HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL – \nATTORNEYS ’ EYES ONLY ” information including the Prosecution Bar set forth in Paragraph 8,  \nand may be disclosed only to the individuals to whom “HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL – \nATTORNEYS ’ EYES ONLY ” information may be disclosed, as set forth in Paragraphs 7.3 and \n7.4, with the exception of Designated House Counsel. \n(c) A Party that designated Protected Material as “HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL – \nSOURCE CODE ” may restrict the production to the following procedure.  The designated material  \nshall be made available for inspection, in a format allowing it to be reasonably reviewed and \nsearched, during normal business hours or at other mutually agreeable times, at an office of the \nProducing Party ’s counsel or another mutually agreed upon location. Access to source code shall be \nprovided, at the Producing Party ’s election, (1) on a s ecured computer having disk encryption and \npassword protection in a secured room without Internet access or network access to other computers, \nsuch that all persons entering the secured room containing the source code are subject to reasonable \nsecurity mea sures to ensure they are not carrying any prohibited items before they will be given \naccess to the secured room; or (2) on a networked computer configured to connect (via a Virtual \nPrivate Network or Virtual Network Computing connection) to a source code r eview environment \nhosted on a remote server maintained by the Producing Party. Both the (1) secured computer and Case 4:24-cv-01454-JST     Document 99     Filed 01/08/25     Page 14 of 21 \n15 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  (2) the networked computer are referenced herein as “Source Code Computer. ” Use or possession \nof any input/output device (e.g., USB memory stick, mobile phone or tablet, camera or any camera -\nenabled device, CD, floppy disk, portable hard drive, laptop, or any device that can access the \nInternet or any other network or external sy stem, etc.) is prohibited while accessing the Source Code \nComputer. The Receiving Party shall not copy, remove, or otherwise transfer any portion of the \nsource code onto any recorda ble media or recordable device. The Source Code Computer will be \nmade available for inspection upon reasonable notice to the Producing Party, which shall not be less \nthan 10 business days in advance of the initial requested inspection. Following the initia l inspection, \nthe Receiving Party must give notice at least 48 hours in advance of additional review. The \nProducing Party may visually monitor the activities of the Receiving Party ’s representatives during \nany source code review, but only to ensure that th ere is no unauthorized recording, copying, or \ntransmission of the source code.  \n(d) The Receiving Party may request paper copies of limited portions of source code that \nare reasonably necessary for the preparation of court filings, pleadings, expert reports, or other \npapers, or for deposition or trial, but shall not request paper copi es for the purposes of reviewing the \nsource code other than electronically as set forth in paragraph (c) in the first instance. The Producing \nParty shall provide all such source code in paper form including bates numbers and the label \n“HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL - SOURCE CODE. ” The Producing Party may challenge the amount \nof source code requested in hard copy form pursuant to the dispute resolution procedure and \ntimeframes set forth in Paragraph 6 whereby the Producing Party is the “Challenging Party ” and the \nReceiving Party is the “Designating Party ” for purposes of dispute resolution.  \n(e) The Receiving Party shall maintain a record of any individual who has inspected any \nportion of the source code in electronic or paper form. The Receiving Party shall maintain all paper \ncopies of any printed portions of the source code in a secured, loc ked area. The Receiving Party \nshall not create any electronic or other images of the paper copies and shall not convert any of the \ninformation contained in the paper copies into any electronic format. The Receiving Party shall only \nmake additional paper co pies if such additional copies are (1) necessary to prepare court filings, \npleadings, or other papers (including a testifying expert ’s expert report), (2) necessary for Case 4:24-cv-01454-JST     Document 99     Filed 01/08/25     Page 15 of 21 \n16 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  deposition, or (3) otherwise necessary for the preparation of its case. Any paper copies used during \na deposition shall be retrieved by the Producing Party at the end of each day and must not be given \nto or left with a court reporter or any other unauthori zed individual.  \n9. PROTECTED MATERIAL SUBPOENAED OR ORDERED PRODUCED IN \nOTHER LITIGATION  \nIf a Party is served with a subpoena or a court order issued in other litigation that compels \ndisclosure of any information or items designated in this action as “CONFIDENTIAL ” or \n“HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL – ATTORNEYS ’ EYES ONLY ” or “HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL – \nSOURCE CODE ” that Party must:  \n(a) promptly notify in writing the Designating Party. Such notification shall include a copy \nof the subpoena or court order;  \n(b) promptly notify in writing the party who caused the subpoena or order to issue in the \nother litigation that some or all of the material covered by the subpoena or order is subject to this \nProtective Order. Such notification shall include a copy of this  Stipulated Protective Order; and  \n(c) cooperate with respect to all reasonable procedures sought to be pursued by the \nDesignating Party whose Protected Material may be affected.2 \nIf the Designating Party timely seeks a protective order, the Party served with the subpoena \nor court order shall not produce any information designated in this action as “CONFIDENTIAL ” \nor “HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL – ATTORNEYS ’ EYES ONLY ” or “HIGHLY \nCONFIDENTIAL – SOURCE CODE ” before a determination by the court from which the \nsubpoena or order issued, unless the Party has obtained the Designating Party ’s permission. The \nDesignating Party shall bear the burden and expense of seeking protection in that court of i ts \nconfidential material – and nothing in these provisions should be construed as authorizing or \nencouraging a Receiving Party in this action to disobey a lawful directive from another court.  \n \n2 The purpose of imposing t hese duties is to alert the interested parties to the existence of this \nProtective Order and to afford the Designating Party in this case an opportunity to try to protect its \nconfidentiality interests in the court from which the subpoena or order issued.

A NON -PARTY ’S PROTECTED MATERIAL SOUGHT TO BE PRODUCED IN \nTHIS LITIGATION  \n(a) The terms of this Order are applicable to information produced by a Non -Party in \nthis action and designated as “CONFIDENTIAL ” or “HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL – \nATTORNEYS ’ EYES ONLY ” or “HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL – SOURCE CODE. ” Such \ninformation produced by Non -Parties in connection with this litigation is protected by the \nremedies and relief provided by this Order. Nothing in these provisions should be construed as \nprohibiting a Non -Party from seeking additional protections.  \n(b) In the event that a Party is required, by a valid discovery request, to produce a Non -\nParty ’s confidential information in its possession, and the Party is subject to an agreement with the \nNon-Party not to produce the Non -Party ’s confidential information, then the Party shall:  \n1. promptly notify in writing the Requesting Party and the Non -Party that \nsome or all of the information requested is subject to a confidentiality agreement with a Non -\nParty;  \n2. promptly provide the Non -Party with a copy of the Stipulated Protective \nOrder in this litigation, the relevant discovery request(s), and a reasonably specific description of \nthe information requested; and  \n3. make the information requested available for inspection by the Non -Party.  \n(c) If the Non -Party fails to object or seek a protective order from this Court within 14 \ndays of receiving the notice and accompanying information, the Receiving Party may produce the \nNon-Party ’s confidential information responsive to the discovery request. If the Non -Party timely \nseeks a protective order, the Receiving Party shall not produce any information in its possession or \ncontrol that is subject to the confidentiality agreement with the N on-Party before a determination \nby the Court.3 Absent a court order to the contrary, the Non -Party shall bear the burden and \nexpense of seeking protection in this Court of its Protected Material.  \n \n3 The purpose of this provision is to alert the interested parties to the existence of confidentiality \nrights of a Non -Party and to afford the Non -Party an opportunity to protect its confidentiality \ninterests in this Court.

UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURE OF PROTECTED MATERIAL  \nIf a Receiving Party learns that, by inadvertence or otherwise, it has disclosed Protected \nMaterial to any person or in any circumstance not authorized under this Stipulated Protective \nOrder, the Receiving Party must immediately (a) notify in writing the D esignating Party of the \nunauthorized disclosures, (b) use its best efforts to retrieve all unauthorized copies of the Protected \nMaterial, (c) inform the person or persons to whom unauthorized disclosures were made of all the \nterms of this Order, and (d) re quest such person or persons to execute the “Acknowledgment and \nAgreement to Be Bound ” that is attached hereto as Exhibit A.  \n12. INADVERTENT PRODUCTION OF PRIVILEGED OR OTHERWISE \nPROTECTED MATERIAL  \nWhen a Producing Party gives notice to Receiving Parties that certain inadvertently \nproduced material is subject to a claim of privilege or other protection, the obligations of the \nReceiving Parties are those set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26 (b)(5)(B). This \nprovision is not intended to modify whatever procedure may be established in an e -discovery order \nthat provides for production without prior privilege review. Pursuant to agreement of the parties, \nthe inadvertent production of material subj ect to a claim of privilege or other protection shall not \nconstitute a waiver of that privilege or other protection under Federal Rule of Evidence  502(d).  \n13. MISCELLANEOUS  \n14.1 Right to Further Relief . Nothing in this Order abridges the right of any person to \nseek its modification by the Court in the future.  \n14.2 Right to Assert Other Objections . By stipulating to the entry of this Protective \nOrder no Party waives any right it otherwise would have to object to disclosing or producing any \ninformation or item on any ground not addressed in this Stipulated Protective Order. Similarly, no \nParty waives  any right to object on any ground to use in evidence of any of the material covered \nby this Protective Order.  \n14.3 Export Control . Disclosure of Protected Material shall be subject to all applicable \nlaws and regulations relating to the export of technical data contained in such Protected Material, \nincluding the release of such technical data to foreign persons or nationals in the Uni ted States or Case 4:24-cv-01454-JST     Document 99     Filed 01/08/25     Page 18 of 21 \n19 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  elsewhere. The Producing Party shall be responsible for identifying any such controlled technical \ndata, and the Receiving Party shall take measures necessary to ensure compliance.  \n14.4 Filing Protected Material . Without written permission from the Designating Party \nor a court order secured after appropriate notice to all interested persons, a Party may not file in \nthe public record in this action any Protected Material. A Party that seeks to file under seal any \nProtected Material must comply with Civil Local Rule 79 -5. Protected Material may only be filed \nunder seal pursuant to a court order authorizing the sealing of the specific Protected Material at \nissue. Pursuant to Civil Local Rule 79 -5, a sealing order will issue only upon a request \nestablishing that the Protected Material at issue is privileged, protectable as a trade secret, or \notherwise entitled to protection under the law. If a Receiving Party ’s request to file Protected \nMaterial under seal pursuant to Civil Local Rule 79 -5 is denied by the Court, then the Receiving \nParty may file the Protected Material in the public record pursuant to Civil Local Rule 79 -5 unless \notherwise instructed by the Court. \n14. FINAL DISPOSITION  \nWithin 60 days after the final disposition of this action, as defined in paragraph 4, each \nReceiving Party must return all Protected Material to the Producing Party or destroy such material. \nAs used in this subdivision, “all Protected Material ” includes all copies, abstracts, compilations, \nsummaries, and any other format reproducing or capturing any of the Protected Material. Whether \nthe Protected Material is returned or destroyed, the Receiving Party must submit a written \ncertification to the P roducing Par ty (and, if not the same person or entity, to the Designating Party) \nby the 60 -day deadline that (1) identifies (by category, where appropriate) all the Protected \nMaterial that was returned or destroyed and (2) affirms that the Receiving Party has not reta ined \nany copies, abstracts, compilations, summaries or any other format reproducing or capturing any \nof the Protected Material. Notwithstanding this provision, Counsel are entitled to retain an archival \ncopy of all pleadings, motion papers, trial, depositi on, and hearing transcripts, legal memoranda, \ncorrespondence, deposition and trial exhibits, expert reports, attorney work product, and \nconsultant and expert work product, even if such materials contain Protected Material.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: This case involves Aon Re, Inc. suing Zesty.AI, Inc. for patent infringement regarding patents that use machine learning to analyze aerial photographs of properties to assess risk. Zesty.AI argued that these patents were invalid under 35 U.S.C. § 101, claiming they only implement the abstract idea of risk assessment with generic machine learning. The court, however, denied the motion to dismiss, agreeing with Aon that the patents specify a particular arrangement of classifiers that constitute a patent-eligible invention.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the patents held by Aon Re, Inc., which employ machine learning to evaluate property risk from aerial images, are directed to an abstract idea and thereby qualify as patent-ineligible under 35 U.S.C. § 101.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court held that the patents are not directed to an abstract idea because they recite a specific technological method involving two independently trained machine learning classifiers that analyze different aspects of a property, which provides a concrete and specific technological solution rather than a generalized use of technology.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine you have a magic computer program that looks at pictures from the sky to spot any problems with your house, like if the roof is damaged, and guesses how likely it might be to get hurt in a storm. Some people said this program is too simple and just does what people already do by looking at pictures. But the court said it's not just copying what people do because it uses two super smart robot brains (algorithms) that each check different parts of the house to give a clearer result. Because it’s a clever way to solve a tricky problem, the court decided it's okay for this idea to be protected like an invention patent.",
    "full_text": "IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT  \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE  \n \nAON RE, INC.  : CIVIL ACTION  \n :  \nv. : NO.   25-201 \n :  \nZESTY .AI, INC.  :  \n \nMEMORANDUM  \n \nMURPHY, J.                       July 15, 2025 \n \nThis is a patent infringement case involving patents that use machine learning to evaluate \nreal property from aerial imagery .  Zest y.AI moved to dismiss the case, arguing that the patents \nare invalid under 35 U.S.C. § 101 because they claim a generic implementation of the abstract \nidea of assessing property risk from imagery.  Recently, the Federal Circuit acknowledged the burgeoning field of artificial intelligence  but held that patent owners may not claim the mere \napplication of generic machine learning to new data environments.  Aon’s patents do not offer a new twist on machine learning itself.  But that is not fatal, because we agree with Aon that the patents recite the patent -eligible  arrangement  of two independently trained classifiers to analyze \nproperty characteristics and conditions.  For the reasons that follow, we deny Zesty.AI’s motion to dismiss . \nI. Background \nAon Re, Inc. accuses  Zesty.AI, Inc. of infringing four similar U.S. patents: 10,529,029, \n10,650,285, 11,030,491, and 11,195,058.  See DI 1.  The patents describe computer systems that \nuse machine- learning classifiers to analyze aerial photographs of buildings (e.g., homes and  \ncommercial structures ); automatically identify features  (e.g., the type of roof); and determine \ntheir condition (e.g., in good shape or needs repair ).  See, e.g., 029 patent at Abstract, 1:18-36, \n2:24-35.  The  invention then uses these identified features and condition assessments to evaluate Case 1:25-cv-00201-JFM     Document 30     Filed 07/15/25     Page 1 of 13 PageID #:\n<pageID>2 \n how susceptible a given  property might be to damage during storms or other adverse natural \nconditions , which is  useful information for insurance companies like Aon in assessing risk and \npricing coverage .  See id.  at 11:47- 12:16; DI 1 at 1 .   \nThe patents explain that  machine learning  classifiers are computer software model s that \ncan evaluate input data and classify it into categories.  See 029 patent at 1:37- 2:5.  The classifier \nlearns to make these assignments by training  on examples  with known answers .  See id. at 1:46-\n49, 8:37- 41.  This enables  it to recognize relevant features and sort  new, unseen inputs .  See id.  \nat Fig. 2D, 1: 46-49, 9:4- 23.  The classifier represents categories as complex mathematical \nabstraction s.  See id.  at 1:37- 39.  W hen applied to image analysis , these classifiers mimic “ the \nbiological process of visually reviewing and identifying an object or feature of an object .”  Id. at \n8:16-26.  Depending on the implementation, a classifier may evaluate image data at the pixel \nlevel (such as  through sets of intensity values) or at a more abstract level using edges  or region \nshapes.   Id. at 1:61- 67. \nZesty filed a motion to dismiss, arguing that Aon’s  patents claim subject matter that is \nnot eligible for patent protection under 35 U.S.C. § 101.  See DI 17 .  Zesty’s motion primarily \ntargets claim 1 of the 029 patent.  See DI 19 at 5- 10, 15-16.  The parties dispute whether that \nclaim is fairly representative, but w e may assume that it is .  See DI 25 at 6- 7.  Representative \nclaim  1 of the 029 patent  is reproduced below:  \n1. A method for automatically categorizing a repair condition of a property \ncharacteristic, comprising: \n receiving, from a user at a remote computing device, a request for a property condition classification, wherein the property classification request includes identification of a property and at least one property characteristic;  \n Case 1:25-cv-00201-JFM     Document 30     Filed 07/15/25     Page 2 of 13 PageID #:\n<pageID>3 \n obtaining, by processing circuitry of a computing system responsive to \nreceiving the request, an aerial image of a geographic region including the property;  \n extracting, by the processing circuitry, one or more of a plurality of features from the aerial image corresponding to the property characteristic, wherein the extracted features include pixel groupings representing the property characteristic;  \n determining, by the processing circuitry from the extracted features, a property characteristic classification for the property characteristic, wherein determining the property characteristic classification includes applying the pixel groupings for the property characteristic to a first machine learning classifier trained to identify property characteristics from a set of pixel groupings;  \n determining, by the processing circuitry based on the identified property characteristic and the extracted features, a condition classification for the property characteristic, wherein identifying the condition classification includes applying the pixel gr oupings for the property characteristic to a \nsecond machine learning classifier trained to identify property characteristic conditions from a set of pixel groupings;  \n determining, by the processing circuitry based in part on the property characteristic classification and the condition classification, a risk estimate of damage to the property due to one or more disasters; and  returning, to the user at the remote computing device via a graphical user interface responsive to receiving the request, a condition assessment of the property characteristic including the condition classification and the risk estimate of damage to the pr operty due to the one or more disasters.  \n \nThe method of  claim 1 begins by accessing an aerial image on a computer  in response to \na user request .  029 patent at 24:17- 26.  Next, the method isolates  and removes  from that image  \ngroups of pixel s “such as angles, outlines, substantially homogenous fields ” that represent  a \ncertain physical feature, like the roof , of the property.  Id.  at 7: 60-8:1, 24:2 7-31.  The method \nthen analyzes those features using two different machine learning algorithms , both of which \nrequire using the  extracted pixels as input data .  See  id. at 2 4:32-47.  One algorithm is trained Case 1:25-cv-00201-JFM     Document 30     Filed 07/15/25     Page 3 of 13 PageID #:\n<pageID>4 \n specifically to identify a particular property characteristic  — for instance, determining whether \nthe roof is  gambrel, gable, hipped, square, or flat .  See i d. at Fig. 2A, 1: 31-36, 8:50- 9:3, 24: 32-\n39.  The second, separate algorithm assesses the condition of that characteristic  — for example, \nevaluating whether the  roof is in good repair or shows signs of damage or deterioration.  See  id. \nat Fig. 2B, Fig. 2C, 10:9- 11:31, 16: 12-31, 24: 40-47.  The final step is outputting a “ risk \nestimate ,” which requires predicting how likely or severe damage to the property might be from  \nspecific disaster s or weather conditions, such as hurricane s or strong winds.  See i d. at 11:47-\n12:16, 24:48- 27.  According to the patent, this method helps  its users obtain a quick and \nconsisten t evaluat ion of  property risks based solely on aerial images.   See i d. at 2:6-11. \nZesty argues  that the method in claim 1 is directed to the  abstract idea of “looking at \naerial imagery to estimate risk .”  DI 19 at 5; DI 26 at 1- 2.  According to Zesty, the patent does \nnothing more than implement generic machine- learning technology to automate tasks \ntraditionally performed by human inspectors.  See DI 19 at 11.  Zesty analogizes  these claims to \nothers that courts have found ineligible for patent protection because they merely automated \nlongstanding human practices using conventional technology and we re not directed to \nimprovements in computer or machine -learning technology.  See id. at 1 -2, 6-7, 11, 13- 14 (citing \nRecentive Analytics, Inc. v. Fox Corp., 134 F.4th 1205 (Fed. Cir. 2025) ). \nAon responds that  Zesty failed to carry its burden of proving the abstractness of the \nclaims , and that  claim 1 is not abstract because it recites an “ improved computer architecture .”  \nSee DI 25.  According to Aon, the claim’s use of two distinct machine learning algorithms \nworking independently and simultaneously to identify different property information from the same image goes beyond merely  automating existing practices  with generic technology.  See id.  Case 1:25-cv-00201-JFM     Document 30     Filed 07/15/25     Page 4 of 13 PageID #:\n<pageID>5 \n at 9, 12-13 (citing McRO, Inc. v. Bandai Namco Games Am. Inc., 837 F.3d 1299, 1314-15 (Fed. \nCir. 2016)).  Instead, Aon argues, this approach meaningful ly improves the speed  and efficiency \nof property assessments compared to prior computer -implemented techniques.   Id. \nII. Legal Standard \nPatent eligibility under § 101 encompasses “any new and useful process, machine, \nmanufacture, or composition of matter, or any new and useful improvement thereof.”  35 U.S.C. § 101.  Abstract ideas, laws of nature, and natural phenomena are  “implicit exception [s]” to this \nbroad standard for eligibility.  See Alice Corp. Pty. v. CLS Bank Int’l , 573 U.S. 208, 216 (2014). \nTo determine patent eligibility, we apply the two -step framework established by the \nSupreme Court in Mayo  and Alice .  See  id. at 217 (citing Mayo Collaborative Servs. v. \nPrometheus Labs., Inc., 566 U.S. 66 (2012) ).  First, we evaluate whether the claim at issue is  \n“directed to a patent -ineligible concept” such as an abstract idea.   Id. at 217-18.  If not, the \ninquiry ends, and the claims are patent eligible.   If the claims are directed to a patent -ineligible \nabstract idea, we move to step two and ask whether the claims nonetheless contain an “inventive concept” — additional elements “ sufficient to transform the abstract idea into a patent- eligible \ninvention.”  Id.  at 221.   \nStep one requires us to consider the “focus of the claimed advance over the prior art to \ndetermine whether the claim’s  character as a whole is directed to excluded subject matter ,” such \nas, relevant here, an abstract idea.  Affinity Labs of Tex., LLC v. DIRECTV, LLC , 838 F.3d 1253, \n1257 (Fed. Cir. 2016) ( citation modified ).  There is no compendium of abstract ideas.   Instead, \nwe are encouraged to analyze the claim in context, drawing on analogies to past decisions when \npossible.  See Enfish, LLC v. Microsoft Corp., 822 F.3d 1327, 1334 (Fed. Cir. 2016) ; see also Case 1:25-cv-00201-JFM     Document 30     Filed 07/15/25     Page 5 of 13 PageID #:\n<pageID>6 \n Veeva Sys. Inc. v. Tact.ai Techs., Inc., No. 23 -1032, 2024 WL 2848335, at *4- 5 (D. Del. June 5, \n2024) .   \nPreemption is a crucial  concern underlying this comparative analysis .  See Alice , 573 \nU.S. at 216.  A claim that effectively forecloses all practical applications of an abstract idea risks \nimpeding, rather than promoting, future innovation.  See McRO , 837 F.3d at 1315.  And c ourts \noften consider the risk of  preemption in cases involving computer -implemented methods and \nsystems.  Because computers  are foundational tools  possessing near -universal applicability , \nclaims that invoke computer  technology in sweeping or generalized terms can effectively  \nmonopolize  its use in an entire area of invention.  Accordingly, we  must carefully distinguish \nbetween claims that merely harness generic computing tools to lay claim to an abstract idea, and \nthose that marshal  those tools in a specific, structured way to solve a concrete technological \nproblem.  See In re TLI Commc'ns LLC Pat. Litig., 823 F.3d 607, 611 (Fed. Cir. 2016)  (“[I]n \ndetermining whether the claims are directed to an abstract idea, we must be careful to avoid oversimplifying the claims because ‘ at some level, all inventions embody, use, reflect, rest  upon, \nor apply laws of nature, natural phenomena, or abstract ideas .’” (citation modified ) (quoting \nAlice , 573 U.S. at 217)) .  As courts have understood Alice , only the latter fall within the scope of \npatent -eligible subject matter.    \nAt one end of the spectrum, claims that describe routine steps and invoke generic \ncomputer tools  without identifying how the technology is applied in a specific or inventive way \nare typically found abstract .  See, e.g., Recentive, 134 F.4th at 1211- 13 (claims ineligible where \nthey generically applied machine learning to schedule TV content without explaining how models were inventively trained, structured, or implemented) ; Int'l Bus. Machs. Corp. v. Zillow Case 1:25-cv-00201-JFM     Document 30     Filed 07/15/25     Page 6 of 13 PageID #:\n<pageID>7 \n Grp., 50 F.4th 1371, 1380 -82 (Fed. Cir. 2022) ( claims ineligible where they used standard data \nvisualization tools to display real estate information without reciting any inventive \nimplementation ); ChargePoint, Inc. v. SemaConnect, Inc., 920 F.3d 759, 768- 70 (Fed. Cir. \n2019)  (claims ineligible where they recited remote control of electric vehicle charging stations \nover a network but failed to claim  any specific advance in networking , charging, or computing \ntechnology) . \nAt the other end of the spectrum , claims that solve specific  technical problem s, such as \nparticular improvements to the functioning of computers, networks, or software  that are useful \nfor an application of those technologies , are usually found eligible .  See McRO , 837 F.3d at \n1315- 16 (claims eligible where they used specific phoneme -to-morph rule sets to automate \nfacial animation, improving animation workflow through a  novel  algorithmic structure) ; \nKoninklijke KPN N.V. v. Gemalto M2M GmbH , 942 F.3d 1143, 1151- 52 (Fed. Cir. 2019)  \n(claims eligible where they applied defined permutations to transmitted data blocks to detect systematic errors, enhancing data integrity) ; CardioNet, LLC v. InfoBionic, Inc., 955 F.3d 1358, \n1371–72 (Fed. Cir. 2020)  (claims eligible where they used a specific sensor configuration and \nsignal -processing logic to improve detection of atrial fibrillation over conventional monitors).  \nThe common thread among these cases  finding eligibility  is that the claims recite more than a \nresult -oriented goal or functional description.  The claims pro vide solutions  in specific, non-\nconventional, or technical way s, confining the scope of the claims and avoid ing preemption. \nContesting patent eligibility under § 101 is an affirmative defense  of invalidity , and the \nburden of proving invalidity falls squarely upon Zesty , the movant .  See Commil USA, LLC v. \nCisco Sys., Inc., 575 U.S. 632, 644 (2015) ; 35 U.S.C. § 282(a).  Zesty must articulate with Case 1:25-cv-00201-JFM     Document 30     Filed 07/15/25     Page 7 of 13 PageID #:\n<pageID>8 \n specificity the alleged abstract idea and demonstrate that the asserted claims are directed to that \nidea.  Veeva , 2024 WL 2848335, at  *4-5.  Because, as discussed below, Zesty did not persuade \nus that the claims are directed to an abstract idea, our analysis does not proceed beyond step one.   \nIII. Analysis \nZesty argues that claim 1 of the 029 patent is directed to the abstract idea of “looking at \naerial imagery to estimate risk.”  DI 19 at 5; DI 26 at 1-2.  We confine our analysis to Zesty’s proposal because, as explained above, Zesty bears the burden of persuasion.   \nZesty’s position has some facial appeal .  Aon’s patents acknowledge that humans have \nvisually assessed property condition and estimated risks .  Further, Aon does not suggest that it \ninvented the computers and machine- learning classifiers mentioned in the claim.  But step one of \nthe Alice  inquiry demands more than a generalized assessment .  The relevant question is whether \nclaim 1, as drafted, merely invokes generic computing tools to carry out an established human practice, or whether it recites a specific and limited implementation that solves a concrete problem using technology in a defined way.  See Enfish , 822 F.3d at 1335-36; McRO , 837 F.3d \nat 1314-15. \nClaim 1 falls into the latter category  of patent -eligible implementations .  It does not \nbroadly claim evaluating risk using imagery.  Rather, i t recites  a process with a distinctive \nstructure: two separate and independently trained machine- learning classifiers that operate \nindependently.  One identifies a physical characteristic of a property (such as roof shape), and the other evaluates the condition of that same characteristic (such as signs of deterioration).  See 029 patent at 24:32-47; see also id. at 8:36-9:23, 10:9-11:31, 15:50-16:49.  Further, those classifiers must work by making use of pixel groupings obtained from digital images and Case 1:25-cv-00201-JFM     Document 30     Filed 07/15/25     Page 8 of 13 PageID #:\n<pageID>9 \n produce a specific output: “a condition assessment of the property characteristic including the \ncondition classification and the risk estimate of damage to the property due to the one or more disasters.”  Id. at 24: 27-31, 24: 54-57; see also id. at  11:47- 12:15, 16:50- 18:54. \nThis architecture is significant in the eligibility analysis .  As the patent explains, the \nseparate application of  two independently trained classifiers  provides  efficiency and reliability in \nidentif ying both the characteristic and that characteristic’s condition.   Id. at 9: 4-23, 11: 12-31.  \nThe claim thus implements  machine- learning technology in a specific way  to address a practical \ntechnical problem: how to accurately and quickly assess the physical characteristics and condition of a property from an aerial image using machine learning models.  See id.  at 2: 6-11. \nImportantly, claim 1 does not simply recite the  result  itself  or broadly direct the  use a \ncomputer and machine learning to do risk analysi s.  The claim’s  specificity distinguishes  it from \nclaims in other cases that were deemed  abstract for merely appl ying machine learning or data \nvisualization without disclosing any technology- specific method.  See Recentive, 134 F.4th at \n1212–13 (invalidating claims that “ do not delineate steps through which the machine learning \ntechnology achieves an improvement ”); Zillow , 50 F.4th at 1381 (claims ineligible where they \n“do[] not sufficiently describe how to achieve the [ir] results in a non- abstract way” (quoting \nTwo-Way Media Ltd. v. Comcast Cable Commc'ns, LLC , 874 F.3d 1329, 1337 (Fed. Cir. 2017) ). \nBriefly consider cases where claims were found to be abstract.  In Recentive, the patentee \nclaimed a method of optimizing event schedules using machine learning but failed to identify a specific technical implementation.   The claims broadly referenced iterative training and real -\ntime updating without specifying the “steps through which the machine learning technology achieves an improvement .”  Recentive, 134 F.4th at 1212- 13 (“Allowing a claim that Case 1:25-cv-00201-JFM     Document 30     Filed 07/15/25     Page 9 of 13 PageID #:\n<pageID>10 \n functionally describes a mere concept without disclosing how to implement that concept risks \ndefeating the very purpose of the patent system.”).   In Longitude Licensing, claims were found \nabstract because they recited broadly applying machine learning to information retrieval without detailing “ ‘how the purported invention improve[s] the functionality’ of image correction \nmethods.”  Longitude Licensing Ltd. v. Google LLC , No. 2024-1202, 2025 WL 1249136, at *2-3 \n(Fed. Cir. Apr. 30, 2025) (quoting Hawk Tech. Sys., LLC v. Castle Retail, LLC , 60 F.4th 1349, \n1358 (Fed. Cir. 2023)).  And in TLI , claims were ineligible because the patent “predominately \ndescribe[d] the system and methods in purely functional terms” and failed to provide details for how the components achieved any improvement over prior art.  823 F.3d at 612-13 (“ [The \nclaims] are directed to the use of conventional or generic technology in a nascent but well-known environment, without any claim that the invention reflects an inventive solution to any problem presented by combining the two.”).  \nIn contrast, claim 1 of the 029 patent recites  a concrete and specific technological \nsolution.  Rather than referring to  the use of machine learning  in general , the claim requires \nindividually trained classifiers that operate independently, performing separate and clearly defined  analytical  tasks: one classifier identifies a specific physical characteristic of a property \nfrom aerial imagery, and the other independently assesses the condition of that characteristic.  This division of labor, together with the requirement to analyze defined pixel groupings and produce risk  assessment outputs  based on the classifiers’ assessments , confirms  that the claim \nrepresents more than a generalized use of machine learning .  Although the patent does not \npurport to invent machine learning algorithms, computer hardware, or the general concept of aerial imagery analysis  or risk assessment , it does specifically define how these known Case 1:25-cv-00201-JFM     Document 30     Filed 07/15/25     Page 10 of 13 PageID #:\n<pageID>11 \n components must be structured to achieve a supposed technological improvement  in accuracy \nand efficiency  to the combination of those components . \nThis type of defined structural constraint closely aligns with the claims held eligible  in \nMcRO  and Koninklijke .  In McRO , the Federal Circuit  upheld claims that related to automating \nthe animation of lip synchronization by matching animated characters ’ mouth movements to \nspoken audio.  See McRO , 837 F.3d at 1314- 16.  Rather than merely instructing animators to \nsynchronize audio with animation using a computer generally, the claims required  a rule set  that \nestablished detailed relationships between spoken sounds and corresponding facial movements.  \nSee id.  While the  exact rules were not claimed, and the invention  employed  only “ general -\npurpose  computer s” and “limited mathematical rules ,” the claims nonetheless  defined how these \ncomponents work together  to achieve automated lip synchronization.  Id.  at 1314.  Thus, the \ncourt found the claims eligible because they covered  a concrete technological method for \nautomating animation, rather than claiming the mere result of  lip synchronization.  See id .   \nSimilarly, in Koninklijke , the claims described a method of improving error detection in \ndata transmissions.  Prior error detection systems sometimes failed to detect a certain type of \npersistent error.  To solve this problem, the claims required varying the way error -checking data \nwas generated by applying different permutations  (rearrangements of data bits ) to different \nblocks of transmitted data over time.  Koninklijke , 942 F.3d at 1150- 52.  Rather than merely \nclaiming the abstract idea of error detection or calling for  permutation  generally , the requirement \nthat permutation s be modified in time  provided a sufficiently specific way of  detect ing persistent \nerrors .  See id.  at 1152.  \nHere, the independent training and distinct analytical roles assigned to each of the two Case 1:25-cv-00201-JFM     Document 30     Filed 07/15/25     Page 11 of 13 PageID #:\n<pageID>12 \n machine learning classifiers provide a structured technological method specific to  analyzing \npixel groups in aerial imagery for property risk assessments .  Like the claims  upheld in McRO  \nand Koninklijke , claim 1 clearly defines how known technological components must be \nspecifically structured and combined, rather than broadly claiming a purported abstract idea of \napplying machine learning to aerial images to assess risk .  By assigning separate and clearly \ndefined analytical tasks  to the  two independently trained classifiers, claim 1 provides a particular  \nstructured solution that the patent says is accurate  and efficien t.  Thus, claim 1 is not directed to \nthe abstract idea advanced by Zesty.  \nThis conclusion is not contrary to Recentive’s holding “that patents that do no more than \nclaim the application of generic machine learning to new data environments, without disclosing improvements to the machine learning models to be applied, are patent ineligible under § 101.”  134 F.4th at 1215- 16.  To be sure, Aon or a similarly situated patent owner could follow that \nroute to patent eligibility and claim specific improvements to the machine -learning models \nuseful for addressing property risk assessment.  But another route to eligibility, as we have explained , is claiming a specifically arranged implementation of machine learning , analogous to \nthe patent -eligible arrangements  of McRO  and Koninklijke .  Those two decisions were not \nhelpful to the Recentive court , because in Recentive, the Federal Circuit viewed the claims as \nreciting only generic machine learning rather than a purportedly novel arrangement.  Id.  at 1213 \n(distinguishing McRO  and Koninklijke ). \nOur holding is also consistent with the preemption concerns discussed in Alice and its \nprogeny.  Claims should not risk monopolizing an entire field by claiming an abstract idea in functional or result -oriented terms.  See Alice, 573 U.S. at 216.  Zesty has not persuaded us that Case 1:25-cv-00201-JFM     Document 30     Filed 07/15/25     Page 12 of 13 PageID #:\n<pageID>13 \n Aon’s claims pose  such a risk.  Claim 1 of the 029 patent  requires a specific classifier \narrangement  that must analyze  pixels from aerial images in a defined sequence to generate risk \nassessments.  Zesty does not explain why this fails to leave room for alternative methods, and \nthe record, albeit very limited at this stage, appears to suggest the opposite conclusion.  See McRO , 837 F.3d at 1315- 16 (“[T]he description of one set of rules does not mean that there \nexists only one set of rules, and does not support the view that other possible types of rules with different characteristics do not exist. ”).  Nor does this holding run afoul of Alice ’s warning \nagainst narrow (yet still ineligible) abstract ideas because Zesty never suggested that  Aon’s two -\nclassifier structure  was itself an ineligible abstract idea.   See Alice, 573 U.S. at 220. \nClaim 1 is not particularly hard to understand; Aon does not pretend that it is.  B ut \nintricacy  must not be  the principa l measure of eligibility  — why should elegant inventions be \nprejudiced?   Claim 1 presents a targeted, technical solution to a specific problem and reflect s \nmore than a generic invocation of machine learning.   Thus, it is directed to patent -eligible  \nsubject matter .  And because Zesty has not shown that claim 1 is directed to an abstract idea, our \nAlice  inquiry ends at step one .  The motion to dismiss is denied.  An appropriate accompanying \norder follow s. Case 1:25-cv-00201-JFM     Document 30     Filed 07/15/25     Page 13 of 13 PageID #:\n<pageID>",

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: Shared.com, a Canadian online content creator, filed a lawsuit against Meta Platforms, Inc., alleging breach of contract and misrepresentation tied to their use of Facebook for advertising and monetization. Shared claimed they were unfairly restricted from Facebook services and did not receive due notice of such restrictions or sufficient explanations for ad rejections, resulting in financial losses. The court partially granted and partially denied Meta's motion to dismiss, allowing some claims to proceed despite Meta’s defenses under the Communications Decency Act.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether Meta's actions in restricting Shared.com's access and failing to provide adequate notice and explanations as per the contractual terms were legally actionable or protected under section 230(c)(1) of the Communications Decency Act.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court held that section 230(c)(1) immunity shielded Meta from liability regarding the removal of Shared's content, but claims related to Meta’s failure to provide procedural obligations outlined in their contracts, such as notices and payment timing, were not barred and could proceed.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine you run a YouTube channel and you pay YouTube to show your videos to more people. YouTube suddenly stops you from using some of its services without telling you why, and when they do, it’s very vague, making it hard for you to fix issues with your videos. You sue YouTube because these actions hurt your business. The court agrees with some of your claims and says you should get a chance to prove if YouTube broke its promises to you in the contracts you both agreed on, but other claims are dismissed because YouTube is mainly protected by a law that gives it a lot of freedom in managing content on its platform.",

INTRODUCTION  \n Plaintiff Shared.com  (“Shared”)  is an online content creator that was, for many years, \ndeeply engaged in the Facebook advertising ecosystem . This suit arose following a series of \nalleged  incidents that effectively barred Shared from using, advertising on, and monetizing from \nthe social media platform.  The operative First Amended Complaint (“FAC ”) avers breach of \ncontract, misrepresentation, and several other acts of misconduct by Defendant Meta Platforms, \nInc. (“Meta ”). Meta now moves to dismiss the  FAC  for failure to state a claim .  \nThe motion is granted in part and denied  in part.  Some of Plaintiff’s claims are barred by \nsection 230(c)(1) of the Communications Decency Act . The remaining claims, however, have \nbeen adequately pleaded.  \nII.

ESPN , 393 F.3d 1068, 1072 (9th Cir. 2005), all facts Case 3:22-cv-02366-RS     Document 31     Filed 09/21/22     Page 1 of 12 \nORDER ON MOTION TO DISMISS  \nCASE NO.  22-cv-02366 -RS \n2 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California   Shared is a partnership based out of Ontario, Canada that “creates and publishes original, \ntimely, and entertaining [online] content .” Dkt. 21  ¶ 9. In addition to its own web site, Plaintiff also \noperated a series of Facebook pages from 2006 to 2020. During this period, Shared avers that its \npages amassed approximately 25 million Facebook followers, helped in part by its substantial \nengagement with  Facebook ’s “advertising  ecosy stem .” This engag ement occurred in two ways. \nFirst, Shared directly purchased “self -serve ads ,” which helped drive traffic to Shared.com and \nShared’s Facebook pages. Second, Shared participated in a monetization program called “Instant \nArticles,” in which articles  from Shared.com would be embedded  into and operate  within the \nFacebook news feed ; Facebook would then embed  ads from other businesses into th ose articles \nand give Shared a portion of the ad revenue. Shared “invested heavily in content  creation” and \nretained personnel and software specifically to help it maximize its impact on the social media \nplatform.  Id. ¶ 19. \n Friction between Shared and Facebook began in 2018. Shared states  that it lost access to \nInstant Articles on at least three occasions b etween April and November of that year. Importantly, \nShared received no advance notice that it would lose access. This was contrary to Shared’s averred  \nunderstanding of the Facebook Audience Network Terms ( “the FAN Terms”), which provide that \n“[Facebook] may change, withdraw, or discontinue [access to Instant Articles] in its sole \ndiscretion and [Facebook] will use good faith efforts to provide Publisher with notice of the \nsame.”  Id. ¶ 22; accord  Dkt. 21 -5. Shared asserts that “notice,” as provided in the FAN Terms, \nobliges  Facebook to provide advance  notice of a forthcoming loss of access, rather than after -the-\nfact notice.  \n During th is same timeframe, Facebook also failed to make a timely payment from Instant \nArticles ad revenue. Another clause in the FAN Terms (“the FAN payment term”)  provides that  \nFacebook would forward money earned through Instant Articl es “approximately 21 days \nfollowing the end of the calendar m onth in which the transaction occurred.” Dkt. 21  ¶ 26; accord \n \nin this section are taken from the FAC , unless otherwise  noted .

Facebook delayed paying  Shared its portion of April 2018 ad revenue until September \n2018, roughly four months beyond the timeframe noted  in the FAN payment term . This delay  led \nto a critical shortage in Shared ’s operating capital , ultimately resulting in  its decision to  lay off \neighteen  employees.  \n Meanwhile, all was not well with Shared’s self-serve ad  buys . Shared notes that, “[o]ver \nthe course of its relationship with Facebook, Shared had numerous ads arbitrarily and incorrectly \nrejected without explanation.” Dkt. 21  ¶ 47. Facebook’s  Advertising Policies, which governed the \nself-serve ad program, had provided that if an ad was rejected, Facebook would send the publishe r \n“an email with details  that explain why. Using the information in [the] disapproval email, you can \nedit your ad and create a compliant one.”  Id. ¶ 45; accord Dkt. 21 -4, at 2. Shared expected to \nreceive specific  explanations  when its ads were rejected , but each time it instead received a \n“circ ular” explanation simply stating that the ad had been rejected for failing to comply with the \nAdvertising Policies.  Dkt. 21 ¶ 102 . \n All of these tensions were brought to a head in October 2020  when  Facebook “unpublished \nthe Shared Facebook pages, suspended  Shared’s ability to advertise,” and disabled Shared ’s ad \naccounts as well as the  personal Facebook profiles of several Shared employees . Id. ¶ 42. While \nthe Facebook Terms of Service  stated that accounts could be suspended only after “clearly, \nseriously  or repeatedly ” breach ing Facebook’s policies , id. ¶ 49, Shared states that, to its \nknowledge, it had not violated any such policies.  These actions  “effectively gave Shared a death \nsentence within the Facebook system,” resulting in its business and its multimillion -dollar  \nvaluation “cratering.”  Id. ¶¶ 43, 51 . \n Shared sued Meta, Facebook’s parent company, in July 2022. The  FAC  raises six claims \nfor relief, some of which have multiple factual bases.  First, Shared avers that Meta committed \nconve rsion  (Claim 1) , breach of contract  (Claim 3) , and breach of the implied covenant of good \nfaith and fair dealing (Claim  4) in suspending access  to Shared’s Facebook pages , contrary to  the \nFacebook Terms of Service . Second, Shared avers that Meta committed breach of contract  (Claim \n3), breach of the  implied covenant  of good faith and fair dealing  (Claim 4) , and intentional Case 3:22-cv-02366-RS     Document 31     Filed 09/21/22     Page 3 of 12 \nORDER ON MOTION TO DISMISS  \nCASE NO.  22-cv-02366 -RS \n4 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  misrepresentation  (Claim 5)  or negligent misrepresentation (Claim 6) for failing to provide \nadvance notice of suspension from Instant Articles, contrary to  the FAN Terms. Third, Shared \navers that Meta commit ted breach of contract  (Claim 3) , intentional misrepresentation  (Claim 5)  or \nnegligent misrepresentation  (Claim 6) , and violated California ’s Unfair Competition Law (“UCL”)  \n(Claim 2) , see Cal. Bus. & Prof. Cod § 17200, for failing to provide sufficient det ails regarding ad \nrejections  in violation of  the Ad vertising Policies . Fourth, Shared avers that Meta committed \nbreach of contract (Claim 3) for failing to deliver the April 2018 payment on time  in violation of \nthe FAN payment term . Meta now move s to dismiss the FAC  in its entirety.  \nIII. LEGAL STANDARD  \nFede ral Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6)  governs motions to dismiss for failure to state a \nclaim . A complaint must include “a  short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader \nis entitled to relief.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2). While “detailed factual allegations” are not required, a \ncomplaint must have sufficient factual allegations to “state a claim to relief that i s plausible on its \nface.” Ashcroft v. Iqbal , 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) (quoting Bell Atlantic v. Twombly , 550 U.S. \n544, 570 (2007)).  When evaluating such a motion, courts generally “accept all factual allegations \nin the complaint as true and construe the pl eadings in the light most favorable to the nonmoving \nparty .” Knievel v. ESPN , 393 F.3d 1068, 1072 (9th Cir. 2005).  However, “[t]hreadbare recitals of \nthe elements of a cause of action, supported by mere conclusory statements, do not suffice.” Iqbal , \n556 U. S. at 678.   \nFor actions sounding in fraud, the complaint  “must state with particularity the \ncircumstances constituting fraud or mistake. ” Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(b). Such averments “ must be \naccompanied by ‘the who, what, when, where, and how’ of the misconduct c harged ,” such that \nthey are “specific enough to give defendants notice of the particular misconduct.” Kearns v. Ford \nMotor Co. , 567 F.3d 1120, 1124 (9th Cir. 2009) (first quoting Vess v. Ciba -Geigy Corp. USA , 317 \nF.3d 1097, 1106 (9th Cir. 2003); and then q uoting Bly-Magee v. California , 236 F.3d 1014, 1019 \n(9th Cir. 2001)). Knowledge may be pleaded generally under Rule 9(b), but the complaint “must \nset out sufficient factual matter from which a defendant’s knowledge of a fraud might reasonably Case 3:22-cv-02366-RS     Document 31     Filed 09/21/22     Page 4 of 12 \nORDER ON MOTION TO DISMISS  \nCASE NO.  22-cv-02366 -RS \n5 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  be inferred.”  United States ex rel. Anita Silingo v. WellPoint, Inc. , 904 F.3d 667, 679 –80 (9th Cir. \n2018).  \nIV. ANALYSIS  \n To survive Defendants’ motion to dismiss, each of Plaintiff’s claims must overcome three \nhurdles: first, they must not be barred by section 230 (c)(1) of the Communications Decency Act ; \nsecond, they must not be barred by the Limits  on Liability within the Facebook Terms of Service ; \nand third, they must be sufficiently pled. After reviewing the FAC , not every claim can overcome \nall three, so each hurdle is addressed in turn.  \nA. Section 230 (c)(1) Immunity  \nCongress  passed the Communications Decency Act  in an effort to create and promote a \nvibrant digital communications landscape . Among other things, section 230(c)(1) of the Act \ngenerally exempts “information content providers ” from liability for information provided by third \nparties. See, e.g. , Barnes v. Yahoo!, Inc. , 570 F.3d 1096, 1099 –100 (9th Cir. 2009). The section  \nstates  that “[n] o provider or user of an interactive  computer service shall be treate d as the  \npublisher or speaker of any information  provided by another information content  provider. ” 47 \nU.S.C. § 230(c)(1). While this immunity is broad, it is not absolute. As the Ninth Circuit clarified \nin Barnes v. Yahoo!, Inc. , the relevant inquiry is n ot how plaintiff s style their claim s for relief, but \nrather “ whether the duty that the plaintiff  alleges the defendant violated derives  from the \ndefendant’s status or conduct as a  ‘publisher or speaker.’ ” 570 F.3d at 1102.  If the plaintiff alleges \nthat liability arises from  the defendant’s “manifest intention to be legally obligated to do \nsomething,” rather than from the defendant’s “status or conduct as a ‘publisher or speaker,’” \nsection 230(c)(1) does not apply. Id. at 1107; see In re Zoom Video Co mmc’ns. Inc. Privacy \nLitigation , 525 F. Supp. 3d 1017, 1034 (N.D. Cal. 2021).  \nDefendant argues that all of Plaintiff’s claims are barred by section 230(c)(1).  It assert s, \nand Plaintiff does not contest, that Meta is a “provider . . . of an interactive computer service” \nunder the Act’s definition, and that the relevant information at issue was “provided by another \ninformation content provider.” 47 U.S.C. § 230(c)(1); see Dkt. 24, at 22. Defendant further argues Case 3:22-cv-02366-RS     Document 31     Filed 09/21/22     Page 5 of 12 \nORDER ON MOTION TO DISMISS  \nCASE NO.  22-cv-02366 -RS \n6 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  that each of Plaintiff’s claims seek to treat Meta as a “publisher or speaker,” and that the suit must \ntherefore fail  in its entirety .  \nDefendant is only partially correct. Plaintiff raises three claims involving Defendant’s \ndecision to suspend Plaintiff’s access to its Facebook accounts  and t hus “terminate [its] ability to \nreach its followers ”: one for conversion, one for breach of contract, and one for breach of the \nimplied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. See Dkt. 21, ¶¶ 54–63, 110 –12, 119. Shared  \nclaims  that, contrary to the Facebook  Terms of Service, Defendant suspended Shared ’s access to \nits Facebook pages without first determining whether it had “clearly, seriously or repeatedly \nbreached  [Facebook’s ] Terms or Policies. ” At bottom, these claims seek to hold Defendant liable  \nfor its decision to remove third -party content from Facebook. This is a quintessential editorial \ndecision of the type that is “perforce immune under section 230.” Barnes , 570 F.3d at 1102  \n(quoting Fair Housing Co uncil of San Fernando Valley v. Roommates .com , 521 F.3d 1157,  1170 –\n71 (9th Cir. 2008) (en banc )). Ninth Circu it courts hav e reached  this conclusion on numerous \noccasions . See, e.g. , King v. Facebook, Inc. , 572 F. Supp. 3d 776, 795 (N.D. Cal. 2021) ; Atkinson  \nv. Facebook Inc. , 20-cv-05546 -RS (N.D. Cal. Dec. 7, 2020) ; Fed. Agency of News LLC v. \nFacebook, Inc. , 395 F. Supp. 3d 1295, 1306 –07 (N.D. Cal. 2019) . To the extent Facebook ’s Terms \nof Service outline a set of  criteria  for suspending accounts  (i.e., when accounts have “clearly, \nseriously, or repeatedly” breached Facebook’s policies) , this s imply restates Meta’s  ability to \nexercise editorial discretion.  Such a restatement does not,  thereby , waive  Defendant’s section \n230(c)(1) immunity. See King , 572 F. Supp. 3d at 795. Allowing  Plaintiff to reframe the harm as \none of lost data, rather than suspended ac cess, would simply authorize a convenient shortcut \nthrough section 230 ’s robust liability limitations  by way of cle ver pleading . Surely this cannot be \nwhat Congress would have intended.  As such, these claims must be dismiss ed. \nThe remaining claims, however, do not seek to treat Defendant as a publisher or speaker. \nThey arise instead out of promises that Plaintiff argues  Defendant made to its advertising partners.  \nWith respect to the FAN Terms, Plaintiff’s claims are rooted in Defendant’s averred violation of \nits promise to provide “notice.” Plaintiff similarly seeks  to hold Defendant liable for its averred Case 3:22-cv-02366-RS     Document 31     Filed 09/21/22     Page 6 of 12 \nORDER ON MOTION TO DISMISS  \nCASE NO.  22-cv-02366 -RS \n7 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  violation of its promise to provide “details that explain why” Plaintiff’s ads were rejected . In both \ncases, Plaintiff does not question Defendant’s right or ability to limit access to the Facebook ad \nplatform or to remove the ads; rather, Plaintiff objects to what it argues were  deficiencies  in the \nprocedure described in Facebook’s contracts . Cf. id. (“That Facebook  has the editorial discretion \nto post or remov e content has littl e do to with the  implied promise to explain why content  was \nremoved. ”). Additionally, Plaintiff’s  breach of contract claim involving the FAN payment term \nclearly has nothing to do with Facebook’s editorial capabilities,  but rather involves its obligations \nto pay ad partners in a timely fashion . These claims, therefore, are not subject to section 230(c)(1) \nimmunity.  \nB. Facebook’s Limit s on Liability  \nDefendant next argues that many of Plaintiff’s claims for damages are barred under the \nLimits on Liability (“the limitations  provision ”) included in Facebook’s Terms of Service. In \nrelevant part, the Terms state the following : \n \n[Facebook’s] liability shall be limited to the fullest extent permitted \nby applicable law, and under no circumstance will we be liable to you \nfor any lost profits,  revenues, information, or data, or consequential, \nspecial, indirect, exemplary, punitive, or  incidental damages  arising \nout of or related to these Terms or the Facebook Products, even if  we \nhave been advised of the possibility of such damages . \nDkt. 21, Ex. 11 § 3 . Courts have generally enforced such  limitations  provisions , so long  as they \nare not unconscionable .2  See, e.g. , Food Safety Net Servs. v. Eco Safe Sys. USA, Inc., 147 Cal. \nRptr. 3d 634, 6 41–42 (Ct. App. 2012). However , as Plainti ff correctly observes, California  law \nrenders  limitations provisions unenforceable against claims for fraud  or willful injury . See Cal. \nCiv. Code § 1668.  The limitations  provision therefore cannot stand in the way of Claims 2, 5, and \n6, as they all aver some form of fraud by Defendant.  \n \n2 Plaintiff summarily avers in the FAC that the limitations  provision is  unconscionable. Dkt. 21 \n¶ 113. Plaintiff further states in its Opposition that it “reserves to argue unconscionability as th e \ncase progresses.” Dkt. 25 , at 21 n.6. Since Plaintiff has thus far not meaningfully argued that the \nlimitations  provision is , in fact, unconscionable , this Order assumes the provision is  enforceable.  Case 3:22-cv-02366-RS     Document 31     Filed 09/21/22     Page 7 of 12 \nORDER ON MOTION TO DISMISS  \nCASE NO.  22-cv-02366 -RS \n8 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  For the remaining claims, the limitation s provision  present s a possible  obstacle, because it \nlimits Plaintiff’s potential relief. Plaintiff argues it would be  more appropriate to defer  resolving \nthis question until a later sta ge in the litigation , given that  the distinction between general (or \ndirect) damages and consequential  (or indirect)  damages is “relative not ab solute .” While the \ndistinction between the se two forms of damages might  not be quite as nebulous as Plaintiff \nsuggests, the point  is well taken. Given that each of the claims plausibly avers that Shared was \nharmed a s a result of Defendant ’s conduct,  the discovery process would  aid in determin ing more \nconcre tely whether each claim  avers direct or indirect damages . The limitations provision  will \ntherefore not mandate dismissal of any of Plaintif f’s claims, though Defendant can always reassert  \nthe limitations provision  in, for example, a motion for summary judgme nt. \nC. Sufficient Pleadings  \nFinally, every claim must make a minimum showing of plausibility in order to survive a \nmotion to dismiss, and Rule 9(b) further requires claims sounding in fraud  to be pleaded with \nparticularity . The surviving po rtions of Claims 3 and 4 are discussed first; Claim 2 is discussed \nsecond; and Claims 5 and 6 are discussed third.  \n1. Breach of Contract & Implied Covenant Claims : FAN Terms  \nPlaintiff claims  that Defendant breached the FAN Terms by failing to provide Shared wi th \nadvance notice that its access to Instant Articles would be suspended. Plaintiff further argues that, \nto the extent the FAN Terms did not necessarily require Defendant to provide advance notice, \nFacebook’s  failure to do so would still constitute a breac h of the implied covenant of good faith \nand fair dealing. Defendant, in response, contests Plaintiff’s interpretation of the FAN Terms and \nargues that no breach occurred because  (a) it was not required to offer “advance” notice at all and \n(b) it did, in fa ct, offer after -the-fact notice.  \nThe main dispute, then, turns largely on the interpretation of the FAN Terms themselves. \nContrary to Defendant’s contention, the FAN Terms a re not self -evidently clear: “notice” is \nsusceptible to both interpretations ( i.e., “adva nce” notice and “after-the-fact” notice). See, e.g. , \nNotice , MERRIAM -WEBSTER , https://www.merriam -webster.com/dictionary/notice  (defining Case 3:22-cv-02366-RS     Document 31     Filed 09/21/22     Page 8 of 12 \nORDER ON MOTION TO DISMISS  \nCASE NO.  22-cv-02366 -RS \n9 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  “notice” as both “the announcement of a party’s intention to quit an agreement or relation at a \nspecified time” and “the condition of being warned or notified . . . ”). Accepting Plaintiff’s \ncontentions as true, as the law requires, Plaintiff ha s adequately pleaded these criteria. Plaintiff has \nalso adequately pleaded proximate causation between the averred breach and the damages that \nensued  — namely by precluding Shared’s ability to pivot to other forms of content creation. The \nmotion is there fore denied as to these portions of Claims 3 and 4 . \n2. Breach of Contract: Advertising Policies  \nPlaintiff similarly avers, in Claim 3, that Defendant breached the terms of the Advertising \nPolicies by not provid ing sufficient “details that explain[ed] why” Plaintiff’s ads were rejected \nfrom Facebook . As with the averred breach of the FAN Terms, Defendant  moves to dismiss \nprimarily on the grounds that the clear terms of the Advertising Policies d id not require \nexplanations “sufficient  for Shared to bring its ads into compliance”  and that Defendant  did, in \nfact, provide details — the details being  that the ads were suspended for violating the Advertising \nPolicies. This dispute , once more,  turns largely on contract interpretation , and a gain, Plainti ff’s \ninterpretation is plausible . Plaintiff has also adequately pleaded proximate causation between the \naverred breach and damages  — namely, that Plaintiff wasted money on ads it would otherwise not \nhave purchased. The motion is therefore denied as to this  portion of Claim 3.  \n3. California UCL Claim  \nPlaintiff avers, in Claim 2, that Defendant violated the UCL, which prohibits “ unlawful, \nunfair or fraudulent  business practices.” Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code § 17200. Specifically, Plaintiff \ncontends  that Defendant’s failure to provide “details that explain why” ads were rejected violated  \nboth the “fraudulent” and “unfair” prongs of the UCL. “Because the statute is written in the \ndisjunctive, . . . [e]ach prong of the UCL is a separat e and distinct theory of liability.” Lozano v. \nAT&T Wireless Servs., Inc. , 504 F.3d 718, 731 (9th Cir. 2007).  \na. “Fraudu lent” Prong  \nIn order to prevail on a UCL claim under  the “fraudulent” prong, Plaintiff must satisfy the \n“reasonable consumer” standard : it must show that “members of the public are likely to be Case 3:22-cv-02366-RS     Document 31     Filed 09/21/22     Page 9 of 12 \nORDER ON MOTION TO DISMISS  \nCASE NO.  22-cv-02366 -RS \n10 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  deceived.” I.B. ex rel. Fife v. Facebook, Inc. , 905 F. Supp. 2d 989, 1011 (N.D. Cal. 2012). Since \nthis claim sounds in fraud, Rule 9(b) requires that the claim be stated with particularity. Here, \nPlaintiff has met its burden. Shared argues  that the Advertising Policies themselves contained a \nfraudulent statement — i.e., that ad partners would be provided with sufficient details to bring \ntheir rejected ads into conformity with Facebook’s policies. It is plausible that a reasonable \nconsumer would concur with Shared’s interpretation of the Policies, notwithstanding Defendant’s \ncontrary interpretation. Indeed, Plaintiff support s this interpretation by offering examples of \nnumerous  other ad partners that faced similar frustration in using Facebook’s self -serve ads. See \nDkt. 21 , ¶¶ 75 –86. It is similarly plausible, at the very least, that Defendant knew or should have \nknown that it could not comply with this expectation  due to  its averred  reliance on artificial  \nintelligence . While Plaintiff does not state who specifically at Shared read the Policies, or on what \nparticular dates they read them, the FAC  states  that Plaintiff did read the Advertising Policies \n“[p]rior to deciding to advertise and/or continue a dvertising on Facebook.”  In combination, this \nsuffices to satisfy Rule 9(b)’s heightened pleading standards. Plaintiff has therefore stated a claim \nunder the “fraudulent” prong of the UCL , and the motion is denied in this respect . \nb. “Unfair ” Prong  \nAt present, California courts have “adopt [ed] three different tests for determining  \nunfairness in the consumer contex t.” Nationwide Biweekly Admin., In c. v. Sup er. Ct. of Alam eda \nCnty. , 462 P.3d 461, 472 (Cal. 2020).  Under the “balancing test ,” the court must e xamine the \nimpact of a n alleged  unfair practice on its victim, “balanced against the reasons, justificat ions and \nmotives of the alleged wrongdo er.” Id. at 472 n.10; see also In re Anthe m, Inc. Data Breach \nLitigation , 162 F. Supp. 3d 953, 990 (N.D. Cal. 2016)  (balancing test involves considering \nwhether plaintiff “alleg [ed] immoral, unethical, oppressive,  unscrupulous , or substantially \ninjurious conduct by Defendant[] ”). Some courts apply a differen t, three -part balancin g test, under \nwhich “(1) [t]he consumer injury must be substantial; (2) the injury must not be outweighed by \nany countervailing benefits  to consumers or competition; and (3) it must be an injury that \nconsumers themselves could not reasonably have avoided.”  Nationwide , 462 P.3d at 472 n.10. Case 3:22-cv-02366-RS     Document 31     Filed 09/21/22     Page 10 of 12 \nORDER ON MOTION TO DISMISS  \nCASE NO.  22-cv-02366 -RS \n11 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  Finally, t he “tethering test ” requires the plain tiff to show that “the public policy which is a \npredicate  to a consumer unfair competition action under the ‘unfair’ prong of the UCL [is] \ntethered to specific constitutional, statutory, or regulatory provisions.”  In re Adobe  Sys., Inc. \nPrivacy Litigation , 66 F. Supp. 3d 1197, 1226 (N.D. Cal. 2014).  \nHere, Plaintiff argues that Defendant’s conduct is unfair  because,  by failing to provide \nsatisfact ory explanations  for ad rejections , Defendant  “provide[d] advertising services at a lower \ncost, and .  . . made those advertising services appear to be more valuable than they were. ” Dkt. 21  \n¶ 74. Plaintiff suggests  this was due to Defendant ’s “over-reliance on artificia l intelligence ” in ad \nregulation,  which allowed Facebook to “maximize its profits ” rather than provide adequate \nexplanations.  Id. ¶¶ 71, 74.  Plaintiff also argues  Defendant ’s conduct was “contrary to legislatively \ndeclared public policies that seek to protect consumers from misleading statements. ” Id. ¶ 72.  \nPlaintiff has made an adequate sho wing that Def endant ’s conduct was “unfair ” under the \ntethering test. While this  claim  essentially overlaps with P laintiff ’s claim under the “fraudulent ” \nprong , Defendant is incorrect in arguing that this would require  dismissal: “unfair ” prong claims \nthat overlap with claims under another  UCL prong  need only be dismissed “if the claims under the \nother . . . prongs of the UCL do no t survive.” Hadley v. Kellogg Sales  Co., 243 F. S upp. 3d 1074, \n1104–05 (N.D. Cal. 2017)  (emphasis added) ; see also  Punian v. Gillette Co. , 2016 WL 1029607, \nat *17 (N.D. Cal. Mar. 15, 201 6). As noted above, Plaintiff  has stated a vali d claim under the \n“fraudulent ” prong, so its claim under the “unfair ” prong may proceed since  it has articulated a \nspecific state policy that Defendant has allegedly violated .3 The mo tion to dismiss the UCL claim \nunder the “unfair ” prong is therefore denied.  \n4. Misrepresentation  Claims  \nFinally, Plaintiff avers, in Claims 5 and 6, that Defendant  misrepresented to Plaintiff that it \nwould receive both “advance notice” that it would lose access to Instant Articles, and that it would \n \n3 Plaintiff ’s “unfair” prong claim therefore rises and falls with its “fraudulent ” prong claim. Th is \nOrder expresses no opinion as to whether Plaintiff has adequately pleaded a  claim under the \n“unfair ” prong  for reasons other than Defendant ’s allegedly misleading conduct.   Case 3:22-cv-02366-RS     Document 31     Filed 09/21/22     Page 11 of 12 \nORDER ON MOTION TO DISMISS  \nCASE NO.  22-cv-02366 -RS \n12 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  receive sufficient “details  that explain why” its ads were rejected. The latter argument overlaps \nalmost entirely with  Claim 2, and these two claims must therefore rise or fall together. Given that \nPlaintiff satisfactorily stated a claim under the “fraudulent ” prong of the UCL, it has also stated a \nplausible claim for misrepresentation with respect to the Advertising Polici es.  \nAs to the FAN Terms and the lack of adequate notice, the reasoning above applies here as \nwell. Although Plaintiff does not state who at Shared actually read the FAN Terms, the FAC  \nnevertheless states that Shared “reasonably relied on [the FAN Te rms] in connection with its \ndecision” to invest in and utilize Instant Articles. Dkt. 21 ¶ 131. The FAC  therefore avers \nDefendant’s wrongful conduct with sufficient particularity to satisfy Rule 9(b), and Defendant’s \nmotion is therefore denied with respect to Claim s 5 and 6.4 \nV. CONCLUSION  \n Based on the foregoing a nalysis, the motion to dismiss is granted in part  and otherwise \ndenied . Claim 1 is dismissed  without leave to amend ; Claim 3 is dismissed with respect to the \nTerms of Service , with out leave to amend ; and Claim 4 is dismissed  with respect to the Terms of \nService , without leave to amend .

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: In the case, plaintiffs consisting of Facebook advertisers accuse Meta Platforms, Inc. (formerly Facebook, Inc.) of violating antitrust laws by monopolizing the social advertising market, leading to inflated ad prices. The plaintiffs claim Meta used a variety of anticompetitive tactics, including integrating artificial intelligence and machine learning models, to maintain its dominance. The court denied Meta's motion to dismiss, allowing the case to proceed based on the plausibility of the plaintiffs' claims.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: The core legal issue is whether Meta engaged in monopolistic practices in violation of sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act, specifically through actions that include integrating AI and machine learning to stifle competition and maintain a stranglehold on the social advertising market.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court denied Meta's motion to dismiss the plaintiffs' claims, finding that the amended complaint contained sufficient and plausible allegations of anticompetitive conduct, which included the use of AI and ML technologies, that merit further examination through litigation.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine if one big toy store in town started buying out all other toy stores and using secret tools to make sure only they sold certain popular toys. This made them the only choice for buying toys, so they could charge higher prices. Some people who buy toys for their stores are upset and complained. The judge said the complaint shows enough reasons to go forward and investigate if this big toy store really played unfairly using its secret tools, including artificial intelligence, to keep competitors out.",

(Meta) , which  was rebranded from Facebook, Inc.   The allegations \nin the complaints are directed at the Facebook social networking service, and the Court will us e \nFacebook for clarity.  One plaintiff group consists of Facebook users, who call themselves \n“consumers.”  They allege that Facebook illegally acquired and maintained “a stranglehold on the \nSocial Network and Social Media Markets.”  Dkt. No. 87 ¶ 3 (consol idated consumer class action \ncomplaint).  The consumer complaint is not in issue for present purposes.   \nThe focus here is on the other plaintiff  group , namely individuals and entities who bough t \nadvertising on Facebook.  They allege that they paid artificially inflated ad prices as a result of \nFacebook’s illegal monopolization of “the market for social advertising.”  Dkt. No. 391 ¶ 1 (first \namended consolidated advertiser  class action  complaint)  (FAC) .1  They allege  three  claims: \nmonopolization and attempted monopolization in violation of Section 2 of the Sherman Act, 15 \n \n1 The advertisers’ complaint ha s a rather tortured  ECF docket history because the advertisers  filed \na redacted version that the Court determined w as overdone.  The first amended consolidated \nadvertiser complaint was originally file d at Dkt. No. 237.  The Court rejected the overbroad \nredactions.  Dkt. No. 344.  A revised first amended complaint was refiled pursuant to the order at \nDkt. No. 353 -1.  Dkt. No.  391 is a separate ECF entry for No. 353 -1, and is the operative  \ncomplaint for the advertiser group.   Case 3:20-cv-08570-JD     Document 396     Filed 12/06/22     Page 1 of 4 \n2 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  U.S.C. §  2, and an unlawful restraint of trade in violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act, 15 \nU.S.C. §  1.  Id. ¶¶ 857-79.   \nA prior district judge who p resided over this litigation granted and denied in part \nFacebook’s motion to dismiss the advertiser and consumer complaint s under Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 12(b)(6).  Dkt. No. 214.  Each plaintiff group was granted leave to amend.  Only the \nadvertise r group elected to file an amended complaint , which is the FAC .  Facebook  asks to \ndismiss the FAC under Rule 12(b)(6).  Dkt. No. 395.2  The parties’ familiarity with the record is \nassumed , and the motion is denied.    \nThe parties have resolved most of Facebook’s object ions to the timeliness of the Section 2  \nclaims .  Facebook read the FAC to continue to  challeng e: (1)  the acquisitions of Instagram and \nWhatsApp in 2012 and 2014, respectively ; (2) the use of Onavo starting  in 2011 ; and (3) changes \nto Facebook’s Platform policies in 2015 , along with data  sharing agreements that followed those \npolicy changes .  Dkt. No. 395 at 5.  Facebook suggested that conduct preceding December  2016 \nwould be untimely under the  applicable  four-year statute of limitations, 15 U.S.C. §  15b, given \nthat the advertisers’ original complaint was filed on December 18, 2020.  See Affilious, Inc. v. \nFacebook, Inc. , No. 3:20 -cv-09217 -JD, Dkt. No. 1 .  In response, the  advertisers  stated that they \nwill not seek damages for, or otherwise base their Section 2 claims on , “any pre -limitations period \nconduct.”  Dkt. No. 392 at 15.  Facebook  has no substantive concerns about this representation, \nsee Dkt. No. 283  at 1, and  the advertisers will be held to it.   \nThe sole remaining timeliness question relates to the filing of the amended complaint.  \nFacebook  says that  the FAC , which was filed on February 28, 2022,  presents new allegations that \n“do not relate back to the conduct, transaction, or occurrence set  out” in the initial complaint .  Dkt. \nNo. 395 at 8 (internal quotation and citation omitted) .  Consequently, Facebook  suggests that \nFebruary 28, 2018 , forward is the relevant time period, and that conduct preceding th is date should  \nbe disregarded and the F AC trimmed or dismissed .    \n \n2 The motion to dismiss has its own convoluted history from overbroad redactions.  The motion \nand opposition were filed with redactions.  Dkt. Nos. 262, 271.  The Court directed  the parties to \nfile unredacted versions of the motion to d ismiss briefing.  Dkt. No. 344.  The c itations here are to \nthe unredacted versions , Dkt. Nos. 395 (motion), 392 (opposition) . Case 3:20-cv-08570-JD     Document 396     Filed 12/06/22     Page 2 of 4 \n3 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  The point is not well taken.  The amended complaint  respond ed to the shortfalls identified \nin the order of dismissal.  If anything, the new allegations simply add detail to the prior ones ; they \nare not radical changes or entirely new topics .  The new allegations arise out of the same conduct \nstated in the original complaint, and Facebook has not demon strated that a relation back will \nunfairly prejudice  it in any way .  Consequently, they relate back  to the date of the original \ncomplaint  for limitations purposes .  See Fed. R. Civ. P.  15(c) ; Bebault v. DMG Mori USA, Inc. , \nNo. 18 -cv-02373 -JD, 2020 WL 20656 46, at *3 (N.D. Cal. Apr. 29, 2020); see also ASARCO, LLC \nv. Union Pac. R.R. Co. , 765 F.3d 999, 1004 (9th Cir. 2014) (“The relation back doctrine of Rule \n15(c) is liberally applied.”) (internal quotation and citation omitted).  \nFacebook also challenges the Section 2 claims as failing to “plausibly allege any \ncognizable anticompetitive effect from the challenged conduct, let alone one that caused them \nantitrust injury.”  Dkt. No. 395 at 9.  These are elements of a Section 2 claim.  See In re Google \nPlay Store Antitrust Litig. , No. 21 -md-02981 -JD, 2022 WL 17252587 , at * 8 (N.D. Cal. Nov. 28, \n2022) (to state a Section 2 claim, plaintiffs must show  “(a) [Facebook’s]  possession of monopoly \npower in the relevant market; (b) the willful acquisition or maintenanc e of that power; and (c) \ncausal antitrust injury”) (quoting FTC v. Qualcomm Inc. , 969 F.3d 974, 990 (9th Cir. 2020)).   \nThis too is unavailing.  The  FAC describes  a “monopoly broth”  of anticompetitive \nconduct, which the prior district judge sustained as a plausible approach.  See Dkt. No. 214 at 71 \n(“Under a ‘monopoly broth’ theory of liability, a plaintiff ‘can state a Section 2 claim by alleging a \nseries of practices that are anticompetitive, even if some of the activities would be lawful if \nviewed in iso lation.’” ) (citation  omitted ).  The ingredients  of the broth  are said to be:  (1) the \ntargeting  of competitors for whitelist and data sharing agreements “on pain of denial of access to \nFacebook’s Platform and APIs” ; (2) entering into unlawful data and marke t division agreements \nwith Netflix, eBay , and Foursquare; (3) using data that was deceptively obtained through the \nOnavo  app to surveil and target competition; (4) integrating artificial intelligence and machine \nlearning models from Facebook, Instagram, an d Whats App; and (5) entering into an agreement \nwith Google to reinforce Facebook ’s position in the social advertising market.  Dkt. No. \n391 ¶¶ 860, 866 .   Case 3:20-cv-08570-JD     Document 396     Filed 12/06/22     Page 3 of 4 \n4 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  This is enough to go forward.  The a dvertisers have  plausibly  alleged “predatory and \nexclusionary conduct” that caused the social advertising market to be less competitive .  \nQualcomm , 969 F.3d at 990 .  This is said to have “resulted in fewer Social Advertising choices for \nadvertisers and left only Facebook’s  monopoly rents a s available prices in the” market .  Dkt. No. \n391 ¶ 825; see also id. ¶ 835 (a dvertisers paid “supracompetitive prices inflated by Facebook’s \nanticompetitive scheme ”).  Facebook’s contentions  to the contrary raise factual disputes that are \nnot amenable to r esolution in a motion to dismiss.   \nAs a closing point , Facebook says that plaintiffs Affilious, Inc., Jessyca Frederick, and 406 \nProperty Services , PLLC , lack Article III standing to bring the Section 1 claim alleged in Count \nIII.  Dkt. No. 395 at 15.  The claim is based on an agreement Facebook  entered with Google, \ncodenamed “Jedi Blue,” in September 2018.  Dkt. No. 391 ¶¶ 645-47.  By the advertisers ’ own \nclass definition, Jedi Blue  could not have injured the pre -2018 named plaintiffs, “who pur chased \nadvertising from Facebook between December 1, 2016, and April 3, 2018, but not after April 3, \n2018.”  Id. ¶ 839.   \nThe Court declines to resolve the question at this stage of the case.  Facebook may ask to \nrevisit it if a fully developed record so w arrants.  The same goes for plaintiff Mark Young .  See \nDkt.

ECF No. 300.  Defendants \nobject to Plaintiffs disclosing highly confidential material designated as “ATTORNEYS’ EYE S \nONLY” or “HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL – SOURCE CODE” to Dr. Zhao.  Plaintiffs wish to be \nable to disclose highly confidential material to Dr. Zhao, who, they contend is “one of the \npreeminent researchers in” the field of AI image generation  and thu s an invaluable expert .  Id. at \n300. \nDr. Zhao is  a computer science professor at the University of Chicago who researches \ngenerative AI and machine learning.   ECF No. 300 -1 (Zhao Decl.) ¶ ¶ 1-2.  As part of his academic \nresearch, Dr. Zhao leads  the Glaze Project, a “research effort that develops technical tools with the \nexplicit goal of protecting human creatives against invasive uses of generative artificial \nintelligence[.]”  Id. ¶ 6.  These tools include Glaze, “a tool that makes subtle changes to digital \nartwork to prevent AI models from acc urately mimicking an artist’s unique style[,]” and \nNightshade, “a to ol that alters core image data, causing AI models that train on these images to \nproduce distorted or incorrect outputs for certain prompts[.]”  ECF No. 300 at 2.  Defendants \ncontend that Dr. Zhao’s tools “sabotage the training of text -to-image models” and object to Case 3:23-cv-00201-WHO     Document 316     Filed 07/14/25     Page 1 of 6 \n2 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  disclosing their source code and other highly confidential material  to someone who they believe \ncould use it “to more effectively harm Defendants’ products and companies.”   Id. at 5.   \n“A witness who is qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or \neducation ” may provide opinion testimony if their testimony “will help the trier of fact” \nunderstand the evidence or “determine a fact in issue[.]”  Fed.

Apple Inc. , No. 12 -cv-\n2885, 2014 WL 1027948, at *1 (N.D. Cal. Mar. 13, 2014)  (quotations omitted).  But that interest \n“must be balanced against… [the] risk of improper use or disclosure[.]”  Id.  While there is “no \nbright -line rule for expert disqualification,” courts must balance the “risk of competitive harm \narising from disclosure…against the showing made as to the need for the particular expert or \nconsultant to access the confidential informati on.”  Kane v. Chobani, Inc. , No. 12 -CV-02425, \n2013 WL 3991107, at *5 (N.D. Cal. Aug. 2, 2013)  (quotations omitted); Tomahawk Mfg., Inc. v. \nSpherical Indus., Inc. , 344 F.R.D. 468, 473 (D. Nev. 2023).  The parties’ Protec tive Order \nestablishes that the party “opposing disclosure to the Expert shall bear the burden of proving  that \nthe risk of harm that the disclosure would entail (under the safeguards proposed) outweighs the \nReceiving Party’s need to disclose the Protected Material to its Expert.”   ECF No.  276 ¶ 7.4.  The \nCourt addresses these two factors —the risk of harm that disclosure to Dr. Zhao may cause \nDefendants and Plaintiffs’ need to disclose highly confidential information to Dr. Zhao —in turn.  \nDefendants argue that disclosing their highly confidential material, including source code \nand training data, to Dr. Zhao “raises serious competitive concerns” as Dr. Zhao’s research \nfocuses on developing tools that actively undermine their models .1  ECF No. 300 at 5.  Plaintiffs \ncontend that Dr. Zhao is not a n “actual competitor” of Defendants because he is an academic \nresearcher whose work is funded by grants and is not competing “for the same dollars from the \n \n1 They also argue that the protective order directly bars Dr. Zhao from being designated as an \nexpert, as it prohibits past or current employees of a “Party or of a Party’s competitor” from \nservice as an expert.  ECF No. 276 ¶ 2.7.  As the protective order does not define “competitor,” \nthis does not meaningfully impact the Court’s analysis .  The core issue is if disclosure to Dr. Zhao \ncreates a risk of competitive harm.

ECF No. \n300 at 3 n.1; Los Angeles Cnty. Med. Ass ’n v. Aetna Health of California, Inc. , No. CV1211020, \n2013 WL 12146515, at *3 (C.D. Cal. Apr. 29, 2013) (defining “direct competitors” in the \nconsumer protection context as “those who vie for the same dollars from the same consumer \ngroup”).   They further argue that accessing Defendants’ highly confidential materials “would \nprovide zero substantive benefit” to Dr. Zhao’s a cademic research as he could not determine \nwhether Defendants “detected and removed” Nightshade -protected images or implemented \ncountermeasures against his tools “through examination of source code or training data.”  ECF \nNo. 300 at 3.   \nThe Court disagrees with Plaintiffs’ argument that Dr. Zhao is not a competitor because h e \nis an academic researcher rather than part of a company that directly competes “for the same \ndollars” as Defendants.  Id. at 3 n.1.  His work is “in functional competition with Defendants ” as \nhe develops tools that attack Defendants’ generative AI models.  Id. at 5; see Voice Domain \nTechs., LLC v. Apple,  Civil Action No. 13-40138, 2014 WL 5106413, at *4 (D. Mass. Oct. 8, \n2014)  (“Even where parties are not traditional competitors in the market place, an individual may \nstill be deemed a [competitor] where the parties are in an adversarial posture and the individual \nreceiving the highly confidential information would be especially situated to take position that are \ndirectly harmful and antagonistic to the defendant .”) (citation modified) .  Dr. Zhao attests  that his \ntools teach  generative AI models  to make mistakes : a model trained on enough Glaze - or \nNightshade -modified images might produce an image in the style of Jackson Pollock when \nprompted to produce a realistic charcoal portrait or pr oduce an image of a leather purse when \nprompted to draw a cow.  Zhao Decl. ¶ ¶ 10-11.  As Dr. Zhao research es and creates tools that \nmake generative AI models such as Defendants’ less reliable, his work impacts “Defendants’ \nability to operate in the marketplace.” 2  ECF No. 300 at 5 ; see Tomahawk Manufacturing , 344 \nF.R.D. at 471 -72 (identifying that “special concerns arise when prospective experts or consultants \n \n2 Plaintiffs argue that Dr. Zhao’s tools only undermine Defendants’ models “insofar as Defendants \nmisappropriate artists’ work” and thus do not pose a cognizable competitive risk.  ECF No. 300 at \n3.  This argument is premature, as whether or not Defendants ’ use of artists’ work “found on the \nweb” to train their AI models is misappropriation is the central issue of this case.  Id. at 5.  Case 3:23-cv-00201-WHO     Document 316     Filed 07/14/25     Page 3 of 6 \n4 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  may themselves be competitive with the disclosing party’s business”).  \nThe Court credits  Dr. Zhao’s attestation that “development of Glaze and Nightshade is, for \nall intents and purposes, complete” and that accessing “Defendants’ training data information \nwould not benefit [his] development of Glaze or Nightshade.”  Zhao Decl. ¶¶ 12, 17.  But Dr. \nZhao has not agreed to cease developing other so -called “data -poisoning tools” during the course \nof this litigation or to cease researching how to make image -generating AI models less effective.  \nId.; ECF No. 300 at 6 n.12.  This is, of course, a whol ly legitimate choice, but one that implicates \nDr. Zhao’s ability to review Defendants’ highly confidential materials  in this case .  Per Plaintiffs, \nDr. Zhao’s focus is on “adversarial machine learning and tools to mitigate harms of generative AI \nmodels[.]”  ECF No. 302 -6 at 2.  Akin to GPNE , Dr. Zhao has researched and developed tools that \nwork at cross -purposes with Defendants’ models “[i]n the very recent past,” and “there has been \nno representation or agreement that he will not do so again in the very ne ar future.”  2014 WL \n1027948, at *2.  His research  puts him in an “adversarial posture” vis -à-vis Defendants such that \n“the information to which he would be exposed as an expert in this case could influence his” \nongoing and future work “protecting human creatives against invasive uses of generative artificial \nintelligence[.]”  Voice Domain , 2014 WL 5106413, at *4 ; GPNE , 2014 WL 1027948, at * 2; Zhao \nDecl. ¶ 6.   This is in no  way to suggest that Dr. Zhao would intentionally misuse information \nobtained during this litigation, but instead recognizes that “even if he were to make his best efforts \nto cabin the information off in his mind,” the highly confidential information may “become \nintertwined with his other knowledge such that” it may be disclosed “in the co urse of his future \nwork[.]”  GPNE , 2014 WL 1027948, at * 2; Symantec Corp. v. Acronis Corp. , No. 11 -5310, 2012 \nWL 3582974, at *2 (N.D. Cal. Aug. 20, 2012) .3  The Court accordingly find s that Defendants have \ndemonstrated that disclosing their highly confidential information to Dr. Zhao poses a risk of \nharm.  \nGiven the risk of harm to Defendants, Dr. Zhao must have “unique knowledge within” the \nfield of AI image generation  to review Defendants’ materials designated as highly confidential .  \n \n3 His agreement to not use any confidential information outside of this litigation thus does not \nchange this analysis.  See Zhao Decl. ¶ 5.

Defendants recognize that Dr. Zhao is qualified to serve as \nan expert but argue that he does not have “unique qualifications that other experts could not \nprovide.”  ECF No. 303 at 1; GPNE , 2014 WL 1027948, at *1.  The Court agrees.   \nAI image generation is a relatively new field, and the Court accepts, as Plaintiffs argue, \nthat the pool of “qualified experts in AI image generation not employed by direct competitors” of \nDefendants is small.  ECF No. 300 at 4.  But Defendants demonstrate  that it is not “such a niche \nfield that there is only one qualified expert.”4  ECF No. 303 at 2.  Defendants point to numerous \nacademic papers addressing text -to-image generation; they reason that, between the hundreds of \nauthors of these papers, it is not feasible that “Plaintiffs couldn’t find anyone with the ability to \nexplain how generative image models behave” aside from Dr. Zhao.  ECF No. 303 at 2.   To \nillustrate  their point, Defendants note that one of Dr. Zhao’s former students, Dr. Emily Wenger, \nhad recently been disclosed as an expert on AI image generation a parallel generative AI case.  \nECF No. 303 at 2.  (Dr. Wenger has since been designated as an expert in  that case, over the \ndefendants’ objections.  In re Google Generative AI Copyright Litigation , No.  23-cv-03440 -EKL, \nECF No. 172 at 1-2 (N.D. Cal. July 10, 2025).)  That another academic has been designated as an \nexpert regarding the same topic in a similar case strongly supports Defendants’ point that there is \nmore than “one qualified expert” and Dr. Zhao, although qualified, is not uniquely qualified  to \n“help the Court and the jury in understanding how generative image models memorize, output, \nand infringe copyrighted work.” 5  ECF No s. 303 at 2 ; 302 at 3 . \nThe Court accordingly finds that the risk of harm to Defendants  outweighs Plaintiffs’ need \nto disclose Defendants’ information designated as “ ATTORNEYS’ EYES ONLY ” or “HIGHLY \nCONFIDENTIAL – SOURCE CODE ” to Dr. Zhao.  ECF No. 300 at 1; see GPNE , 2014 WL \n \n4 Plaintiffs’ own briefing does not contradict this.  They claim that “Dr. Zhao is not merely one \namong several qualified experts” but then explain that he is “ one of  the preeminent researchers in \nhis field” and there are a “ few independent experts” of his caliber.  ECF No. 302 at 2, 3  (emphasis \nadded) .   \n5 For the avoidance of doubt, the Court takes no position on whether or not  it would designate Dr. \nWenger as an expert in this case if Plaintiffs were to retain her or Dr. Wenger were to agree to \nserve as an expert.  See ECF No. 309 at 2.  That dispute is not before the Court.  The Court \ndiscusses Dr. Wenger only to illustrate that other qualified experts exist.  See GPNE , 2014 WL \n1027948, at *2.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: In this case, Plaintiffs allege that NVIDIA Corporation committed copyright infringement by using their copyrighted books, included in publicly available large datasets like \"The Pile,\" for training its NeMo Megatron large language models. The court partially granted the Plaintiffs' discovery request, allowing exploration into whether NVIDIA used \"The Pile\" to train any NeMo Megatron models beyond those initially identified. This case involves AI as the dispute centers around the unauthorized use of copyrighted works to train large language models, which are AI-based systems designed to generate and manipulate human language.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether NVIDIA infringed on the Plaintiffs' copyright by using their books, found in a dataset called \"The Pile,\" to train its large language AI models.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court allowed discovery limited to exploring NVIDIA’s use of \"The Pile\" dataset to train its NeMo Megatron language models, including models beyond the four specifically mentioned in the original complaint, because the term \"family\" used by NVIDIA was not clearly defined.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine someone used your favorite storybook to teach a robot how to write and understand language, without asking for your permission because you own the story. The people who made the robot used a big box of books which had your story in it. The court is deciding if they did something wrong by not asking you first. The judge said it's okay for you to ask questions about what other books from the big box were used to teach the robot, but you can only ask about the books you know were used and which had your story in them.",

For the reasons set forth below, the Court GRANTS IN PART and DENIES IN PART \nthe request by Plaintiffs.    \nA. Background  \nPlaintiffs Abdi Nazemian , Brian Keene, and Stewart O’Nan ( collectively,  “Plaintiffs”), on \nbehalf of themselves and all others similarly situated, allege that Defendant NVIDIA Corporation \ninfringed their copyrighted  books when it used databases containing that copyrighted material to \ntrain its large language models.  (Dkt. No. 1.)  Plaintiffs allege that Defendant announced the \navailability of four large language models in the “NeMo Megatron series”: NeMo Megatron -GPT \n1.3B, NeMo MegatronGPT 5B, NeMo Megatron -GPT 20B, and NeMo Megat ron-T5 3B .  (Id.)  \nDefendant publicly disclosed that the NeMo Megatron large language model  series  was trained on  \n“‘The Pile’ dataset prepared by EleutherAI. ”  (Id.)  The Pile dataset includes materials from \n“Books3.”  (Id.)  Plaintiffs allege that their copyrighted  books  are included in Books3 and \ntherefore in The Pile.   (Id.)  Therefore, Plaintiffs allege that Defendant trained its NeMo Megatron \nmodels on Plaintiffs’ copyrighted books.  ( Id.)  Plaintiffs allege direct copyright infringement \nunder 17 U.S.C . § 501.  They purport to represent a class of Plaintiffs from March 8, 2021 to the \npresent , but they intend  to amend  the class period  if they learn that infringement occurred earlier.  Case 4:24-cv-01454-JST     Document 168     Filed 08/21/25     Page 1 of 3 \n2 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  Plaintiffs seek to represent the following class:  \nAll persons or entities domiciled in the United States that own a \nUnited States copyright in any work that was used as training data for \nthe NeMo Megatron large language models during the Class Period.  \n(Id.)   \nA short and overly simplified explanation of the process of training a large language model \nis necessary to understand the dispute.  There are datasets publicly available, and these datasets \ninclude large quantities of copyrighted material, used without co nsent of the owner of the \ncopyrighted material.  Companies such as Defendant then can use those datasets to “train” a large \nlanguage model to learn patterns of speech, structure, and grammar.  The large language model \nthen learns to predict patterns and th en can “understand, generate, and manipulate human \nlanguage.”1 \nB. Analysis  \nPlaintiffs seek discovery both about the datasets or libraries that Defendant used to train its \nlarge language models and the specific large language models that trained on th ose datasets .  \nDefendant argues that any discovery should be limited to the large language models that trained on \nThe Pile and that any discovery should also be limited to the four large language models identified \nin the Complaint.   \nPlaintiffs argue that, because they seek to represent a class of plaintiffs who own any \ncopyrighted material from any source, they are entitled to discovery on all sources and for any \nlarge language models in the Nemo Megatron family that trained on  those datasets .  In other \nwords, because Plaintiffs do not define the term “family” and do not limit their discovery requests \nto the four large language models identified in the Complaint , Plaintiffs seek information about \nany use of any dataset by Defendant . \nWith respect to the datasets, the Court finds that limiting the discovery to the dataset that \nPlaintiffs know that Defendant used and that contains Plaintiffs’ copyrighted books is appropriate.  \nPlaintiffs argue that they are hampered by lack of knowledge because Defendant is the only entity \n \n1 For example, this explanation  was generated by artificial intelligence in response to a \nquestion submitted by the Court.   Case 4:24-cv-01454-JST     Document 168     Filed 08/21/25     Page 2 of 3 \n3 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  that has access to information about its own activities.  This is an inherent problem in any \nlitigation: a plaintiff might not be able to discover wrongdoing by a defendant.  That lack of \nknowledge does not justify a discovery request without bounds.  Here , Plaintiffs know that \nDefendant used The Pile, which contains Plaintiffs’ copyrighted books, to train its large language \nmodels.  Discovery will thus be limited to training on The Pile.  \n With respect to the limitation on specific large language models, the Court finds that \nPlaintiffs  are entitled to discover whether Defendant trained other large language models on The \nPile.  Here,  Defendant’s proposed  limitation to a “family” of large language models is a \nmeaningless distinction because Defendant has not defined “family.”   For this reason, the Court \nwill not place an artificial restriction on the large language models that are the subject of \nPlaintiffs’ search.   They may seek information about large language models that use information \nfrom The Pile dataset by seeking information about other large language models in the Nemo \nMegatron family that exist and that trained on The Pile  dataset .   \n Thus, the Court DENIES the motion to compel discovery regarding the use of datasets \nother than The Pile but GRANTS the motion to compel discovery regarding the use of The Pile to \ntrain datasets in the Nemo Megatron family beyond the four large language mo dels specifically \nnamed in the Complaint.  \nIT IS SO ORDERED . \nDated:  August 21, 2025  \n______________________________________  \nSALLIE KIM  \nUnited States Magistrate Judge  \n \n \nCase 4:24-cv-01454-JST     Document 168     Filed 08/21/25     Page 3 of 3",

However, it dismissed the sham litigation claims due to lack of specific, plausible allegations of baseless litigation.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine a company that makes a super popular game console also makes games for it.

(\"ROSS\") for copyright infringement and tortious interference \nwith contract. (See generally D.I. 1) (\"Compl.\") ROSS asserts a variety of counterclaims , \nincluding violations of the Sherman Act and the unfair competition laws of both California and \nDelaware . (See generally D.I. 36 at 11-46) Plaintiffs move to dismiss the antitrust and unfair \ncompetition counterclaims. (D.I. 39) For the reasons explained below, the Court will grant \nPlaintiffs' motion in part and deny it in part. \nBACKGROUND1 \nA. Factual Allegations2 \nPlaintiffs Thomson Reuters and West operate and market Westlaw, a legal search \nplatform. (D.I. 36 at 11 ,r 5) Plaintiffs control \"over 80% of the market for legal search \nplatform products, \" so some consider Westlaw to be the \"king\" of legal research. (Id.) \nWestlaw has a comprehensive database of \"public law,\" comprising federal and state court \ndecisions, federal and state statutes, and administrati ve rules and guidance. (Id. at 11 ,r 2; see \nalso id. at 17 ,r 39) Because Westlaw's public law database is so comprehensive , Westlaw \"has \n1 In a previous Memorandum Opinion, the Court outlined Plaintiffs' allegations against \nROSS. See Thomson Reuters Enter. Ctr. GmbHv. ROSS Intel. Inc., 529 F. Supp. 3d 303, 307-10 \n(D. Del. 2021). That background is not repeated here, as the instant Memorandum Opinion \nfocuses on ROSS 's allegations against Plaintiffs . \n2 The factual allegations in this section are taken primarily from ROSS's amended \ncounterclaims and the parties' papers. At this stage, the Court must take ROSS's well-pled \nfactual allegations as true. \n1 Case 1:20-cv-00613-SB     Document 170     Filed 04/26/22     Page 2 of 18 PageID #:\n<pageID>been the standard ... since before any practicing lawyer was born,\" and legal researchers \"can \nfeel confident when looking for cases in Westlaw's digital collection .\" (Id. at 18 ,r 44) Yet \nWestlaw's vast amount of public law information is not particularly helpful without a way to \nsearch within that information . (See id. at 26 ,r 78) (\"[I]f the database is not connected to a legal \nsearch tool, then it holds no value.\") Thus, Westlaw incorporates a search tool that allows \nresearchers to sift through the public law. (Id. at 18 ,r 45) The \"backbone \" ofWestlaw 's search \ntool is the West Key Number System, which \"organizes numerous legal topics and then \nsubclassifies them into key numbers based on legal issues and points oflaw.\" (D.I. 28 at 4-5) \nAttorney-editors are constantly reviewing cases to distill crucial points of law into headnotes and \nto organize the headnotes by key number. (See id. at 5) \nDespite Westlaw's dominance , ROSS endeavored to develop a new and improved legal \nsearch platform using artificial intelligence (\"AI\"). (D.I. 36 at 14 ,r 24) ROSS sold access to \nits legal search platform for \"a tiny fraction\" of Westlaw's cost. (Id. at 15 ,r 25) Given its low \ncost and ease of use, ROS S's legal search product garnered significant support from customers , \nthe media, and bar associations. (See id. at 24 ,r 68) But ROSS struggled to build a public law \ndatabase that was even remotely as comprehensi ve as Westlaw's. (See id. at 15 ,r 28; see also id. \nat 25 ,r,r 73-74; id. at 12 ,r 7 (\"ROSS never really had a chance.\")) ROSS partnered with \nLegalEase Solutions, LLC (\"LegalEase \") to improve ROSS 's search tool. According to \nPlaintiffs, however, LegalEase \"used a bot ... to download and store mass quantities of \nproprietary information, \" which it then provided to ROSS. (D.I. 28 at 6) Ultimately , ROSS \nwas \"forced to suspend business activities. \" (D.I. 38 at 7) \n2 Case 1:20-cv-00613-SB     Document 170     Filed 04/26/22     Page 3 of 18 PageID #:\n<pageID>ROSS is pursuing antitrust and unfair competition counterclaims against Plaintiffs , \nseeking to stop them from \"engaging in an exclusionary and anticompetitive course of conduct to \nmaintain [their] monopoly and restrain trade.\" (DJ. 36 at 12 ,r 7) Several allegations regarding \nthe competitive landscape are central to ROSS's counterclaims. First, Plaintiffs have \"never \nprovided consumers with an option to only license the public law database, or to only license the \nlegal search tools, and do[] not plan to ever provide such an option.\" (Id. at 32 ,r 104) That is \ntrue even though, according to ROSS, there are three separate but related markets for (i) public \nlaw database products, (ii) legal search tool products, and (iii) legal search platforms . (DJ. 38 at \n7-8) ROSS further alleges there is \"independent demand\" by consumers for public law \ndatabases and legal search tools, to permit legal researchers to \"mix-and-match products based \non particular preferences and needs.\" (Id. at 5-6) Moreover, Plaintiffs allegedly require their \ncustomers to sign \"contract[s] of adhesion \" (DJ. 36 at 32 ,r 103) containing \"restrictive licensing \nconditions\" that prevent competitors from gaining access to Plaintiffs ' proprietary information \n(id. at 33 ,r,r 107-08). Finally, Plaintiffs allegedly intermingle copyrighted material with \nuncopyrightable government edicts, rendering it \"not difficult\" for Plaintiffs to \"find a way\" to \nsue their rivals for copyright infringement , even though such lawsuits are \"a complete sham.\" \n(Id. at 34-35 ,r,r 110-11) \nB. Procedural History \nIn May 2020, Plaintiffs sued ROSS for copyright infringement and tortious interference \nwith a contract between West and LegalEase . (See Compl. ,r,r 40-53) The Court denied \nROSS's motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim. See Thomson Reuters, 529 \nF. Supp. 3d at 315. \n3 Case 1:20-cv-00613-SB     Document 170     Filed 04/26/22     Page 4 of 18 PageID #:\n<pageID>In December 2020, ROSS partially answered the complaint and asserted counterclaims \nagainst Plaintiffs, seeking declaratory judgment of copyright invalidity, copyright \nnoninfringement, and no tortious interference with contract. (See generally D.I. 21 ,r,r 17-37) \nPlaintiffs answered the counterclaims. (See generally D.I. 23) ROSS subsequently amended \nits answer and added the following counterclaims: (a) declaratory judgment of fair use, \n(b) declaratory judgment of copyright misuse, ( c) violation of the Sherman Act § 2, ( d) violation \nof the Sherman Act§ 1, (e) violation of California 's unfair competition law, and (f) violation of \nDelaware common law on unfair competition. (See generally D.I. 24 ,r,r 116-80) \nPlaintiffs moved to dismiss the counterclaims involving the alleged violations of federal \nantitrust law and state unfair competition law (Counts VI-IX). (See generally D.I. 27, 28) In \nlight of the Court's intervening denial ofROSS 's motion to dismiss Plaintiffs ' copyright \ninfringement and tortious interference claims, ROSS again filed amended counterclaims with the \nsame nine counts. (See generally D.I. 36) \nPlaintiffs filed a second motion to dismiss Counts VI-IX. (D.I. 39)3 The Court has \ncarefully considered all arguments raised in the parties' briefs (see generally D.I. 28, 38, 45), as \nwell as arguments made by counsel during an in-person hearing on the pending motion (see D.I. \n69) (\"Tr.\"). \nLEGAL STANDARDS \nEvaluating a motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b )(6) requires the \nCourt to accept as true all material factual allegations in the complaint. See Spruill v. Gillis, 372 \n3 The Court denied the first motion to dismiss as moot, in light of subsequent filings. \n(See generally D.I. 160) \n4 Case 1:20-cv-00613-SB     Document 170     Filed 04/26/22     Page 5 of 18 PageID #:\n<pageID>F.3d 218, 223 (3d Cir. 2004 ). \"'The issue is not whether a plaintiff will ultimately prevail but \nwhether the claimant is entitled to offer evidence to support the claims.\"' In re Burlington Coat \nFactory Sec. Litig., 114 F.3d 1410, 1420 (3d Cir. 1997) (quoting Scheuer v. Rhodes, 416 U.S. 232, \n236 (1974)). Therefore, the Court may grant such a motion to dismiss \"only if, accepting all well­\npleaded allegations in the complaint as true, and viewing them in the light most favorable to plaintiff, \nplaintiff is not entitled to relief.\" Maio v. Aetna, Inc., 221 F.3d 472, 481-82 (3d Cir. 2000) (internal \nquotation marks omitted). \n\"To survive a motion to dismiss, a civil plaintiff must allege facts that 'raise a right to \nrelief above the speculative level on the assumption that the allegations in the complaint are true \n( even if doubtful in fact).\"' Victaulic Co. v.

Sherman Act § 2 \nA violation of§ 2 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. § 2, \"requires '(l) the possession of \nmonopoly power in the relevant market and (2) the willful acquisition or maintenance of that \npower as distinguished from growth or development as a consequence of a superior product, \nbusiness acumen, or historic accident.\"' Broadcom Corp. v. Qualcomm Inc., 501 F.3d 297, 306-\n07 (3d Cir. 2007) (quoting United States v. Grinnell Corp., 384 U.S. 563, 570-71 (1966)).4 \n1. Tying \nROSS's first theory for its claim under§ 2 of the Sherman Act alleges that Plaintiffs \nunlawfully tie their legal search tool to their public law database to maintain their dominance in \nthe overall market for legal search platforms . (See Tr. at 35) \"A tying arrangement is an \nagreement by a party to sell one product but only on the condition that the buyer also purchases a \ndifferent ( or tied) product, or at least agrees that he will not purchase that product from any other \nsupplier.\" Eastman Kodak Co. v. Image Tech. Servs., Inc., 504 U.S. 451,461 (1992) (internal \nquotation marks omitted). \"[T]he essential characteristic of an invalid tying arrangement lies in \nthe seller's exploitation of its control over the tying product to force the buyer into the purchase \nof a tied product that the buyer either did not want at all, or might have preferred to purchase \n4 The Court will address the two theories ROSS is pressing in connection with its § 2 \nclaim. ROSS clarified in its briefing that it is not relying on the \"essential facilities doctrine\" \n(D.I. 38 at 2), and at the hearing, ROSS withdrew its \"refusal to deal\" claim (Tr. at 43). ROSS \nhad been pursuing a claim based on Plaintiffs ' refusal to deal with ROSS. (See D.I. 38 at 17-19) \n(citing Aspen Skiing Co. v. Aspen Highlands Skiing Corp., 472 U.S. 585 (1985)). The Court will \ndismiss that claim in light of ROSS 's withdrawal of it. \n6 Case 1:20-cv-00613-SB     Document 170     Filed 04/26/22     Page 7 of 18 PageID #:\n<pageID>elsewhere on different terms.\" Jefferson Par. Hosp. Dist. No. 2 v. Hyde, 466 U.S. 2, 12 (1984). \nIn a tying arrangement, there must be ''two separate products. \" Id. at 18. \"[W]hether one or \ntwo products are involved turns not on the functional relation between them, but rather on the \ncharacter of the demand for the two items.\" Id. at 19; see also Eastman Kodak, 504 U.S. at 462 \n(\"For service and parts to be considered two distinct products, there must be sufficient consumer \ndemand so that it is efficient for a firm to provide service separately from parts.\"). \nPlaintiffs ' basis for seeking to dismiss the § 2 tying claim is that ROSS has not \nsufficiently alleged two different products or two different product markets. (D.I. 28 at 13; Tr. \nat 13) ROSS responds that public law databases and legal search tools are separate products, \nciting as support its own experience of developing a legal search tool while separately \n\"buil[ ding] its public law database \" by \"purchas[ing] some cases from Casemaker\" and \"other \npublic law from Fastcase. \" (D.I. 36 at 24 ,r 71) ROSS further alleges that its legal search tool \nproduct was \"incredibly valuable.\" (Id. at 25 ,r 73) As ROSS puts it, \"[c]ustomers valued \nROSS's legal search tool so highly ... because it is built with innovative AI-based technology. \" \n(D.I. 38 at 14) ROSS's experience suggests that building a public law database product is \ndistinct from developing a legal search tool product. \nIn arguing that public law databases and legal search tools are just one product (i.e., a \nlegal search platform), Plaintiffs emphasize that their legal search tool has never been sold \nseparately from their public law database. (See, e.g., Tr. at 11; see also D.I. 36 at 24 ,r 69 \n(ROSS admitting that Plaintiffs have \"never offered to license [their] database separate from \n[their] search tools\")) Plaintiffs are correct that if two products have never been sold separately , \nthis suggests that they are really one product. See generally Eastman Kodak, 504 U.S. at 462 \n7 Case 1:20-cv-00613-SB     Document 170     Filed 04/26/22     Page 8 of 18 PageID #:\n<pageID>(noting that products were previously sold separately) ; see also D.I. 45 at 5 (citing additional \ncases). As ROSS points out, however, Plaintiffs ' public law database was effectively sold as a \nstand-alone product in the form of books for decades before modem technology allowed \nPlaintiffs to develop an online legal search tool. (See Tr. at 31) (\"In the 19th century, West \nbegan to sell case law separate from any digest that could be used to search.\") Moreover, some \nthird parties have allegedly sold public law databases as discrete products. (See D.I. 36 at 24-25 \n,r 71) (describing how ROSS purchased cases from Casemaker and Fastcase) \nPlaintiffs argue that their legal search tool is effectively useless without a public law \ndatabase attached to it. (D.I. 28 at 14) But the Supreme Court has \"often found arrangements \ninvolving functionally linked products[,] at least one of which is useless without the other[,] to \nbe prohibited tying devices.\" Jefferson Par., 466 U.S. at 19 n.30; see also United States v. \nMicrosoft Corp., 253 F.3d 34, 86 (D.C. Cir. 2001) (en bane) (\"[T]he mere fact that two items are \ncomplements ... does not make them a single 'product' for purposes of tying law.\"). \nTaking ROSS's allegations as true, and drawing all reasonable inferences in ROSS's \nfavor, ROSS has sufficiently alleged that public law databases and legal search tools may be two \ndifferent products instead of one. \nROSS has also plausibly alleged that there are independent markets for both products. \nThe amended counterclaims allege \"a growing interest in unbundled search products, or other \nflexible options for digital legal research.\" (D.I. 36 at 27 ,r 79) ROSS further alleges that \n\"there are relevant markets for public law database products and legal search technologies in the \nUnited States.\" (Id. at 27 ,r 80) The customers in those markets include \"end-users like law \nfirms, intermediate buyers like bar associations that seek to expand access to the law, and \n8 Case 1:20-cv-00613-SB     Document 170     Filed 04/26/22     Page 9 of 18 PageID #:\n<pageID>intermediate buyers like ROSS that need access to the database to develop, test and market their \nplatform products. \" (Id.) Indeed, ROSS alleges that its legal search tool received significant \nattention and praise from those types of customer s. (See, e.g., id. at 24 ,r 68; id. at 25 ,r 74) \nMoreover , investors put money into ROSS, \"suggesting that the venture capital community \nbelieved that there was demand for legal search tools.\" (D.I. 38 at 15) (citing D.I. 36 at 23-24 \n,r,r 65-67) \nIn the Court's view, ROSS has adequatel y and plausibly alleged separate product markets \nfor public law databases and legal search tools. See generally Eastman Kodak, 504 U.S. at 486 \n( acknowledging that Kodak might be able to prove that parts, service, and equipment all \ncompose one market, but declining to reach that conclusion as matter of law on summary \njudgment); see also Queen City Pizza, Inc. v. Domino s Pizza, Inc., 124 F.3d 430, 436 (3d Cir. \n1997) (\"[I]n most cases, proper market definition can be determined only after a factual inquiry \ninto the commercial realities faced by consumer s.\"). \nThus, the Court will deny Plaintiffs ' motion to dismiss ROSS's § 2 tying claim. \n2. Sham Litigation \nROSS's second theory for its§ 2 Sherman Act claim is that Plaintiffs have engaged in \nanticompetitive conduct by pursuing sham litigation. (D.I. 38 at 12) To prove \"sham \nlitigation,\" ROSS will have to show (i) a lawsuit that is \"objectively baseless in the sense that no \nreasonable litigant could realistically expect success on the merits\" and (ii) Plaintiffs brought the \nlawsuit with a subjective motivation to weaponize the litigation process for an anticompetitive \npurpose. Pro. Real Estate Invs., Inc. v. Columbia Pictures Indus., Inc. (\"PRE''), 508 U.S. 49, \n60-61 (1993). \"The existence of probable cause to institute legal proceedings precludes a \n9 Case 1:20-cv-00613-SB     Document 170     Filed 04/26/22     Page 10 of 18 PageID #:\n<pageID>finding that an antitrust defendant has engaged in sham litigation. \" Id at 62. \"A litigant has \nprobable cause to initiate a suit if the litigant has 'a reasonable belief that there is a chance that a \nclaim may be held valid upon adjudication .'\" In re Wellbutrin XL Antitrust Litig. Indirect \nPurchaser Class, 868 F.3d 132, 148 (3d Cir. 2017) (quoting PRE:, 508 U.S. at 62-63). \nAccordingly , ROSS \"faces an uphill battle\" by \"claiming that a lawsuit is, by its very existence , \nanticompetitive and unlawful. \" Id. at 14 7. \nAs a preliminary matter, ROSS argues that Plaintiffs forfeited their challenge to the sham \nlitigation claim by failing to raise it in their opening brief. (D.I. 38 at 1) The Court disagrees. \nAs Plaintiffs persuasively explain , they \"moved to dismiss ROSS 's § 2 claim for failure to \nidentify any actionable exclusionary conduct,\" and \"there is no separate 'sham litigation' Count \nin the Counterclaims.\" (D.I. 45 at 6-7) (emphasis and internal quotation marks omitted) The \nCourt does not fault Plaintiffs for failing to foresee every possible argument ROSS would make \nafter Plaintiffs made it clear they were seeking to dismiss the federal antitrust claims in their \nentirety. \nROSS has failed to plausibly allege that Plaintiffs have engaged in sham litigation. \nNotably, the amended counterclaims do not identify any specific litigation that was or is \npurportedly a sham. At the hearing, ROSS indicated that its sham litigation claim is supported \nby paragraphs 51-55 and 110-113 of the amended counterclaims. (Tr. at 47) Paragraphs 51-55 \nallege that Plaintiffs at one point asserted copyrights in Westlaw page numbers and have also \nasserted copyrights in Westlawheadnotes. (D.I. 36 at 19-20 ,r,r 51-55) Paragraphs 53 and 54 \ncite a decision in which the Second Circuit held that certain information regarding cases \npublished on Westlaw is not copyrightable. (Id. at 20 ,r,r 53-54) (citing Matthew Bender & Co. \n10 Case 1:20-cv-00613-SB     Document 170     Filed 04/26/22     Page 11 of 18 PageID #:\n<pageID>v. W Pub!. Co., 158 F.3d 674 (2d Cir. 1998)) Those paragraphs do not allege that the litigation \nwas a sham. ROSS does not allege that the suit was \"objectively baseless\" or that West had an \nimproper intent in pursuing it. \nParagraphs 110-113 of the amended counterclaims are similarly deficient. Paragraph \n110 primarily alleges that uncopyrightable government edicts are intermingled with Plaintiffs' \nproprietary information on Westlaw. (D.I. 36 at 341 110) The paragraph concludes with the \nvague suggestion that \"it is not difficult for [Plaintiffs] to find a way to sue [their] rivals,\" and \n\"on information and belief,\" Plaintiffs have \"a long practice of aggressively pursuing such \nclaims.\" (Id) Paragraph 110 does not list even one example that supposedly fits within this \n\"long practice.\" Paragraph 111 goes on to state that these unspecified litigations are \n\"objectively baseless\" and brought \"to force rivals into unnecessary expensive legal fights solely \nto raise entry barriers.\" (Id at 3 5 1 111) While these allegations track the legal requirements \nfor sham litigation, see PRE, 508 U.S. at 60-61, they are conclusory and deficient, see Schuylkill \nEnergy Res., 113 F.3d at 417. \nFinally, ROSS insinuates that the instant litigation is a sham. (See D.I. 36 at 35 11 112-\n13) The parties dispute whether the Court's earlier denial of ROSS's motion to dismiss \nPlaintiffs' copyright and tortious interference claims means that, as a matter of law, this litigation \nis not a sham. (See Tr. at 46-47) Regardless, ROSS has not made any specific allegations \nabout how the instant case is a sham. Instead, after outlining its vague and conclusory \nallegations about Plaintiffs' \"long history\" of sham litigation, ROSS simply states that \"[t]his is \nexactly what happened to ROSS.\" (D.I. 36 at 35 1 112) \n11 Case 1:20-cv-00613-SB     Document 170     Filed 04/26/22     Page 12 of 18 PageID #:\n<pageID>ROSS has not plausibly alleged that Plaintiffs have engaged in sham litigation. \nAccordingly, the Court will grant Plaintiffs' motion with respect to ROSS's sham litigation \nclaim. See, e.g., 3Shape Trios AJS v. Align Tech., Inc., 2019 WL 3824209, at *5-6 (D. Del. Aug. \n15, 2019) (recommending that motion to dismiss be granted because plaintiff\"fail[ed] to \nplausibly allege sham litigation\"), report and recommendation adopted, 2019 WL 4686614 (D. \nDel. Sept. 26, 2019). \nB. Sherman Act § 1 \nSection 1 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1, prohibits \"every contract ... or conspiracy , \nin restraint of trade or commerce .\" To state a claim under§ 1 of the Sherman Act, one must \nallege (i) an agreement , contract, combination, or conspiracy, (ii) imposing an unreasonable \nrestraint of trade within a relevant market, and (iii) an accompanying antitrust injury. See In re \nIns. Brokerage Antitrust Litig., 618 F.3d 300, 314-15, 315 n.9 (3d Cir. 2010). \nLike ROSS 's § 2 claim, ROSS 's § 1 claim is based on a tying theory. A tying \narrangement \"violates § 1 of the Sherman Act if the seller has appreciable economic power in the \ntying product market and if the arrangement affects a substantial volume of commerce in the tied \nmarket.\" Eastman Kodak, 504 U.S. at 462 (internal quotation marks omitted). \nHere, ROSS alleges that Plaintiffs use their market power for public law databases to \nprotect their legal search engine model. (Tr. at 35) Given the similarities between the § 1 claim \nand the § 2 claim, Plaintiffs principally argue that ROSS 's § 1 claim fails for the same reasons \nthat its § 2 claim fails. (D.I. 45 at 6 n. l; Tr. at 53) This argument fails, for all the reasons it \nfailed in connection with the § 2 tying claim, as discussed above. \n12 Case 1:20-cv-00613-SB     Document 170     Filed 04/26/22     Page 13 of 18 PageID #:\n<pageID>Plaintiffs advance another reason why the § 1 tying claim should be dismissed: in \nPlaintiffs ' view, ROSS has not alleged any agreement , contract, or conspiracy between one of the \nPlaintiffs and another party, as is required for a§ 1 claim. (D.I. 28 at 15-16; D.I. 45 at 8-9) \nROSS points to Plaintiffs ' agreements with their customers as the relevant contracts. (D.I. 38 at \n12) ROSS alleges that Plaintiffs use \"restrictive licensing conditions to foreclose rivals from \naccess to the relevant markets.\" (D.I. 36 at 31 ,r 102) For instance, subsection l(a) of the \n\"Research Subscriber Agreement \" between Plaintiffs and their customers defines \"Data\" to \ninclude \"all information and representations of information , including but not limited to, \ngraphical representations , and other content made available to [users] through the Product.\" (Id. \nat 32 ,r 103) According to ROSS, this contract term \"does not permit customers to unbundle \n[Plaintiffs'] two products.\" (D.I. 38 at 12) In other words, by entering into the customer \nagreements , Plaintiffs protect their content from being shared with competitors such as ROSS. \n(See Tr. at 40) \nPlaintiffs argue that the customer agreements really involve unilateral action, as \nevidenced by the fact that ROSS refers to those agreements as \"contracts of adhesion.\" (D.I. 45 \nat 8-9) This is not dispositive . In Microsoft, 253 F.3d at 47, the United States and individual \nstates sued Microsoft for violations of the Sherman Act due to \"anticompetitive terms in its \nlicensing and software developer agreements. \" One of the claims was a § 1 tying claim based \non the bundling of the Internet Explorer web browser with the Windows operating system. Id. \nIn stating the elements of a per se tying violation, the D.C. Circuit did not mention the existence \nof an agreement or conspiracy. Id. at 85. Even if such an agreement or conspiracy is a \n13 Case 1:20-cv-00613-SB     Document 170     Filed 04/26/22     Page 14 of 18 PageID #:\n<pageID>necessary element, the D.C. Circuit appears to have assumed that the licensing and software \ndeveloper agreements were sufficient. \nPlaintiffs attempt to brush Microsoft aside by casting it as an \"exclusive dealing\" case. \n(See Tr. at 52) According to Plaintiffs , an exclusive dealing case is different because \"both sides \nof the contract get stuff they want.\" (Id.) Plaintiffs ' contention ignores that their customers \n\"get stuff they want\" by entering into Research Subscriber Agreements -specifically , they get \naccess to Plaintiffs ' comprehensive public law database and valuable legal search tool. (See id. \nat 57-58) Accordingly , the Court agrees with ROSS that Microsoft provides some support for \nits § 1 tying theory. \nTo further support its § 1 tying claim, ROSS also relies on Allen-My/and , Inc. v. \nInternational Business Machines Corp., 33 F.3d 194 (3d Cir. 1994). (See D.I. 38 at 12-13) \nPlaintiffs attempt to distinguish that case in a footnote with one sentence: \"Allen-My/and is a§ 1 \ntying case; ROSS's tying theory fails for the reasons stated previously .\" (D.I. 45 at 9 n.4) \nGiven the Court's decision that ROSS 's § 2 tying theory does not fail as a matter of law, \nPlaintiffs ' distinction is unpersuasive . Indeed, the facts of Allen-My/and (as with those of \nMicrosoft) lend some support to ROSS's § 1 tying claim. In Allen-My/and , 33 F.3d at 199, the \nplaintiff challenged IBM's \"net pricing\" policy, under which \"IBM installation labor was \nbundled in with the price of the parts\" for upgrading IBM mainframe computers. The plaintiff \nbrought a § 1 tying claim based on the bundling of the labor and parts. After a bench trial, the \ndistrict court ruled in the plaintiff's favor. See id. at 199-200. In reviewing § 1 tying law, the \nThird Circuit implied that some kind of \"contractual arrangement \" is necessary . See id. at 201. \nThere appears to have been no dispute, however, that IBM's agreements implementing the \"net \n14 Case 1:20-cv-00613-SB     Document 170     Filed 04/26/22     Page 15 of 18 PageID #:\n<pageID>pricing\" policy met any such requirement. ROSS alleges that Plaintiffs and their customers \nenter into Research Subscriber Agreements, which appear to be similar to the agreements in \nAllen-Myland. \nAccordingly, the Court will deny Plaintiffs' motion to dismiss ROSS's § 1 tying claim. \nII. State Law Counterclaims \nA. California Unfair Competition Law \nROSS's counterclaim under California unfair competition law depends in part on federal \nantitrust law. (D.I. 36 at 44 ,r 173) (\"[Plaintiffs'] conduct is unlawful, unfair, or fraudulent \nbecause it is in violation of Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act, and also in violation of the \npolicy or spirit of the Sherman Act.\") Plaintiffs admit that ROSS's California claim \"rises or \nfalls\" with the federal antitrust claims. (Tr. at 26-27) Because ROSS will be permitted to \npursue its § 1 and § 2 claims, as discussed above, the Court will deny Plaintiffs' motion with \nrespect to the California claim. 5 \nB. Delaware Common Law On Unfair Competition \nThe final count in the amended counterclaims alleges that Plaintiffs have violated \nDelaware common law on unfair competition. (D.I. 36 at 45 ,r,r 176-80) Under Delaware law, \n\"the elements of the tort of unfair competition are that the plaintiff has a reasonable expectancy \nof entering a valid business relationship, with which the defendant wrongfully interferes, and \nthereby defeats the plaintiff's legitimate expectancy and causes [it] harm.\" Accenture Glob. \nServs. GmbH v. Guidewire Software Inc., 581 F. Supp. 2d 654, 656-66 (D. Del. 2008) (internal \n5 The Court need not and does not reach the issue of whether ROSS 's allegations of \ncopyright misuse would be sufficient to prevent the dismissal of Count VIII if the Court were to \ndismiss the federal antitrust claims. (See D.I. 38 at 19) \n15 Case 1:20-cv-00613-SB     Document 170     Filed 04/26/22     Page 16 of 18 PageID #:\n<pageID>quotation marks omitted); see also Rypac Packaging Mach. Inc. v. Coakley, 2000 WL 567895, at \n* 8 (Del. Ch. May 1, 2000). \nROSS alleges that it \"had a business expectancy to sell its legal search platform product \nin the market, having received ... indications from customers that they would purchase access to \nthe ROSS platform once it was tied to a reliable database. \" (D.I. 36 at 45 ,r 177) ROSS does \nnot identify or even allude to any specific party with whom it reasonably expected to enter into a \nvalid business relationship. (See Tr. at 49) (ROSS admitting that it did \"not allege [loss of] a \nspecific customer,\" just loss of \"business opportunities \") Although identifying a specific party \nby name is not necessary, ROSS still must \"plead facts to allow the court to 'reasonably infer that \nspecific parties were involved.\"' You Map, Inc. v. Snap Inc., 2021 WL 106498, at *9 (D. Del. \nJan. 12, 2021) (quoting Agilent Techs., Inc. v. Kirkland , 2009 WL 119865, at *7 (Del. Ch. Jan. \n20, 2009)), report and recommendation adopted, 2021 WL 327388 (D. Del. Feb. 1, 2021). \nROSS has not pied any facts that allow the Court to draw such an inference. \nROSS initially pointed to allegations regarding multiple antitrust theories as support for \nits Delaware law claim. (See D.I. 38 at 20) At the hearing, however, ROSS clarified that its \nallegations of sham litigation are the sole support for this claim. (See Tr. at 49) In fact, ROSS \nconceded that dismissal of the sham litigation claim under § 2 of the Sherman Act would warrant \ndismissal of the claim under Delaware unfair competition law. (Id. at 50) Because the Court \nwill dismiss ROSS 's sham litigation claim, the Court will also dismiss Count IX. \nIII. Amendment \nROSS asks for an opportunity to amend in order to correct any deficiencies identified in \nthe Court's decision on Plaintiffs' motion to dismiss. (D.I. 38 at 20; Tr. at 59) At this point, the \n16 Case 1:20-cv-00613-SB     Document 170     Filed 04/26/22     Page 17 of 18 PageID #:\n<pageID>Court lacks a record from which it could conclude that amendment would be futile or otherwise \nimproper. See generally Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a). Accordingl y, ROSS may file amended \ncounterclaims, provided that it does so no later than May 20, 2022. The Court's grant of leave \nto amend is without prejudice to Plaintiffs ' having an opportunity to move to dismiss any \namended counterclaims. \nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, Plaintiffs ' renewed motion to dismiss ROSS's antitrust and \nunfair competition counterclaims (D.I. 39) will be granted in part and denied in part. An \nappropriate order follows. \n17 Case 1:20-cv-00613-SB     Document 170     Filed 04/26/22     Page 18 of 18 PageID #:\n<pageID>",

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: In the case of *Thomson Reuters v. ROSS Intelligence Inc.*, the court ruled on allegations of direct copyright infringement involving the unauthorized use of Westlaw's content by ROSS Intelligence Inc. ROSS, seeking to train its legal AI tool, allegedly used Westlaw’s copyrighted headnotes obtained indirectly. The court granted partial summary judgment in favor of Thomson Reuters, ruling against ROSS on the grounds of direct copyright infringement and dismissing ROSS's fair use defense, among others. The case significantly involves AI, as ROSS utilized AI technology to develop its legal research tool using the infringing content.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: The central legal issue is whether ROSS Intelligence’s actions constituted direct copyright infringement by using Westlaw’s headnotes to train its AI tool without authorization, and whether the use qualifies as fair use.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court held that ROSS Intelligence infringed on Thomson Reuters' copyrights involving Westlaw's headnotes and did not qualify for a fair use defense. Partial summary judgment was granted to Thomson Reuters on the copyright infringement claims, and ROSS's defenses were rejected, except for the factual determination regarding expired copyrights, which must be addressed at trial.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine you have a really fancy collection of notes summarizing important legal stuff - we'll call it a \"magic book of laws.\" You spent ages making it and can prove you own it. Now, someone else—let's call them \"Robbie\"—wants to make their own robot lawyer to help people with legal advice. But instead of making their own notes, Robbie snuck a look at your magic book and used your notes without asking. You're not happy about this and take them to court, saying, \"Hey! Robbie used my magic book without permission!\" The court agrees with you, saying Robbie copied your work, and Robbie’s reasons (like saying it was just for helping more people) weren’t good enough. So, you win, and Robbie's robot lawyer can't use your magic book notes anymore.",

Wis-\ndom does not always find me, so I try to embrace it when it  does––even if it comes \nlate, as it did here.  \nI thus revise my 2023 summary judgment opinion  and order  in this case . See Fed. \nR. Civ. P. 54(b) ; D.I. 547 , 548; Thomson Reuters Enter. Ctr. GmbH v. Ross Intel.  Inc., \n694 F. Supp. 3d 467 (D. Del. 2023) .

ROSS MAKES A LEGAL AI TOOL AND WESTLAW ’S OWNER SUES \nThe law is no  longer  a brooding omnipresence in the sky; it now dwells in legal -\nresearch platforms. Thomson Reuters owns one of the biggest of those platforms: \nWestlaw. D.I. 752 -1 at 4. Users can pay to access its contents, including “case law, \nstate and federal statutes, state and federal regulations, law journals, and treatises.” \nId. “Westlaw also contains editorial content and annotations,” like the headnotes \nhere. Id. Those headnotes summarize key points of law and case holdings. Westlaw \norganizes its content using the Key Number System, a numerical taxonomy. Id. \nThomson Reuters owns copyrights in Westlaw’s copyrightable material. Id. Case 1:20-cv-00613-SB     Document 770     Filed 02/11/25     Page 2 of 23 PageID #:\n<pageID> \n3 Ross , a new competitor to Westlaw , made a legal -research search engine that use s \nartificial intelligence. Id. To train its AI search tool, Ross needed a database of legal \nquestions and answers. Id. at 5. So Ross asked to license Westlaw’s content. Id. But \nbecause  Ross was its competitor , Thomson Reuters refused. Id. at 4–5. \nSo to train its AI,  Ross  made a deal with LegalEase to get training data  in the \nform of “Bulk Memos.” Id. at 5. Bulk Memos are lawyers’ compilations of legal ques-\ntions with  good and bad answers. LegalEase gave those lawyers a guide  explaining \nhow to create those questions using Westlaw headnotes, while clarifying that the law-\nyers should not just copy and paste headnotes directly into the question s. D.I. 678 -36 \nat 5–9. LegalEase sold Ross roughly 25,000 Bulk Memos, which Ross used to train its \nAI search tool. See D.I. 752 -1 at 5; D.I. 769 at  30 (10:48:35). In other words, Ross built \nits competing product using Bulk Memos, which in turn were built from Westlaw \nhead notes. When Thomson Reuter s found out, it sued Ross for copyright infringe-\nment.  \nIn 2023, I largely denied  Thomson Reuters’s motions for summary judgment on \ncopyright infringement and the fair -use defense , and the case moved ahead  toward \ntrial. D.I. 547, 548. In the run -up to the August 2024 trial date, I studied  the case \nmaterials more closely and realized that my prior summary -judgment ruling had not \ngone far enough . So I continued the trial and invited the parties to renew their  summary -\njudgment briefing. D.I. 663.  \nThomson Reuters once again moved for partial summary judgment on direct copy-\nright  infringement and related defenses. D.I. 674. Ross moved for summary judgment Case 1:20-cv-00613-SB     Document 770     Filed 02/11/25     Page 3 of 23 PageID #:\n<pageID> \n4 on Thomson Reuters’s copyright claims. D.I. 683. And b oth sides again moved for \nsummary judgment on fair use. D.I. 672, 676. I now revis e parts of my 2023 summary -\njudgment opinion. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(b).  \nI may grant summary judgment only if there is “no genuine dispute as to any \nmaterial fact  and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law .” Fed. R. Civ. \nP. 56(a). I view all facts and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmovant. \nTundo v. County of Passaic , 923 F.3d 283, 286 –87 (3d Cir. 2019).  \nII. I GRANT PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT TO THOMSON REUTERS , NOT ROSS, ON \nDIRECT COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT AND RELATED DEFENSES  \nThe dispute boils down to whether the LegalEase Bulk Memo questions copied \nThomson Reuters’s headnotes or were instead taken from uncopyrightable judicial \nopinions . To decide many issues here, one  must compare the Bulk Memo  questions, \nheadnotes, and opinions side by side . I include the table below as an example. The \nquestions and headnotes in this case are sealed. So the headnote and question in this \ntable are not actual materials from the record , but an example I  created  based on \nFeist Publications, Inc. v. Rural Tel. Serv. Co. , 499 U.S. 340, 345 (1991).  \n \nQuestion  West Headnote  Case Opinion  \nDoes  originality for copy-\nright purposes mean that \nthe work was inde-\npendently created and has \nsome minimal degree of \ncreativity ? Originality, for copyright \npurposes, means that the \nwork was independently \ncreated and has some min-\nimal degree of creativity.  Original, as the term is \nused in copyright, means \nonly that the work was \nindependently created by \nthe author (as opposed to \ncopied from other works), \nand that it possesses at \nleast some minimal degree \nof creativity.   \n Case 1:20-cv-00613-SB     Document 770     Filed 02/11/25     Page 4 of 23 PageID #:\n<pageID> \n5 As I later explain , I hold that : \n• Ross infringed  2,243  headnotes.  As to those headnotes, the only remaining \nfactual issue is whether some of their copyrights have expired.  \n• Ross’s innocent infringement, copyright misuse, merger, and scenes à faire  \ndefenses all fail.  \nA. Direct copyright infringement  \nThomson  Reuters alleges that Ross directly infringed its copyright s. To show that, \nThomson Reuters must show both that (1) it owned a valid copyright and (2)  Ross \ncopied protectable  elements of the copyrighted work. Feist , 499 U.S. at 361. The sec-\nond element requires showing both that (2a) Ross actually copied the work and that \n(2b) its copy was substantially similar to the work.  Dam Things from Den . v. Russ \nBerrie & Co. , 290 F.3d 548, 561 –62 (3d Cir. 2002).  \n(i) Copyright validity  \nCopyright validity is a question of law, not fact, making it suitable for summary \njudgment. See Silvertop Assocs. Inc. v. Kangaroo Mfg. Inc. , 931 F.3d 215, 219 (3d Cir. \n2019). But an underlying factual dispute remains here. So the jury may need to  decide \nthis issue , but for reasons different from the ones I gave in my prior summary -judg-\nment opinion.  \nThomson Reuters must show  that it had a valid copyright. Copyright registrations \nare “prima facie evidence of the validity of the copyright ” if “made before or within \nfive years after first publication of the work .” 17 U.S.C. §  410(c).  Thomson Reuters \nhas copyright registrations for Westlaw’s copyrightable content. D.I. 752 -1 at 4. And \nit docketed registrations from 1981 to 20 19. D.I. 1 -1. So it has a valid compilation Case 1:20-cv-00613-SB     Document 770     Filed 02/11/25     Page 5 of 23 PageID #:\n<pageID> \n6 copyright.  But if Thomson Reuters chooses to try this case based on a theory of infringe-\nment  of individual headnotes as individual works rather than infringement of the \ncompilation as a whole, t here is still  a factual dispute about  which individual head-\nnotes are both within the period covered by Thomson Reuters’s  registrations  and not \nin the public domain . See D.I. 755, 757, 761 , 763 . So, if Thomson Reuters advances a \ntheory of damages that depends on the infringement of specific headnotes,  this evi-\ndentiary matter must be taken up at  trial.  \nIn my 2023 opinion, I concluded  that this issue would need to go to a jury, but for \na different reason. I held that a jury would need to decide whether the headnotes and \nKey Number System were original enough. 694 F. Supp. 3d at 477 –78.  \nOriginality is central to copyright. The Constitution limits copyright protection to \noriginal works. See Feist , 499 U.S. at 346. So even if Thomson Reuters gets a pre-\nsumption of validity because of the copyright registrations, Ross could rebut the pre-\nsumption by showing that the works are not original. I  previously  thought that orig-\ninality “depend[ed] on how much the headnotes overlap with the [uncopyrightable \ntext of] opinions.” 694 F. Supp. 3d at 478. And I explained that the Key Number Sys-\ntem’s originali ty was a jury question because Ross alleges that “most of the organiza-\ntion decisions are made by a rote computer program and the high -level topics largely \ntrack common doctrinal topics taught as law school courses.” Id. at 477 (internal quo-\ntation marks omitted).  \nBut the originality threshold is “extremely low,” requiring only “some minimal \ndegree of creativity …. some creative spark.” Id. at 345. The key question, then, is Case 1:20-cv-00613-SB     Document 770     Filed 02/11/25     Page 6 of 23 PageID #:\n<pageID> \n7 whether a work is original, not how much effort went into developing it. Id. at 359 –\n60. So I now revise those parts of my prior opinion. Now I see no genuine dispute that \nthe headnotes and Key Number System clear Feist ’s minimal threshold for originality.  \n1. The h eadnotes  are origina l. A headnote  is a short, key point of law chiseled out \nof a lengthy judicial opinion. The text of judicial opinions is not copyrightable . Banks \nv. Manchester , 128 U.S. 244, 253 –54 (1888). And e ven if it were, Thomson Reuters \nwould not get that copyright because it did not write the opinions. But a  headnote \ncan introduce creativity by distilling, synthesizing, or explaining part of an opinion, \nand thus be copyrightable . That is why I have changed my mind . \nFirst, the headnotes a re a compilation. “Factual compilations” are original if the \ncompiler makes “choices as to selection and arrangement” using “a minimal degree of \ncreativity.” Feist , 499 U.S. at 348. Thomson Reuters’s selection and arrangement of \nits headnotes easily clears that low bar .  \nMore than that,  each headnote is an individual,  copyrightable work. That became \nclear to me once I analogized the lawyer’s editorial judgment to that of a sculptor. A \nblock of raw marble, like a judicial opinion, is not copyrightable. Yet a sculptor creates \na sculpture by choosing what to cut away and what to leave in place. That sculpture \nis copyrightable. 17 U.S.C. §  102(a)(5). So too, even a headnote taken verbatim from \nan opinion is a carefully chosen fraction of the whole. Identifying which words matter  \nand chiseling away  the surrounding  mass  expre sses the editor’s idea about what the \nimportant point of law from the opinion is. That editorial expression  has enough Case 1:20-cv-00613-SB     Document 770     Filed 02/11/25     Page 7 of 23 PageID #:\n<pageID> \n8 “creative spark” to be original. Feist , 499 U.S. at 345. So all headnotes, even any that \nquote judicial opinions verbatim,  have original value as individual works.   \nThat belated insight explains my change of heart. In my 2023 opinion, I wrongly \nviewed the degree of overlap between the headnote text and the case opinion text as \ndispositive  of originality . 694 F. Supp. 3d at 478. I no longer think that is so. But I \nam still not granting summary judgment on any headnotes that are verbatim copies \nof the case opinion (for reasons  that I explain below) . \n2. The Key Number System  is original  too. There  is no genuine issue of material \nfact about the Key Number System’s originality . Recall that Westlaw uses this tax-\nonomy to organize its materials. Even if “most of the organization decisions are made \nby a rote computer program and the high -level topics largely track common doctrinal \ntopics taught as law school courses,” it still has t he minimum “spark” of originality. \nId. at 477  (internal quotation marks omitted) ; Feist , 499 U.S. at 345. The question is \nwhether  the system is original, not how hard Thomas Reuters worked to create it.  \nFeist , 499 U.S. at 35 9–60. So whether a rote computer program did the work is not \ndispositive. And it does not matter if the Key Number System categorizes opinions \ninto legal buckets  that any first -year law student would recognize . To be original, a \ncompilation need not be “novel ,” just “independently created by” Thomson Reuters . \nId. at 345 –46. There are many possible, logical ways to organize legal topics  by level \nof granularity . It is enough t hat Thomson Reuters chose a particular one.  Case 1:20-cv-00613-SB     Document 770     Filed 02/11/25     Page 8 of 23 PageID #:\n<pageID> \n9 Thus, I grant summary judgment for Thomson Reuters on whether  the headnotes \nand the Key Number System  are original enough  to prevent Ross from rebutting any \npresumption of validity . \n(ii) Copying of original elements  \nNext, I turn to whether there was “copying of constituent elements of the work \nthat are original.” Feist , 499 U.S. at 361. I must decide whether Thomson Reuters \nhas proven both (a) actual copying and (b) substantial similarity. Dam Things , 290 \nF.3d at 561–62.  \n1. A few preliminaries . Before applying that analysis, I must determine which \nparts of the case to apply it to. Ross moves for summary judgment on all the pieces \nthat Thomson Reuters  accuse s Ross of infring ing: 21,787 headnotes, the editorial deci-\nsions in 500 judicial opinions,  and West’s Key Number System. D.I. 684 at 9 –11. I see \nno proof sufficient to take  all these items away from a jury.   \nThomson Reuters , for its part,  moves for summary judgment on only two subset s \nof the headnotes. D.I. 6 94 at 20 n.8. The two batches contain  5,367 and 2,830  head-\nnotes  each .  \nI reach no new decision on the Key Number System. There are still factual dis-\nputes about whether Ross used it and how, so I cannot analyze what protected ele-\nments Ross may have used. So I leave my prior ruling on this topic in place. Nor do I \ndecide the fa te of the 500 judicial opinions containing Thomson Reuters’s editorial \ndecisions, because there are still factual questions about how and how much Ross \naccessed that material. For now, I consider only the batch of 2,830 headnotes identi-\nfied by Thomson Reut ers.  Case 1:20-cv-00613-SB     Document 770     Filed 02/11/25     Page 9 of 23 PageID #:\n<pageID> \n10 I leave the 5,367 for trial because Thomson Reuters’s argument for summary  judg-\nment on that batch is flawed. Thomson Reuters points out that after I ordered Ross \nto submit a list of headnotes that are verbatim or near -verbatim quotations of judicial \nopinions , Ross did not submit the se 5,367 . D.I. 675 at 24.  And it contends that Ross \nthereby admitted that these headnotes are protectable.  Id. Perhaps I could view that \nas a concession about how similar the headnotes are to the judicial opinions. But \nRoss’s omi ssion makes no concession about the more important issue: whether the \nBulk Memo questions  copied these headnotes, or even whether the questions are \ncloser to the headnote or to the judicial opinion. So it is not appropriate to grant sum-\nmary judgment to Thomson Reuters on the 5,367 headnotes based on this reasoning. \n(Because I did not look at this batch, I need not address Ross’s objection that it had \nno chance to respond to Thomson Reuters’s expert’s opinion on the 5,367 headnotes. \nD.I. 749.)   \nBut it is appropriate to address the other 2,830 now at summary judgment. Before \nI explain why and how I address this batch,  I must first clean up whether the batch \nin fact  has 2,830 headnotes . There are two disputes. First, Ross’s expert, Barbara  \nFrederiksen -Cross , put 3,384 headnotes in this category, but the parties dispute \nwhether 554 of the m are still covered by valid copyright registrations.  To resolve this, \nI looked at all 3,384 but make summary judgment contingent on the jury’s findings \nabout which 2,830 (or other number) still have valid copyrights .  \nSecond, Ross claims that Thomson Reuters never asserted that 1,623 of the 2,830 \nheadnotes were infringed, so at first , I denied  summary judgment on them. 694 Case 1:20-cv-00613-SB     Document 770     Filed 02/11/25     Page 10 of 23 PageID #:\n<pageID> \n11 F. Supp. 3d at 479. Ross says I should again deny summary judgment because Thom-\nson Reuters did not include these 1,623 headnotes when I ordered it to produce a list \nof allegedly infringing headnotes. D.I. 201; D.I. 324 ¶¶  28–30; D.I. 324 -23 (Ross’s \nspreadsheet identifying the 1,623). But on the same day that Thomson Reuters dock-\neted its interrogatory response lacking those 1,623 headnotes, Ross docketed the expert \nreport conceding them.  D.I. 2 66-1 at 431 (Frederiksen -Cross’s report) ; D.I. 281-3–281-\n8 (Thomson Reuters’s interro gatory response) . So Thomson Reuters did not have a \nchance to  analyze Ross’s expert report before submitting its list of headnotes . Plus, \nRoss had the chance to respond to these 1,623 headnotes w hen Thomson Reuters \nraised them  at summary judgment . And Ross’s own expert analyzed them, so there \nwas no danger of unfair surprise. I revise my prior ruling and now consider these \n1,623 headnotes as fairly part of the case.   \nHaving sorted through that morass, I apply the actual -copying and substantial -\nsimilarity analys es to the 3,384 headnotes, which include the 2,830.  \n2. Actual copying . Actual copying means that “the defendant did, in fact, use the \ncopyrighted work in creating his own.” Tanksley v. Daniels , 902 F.3d 165, 173 (3d Cir. \n2018). One can prove this direct ly, with  evidence that the defendant copied the work , \nor indirectly, by showing that the defendant had access to it and produced something \nsimilar  (“probative similarity” ). Id. \nWhen evaluating copying, I may consider expert opinions. See Kay Berry , Inc. v. \nTaylor Gifts, Inc. , 421 F.3d 199, 208 (3d Cir. 2005). Frederiksen -Cross submitted a n \nexpert  report stating that the Bulk Memo questions for this batch closely resemble Case 1:20-cv-00613-SB     Document 770     Filed 02/11/25     Page 11 of 23 PageID #:\n<pageID> \n12 the headnotes’ text and that the headnotes differ significantly from the text of the \njudicial opinions. D.I. 266 -1 at 431, 435; D.I. 675 at 10. Her finding  suggests that \nthese questions were created by copying Westlaw headnotes, not by summarizing the \nunderlying opinions. I view that as Ross’s expert conceding that the 2,830 were actu-\nally copied.  \nBut to make sure, the Court has now compared how similar each of the 2,830 Bulk \nMemo questions, headnotes, and judicial opinions are, one by one. The parties agree \nthat LegalEase had access to Westlaw and used it to make the Bulk Memos. Of \ncourse, access alone is not proof. But  a Bulk Memo question that looks more like a \nheadnote than it does like the underlying judicial opinion is strong circumstantial \nevidence of actual copying. M y comparison of the questions, headnotes, and opinions  \ncan decide  whether probative similarity  is present, so long as I think no reasonable \njury could reach a different conclusion . Access plus probative similarity adds up to  \nevidence of actual copying. To be sure, there was some confusion at the summary \njudgment hearing about whether Ross used all the Bulk Memos. See D.I. 769 at 30 \n(10:48:35) , 162 (14:36:24) . Ross’s counsel said that some Bulk Memos were discarded \nbut twice confirmed that Ross had used 80 % for initial training and 20% for later \nvalidation . D.I. 769 at 30 (10:48:35) , 162 (14:36:24) . So taking counsel at his word, \nRoss used practically 100% to train its AI.  \nHaving slogged  through all 2,830 headnotes, I grant summary judgment to Thom-\nson Reuters  on actual copying , finding actual copying of 2,243 . Appendix A to this \nopinion , filed under seal, catalogues the specific headnotes. I grant summary Case 1:20-cv-00613-SB     Document 770     Filed 02/11/25     Page 12 of 23 PageID #:\n<pageID> \n13 judgment only on the headnotes for which actual copying  is so obvious that no rea-\nsonable jury could find otherwise.  \n3. Substantial similarity . Substantial similarity requires evaluating  whether “the \nlater work materially appropriates the copyrighted work.” Tanksley , 902 F.3d at 173. \nThat means deciding  which parts of the actually copied  work  are original expression \nand so protected by copyright. Substantial similarity is often “an extremely close \nquestion of fact,” and thus well  suited to the jury. Id. at 171 (internal quotation marks \nomitted). But summary judgment can be “appropriate” when “no reasonable jury \ncould find ” otherwise. Id. (internal quotation marks omitted). The question is  whether \nan ordinary user of a product would find it substantially similar  to the copyrighted \nwork . Dam Things , 290 F.3d at 562. As a lawyer and judge, I am myself an ordinary \nuser of Westlaw headnotes. So I am well  positioned to determine substantial similar-\nity here. I do  so cautiously, and o nly on those headnotes for which I am confident that \na reasonable jury could not conclude otherwise.  \nRoss argues that the Bulk Memo questions must be not just substantially similar \nto the headnotes, but virtually identical. The Ninth Circuit takes this approach to \n“thin” copyrights because “the range of protectable … expression is narrow.” Apple \nComput., Inc. v. Microsoft Corp. , 35 F.3d 1435, 1439 , 1446  (9th Cir. 1994). But sub-\nstantial similarity is always a spectrum , whether the copyright is “thin” or “thick.”  \n“More similarity is required when less protectable matter is at issue.” 4 Nimmer on \nCopyright  § 13D.32 [A]. Other terms for this concept include Nimmer’s “supersubstan-\ntial similarity” and the Second Circuit’s “more discerning” ordinary -observer test. Id.; Case 1:20-cv-00613-SB     Document 770     Filed 02/11/25     Page 13 of 23 PageID #:\n<pageID> \n14 Knitwaves, Inc. v. Lollytogs Ltd. , 71 F.3d 996, 1002 –03 (2d Cir. 1995). Though I do \nnot apply the Ninth Circuit’s test explicitly, I do apply the concept underlying all \nthese terms: The less protectable expression a work contains, the more similar the \nallegedly infringing work must be to it . \nApplying this standard, I grant summary judgment on substantial similarity for \nThomson Reuters on the 2,243  headnotes listed in Appendix A, finding that the Bulk \nMemo questions were substantially similar to them. Again, I grant summary judg-\nment only on the headnotes for which substantial similarity  is so obvious that no \nreasonable jury could find otherwise. In practice, this means  that I am grant ing sum-\nmary judgment only on the headnotes whose language  very closely track s the lan-\nguage of the Bulk Memo quest ion but not the language of the case opinion. The rest \nof the headnotes must go to trial.  I do not grant summary judgment to Ross on any \nheadnotes because there are none for which I am confident  that a reasonable jury \ncould not find infringement. I do not decide at summary judgment the factual ques-\ntion of which headnotes are still covered by Thomson Reuters’s existing copyrights \nand leave this question open for trial.  \nB. Ross’s defenses to copyright infringement fail \nNone of  Ross’s possible defenses holds water . I reject them all.   \nFirst, innocent infringement does not apply. Ross  claims that any infringement \nwas innocent. As the parties agree, innocent infringement does not limit liability, just \ndamages . 17 U.S.C. §  504(c)(2). But this limit does not apply when the infringed work \nbears a copyright notice, as Westlaw ’s headnotes  do. 17 U.S.C. §  401(d).  Case 1:20-cv-00613-SB     Document 770     Filed 02/11/25     Page 14 of 23 PageID #:\n<pageID> \n15 Second, copyright  misuse does not apply either. Ross  claims that Thomson Reu-\nters misused its copyright . Copyright misuse is a defense when a copyright holder \nweaponizes the copyright against the public interest, typically for “anti -competitive \nbehavior.” Video Pipeline, Inc. v. Buena Vista Home Ent., Inc. , 342 F.3d 191, 203 –06 \n(3d Cir. 2003). But as I already ruled at summary judgment  on Ross’s antitrust cou n-\nterclaims , Ross has not shown that Thomson Reuters misused its copyrights to stifle \ncompetition. D.I . 669.  \nThird, the merger defense is inapt. Ross claims that any ideas were so close to the \nexpression that they merged with the expression, making it uncopyrightable . Educ. \nTesting Servs. v. Katzman , 793 F.2d 533, 539 (3d Cir. 1986). But there are many ways \nto express points of law from judicial opinions, so I reject this defense as well.  \nFourth , the scenes à  faire  defense does not fit . This defense covers stock elements \nthat follow from the work’s nature, like a historical romance novel’s damsel in dis-\ntress. Atari, Inc. v. N. Am. Philips Consumer Elec s. Corp. , 672 F.2d 607, 616 (7th Cir. \n1982).  But nothing about a judicial opinion requires it to  be slimmed down to Thom-\nson Reuters’s headnotes or categorized by key numbers.  \nIII. THOMSON REUTERS , NOT ROSS, PREVAILS ON THE FAIR-USE DEFENSE  \nThere remains one more defense. In my 2023  opinion , I denied summary judgment \non fair use. D.I. 548; 694 F. Supp. 3d at 482 –87. But with new information and un-\nderstanding, I vacate those sections of that order and its accompanying opinion ad-\ndressing fair use. Fair use  is an affirmative defense , so Ross bears the burden of proof. \nVideo Pipeline , 342 F.3d at 197.  Case 1:20-cv-00613-SB     Document 770     Filed 02/11/25     Page 15 of 23 PageID #:\n<pageID> \n16  I must consider  at least  four fair -use factors: (1) the use’s purpose and character, \nincluding whether it is commercial or nonprofit;  (2) the copyrighted work’s nature;  \n(3) how much of the work was used and how substantial a part it was relative to the \ncopyrighted work’s whole; an d (4) how Ross’s use affected the copyrighted work’s \nvalue or potential market . 17 U.S.C. §  107(1)–(4). The first and fourth factors weigh \nmost heavily in the analysis. Authors Guild v. Google, Inc. , 804 F.3d 202, 220 (2d Cir. \n2015) (Leval, J.).  \n“Fair use is a mixed question of law  and fact .” Harper & Row , Publishers, Inc. v. \nNation Enters. , 471 U.S. 539, 560 (1985) . But “[i]n this case, the ultimate ‘fair use’ \nquestion primarily involves legal work.” Google  LLC v. Oracle Am ., Inc. , 593 U.S. 1, \n24 (2021) . The undisputed facts here push this case squarely  into the legal realm. \nOnce we get past actual copying, the remaining issues that matter are not ones of \nhistorical fact, intent, or factual prediction. They are about how to apply the law to \nthe facts. So here, fair use  is a question for the jud ge, not the jury. Thomson Reuters \nprevails on the two most important  and on the overall balancing.   \nA. Factor one goes to Thomson Reuters  \nFirst, I consider the purpose and character of Ross’s use . 17 U.S.C. §  107(1). I look \nmainly at whether it was commercial and whether it was transformative . Andy War-\nhol Found. for the Visual Arts , Inc.  v. Goldsmith , 598 U.S. 508, 529 –31 (2023).  If Ross \nand Thomson Reuters use  copyrighted material like the headnotes  for very similar pur-\nposes and Ross’s use is commercial, this factor likely disfavors fair use. Id. at 532 –33. \n1. Ross’s use is commercial . Ross admits as much . D.I. 727 at 29.  It “stands to \nprofit from exploitation of the copyrighted material without paying the customary Case 1:20-cv-00613-SB     Document 770     Filed 02/11/25     Page 16 of 23 PageID #:\n<pageID> \n17 price.” Harper & Row , 471 U.S. at 562. But commerciality is not dispositive. I must \nbalance it against how different this work’s purpose or character is. Warhol , 598 U.S. \nat 525.  \n2. Ross’s use is not transformative . Transformativeness is about the purpose of the \nuse. “If an original work and a secondary use share the same or highly similar pur-\nposes, and the second use is of a commercial nature, the first factor is likely to weigh \nagainst fair use, absent some other ju stification for copying.” Warhol , 598 U.S. at \n532–33. It weighs against fair use  here.  Ross’s use is not transformative because it does \nnot have a “further purpose or different character” from Thomson Reuters’s. Id. at 529.  \nRoss was using Thomson Reuters’s  headnotes as AI data to create a legal research \ntool to compete with Westlaw. It is undisputed that Ross’s AI is not generative AI (AI \nthat writes new content itself). Rather, when a user enters a legal question, Ross spits \nback relevant judicial opinions that have already been written . D.I. 723 at 5. That \nprocess resembles how Westlaw uses headnotes and key numbers to return a list of \ncases with fitting headnotes. Thomson Reuters uses its headnotes and Key Number \nSystem primarily to help legal researchers navigate Westlaw and  (possibly, as  the \nparties dispute this)  to improve Westlaw’s internal search tool. D.I. 769 at  14 \n(10:24:52). The parties agree that Ross and Westlaw are competitors. D.I. 752 -1 at 4.  \nSo at first glance, this factor looks simple.  \nBut, as Ross argues, the headnotes do not appear as part of the final product that \nRoss put forward to consumers. The copying occurred at an intermediate step: Ross Case 1:20-cv-00613-SB     Document 770     Filed 02/11/25     Page 17 of 23 PageID #:\n<pageID> \n19 31. The copying in Sony  was also necessary. The Ninth Circuit “appl[ied] fair use to \nintermediate copying  [that was]  necessary to reverse engineer access to unprotected \nfunctional elements within a program.” Id. at 22. “[I]ntermediate copying … was a \nfair use for the purpose of gaining access to the unprotected elements of Sony’s soft-\nware.” Sony , 203 F.3d at 602. Likewise, Sega  addressed copying that occurred “solely \nin order to discover the functional requirements for compatibility.” 977 F.2d at 1522. \nHere , though, there is no computer code whose underlying ideas can be reached only \nby copying their expression. The “copying is [not] reasonably necessary to achieve the \nuser’s new purpose.” Warhol , 598 U.S. at 532.  \nMy prior opinion wrongly concluded that I had to send this factor to a jury. 694 F. \nSupp. 3d at 483 –84. I based that conclusion  on Sony  and Sega . Since then, I have \nrealized that the intermediate -copying  cases (1) are computer -programming copying \ncases ; and (2) depend in part on the need to copy to reach the underlying ideas . Nei-\nther is true here. Because of that, t his case fits more neatly into the newer framework \nadvanced by Warhol . I thus look to the  broad  purpose and character of Ross’s use. \nRoss took the headnotes to make it easier to develop a competing legal research tool. \nSo Ross’s use is not transformative.  Because the AI landscape is changi ng rapidly, I \nnote for readers  that only non -generative AI is before me today.  \n3. Even if relevant , bad faith would not move the needle . The Supreme Court has \nexpressed “some skepticism about whether bad faith has any role in a fair use analy-\nsis.” Google , 593 U.S. at 32. If it does,  a reasonable jury might find that Ross, by going \nforward and arguably inducing LegalEase’s copying after Thomson Reuters refused Case 1:20-cv-00613-SB     Document 770     Filed 02/11/25     Page 19 of 23 PageID #:\n<pageID> \n20 to license its content, acted in bad faith. B ut because Ross’s use was commercial and \nnot transformative, I need not consider this possible element . Even if I found no bad \nfaith , that finding would not outweigh the other two considerations.  \nB. Factor two goes to  Ross  \nSecond, I ask about the nature of the  original work. 17 U.S.C. §  107(2) . That involves  \n“focus[ing] on the degree of creativity inherent to the work.” 4 Nimmer on Copyright  \n§ 13F.06 . More creative works get more protection. Id. § 13F.06[A].  \nWestlaw’s material has more than the minimal spark of originality  required for \ncopyright validity . But the material is not that creative. Though the headnotes required \neditorial creativity and judgment,  that creativity is less than that of a novelist or artist \ndrafting a work from scratch.  And the Key Number System is a factual compilation, \nso its creativity is limited.  \nI signaled a similar leaning before. 694 F. Supp. 3d at 48 4–85. Yet I stopped short \nof granting summary judgment based on factual disputes about how much creativity \nwas involved. Now, as I concluded above,  there is no factual dispute that the head-\nnotes have creative elements but are far from the most creative works.  \nSo factor two goes for Ross. Note, though, that this factor “has rarely played a \nsignificant role in the determination of a fair use dispute.” Authors Guild , 804 F.3d \nat 220. \nC. Factor three goes to  Ross  \nThird, I focus on how much of the work was used and how substantial a part it \nwas relative to the whole . 17 U.S.C. §  107(3). I ask whether that usage was “reasona-\nble in relation to the purpose of the copying.” Campbell v. Acuff -Rose Music, Inc. , 510 Case 1:20-cv-00613-SB     Document 770     Filed 02/11/25     Page 20 of 23 PageID #:\n<pageID> \n21 U.S. 569, 586 (1994). Courts consider both “the quantity of the materials used” and \n“their quality and importance.” Id. at 587. To win on this factor, the alleged copier \nmust not take the “heart” of the work. Id. \nMy prior opinion did not decide factor three but suggested that it leaned towards \nRoss . The opinion  focused on Ross’s claim that its output to an end user is a judicial \nopinion, not a West headnote, so it “communicates little sense of the original.” 649 F. \nSupp. 3d at 485 ( quoting  Authors Guild , 804 F.3d at 223).  \nI stand by that reasoning, but now go a step further and decide factor three for \nRoss.  There is no factual dispute : Ross’s output to an end user does not include a West \nheadnote . What matters is not “the amount and substantiality of the portion used in \nmaking a copy , but rather the amount and substantiality of what is thereby made \naccessible  to a public for which it may serve as a competing substitute.” Authors \nGuild , 804 F.3d at 222  (internal quotation marks omitted) . Because Ross did not \nmake West headnotes available to the public, Ross benefits from factor three.  \nIn its briefing, Ross emphasized that the number of headnotes allegedly taken \namounted to only  a small percentage of the total headnotes owned by Westlaw. That \nargument is inapt . If taking 300 words out of President Ford’s memoirs could count \nas taking the heart of the work, so too can taking several thousand headnotes out of \nWestlaw. Campbell , 510 U.S. at 58 7. The percentage of a total work copied is neither \nnecessary nor sufficient to decide factor three. But Ross wins this factor anyway.  \nD. Factor four goes to Thomson Reuters  \nFactor four “is undoubtedly the single most important element of fair use.” Harper \n& Row , 471 U.S. at 56 6. For this factor , I consider the “likely effect [of Ross’s copying] Case 1:20-cv-00613-SB     Document 770     Filed 02/11/25     Page 21 of 23 PageID #:\n<pageID> \n22 on the market for the original.” Campbell , 510 U.S. at 590. I must consider not only \ncurrent markets but also potential derivative ones “that creators of original works \nwould in general develop or license others to develop.” Id. at 592. I also consider any \n“public benefits the copying will likely produce.” Google , 593 U.S. at 35. The original \nmarket is obvious: legal -research platforms. And at least one  potential derivative \nmarket is also obvious: data to train legal AIs.  \nMy prior opinion left this factor  for the jury. I thought that “Ross’s use might be \ntransformative, creating a brand -new research platform that serves a different pur-\npose than Westlaw.” 694 F. Supp. 3d at 486. If that were true, then Ross would not \nbe a market substitute for Westlaw. Plus, I worried whether there was a relevant, \ngenuine issue of material fact about whether Thomson Reuters w ould use its data to \ntrain AI tools  or sell its headnotes as training data . Id. And I thought a jury ought to \nsort out “whether the public ’s interest is better served by protecting a creator  or a \ncopier.” Id. \nIn hindsight, those concerns are unpersuasive. Even taking all facts in favor of \nRoss, it meant to compete with Westlaw by developing a market substitute. D.I. 752 -1 \nat 4. And it does not matter whether Thomson Reuters has used the data to train its \nown legal search tools; the effect on a potential  market for AI training data is enough.  \nRoss bears  the burden of proof. It has not put forward enough facts to show that these \nmarkets do not exist and would not be affected . \nNor does a possible benefit to the public save Ross. Yes, there is a public interest \nin accessing the law. But legal opinions are freely available , and “the public’s interest Case 1:20-cv-00613-SB     Document 770     Filed 02/11/25     Page 22 of 23 PageID #:\n<pageID> \n23 in the subject matter” alone is not enough.  Harper & Row , 471 U.S. at 569. The public \nhas no right to Thomson Reuters’s parsing of the law. Copyrights encourage people \nto develop things that help society, like good legal -research tools. Their builders earn \nthe right to be paid accordingly. This case is distinguishable from Google , where the \nAPI was valuable “because users, including programmers, [were] just used to it.” 593 \nU.S. at 3 8. There is nothing that Thomson Reuters created that Ross could not have \ncreated for itself or hired LegalEase to create for it  without infring ing Thomson Reu-\nters’s copyrights .  \nE. Balancing the factors, I reject Ross’s fair -use defense  \nFactors  one and four favor Thomson Reuters . Factor s two and three favor Ross . \nFactor two  matters less  than the others, and factor four matters more . Weighing them \nall together, I grant summary judgment for Thomson Reuters on fair use.    \n* * * * * \nI grant partial summary judgment to Thomson Reuters on direct copyright infringe-\nment for the headnotes in Appendix A.  For those headnotes, the only remaining fac-\ntual issue on liability is that some of those copyrights may have expired  or been  untimely  \ncreated . This factual question underlying copyright validity is for the jury . I also grant \nsummary judgment to Thomson Reuters against Ross’s defenses of innocent infringe-\nment, copyright misuse, merger, scenes à faire , and fair use. I deny Ross’s motions for \nsummary judgment on direct copyright infringement and fair use. I revise all parts \nof my prior opinions that conflict with this one. I leave undisturbed the parts of my \nprior opinion not addressed in this one, such as my ruling s on contributory liability, \nvicarious liability , and tortious interference with contract.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: This case involves a legal dispute between Thomson Reuters and ROSS Intelligence, where Thomson Reuters accused ROSS of copyright infringement in using its legal database to develop a competing AI-based search tool. ROSS countersued, alleging antitrust violations by Thomson Reuters for tying its legal search tool with its legal database, making it difficult for competitors to enter the market. The court granted summary judgment to Thomson Reuters on the antitrust counterclaims due to ROSS's failure to demonstrate separate products or define relevant markets.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether Thomson Reuters engaged in illegal tying by bundling its legal search tool with its legal database, thereby violating antitrust laws.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court granted summary judgment to Thomson Reuters, finding that ROSS failed to provide sufficient evidence of separate products or properly define the relevant markets necessary to sustain its antitrust claims.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine you want to buy a toy car, but the only way to get it is to also buy a big toy castle. You might think that's unfair if you only want the car. ROSS said that Thomson Reuters was doing something similar by only selling its legal search tools with its big collection of legal documents, making it tough for others like ROSS to sell similar search tools. The judge decided ROSS didn't show enough proof that people wanted the car (search tools) alone or defined the toy (market) well enough to support their complaint.",

Ross contends that \nThomson Reuters  violated and still violate s antitrust laws , but Ross  has not back ed \nup its allegations  with enough evidence . So I grant summary judgment to Thomson \nReuters  on those counterclaims .  \nI. BACKGROUND  \nThe antitrust issues here are just one part of a larger case. Thomson Reuters’s \nWestlaw platform has an extensive collection of  legal sources (including  judicial opin-\nions) and accompanying search tool s to navigate them . D.I. 170 at 1 –2. Ross  tried to \nbuild a better  legal search tool using artificial intelligence. Id. Thomson Reuters sued  \nRoss  for copyright infringement , alleging that Ross  had used Thomson Reuters’s intel-\nlectual  property  to build its search tool. Compl., D.I. 1 at 2 –3. The copyright lawsuit \nis pending before me . D.I. 667.  \nRoss then brought these antitrust counterclaims. D.I. 24  at 42 –44. This Court  dis-\nmissed  some  of th ese claims, D.I. 170, but three counts  survived to discovery on a \ntheory that Westlaw ties its caselaw database to its search tools. Those counts  now \nreturn on summary judgment: Count VI, 15 U.S.C. § 2 (Sherman Act), Count VII, 15 \nU.S.C. § 1 (Sherman Act), and Count VIII , California’s Business and Professions Code \n§ 17200 et seq . D.I. 24 at 42 –44; D.I. 170 at 9, 12, 15;  D.I. 519, 521, 523, 525 , 527 . The \nparties  do not distinguish among  the three counts in their summary -judgment brief-\ning because all rise and fall on the same issues.  Case 1:20-cv-00613-SB     Document 669     Filed 09/27/24     Page 2 of 14 PageID #:\n<pageID> \n3 In this opinion, I resolve five summary -judgment motions and two motions to pre-\nclude or exclude expert  opinions and testimony relevant only to the antitrust coun-\nterclaims . Thomson Reuters moved for summary judgment on five issues: separate \nproducts, market definition  and power , statute of limitations, injunctive relief, and \ndamages relating  to testimony from Dr. Alan Cox.  D.I. 519, 521, 523, 525, 527.  Thom-\nson Reuters also moved to preclude  certain opinions of Ross’s experts Dr. James Rat-\nliff and Dr. Gillian  Hadfield. D.I. 529. And Ross moved to exclude certain opinions of \nThomson Reuters’s expert Dr. Chad Syverson.  D.I. 516.   \nI will grant summary judgment if there is  “no genuine dispute as to any material \nfact.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). I view facts in the light  most favorable to Ross , the non-\nmovant.  Lamont v. New Jersey , 637 F.3d 177, 179 n.1 (3d Cir. 2011). I must enter \nsummary judgment “against a party who fails to make a showing sufficient to estab-\nlish the existence of an element essential to that party’s case.” Celotex Corp. v. Catrett , \n477 U.S. 317 , 322  (1986).  \nII. ROSS  HAS FAILED TO SHOW THAT THOMSON REUTERS IS TYING SEPARATE \nPRODUCTS AND HAS FAILED TO DEFINE THE MARKET S FOR THEM \nRoss’s remaining antitrust counter claim s are all based  on tying  theories . Some  \ntying arrangements violate antitrust law. Eastman Kodak Co. v. Image Tech . Servs ., \nInc., 504 U.S. 451, 461 –62, 464 (1992).  Tying occurs when a party will “sell one prod-\nuct but only on the condition that the buyer also purchases a different (or tied) prod-\nuct.” N. Pac. Ry. Co. v. United States , 356 U.S. 1, 5 (1958). Ross’ s theory  is that \nWestlaw’s caselaw database (“the public law database”)  is a product that many con-\nsumers want (the tying product), so Thomson Reuters  decided to sell it only packaged Case 1:20-cv-00613-SB     Document 669     Filed 09/27/24     Page 3 of 14 PageID #:\n<pageID> \n4 with the Westlaw search tools (the tied product) to ensure that those products also \nsell. D.I. 24 at 31 –32. In other words, Ross claims that Thomson Reuters forces people \nto buy its  Westlaw search tools if they want to use its caselaw database . Ross contends \nthat this arrangement is both per se illegal under the Sherman  Act and  illegal under \na rule -of-reason theory of liability. D.I. 554 at 7, 23; see Town Sound & Custom Tops, \nInc. v. Chrysler Motors Corp. , 959 F.2d 468, 475 , 481 –82 (3d Cir. 1992) .  \nUnder either theory, Ross must make two threshold showings before it may pro-\nceed with its arguments  that Thomson Reuters violated antitrust law. First, Ross \nmust show that the two products are separate. Avaya Inc., RP v. Telecom Labs, Inc. , \n838 F.3d 354, 397 (3d Cir. 2016). Products that are not separate cannot be tied together . \nSecond, Ross  must define the relevant market before it can hope to show an improper \nuse of power in that market. The relevant markets are different for per se and rule -\nof-reason claims. For a per se tying claim, Ross must define the tying product market. \nBrokerage Concepts, Inc. v. U.S. Healthcare, Inc. , 140 F.3d 494, 513 (3d Cir. 1998).  \nAnd for Ross’s rule -of-reason arguments, it must define the tied product market.  Id. \nat 519.  Ross does neither.  \nA. Ross has not shown that the two products are separate  \n(i) Legal principles  \nTo show that a seller  is illegally tying two products, one must first show that the \ntwo products are separate. Avaya , 838 F.3d at 397. Whether  products  are s eparate is \ntypically an issue of law to be resolved by a judge. Phillip E. Areeda & Herbert J. \nHovenkamp, Antitrust Law  (Lexis Online 2024) ¶ 1743c.  The test for whether the two Case 1:20-cv-00613-SB     Document 669     Filed 09/27/24     Page 4 of 14 PageID #:\n<pageID> \n5 products are distinct  is whether there is “sufficient consumer demand so that it is \nefficient for a firm to [sell them separately] .” Eastman Kodak , 504 U.S. at 462. “[N]o \ntying arrangement  can exist unless there is a sufficient demand for the purchase of” \nthe products separately. Jefferson Parish Hosp. Dist. No. 2 v. Hyde , 466 U.S. 2, 21 \n(1984 ). The sufficient -demand requirement has teeth.  “Idiosyncratic buyers” are not \nenough ; we must look at what consumers generally want . Areeda & Hovenkamp \n¶ 1744d. And, when looking at analogous markets, “if less than 20 percent of the tying \nitem is sold unbundled in the competitive market analogue, then the items are a sin-\ngle product.” Id.  \nThe parties dispute what Ross must do to show sufficient consumer demand.  Ross \nargues that it need not prove that people actually buy the  products separately, only \nthat independent market s could  exist. D.I. 555 at  5. Ross points out the danger of \n“perversely immuniz[ing] the worst -case scenario of a successful ti e by which a monop-\nolist successfully leverages a monopoly in the tying product into a monopoly in the \ntied product.” Id. at 8 (quoting Areeda & Hovenkamp  ¶ 1745d ). To avoid this unfair \noutcome , Ross  says, I must  “assess [] … what consumer demand would be at the costs \nand quality that would prevail if the items were separately provided.” Id. at 9 (citing \nAreeda & Hovenkamp ¶  1745d). To support its view, Ross also cites  the ABA Model \nJury Instructions in Civil Antitrust Cases on separate and distinct products. Id. at 9. \nBut the Model Jury Instructions are not binding on courts . And though they do in-\nstruct the jury to  “consider whether there would be separate demand for each [prod-\nuct] if they were offered separately,” they further  explain that “[t]he relevant issue is Case 1:20-cv-00613-SB     Document 669     Filed 09/27/24     Page 5 of 14 PageID #:\n<pageID> \n6 whether there is sufficient demand from customers to induce sellers to provide them \nseparately.” D.I. 558 -1, Ex. B at 26. So they do not make Ross’s point.  \nUnsurprisingly, Thomson Reuters seeks a more concrete standard  than Ross . It \nargues that Ross must show that consumers either “bought the items separately” or \n“request ed or wanted the items separated.” D.I. 583 at  5 (quoting Areeda & \nHovenkamp ¶  1743 a). Thomson Reuters is mostly right.  \nI conclude that Ross must show  at least one of three things  to meet its burden on  \nseparate products : (1) that consumers “bought the items separately,” (2) that consum-\ners “requested or wanted the items separated,” or (3) “that some customers would \nhave requested or wanted the items separated but for” the fact that they were “intim-\nidated not to make such requests or were deprived of the information that would have \nmade them want the items separated.” Areeda & Hovenkamp ¶  1743a.  So Ross must \nshow (1), (2), or (3) to establish that  “independent markets could exist.” Areeda & \nHovenkamp ¶1745d . But it has not.  \n(ii) Ross fails to show separate  products  \nThe facts , taken in the light most favorable to Ross, do not make any of these three \nshowings.  Ross submits the following facts and arguments to attempt to show sepa-\nrate products.  \n1. Demand for public law separately  \nBooks.  Ross  notes  that Thomson Reuters used to sell its public -law database  in \nbook s (rather than online)  without  the legal search tools that are now packaged with \nWestlaw . Id. at 12 –13. True,  historical market analogues  can support a separate -Case 1:20-cv-00613-SB     Document 669     Filed 09/27/24     Page 6 of 14 PageID #:\n<pageID> \n7 products finding . See Areeda & Hovenkamp ¶  1744c2 ; see also Kaufman v. Time \nWarner , 836 F.3d 137, 142 (2d Cir. 2016) (“Relevant evidence of separate and distinct \nconsumer demand for the tying product and the tied product is, inter alia , the history \nof the products being, or not being, sold separately … or the sale of products sepa-\nrately in similar markets.”) . And this is one reason why  the previous judge in this \ncase, Judge Stark , did not dismiss  the tying claim. As he  noted , “Plaintiffs’  public law \ndatabase was effectively sold as a stand -alone product in the form of books for decades \nbefore modern technology allowed plaintiffs to develop an online legal search tool.” \nD.I. 170 at 8. But this is just one possible data point, and the bar is higher at summary \njudgment.  \nThe idea behind historical market analogues is that they are evidence of consumer \npreferences from a time when the markets were competitive.  See Areeda & \nHovenkamp ¶  1744c2 . But the analogy to books  suffers from two flaws . First, Ross is \nwrong  that books were sold without search tools. True, b ooks were sold without \nWestlaw’s current technological capacity. But i f we can analogize online legal data-\nbases to printed legal databases, we can also analogiz e online search tools to printed \nsearch tools : tables of c ontents , ind ices, and page numbers . So its database  was not \nsold unbundled from search tools.  \nSecond, “consumer preferences, production costs, and quality concerns … vary \nover time.” Id. The evolution from book search tools (say , a table of contents) to \nWestlaw’s digital search tools (say, Boolean search terms) is like how the horse -drawn \ncarriage market evolved into the car market. Just as we no longer  use horse -drawn Case 1:20-cv-00613-SB     Document 669     Filed 09/27/24     Page 7 of 14 PageID #:\n<pageID> \n8 carriages for transportation (except for fun), few consumers want caselaw separated \nfrom the sophisticated search tools that make it digestible. A market for public law \nin book form  used to exist , but that  does not mean that a market for separate caselaw \nstill exists in a world with more sophisticated search tools.  Ross has not done enough \nto show that this market is a helpful analog ue.  \nConsumer requests  for public -law databases . Ross says that consumers \nasked to buy Westlaw’s  public -law database separately . D.I. 555 at  15. But th at \nsmidge of  consumer demand is not enough. There must be “sufficient consumer \ndemand  so that it is efficient for a firm to ” sell the two products separately. Eastman \nKodak , 504 U.S. at 462. Ross cites  emails  from  two law firms, Baker Hostetler and \nSkadden. D.I. 558 -1, Ex. Q at 280 –82; D.I. 558 -1, Ex. R at 283 –84. But the Baker \nHostetler email chain does not ask about buying  public  law separately. D.I. 558 -1, \nEx. Q at 280 –82. And the Skadden email alone is not enough to infer “sufficient con-\nsumer demand.” Eastman Kodak , 504 U.S. at 462 ; D.I. 558 -1, Ex. R at 283 –84. Ross \ncould have done more to try to develop the record during di scovery, perhaps subpoe-\nnaing Skadden representatives . But it did not.  \nAPIs.  Ross also argues that Thomson Reuters’s decision to make some Westlaw \ncontent available via application programming interfaces shows separate consumer \ndemand for  public law . D.I. 555 at 18 –20. This also fails. These interfaces are “another  \nmethod that customers use to access Thomson Reuters’ platforms.” D.I. 520 at 23. \nSome of them let  customers search internal firm data and external Westlaw data \nthrough a single search. D.I. 555 at 19. But Ross admits that these are just interfaces; Case 1:20-cv-00613-SB     Document 669     Filed 09/27/24     Page 8 of 14 PageID #:\n<pageID> \n9 they do not allow “independent access to [Thomson Reuters’s] full U.S. public law \ndatabase.” Id. So this is not an example of selling public law separately. Ross submits \nevidence that Thomson Reuters is considering offering data products that include the \npublic law. D.I. 558 -2, Ex. EE at 83. But Thomson Reuters is not doing this  yet, so it \nis unclear what, if any, demand there would be for this data.   \n2. Demand for search tools separately  \nConsumer requests for Ross’s search tool. As evidence that consumers \nwanted to buy its search tool on its own, Ross points to an interrogatory  response and \ndepositions of its own employees . D.I. 5 58-1, Ex. S  at 291; Ex. T  at 309–11 (transcript \n100:24 –102:15 ); Ex. U  at 323–37 (transcript 14:18 –18:2); Ex. V.  at 342–43 (transcript \n155:5 –156:22 ) (irrelevant because it discusses buying Ross as the company, not Ross’s \nproducts) ; and Ex. W  at 360–6 (transcript 269:23 –271:11 ). But careful review of these \ntranscripts shows that, at best , most employees gestured toward  unspecified  “custom-\ners” who want ed to buy Ross ’s search product  without the public law. See, e.g. , D.I. \n558-1, Ex. T. at  310–11 (transcript 101–02) (a former Ross employee acknowledging \nthat he never actually sold the search tool separately and r esponding to a question \nabout who wanted to buy Ross’s search tool separately from the public law database \nwith , “[t]here was a customer that came into the chat. There were customers that \nwould come into the chat.”).  \nThese stateme nts do not suggest many  interested buyers nor allege a specific \nnumber of consumers, and the only one they name specifically is the U.S. Department \nof Justice . So even taking these statements as true, they do not  show “sufficient con-\nsumer demand so that it is efficient for a firm to” sell the two products separately. Case 1:20-cv-00613-SB     Document 669     Filed 09/27/24     Page 9 of 14 PageID #:\n<pageID> \n10 Eastman Kodak , 504 U.S. at 462. And Ross’s argument that its “legal  search tool re-\nceived significant attention and praise” is irrelevant. D.I. 555 at 13.  \nWestlaw’s product tiers.  Ross also tries  to find evidence of separate products in \nWestlaw’s own sales. Ross argues that Westlaw’s choice to offer different levels of \nsearch plans shows demand for buying the public law database and accompanying \nsearch tools separately. Id. at 17. But it does not matter  that Westlaw offers three \nplans, each bundling its public -law collection with a different search tool. This shows \ndemand for different levels of search -tool sophistication, not demand for  a public -law \ndatabase  with  no search tool at all  or for a search tool on its own.  \nWest KM. Ross ’s last point  is that Thomson Reuters sells West KM  separately , \nbut that argument fails too. Id. at 21.  As Ross itself explains, “West KM uses \nWestlaw’s search technology to review the [ customer ] organization’s own documents, \npromising an experience that mimics searching for public law on Westlaw.” Id. So \nWest KM is not a search tool for public law that is being sold separately from public \nlaw itself.   \nTo sum up, Ross has failed to satisfy any of the three standards for showing dis-\ntinct products. It  has not shown any consumers “bought the items separately.” Areeda \n& Hovenkamp ¶  1743a. Nor has Ross adduced enough  evidence that consumers \n“requested  or wanted the items separate .” Id. And Ross has made no effort to show \nthat consumers would have asked for the items separated if they were not “intimi-\ndated not to make such requests or were deprived of the information that would have \nmade them want the items separated.” Id.  Case 1:20-cv-00613-SB     Document 669     Filed 09/27/24     Page 10 of 14 PageID #:\n<pageID> \n11 I thus grant Plaintiffs ’ Motion for Summary Judgment on Ross’s Antitrust Coun-\nterclaims (No. 1) Separate Products [D.I. 519]. Without showing separate products, \nnone of Ross’s remaining antitrust counterclaims can proceed.  \n \nB. Ross has not defined the markets  \nEven i f Ross’s allegation of tying had not failed on separate products, it would still \nfail because Ross has not properly define d the market in which Thomson Reuters  \nallegedly  exercises excessive power , either on a per se tying theory  or on a rule -of-\nreason theory.   \n(i) Legal principles  \nAt a minimum, Ross must define either the tying market or the tied market. For \nper se  tying, Ross must show t wo threshold things  about the market . First, it must \n“properly define []” the tying product market. Brokerage Concepts , 140 F.3d at 513. \nThat means defining  both the product and the geograph y of the market. Id. Second, \nRoss must show that Thomson Reuters “possesses market power in the tying product \nmarket .” Town Sound , 959 F.2d at 477. One cannot determine m arket power until \nafter one defines the market . So a successful per se  claim defines the tying market.  \nFor a rule-of-reason tying  theory , Ross need  define  only the market  for the tied \nproduct . A rule -of-reason theory  is more flexible than a per se theory , letting  Ross \n“state some plausible theory of antitrust harm that does not depend implicitly on \npower leveraging.” Town Sound , 959 F.2d at 486. To support a rule -of-reason theory , \nRoss must be able to show that the alleged tie affected “competition in the  tied mar-\nket.” Brokerage Concepts , 140 F.3d at 51 1. So under this theory of liability, Ross need Case 1:20-cv-00613-SB     Document 669     Filed 09/27/24     Page 11 of 14 PageID #:\n<pageID> \n12 not define the tying market. But it does need to define the tied market. “Before we \ncan determine whether there was harm to competition in the tied market, that mar-\nket must be defined.” Id. at 519. \nThis requirement holds especially true for  Ross’s specific arguments.  The “tying \ninjury ” alleged “d epend[s] on a careful definition of the tied good market.”  United \nStates v. Microsoft Corp. , 253 F.3d 34, 95 (D.C. Cir. 2001) .  Ross argues that it “has \noffered evidence of cognizable harm in the tied product market in the form of reduced \ninnovation.” D.I. 554 at 24. But I cannot assess that injury if it “ takes place in a mar-\nket that has not been defined .” Microsoft , 253 F.3d at 95  (quoting Jefferson Parish , \n466 U.S. at 29). Ross also argues that there was “foreclosure in the legal search tools \nmarket.” D.I. 554 at 24.  When “the theory is one of market foreclosure, [I] must exam-\nine the structure of the market supposedly foreclosed.” Town Sound , 959 F.2d at 493.   \nDefining a market requires, at a minimum, “describing those groups of producers \nwhich, because of the similarity of their products, have the ability … to take signifi-\ncant amounts of business away from each other.” SmithKline Corp. v. Eli Lilly & Co. , \n575 F.2d 1056, 1063 (3d Cir. 1978). “The outer boundaries of a product market are \ndetermined by evaluating which products would be reasonably interchangeable by \nconsumers for the same purpose.” Brokerage Concepts , 140 F.3d at 513.  \n To recap, Ross had to define the market for both its per se  and rule -of-reason \ntheory . The per se  tying theory  requires defining the tying market —the market for \npublic law. And here, the rule-of-reason tying theory  requires defining the tied mar-\nket—the market for legal search tools .  Case 1:20-cv-00613-SB     Document 669     Filed 09/27/24     Page 12 of 14 PageID #:\n<pageID> \n13 (ii) Ross failed to define either  market  \nRoss failed to define either the tying or tied product market. It tried  to do that by \nrelying on  the expert opinion of Dr. Ratliff. But he spent  just three short paragraphs \ndefining the market for electronically searchable collections of U.S. law and six short \nparagraphs defining the market for legal search tools. D.I. 532 -1, Ex. 33  at 73,  80–82. \nIn these short paragraphs, he fails to analyze in any depth companies or products \nthat are interchangeable with the products here. Brokerage Concepts , 140 F.3d at \n513. This makes it difficult to understand the scope of the market he is attempting to \ninteract with. His analysis is not enough.  \nIn fact, his analysis is so lacking that I grant in part Plaintiffs’ Motion to Preclude \nDr. James Ratliff and Dr. Gillian Hadfield . D.I. 529. I exclude the section of Dr. Rat-\nliff’s opinion devoted to market definition under  Federal Rule of Evidence 702 and \nDaubert  v. Merrell Dow Pharms., Inc. , 509 U.S. 579 , 592–93 (1993). To be admissible, \nqualified experts’ opinions must be based on reliable methodology and must fit the \nfacts of the case. Elcock v. Kmart Corp. , 233 F.3d 734, 741 (3d Cir. 2000). Here, Dr. \nRatliff  essentially has no  methodology for defining the relevant markets. He includes \nno math or economic modeling.  He never analyzes  potential competitors  in any depth . \nAll he does is  make brief, conclusory assertions . That is not enough.  \nRoss fails to define the relevant product markets. Without defining them ade-\nquate ly, it cannot reach the issue of market power. So I grant Plaintiffs ’ Motion for \nSummary Judgment on Ross’s Antitrust Counterclaims (No. 2) Market Definition and \nMarket Power . D.I. 521.  \n Case 1:20-cv-00613-SB     Document 669     Filed 09/27/24     Page 13 of 14 PageID #:\n<pageID> \n14 III. OTHER OUTSTANDING MOTIONS RELEVANT TO THE  \nANTITRUST COUNTERCLAIMS  ARE MOOT \nI need not reach  Thomson Reuters’s  other summary -judgment motions , because \ngranting summary judgment on either separate products or market definition alone \nresolve s the outstanding antitrust counterclaims.  \nTurning to the expert motions, the portions of Plaintiffs’ Motion to Preclude Dr. \nJames Ratliff and Dr. Gillian Hadfield  that I did not already exclude for failing to \nmeet Daubert  are moot.  D.I. 529.  These expert reports were submitted to further the \nantitrust counterclaims and no longer matter now that those counter claims are resolved.  \nFor the same reason, Defendant’s Motion to Exclude Certain Opinions of Plaintiffs \nand Counter Defendants’ Expert Chad Syverson  is moot too . D.I. 516.  If either party \ntries  to use these expert opinions in the copyright portion of this case, the parties may \nresubmit motions to exclude them .  \n* * * * * \nFor all these  reasons, I grant summary judgment to Thomson Reuters on its motions  \non separate products and market definition and market power.  I dismiss as moot the \nother motions on the antitrust counterclaims.  Case 1:20-cv-00613-SB     Document 669     Filed 09/27/24     Page 14 of 14 PageID #:\n<pageID>",

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: In *Brightex Bio-Photonics, LLC v. L'Oreal USA, Inc.*, the court dismissed Brightex’s patent infringement claims against L'Oreal based on two patents, including the '358 Patent, which involved an invention for providing personalized skincare recommendations using facial analysis. The court concluded that the claims were invalid under Section 101 for patent-ineligibility, as they were directed to the abstract idea of recommending treatments based on the severity of skin characteristics without sufficient inventive concept. The involvement of AI/machine learning in this case is manifested in the advanced image analysis for identifying skin characteristics and recommending treatments, but the court found it too generic and abstract as claimed.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the claims of the '358 Patent are patent-eligible under 35 U.S.C. § 101, considering the Supreme Court's *Alice* framework, specifically focusing on whether the patent claims are directed to an abstract idea and, if so, whether they include an inventive concept sufficient to transform the claimed abstract idea into patent-eligible subject matter.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court held that the claims of the '358 Patent are directed towards the abstract idea of recommending skincare treatments based on facial analysis and lack an inventive concept that would transform this abstract idea into patent-eligible subject matter. Therefore, the claims were deemed patent-ineligible under 35 U.S.C. § 101, resulting in a dismissal with prejudice of Brightex’s infringement claim against L’Oreal.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine you have a phone app that takes pictures of your face and suggests skin care products based on how your skin looks compared to other people. Brightex, the company behind this app, tried to sue L'Oreal for using the same idea. However, the court said this idea wasn't new or special enough to be protected by patents because it basically just used technology to do something people could already do, like looking at a face and deciding what skincare it needs. The court decided this was more about using a basic method rather than inventing a new way of doing things, so L'Oreal didn't break any patent laws.",

Presently before the Court is L’Oreal’s Motion to Dismiss Under \nFed.R.Civ. P. 12(b)(6) (“Motion”), in which L’Oreal contends B rightex  fails to state a claim of \ninfringement of the ’358 Patent upon which relief can be granted because the asserted claims of \nthe ’358 Patent  (independent claim 16 and dependent claim 18)  are invalid under 35 U.S.C. § 101  \npursuant to Alice Corp. Pty. Ltd. v. CLS Bank Int’l , 573 U.S. 208 (2014).   A hearing on the Motion \nwas held on M arch 5, 2025.  For the reasons stated below, the Motion is GRANTED .1 \nII. BACKGROUND  \nA. The `358 Patent  \nThe ’358 Patent issued on December 12, 2017 . Compl. ¶ 46  & Ex. 1 ( ’358 Patent ).  It is \nentitled “Method for Providing Personalized Recommendations”  and “relates to the personalized \n \n1 The parties have consented to the jurisdiction of a United States magistrate judge pursuant to 28 \nU.S.C. § 636(c).

In the ’358 Patent , the invention \nis described, “[b]y way of example but not limitation,” “in the context of cosmetology and \nspecifically with respect to the cosmetic improvement of a person’s face.”  Id. at 1: 8 -10.  \nThe specification describes “a process by which recommendations may be selected for a \nuser.” Id. at 1:14 -16.  First, “a user submits an image of her face and responses to a question naire.”  \nId.  at 2: 23 -5.  “[A]  typical electronic device . . . used to capture  a user’s image and questionnaire \nresponses” “ may be a mobile telephone, smart phone , tablet computer, personal digital assistant ( \nPDA ), laptop or  other device, preferably with at least a camera, display, communication \ncapability and a means of data entry.”  Id. at 2: 28 -33. The user is instructed “where to put her face \nin the image” by a “photo guide[,]” which allows the user to “take an image of her face with \npreferred dimensions for use in the  recommendation process.”  Id. at 2: 33-37. \nAfter the user has submitted an image and questionnaire responses, “the user’s image is \nanalyzed to produce measurements.”  Id. at 2: 57 -59.  “Any sufficient method or means of image \nprocessing may be used to analyze the user’s image to identify the facial characteristics and \nfeatures  of the user’s face. ”  Id.  at 2: 58 -61. Facial features that may be measured include \n“number of crow’s feet[,]” “number of deep lines[,]” “number of fine lines[,]” “number of age \nspots” and “percent of a user’s face covered by age spots.”  Id. at 2: 63 -3: 10. The measurements \nand questionnaire responses are then used to create a “user profile”  that is “used to locate \nreference information within an ‘age’ category.”  Id. at 3: 29 -35.  The “reference information” \n“preferably . . . comprises previously stored data about a population.”  Id. at 3:36.   “For example, \nthe user ’s  ‘age’ category may comprise information from a population of  people that are the same \nage as the user .”  Id. at 3: 49 -51.   The user’s measurements are then compared to the reference \ninformation to determine the severity of the feature  (e.g., deep line count)  as compared to the \ngeneral population in the user’s age group) ( e.g., low, medium or high).  Id. at 3: 52 -57.

Section 101 and Alice  \nUnder 35 U.S.C. § 101, certain categories of inventions are eligible for patent protection: \n“process [es], machine [s], manufacture [s], or composition [s] of matter .”  35 U.S.C. §  101.  The \nSupreme Court has “ long held that this provision contains an important implicit exception: Laws \nof nature, natural phenomena, and abstract ideas are not patentable.”   Alice Corp. Pty. v.

Cal. 2017) (quoting Mayo Collaborative Servs. v. Prometheus Labs ., \nInc., 566 U.S. 66, 71 (2012) (citations omitted)).  The Court has cautioned, however, that “too \nbroad an interpretation of this exclusionary principle could eviscerate patent law” because “all \ninventions at some level embody, use, reflect, rest upon, or apply laws of nature, natural \nphenomena, or abstract ideas.” Mayo , 566 U.S. at 71.  Thus, courts must “ tread carefully in \nconstruing this exclusionary principle lest it swallow all of patent law.” Alice , 573 U.S. at 217  \n(citing Mayo , 566 U.S. at 71).  \nThe Alice  Court applied a two -step framework for determining patent eligibility, \npreviously articulated in Mayo Collaborative Servs. v. Prometheus Labs., Inc ., 566 U.S. 66 \n(2012):  \nFirst, we determine whether the claims at issue are directed to one of \nthose patent -ineligible concepts. If so, we then ask, “[w]hat else is \nthere in the claims before us?” To answer that question, we consider \nthe elements of each claim both individually a nd “as an ordered \ncombination” to determine whether the additional elements \n“transform the nature of the claim” into a patent -eligible application. \nWe have described step two of this analysis as a search for an \n“inventive concept” —i.e., an element or combi nation of elements that \nis sufficient to ensure that the patent in practice amounts to \nsignificantly more than a patent upon the [ineligible concept] itself.  \nAlice , 573 U.S. at 217.  \nD. The Complaint  \nIn the Complaint, Brightex asserts that L’Oreal has willfully infringed Brightex’s ’358 and \n’579 patents. Compl. ¶¶ 83 -126.  As to the ’358 Patent, Brightex asserts infringement of claims 16 \nand 18.  Brightex describes in the complaint the development of its “ advanced and innovative \ntechnology relating to the recognition and computerized analysis of facial features ” by Raj \nChhibber.  Id.  ¶ 13.  According to Brightex:  \n13. Chhibber . . . determined that there was an unfulfilled need to \nimprove the ability to scan facial skin features and help identify skin \ncharacteristics and conditions that could be treated or otherwise \nremedied. He also realized that the skincare industry was far behind \nin using technology to improve its products and services. For \nexample, at the time of [Brightex’s]  founding, the industry was still \nvisually comparing images before and after product application with \nno quantification of skin parameters.  Visual grading was used, and \nbooks were published to train staff and dermatologists to align their Case 3:24-cv-07919-JCS     Document 32     Filed 03/06/25     Page 7 of 32 \n8 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  grading scores. This deficient process was known as “blind \ndermatology” by many researchers in the field. Chhibber and the team \nhe assembled at [Brightex]  determined that even well -trained \ndermatologists could not agree on grading and classification with the \naccuracy required to prove product efficacy.  \n14. Chhibber researched the matter and determined that inspecting a \nface for characteristics and conditions required one to closely \nexamine the skin for very small imperfections, which was the best \nway to conduct a useful diagnosis. This lead Chhibber and his team \nto develop software for use in a facial image scanner, which \n[Brightex]  called the “Clarity Pro” system. This software enabled a \nfacial image scanner to identify bacteria -clogging pores, show where \nwrinkles are forming, and identify skin damage ca used by the sun. \nChhibber understood that, with this [Brightex]  technology, doctors \nand aestheticians would be able to recommend creams, lotions and \nother skin treatment products based on skin condition, and then show \npatients “before and after” effects of such recommendations. In \naddition, companies, such as cosmetic  companies, could test and \nquantifiably demonstrate the benefits of such products to their \ncustomers.  \n15. Although the Clarity Pro facial image scanner was a technology \ntargeted for use by beauty spas and dermatologists, Chhibber \nenvisioned refining [Brightex’s]  technology to reduce its size and cost \nand improve its performance so that it could be used in cellphones \nand laptop type devices by ordinary end -users for personal use. The \nadvanced cameras that smart devices used provided consumers with \nthe ability to t ake high -quality photography at home. This, coupled \nwith advances in artificial intelligence (AI ), allowed [Brightex]  to \ndevelop technology that could perform advanced skin measurements \nand analysis on images or “selfies” taken with commercially available \nsmartphones in order to accurately assess skin conditions to \nrecommend the correct cosmetics and skincare treatments.  \nId. ¶¶ 13 -15. \n In addition to alleging facts about L’Oreal’s infringement of Brightex’s patents, the \ncomplaint contains a section entitled: “ The Innovation of the Asserted Patents.”  Id.  ¶¶ 53 -77. As \nrelevant here, that section alleges as follows:  \n53. Claim 16 of the asserted `358 Patent is directed to a novel method \nfor receiving an image of the skin of a person’s face, then providing \na computer analysis of that image data to identify its skin \ncharacteristics that deviate substantially from a group  of reference \ndata relating to those skin characteristics, and then providing \nrecommendations to a user for treating those skin conditions based \nupon the “severity” of the deviations or “ratings.” The Claim requires \nthe method to use a “photo guide” to pos ition the capture of the facial \nimage in the camera display.  \n \n54. Thus, the claimed invention is not directed to the abstract idea of \nproviding recommendations to a user about a product per se.  \n Case 3:24-cv-07919-JCS     Document 32     Filed 03/06/25     Page 8 of 32 \n9 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  55. Moreover, in the claimed invention, a computer is not invoked \nmerely as a tool, using its generic processes. Instead, it is directed at \na specific computerized process that provides for a particular, \nimproved way to acquire an image of a person’s face,  and then \nanalyze that image data to identify at least two user skin \ncharacteristics, and then calculate the extent to which the user’s data \nfor at least these two skin characteristics deviate from stored data \nregarding the same type of skin characteristic s (i.e. “severity rating”) \nfor a specific group of people.  \n \n56. The provided skin treatment recommendations, therefore, are \nbased, in part, on the user skin characteristics with highest severity \nratings, as determined by a computerized analysis of photo image \ndata, and not previously performed by the use of pen and  paper. In \nparticular, the claims require the specified process to be performed \nusing an “electronic device” that “comprises a camera and display.”  \n \n57. The claims focus on a specific computerized method for providing \nskin treatment recommendations to a user based, in part, on the extent \nof the deviation of the severity of the user’s skin characteristics \ncompared to the same type to of skin characteris tics for a comparable \ngroup of people.  \n \n58. The claimed specific computerized process solved the problem of \nautomatically identifying a user’s most severe skin conditions and \nthen recommending a treatment for the condition based, in part, on \nthe highest severity rating of the skin condition. The  claims are not \ndirected at the abstract idea of providing skin treatment \nrecommendations to users in general, merely by invoking generic \nprocesses and equipment.  \n \n59. The asserted claims improved upon the technology for acquiring \nand then analyzing facial data for prioritizing product \nrecommendation to treat skin conditions, based in part on the \nperceived severity of skin condition problems. The specific steps set \nforth in the asserted claims state how the claims improve the method \nfor identifying the severity of a skin condition and then \nrecommending a treatment for improving the condition, not achieving \nthe recommendation of a product. The asserted claims, therefore, \nrecite a technical solution to a proble m arising in the realm of \ncomputing networks.  During prosecution, the Patent and Trademark \nOffice initially rejected the claims of the `358 Patent under 35 U.S.C. \n§ 101, contending that the claimed invention is directed to the abstract \nidea of providing recommendations. The `358 Patent issued in 2017,  \nwhich means this Patent was examined after, and in view of, the \nSupreme Court’s Alice Corp. decision on Section 101 of the Patent \nAct. \n \n61. The patentee responded to the aforementioned rejection by \npointing out that the invention is a novel computerized method of \nproviding prioritized skin treatment recommendations to users based \non a severity rating calculation.  \n \n62. The patentee further responded that the pending claims of the \napplication for the `358 Patent contain meaningful limitations that \nrepresent a sufficiently inventive concept, and that they recite Case 3:24-cv-07919-JCS     Document 32     Filed 03/06/25     Page 9 of 32 \n10 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  specifically how the recommendations are selected and prioritized \nbased on a specifically calculated severity rating.  \n \n63. In addition, during prosecution, the claims were eventually \namended to require the display of the camera used to perform the \nspecific process to have a “photo guide indicating how the user’s face \nshould be positioned with respect to the camera when the  image is \nobtained.” These limitations also preclude a pen -and-paper method of \nimplementation.  \n \n64. In view of the patentee’s responses to the PTO’s office actions \nand the amendments to the pending claims of the application for the \n`358 Patent, the PTO withdrew the rejection of the claims pending \nclaims, including the now issued Claims 16 and 18, und er 35 U.S.C. \n§ 101.  \nCompl. ¶¶ 53 -64. \nE. Contentions of the Parties  \n1. Motion  \nIn the Motion, L’Oreal contends  the claims of the ’358 Patent are invalid under § 101 \nbecause they “ are directed to the abstract idea of recommending treatments based on the severity \nof a person’s skin characteristics, and rely solely on generic computer components to carry out that \nidea. ”  Motion at 12.   Applying step one of the Alice test, L’Oreal  contends a claim is “directed to” \nan abstract idea if the abstract idea is the “focus” of the claim,” and further asserts that this \nrequirement is met as to claim 16.  Id.  In particular, L’Oreal asserts:  \n[C]laim 16 recites nothing more than a method of: (1) obtaining an \nimage of a user’s face, (2) identifying at least two skin characteristics \nof the user, (3) comparing the identified user skin characteristics to \n“normal” skin characteristics reference data to cal culate severity \nratings, and (4) providing treatment recommendations for user skin \ncharacteristics with the highest severity rating.  \nId.  at 13.  According to L’Oreal, “[t] hese steps are all logical and conventional aspects of \nrecommending treatments based on the severity of a person’s skin characteristics in both the real \nand electronic world. ”  Id.   \nFurthermore, L’Oreal asserts, “because each step is performed by generic computer \ncomponents [,]” “ this is not a method  ‘necessarily rooted in computer technology in order to \novercome a problem specifically arising in the realm of ’ computerized skin analysis .”   Id. (citing \nDDR Holdings, LLC v. Hotels.com, L.P.,  773 F.3d 1245, 1257 (Fed. Cir. 2014); Credit Acceptance Case 3:24-cv-07919-JCS     Document 32     Filed 03/06/25     Page 10 of 32 \n11 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  Corp. v. Westlake Servs ., 859 F.3d 1044, 1055 (Fed. Cir. 2017) ). L’Oreal makes four specific \narguments to support this point.   \nFirst, it contends that “ for a computer to determine the severity of skin characteristics, it \nlogically follows that an image (or ‘image data ’) must be obtained  [and that] the subject of the \nimage —here, ‘the user’s face ’-- ‘should be positioned ’ in a particular way ‘when the image data is \nobtained. ’” Id.  at 13. According to L’Oreal, the “use of a photo guide” recited in claim 16 “ can be \nachieved without a computer and is incidental to the abstract idea of recommending treatments \nbased on the severity of a person’s skin characteristics .”  Id. Therefore, L’Oreal asserts, “ the use of \na generic ‘electronic device ’—such as a ‘mobile telephone, smart phone, tablet computer, personal \ndigital assistant (PDA), laptop or other devices[] with at least a camera, display, ’ ’358 Patent at \n2:27-40—to position and capture an image of a user’s face does not make these processes any less \nabstract. ”  Id.  at 14 (citing Elec. Power Grp. v. Alstom S.A ., 830 F.3d 1350, 1353 (Fed. Cir. 2016) ; \nDental Monitoring , SAS v. Align Tech., Inc ., No. C 22 -07335 WHA, 2024 WL 2261931,  at *4 -5 \n(N.D. Cal.

Ca l. 2017) ). \nSecond, L’Oreal argues that “ the use of a computer to identify skin characteristics and/or \nmeasurements thereof —i.e., to collect information —does not make these processes any less \nabstract. ” Id.  at 14 -15. According to L’Oreal, “[a] lthough claim 16 specifically requires \n‘transforming via a computer said image data via image processing into measurements in order to \nidentify ’ such characteristics, ’358 Patent at claim 16, the specification makes clear that the \npurported invention is not directed to a specific  or improved type of image processing, nor does \nthe claimed ‘image processing ’ require the use of a non -generic computer [.]”  Id. at 14 (citing ’358 \nPatent  at 2:58 -63 (“In step 102, the user’s image is analyzed to produce measurements. … Any \nsufficient method  or means of image processing may be used to analyze the user’s image to \nidentify the facial characteristics and features of the user’s face.”) . \n Third, L’Oreal argues, the comparison of skin characteristics to the mean value in claim 16 \nis simply “ the logical way to determine variance of such characteristic from the norm (and thus the \nseverity of the characteristic). ”  Id.  at 15.  According to L’Oreal, “[t] hese too are merely ideas Case 3:24-cv-07919-JCS     Document 32     Filed 03/06/25     Page 11 of 32 \n12 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  ‘that the Federal Circuit has consistently found to be abstract. ’”  Id. at 15 -16 (quoting Procter & \nGamble , 288 F.

Furthermore, L’Oreal argues, “ the limitations of claim 16 \n‘broadly cover manual determination and comparison of defect severity ’ using ‘purely functional \nlanguage. ’”  Id.  at 16 (quoting Procter & Gamble , 288 F. Supp. 3d at 1019 –20 (citation omitted)).  \n“And Plaintiff readily acknowledges that the purpose of such limitations is to improve upon \nexisting ways to ‘identify skin characteristics and conditions that could be treat ed’—e.g., by \n‘visually ’ ‘inspecting a face for characteristics and conditions ’—as opposed to improving the \nfunctioning of a computer. ”  Id. \n Finally, L’Oreal argues that “ providing treatment recommendations for sufficiently severe \nskin characteristics —here, the ones determined to have ‘the highest severity rating ’—is merely \nincidental to the above -described abstract processes and similarly abstract. ”  Id.  at 17.  \n At step two of the Alice  test, L’Oreal argues that “ none of the claim elements  [of claim 16] , \nassessed individually, supply the requisite ‘inventive concept. ’”  Id. (citing Procter & Gamble , \n288 F. Supp. 3d at 1026 ). As in Procter & Gamble , L’Oreal contends, the specification of the ’358 \nPatent “confirms the generic nature of [the claim] elements.”  Id.  at 18 (citing Procter & Gamble , \n288 F. Supp. 3d at 1026).  L’Oreal asserts, “ The specification does not once mention the claimed \n‘computer, ’ much less suggest that the relevant functions cannot be performed on any general -\npurpose com puter. ”  Id. \n L’Oreal also argues that the “inventive concept” requirement is not met because “[t] he \nelements of claim 16 are . . . arranged in a conventional and generic way .”  Id.  According to \nL’Oreal, “[n] othing in the specification supports Plaintiff’s allegation that the claims ‘recite a \ntechnical solution to a problem arising in the realm of computing networks. ’”  Id. at 18 -19 \n(quoting Compl . ¶ 59). Instead, “ the specification consistently describes the purported invention as \n‘provid[ing] personalized recommendat ions that are intended to improve a person’s cosmetic \nappearance, ’ with only sparse references to generic computer components that can be used to \nachieve this. ” Id. at 19 (quoting  ’358 Patent at 1:14 –18).  According to L’Oreal, “[t] he \nspecification is also void of any suggestion that the claimed method would in any way improve the \nfunctioning of such generic computer components. ”   Id.  And finally, L’Oreal asserts that  Case 3:24-cv-07919-JCS     Document 32     Filed 03/06/25     Page 12 of 32 \n13 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  “‘[r]egardless  of whether the steps in claim [16] have previously been combined ’ (they have), \n‘they do not amount to significantly more than acquiring and analyzing information ’ and, thus, the \ncombination thereof does not ‘encompass an inventive concept. ’ ”  Id.  (quoting  Procter & \nGamble , 288 F. Supp. 3d at 1028 –29).  \n L’Oreal contends claim 18 also does not contain any “inventive concept” under Alice.  Id.  \nIn particular, “[i] t does not add any steps to the method of claim 16, nor does it require the use of \nany new or specialized computer components, nor does it provide any elements that would \nimprove the functioning of the generic computer components recited in claim 16. ”  Id. \n For these reasons, L’Oreal argues that the asserted claims of the ’358 Patent are invalid \nunder 35 U.S.C. § 101.  \n2. Opposition  \nIn its Opposition, Brightex rejects L’Oreal’s argument that the asserted claims o f the ’358 \nPatent are invalid because they are directed to an abstract idea.  Opposition at 1.  According to \nBrightex, L’Oreal has oversimplified the limitations of claim 16, which claims a “ patentable, \ntechnological solution in the field of computerized skin analysis and an improvement over the \nexisting techniques for obtaining image data for processing measurements to identify skin \ncharacteristics .”  Id.  at 1-2.  Brightex fu rther contends “[t] he photo guide is used in a process \nspecifically designed to achieve improved facial data acquisition and subsequently an improved \nidentification of skin defects and the severity of those defects. ”  Id. at 2.  According to Brightex, \n“[t]he evidence also confirms that the Asserted Claims recite individual limitations that are \nunconventional and that, taken together, the combination provides an inventive concept that goes \nfar beyond merely claiming the allegedly abstract idea. ”  Id. \nBrightex argues that L’Oreal’s characterization of claim 16 as involving four steps is \ninaccurate, failing to take into account many of the limitations of the claim.  Id. at 6.  For example, \nthe first step  described by L’Oreal – “obtaining an image of the user’s face [,]” Motion at 4  --  \nmakes “[n] o mention . . .  of a photo guide, an electronic device, image data, and the \ntransformation of image data into measurements .”  Id. Furthermore, Brightex contends, “ L’Oreal’s \nfactual statements concerning what derma tologists have been doing ‘for decades ’ and what Case 3:24-cv-07919-JCS     Document 32     Filed 03/06/25     Page 13 of 32 \n14 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  calculations have been done on images of faces is entirely unsupported. ” Id. (citing  Motion at 5 ). \nBrightex also argues that L’Oreal’s reliance on the prosecution history is improper to the \nextent it suggests that the Court need only consider the one limitation that the Examiner found was \nnot abstract – the photo guide – in determining whether the claim s are invalid.   Id.  at 6-7. Rather, \nBrightex contends, the Court must consider the claim as a whole when deciding whether it is \ndirected to an abstract idea.  Id.  at 7.  \nFurthermore, Brightex  argues, L’Oreal’s assertion “ that a photo guide is ‘as generic and \nconventional when used as claimed ’ and cannot provide an inventive concept [,] Motion at 10 [,] . . \n. is as close as L’Oreal gets to discussing why the Examiner was incorrect in his reasons for \nallowance, and L’Oreal merely provides a conclusory statement to the contrary. ”  Id.  at 7.  \nBrightex  contends  “this is a factual allegation concerning what was routine, well -understood, or \nconventional at the time of the invention  within the field of computerized skin analysis and \npersonalized recommendations which must be resolved in Brightex’s favor at the 12(b)(6) stage , \nand for which L’Oreal provides no evidence or prior art support .”  Id.at 7-8. Brightex further asserts \nthat at this stage of the case, it “ need only show plausibility that individual elements, or that the \nclaimed combination is not well -understood, routine, or conventional activity for questions of fact \nto preclude dismissal .” Id. (citing Aatrix Software, Inc. v. Green Shades Software, Inc ., 882 F.3d \n1121, 1128 (Fed. Cir. 2018) ).  Brightex argues that “[t] he photo guide limitation, as claimed, \nmeets this plausibility standard alone and in combination with other limitations of claim 16, \nprecluding dismissal .”  Id. \nBrightex also points to other statements by L’Oreal “ concerning the state of the art and \nwhat was routine and conventional, each [of] which conflict with the factual statements made in \nthe Complaint: ”  \n• “[L’Oreal’s oversimplified limitations] are all logical and conventional aspects of \nrecommending treatments based on the severity of a person’s skin characteristics in \nboth the real and electronic world.” Id. (citing Motion at 13 ).  \n• “[I]n order to determine the severity of skin characteristics, it logically [follows]  \nthat at least two skin characteristics must be identified from the image.” Id. (citing Case 3:24-cv-07919-JCS     Document 32     Filed 03/06/25     Page 14 of 32 \n15 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  Motion at 14 ). \n•  “All such ‘measurements’ can be (and have long been) determined visually, e.g., \nby a skin care professional, without the use of a computer.” Id. (citing Motion at \n15). \n•  “[in] order to determine the severity of a person’s skin characteristics, the variance \nof such characteristics from the norm must be determined.” Id.  (citing Motion at \n15). \n• “The elements of claim 16 are also arranged in a conventional and generic way.” \nId.  (citing Motion at 18 ). \nIn addition, Brightex asserts that “ the ‘358 Patent has been cited and utilized by examiners as \ninventive and valid around the world, including against a L’Oreal patent application. ”  Id. at 9 \n(citing Opposition Ex. A, dkt. no. 28 -1 (WO2022/232627 )). \n Applying the Alice  test, Brightex  argues that at step one, the asserted claims are not \ndirected at an abstract idea because they “ do not simply recite the desired result of ‘recommending \ntreatments based on the severity of a person’s skin characteristics, ’ but instead recite a specific \nimproved solution for accomplishing that goal and are thus directed to patent eligible subject \nmatter. ”  Id. at 10.   Brightex rejects L’Oreal’s argument that the photo guide limitation “ can be \nachieved without a computer and is merely incidental to the alleg ed abstract idea. ” Id.  at 13 \n(citing Motion at 13).  According to Brightex, when considering the entirety of the claim, the \n“photo guide” limitation  “transforms the recited electronic device into a specialized device (i.e., a \nminiaturized version of Brightex’s Clarity Pro device) designed to capture image data in a \nparticular way to better facilitate the skin treatment recommendation process. ” Id.  at 13 -14.   \n Brightex argues that L’Oreal’s reliance on the Procter & Gamble case in its step one \nanalysis is misplaced because in that case, there  was no photo guide limitation.  Id.  at 14 -15.  \nBrightex also argues that Elec. Power Grp., LLC v. Alstom S.A ., 830 F.3d 1350, 1353 (Fed. Cir. \n2016)  is distinguishable because it “ did not concern images or photo guides [.]”  Id.  at 15.  It \nfurther asserts  that the Dental Monitoring  case cited by L’Oreal is not on point because it was \ndecided on summary judgment  and therefor e, “factual allegations [were]  more appropriately Case 3:24-cv-07919-JCS     Document 32     Filed 03/06/25     Page 15 of 32 \n16 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  presented, such as what orthodontists at the time of the invention considered routine. ”  Id. at 15 -16 \n(citing  Dental Monitoring SAS v. Align Tech., Inc ., 2024 WL 2261931 (N.D. Cal. May 16, 2024) ). \nIn addition , Brightex asserts, a critical difference between the Dental Monitoring case and this \ncase is “ the fact that  [in Dental Monitoring ] ‘the patent ’s specification concedes that this analysis \nwas conventionally performed by an orthodontist, via in -person visual inspection or through \nreview of patient -provid ed images [ ]” whereas “[t] here is no such disclosure in the ‘358 \nspecification that the analysis detailed in claim 16 was done by dermatologists back in 2012, nor \nhas L’Oreal identified such disclosure. ”  Id.  at 16.  \n At step two of the Alice  test, Brightex argues that it adequately alleged an inventive \nconcept in its complaint and therefore, the case must survive L’Oreal’s motion to dismiss under \nAatrix Software, Inc. v. Green Shades Software, Inc ., 882 F.3d 1121, 1128 (Fed. Cir. 2018).    In \nparticular, Brightex argues that because there are “concrete allegations” in its complaint that  \n“‘individual elements and the claimed combination are not well -understood, routine, or \nconventional activity,’” questions of fact prec lude dismissal at the motion to dismiss stage.   Id. at \n16-17 (quoting Aatrix , 882 F.3d at 1128).   According to Brightex, the allegations here, as in \nAatrix , “ ‘supplie[d] numerous allegations related to the inventive concepts present in the claimed \nform file technology, ’ and ‘describe[d] the development of the patented invention, including the \nproblems present in prior art. ’ ”  Id.  at 17 (quoting Aatrix , 882 F.3d at 1127).  In particular, \nBrightex points to its allegations relating to “ the deficient process of visual grading and training \ndermatologists to align their grading scores, and their inadequacy, to prove product efficacy [;]” \n“the development of the patented invention, including the creation of the Clarity Pro facial image \nscanner and subsequent reduct ion in size (and advancement in AI technology) allowing for use in \ncommercial cellphones [;]” and the “ section in the Complaint entitled Innovation of the Asserted \nPatents [.]”  Id. (citing Compl. ¶¶ 13-15, 53 -64).  According to Brightex, L’Oreal ignored these \nallegations in the Motion.  Id. \n Brightex argues that an inventive concept, as disclosed in the Complaint, can be found in \ntwo of the claim limitations:  “ (1) the ‘photo guide ’ to position the capture of the facial image  . . . \nand (2) the ‘severity rating ’ calculated using the user’s data for at least two skin characteristics and Case 3:24-cv-07919-JCS     Document 32     Filed 03/06/25     Page 16 of 32 \n17 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  their deviation from stored data regarding the same type of skin characteristics .”  Id. (citing \nCompl. ¶¶ 53, 55, 57).  According to Brightex, even though the Examiner found that  the photo \nguide limitation provided “ significantly more than the abstract idea,”  L’Oreal never mentions this \nlimitation in its step two discussion.  Id.  Brightex further asserts that it will be able to show that \nthe claim elements are arranged in a novel way and that L’Oreal’s conclusory assertion to the \ncontrary is not sufficient  to meet its burden.  Id.  at 17 -18. \n Finally, Brightex argues that L’Oreal’s Motion “ threatens the viability of their own \npatents, including the patent L’Oreal contends its Accused Instrumentalities emanate .”  Id.  at 18 -\n19. \n3. Reply  \nIn its Reply, L’Oreal reiterates its argument that the  invention claimed in the  ’358 Patent  \nboils down to four steps that amount to no more than an abstract idea.  Reply at 1.  It rejects \nPlaintiff’s argument that more than an abstract idea is claimed because the patent recites a  \n“technical solution” comprising “specific” requirements that were “unconventional” at the time of \nthe claimed invention .  Id. (citing Opposition at  9–13, 16 –18).  L’Oreal contends Brightex offers \nno authority to support its  “apparent position that a claim is eligible for patent protection simply \nby virtue of being technical, specific, or unconventional ” and “ instead cherry -picks language from \na handful of cases finding claims directed to improvements in the functioning of computers to \nrecite more than an abstract idea, which are, of course, inapplicable here. ”  Id.  \nL’Oreal argues that the asserted claims of the ’358 Patent  are not directed at improvements \nin the functioning of a computing device sufficient to transform an abstract idea into patentable \nsubject matter .  Id. at 2-4.  It asserts that the ’358 Patent describes “two computing devices to \ncarry out the claimed method: (1) an ‘electronic device compris[ing] a camera and a display ’—\nwhich, according to the specification, ‘may be a mobile telephone, smart phone, tablet computer, \npersonal digital assistant (PDA), laptop or other device ’—and (2) a ‘computer ’—which the \nspecification does not once mention .”  Id.  at 2. But as argued in the Motion, “ the claimed method \nis not directed to any improvement in the functioning of either of these generic computing \ndevices [,]” according to L’Oreal.  Id.  Nor does Brightex rebut L’Oreal’s position, L’Oreal asserts.  Case 3:24-cv-07919-JCS     Document 32     Filed 03/06/25     Page 17 of 32 \n28 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  “examine the limitations of the claims to determine whether the claims contain an ‘inventive \nconcept’ to ‘transform’ the claimed abstract idea into patent -eligible subject matter.”  Id. (citing \nAlice , 573 U.S. at 221) (quoting Mayo , 566 U.S. at 77)).   \nThe Supreme Court has “made clear that transformation into a patent -eligible application \nrequires ‘more than simply stat[ing ] the [abstract idea] while adding the words ‘apply it.’ ” Alice , \n573 U.S. at 221 (citing Mayo , 566 U.S. at 72).  Thus, “it is . . . now standard for a § 101 inquiry to \nconsider whether various claim elements simply recite ‘well -understood, routine, conventional \nactivit[ies].’ ” Bascom Glob. Internet Servs., Inc. v. AT&T Mobility LLC , 827 F.3d 1341, 1349 –50 \n(Fed. Cir. 2016) (quoting Alice , 573 U.S. at 225) (quoting Mayo , 566 U.S. at 73) . However, “[t]he \ninventive concept inquiry requires more than recognizi ng that each claim element, by itself, was \nknown in the art.”  Id.  Rather, courts must also consider whether “an inventive concept can be \nfound in the non -conventional and non -generic arrangement of known, conventional pieces.”  Id.  \n“The object of the inquiry is the claim language: a district court may not rely on ‘technological \ndetails set forth in the patent ’s specification and not set forth in the claims to find an inventive \nconcept. ’” Dental Monitoring , 2024 WL 2261931, at *7 ( quoting Intell. Ventures  I LLC v. \nSymantec Corp ., 838 F.3d 1307, 1322 (Fed. Cir. 2016); Two-Way Media Ltd. v. Comcast Cable \nCommc'ns, LLC , 874 F.3d 1329, 1338 (Fed. Cir. 2017) ).   \nBecause the court must draw all reasonable inference in favor of the plaintiff at the \n12(b)(6) stage of the case, a complaint with specific allegations plausibly alleging that the asserted \nclaim discloses  a concept that was not “well -understood, routine, or conventional” is sufficient to \nsurvive the pleading stage of the case.  Aatrix Software, Inc. v. Green Shades Software, Inc ., 882 \nF.3d 1121, 1129 (Fed. Cir. 2018) ; see also Berkheimer v. HP Inc ., 881 F.3d 1360, 1369 (Fed. Cir. \n2018) (“Whether something i s well -understood, routine, and conventional to a skilled artisan at the \ntime of the patent is a factual determination. ”)  Thus, for  example, in Aatrix , the Federal Circuit \nfound that the district court had erred in dismissing the plaintiff’s complain t under § 101 where it \ncontained “c oncrete ” factual  allegations “that individual elements and the claimed combination \n[were] not well -understood, routine, or conventional activity ” and that “the claimed combination [ ] \n[offered an]  improvement to the functioning of the computer. ”  Id. at 1128.   Likewise, in Case 3:24-cv-07919-JCS     Document 32     Filed 03/06/25     Page 28 of 32 \n29 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  Berkheimer , the complaint  was found sufficient to survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion where it alleged \nspecific facts show ing that “the claimed combination improve[d] computer functionality” and \npointed to sections of the specification that explained how  “the claimed improvement increase [d] \nefficiency and computer functionality over the prior art systems .”  Berkheimer v. HP Inc ., 881 \nF.3d at 1369 (Fed. Cir. 2018) . \nb. Application of Legal Standards  \nBrightex contends the complaint adequately alleges that claim 16 discloses inventive \nconcepts based on the “photo guide” and the “severity rating” limitations.2  It argues further that \nL’Oreal’s challenge under § 101 fails because L’Oreal  relies on factual assertions that contradict \nfacts alleged in the complaint.  The Court is not persuaded by Brightex’s arguments.  \nFirst, the Court rejects Brightex’s contention that L’Oreal’s arguments about what was \nroutine and conventional at the time of the patent’s issuance contradict the allegations in the \ncomplaint.  In particular, L’Oreal’s statements  in its moving papers  about what dermatologists \nwere doing at the time of the patent’s issuance, namely, “inspect [ing] a person’s face to identify \ncharacteristics that var y from the norm and, where the variance was sufficiently great,  . . . \nprescrib[ ing] treatment,”  Motion at 5, are entirely consistent with the allegations in the complaint.  \nIn particular, the Complaint describes the “deficient process” used by dermatologists in 2005, \nwhen “ the skincare industry was far behind in using technology to improve its products and \nservices. ”  Compl. ¶ 13.   According to Brighte x, at that time “ the industry was still visually \ncomparing images before and after product application with no quantification of skin parameters. \nVisual grading was used, and books were published to train staff and de rmatologists to align their \ngrading scores. ”  Id.;  see also  id.  ¶ 20 (“ Prior to the 2007 -time-frame, most skin analysis \ncosmetologists used visual grading techniques. ”).    \nMoreover, i n paragraph 14, Brightex reiterates that Chhiber “ researched the matter and \ndetermined that inspecting a face for characteristics and conditions required one to closely \n \n2At the hearing, the parties agreed that dependent claim 18 does not supply any inventive concept \nnot found in claim 16 and therefore, that the Court need only address claim 16 in conducting its \nstep two analysis.  Case 3:24-cv-07919-JCS     Document 32     Filed 03/06/25     Page 29 of 32 \n30 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  examine the skin for very small imperfections, which was the best way to conduct a useful \ndiagnosis. ”  Id.  ¶ 14.   There is no allegation that Chhibber’s conclusion represented a discovery of \na new method; nor does Brightex contend that it was.  Instead, the implication of the allegation is \nthat Chhibber’s conclusion reflected current best practices in the field of c osmetology at the time \nof the issuance of the ’358 Patent.  Therefore, the Court rejects Brightex’s argument that factual \nquestions preclude it from deciding whether the step two test is met on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion.  \nThe Court further finds that neither the photo guide nor the severity limitation supplies an \ninventive concept that transforms claims 16 into patentable subject matter.  As discussed above, the \nexaminer found that the “photo guide” was a “technological solution and significantly more than \nthe abstract idea.” Delacenserie Decl., Ex. A at 22  (citing Bascom Global Internet Services v. \nAT&T Mobility LLC , 827 F.3d 1341 (Fed. Cir. 2016)).  Neither the ’358 Patent specification nor \nthe allegations in the complaint s upport that conclusion, however.  The specification describes the \n“photo guide” in functional terms, as a feature of the “typical electronic device  . . . used to capture \na user’s image ” that  “instructs the user where to place her face in the image ” so that “ the user is \nable to take an image of her face with preferred dimensions for use in the recommendation \nprocess.”   ’358 Patent, 2: 33 -37.  In Fig. 2A, it is depicted as a simple graphic in the shape of a \nsquare frame that can be displayed on the device’s c amera to show the user where to position her \nface when capturing an image.  Id., Fig. 2A.  The specification does not allude to any \n“technological problem” that the “photo guide” solved or identify anything unconventional about \nits use in claim 16.   \nSimilarly, while the complaint includes conclusory allegations about the “innovation” of \nclaim 16, including the allegation that it “ recite a technical solution to a problem arising in the \nrealm of computing networks [,]” Compl. ¶ 59, there are no allegations in the complaint addressing \nwhat specific technological problem the photo guide solved  or explaining how the use of a photo \nguide constituted an advance in computer technology .  Indeed , the complaint emphasizes that the \nmethod  disclosed in claim 16 of the  ’358 Patent was enabled “by the advanced cameras that smart \ndevices used ” and thus did not require a specialized device. See, e.g.,  Compl. ¶ 15.  In short , the \nthe photo guide in claim 16 simply performs a basic computer function that was “known” in the Case 3:24-cv-07919-JCS     Document 32     Filed 03/06/25     Page 30 of 32 \n31 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  art.  Furthermore, other than conclus ory statements that the photo guide in combination  with the \nother claim limitations was inventive, Brightex has not explained how the claim as a whole \ndiscloses any inventive concept that combined the photo guide with the other limitations in an \nunconventional or innovative manner.  Therefore,  the Court rejects Brightex ’s assertion that the \naddition of the photo guide to claim 16 transform ed the claim  into something that is more than an \nabstr act idea .  See In re TLI Commc'ns LLC Pat. Litig ., 823 F.3d 607, 613 –14 (Fed. Cir. 2016) . \nThe Court also rejects Brightex’s assertion that the complaint sufficiently alleges that the \nphoto guide is inventive because it alleges that the function this feature performs “ could not be \nperformed by pen -and-paper methods. ”  Opposition at 5 (citing Comp.  ¶63), 13.  As Judge Koh \nexplained in Procter  & Gamble , to determine whether a claim is directed to an abstract idea, \ncourts consider, “as the facts require[,]” “ whether the claims are, in essence, directed to a mental \nprocess or a process that could be done with pencil and paper.” 288 F. Supp. 3d at 1013.  This is \nclosely related to “another helpful tool” in which courts consider whether claims  “have an analogy \nto the brick -and-mortar world, such that they cover a fundamental .  . . practice long prevalent in \nour system.”   Id. (internal quotation and citation omitted).  Here, Brightex’s focus on the pen -and-\npaper inquiry misses the mark.  While taking a picture with an electronic device that uses a photo \nguide is not a mental process that can be performed using pen and paper, it does have a very \nobvious real -world analogy of positioning a person’s face so that it can be inspected  or \nphotographed  by a cosmetologist – a practice that is implicit in the allegations of the complaint.  \nSee Compl. ¶ 14 (“ Chhibber researched the matter and determined that inspecting a face for \ncharacteristics and conditions required one to closely examine the skin for very small \nimperfections, which was the best way to conduct a useful diagnosis .”).   \nThe Court also finds unpersuasive Brightex’s  reliance on the “severity rating” to show that \nclaim 16 includes an innovative concept.  Brightex makes this argument only in passing  in its \nOpposition brief, see Opposition at 17, but presumably, the argument is based on the allegations in \nthe complaint that the patentee responded to the rejection by the Examiner  “by pointing out that \nthe invention is a novel computerized method of providing prioritized skin treatment \nrecommendations to users based on a severity rating calculation. ”  Compl. ¶ 61;  see also id . ¶ 62 Case 3:24-cv-07919-JCS     Document 32     Filed 03/06/25     Page 31 of 32 \n32 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  (“The patentee further responded that the pending claims of the application for the `358 Patent \ncontain meaningful limitations that represent a sufficiently inventive concept, and that they recite \nspecifically how the recommendations are selected and priorit ized based on a specifically \ncalculated severity rating .”). The Federal Circuit has recognized, however, that “acquiring, \nanalyzing, and displaying information is an abstract idea. Because information itself is an \nintangible, amassing information produce s an intangible, and applying mathematical algorithms to \nsort or analyze that information is essentially a mental process.” Procter & Gamble , 288 F. Supp. \nat 1018 (citing  Elec. Power Grp., LLC v. Alstom S.A ., 830 F.3d 1350, 1354 (Fed. Cir. 2016)).  As \nthe Federal Circuit explained in Electric Power Group , “merely presenting the results of abstract \nprocesses of collecting and analyzing information, without more (such as identifying a particular \ntool for presentation), is abstract as an ancillary part of such  collection and analysis.”  830 F.3d at \n1354 . Thus, the Court here concludes that the disclosure in claim 16 of a method to evaluate the \nseverity of the user’s skin characteristics is ancillary to the abstract process of collecting and \nanalyzing data and does not supply an inventive concept that transforms claim 16 into patentable \nsubject matter.    \nFor these reasons, the Court finds that the asserted claims do not disclose an inventive \nconcept at step two of the Alice test. \nIV. CONCLUSION  \nFor the reasons stated above, the Court finds that the asserted claims of the ’358 Patent are \ninvalid under 35 U.S.C. § 101.  Therefore, the Motion is GRANTED. Plaintiff’s claim for \ninfringement of the ’358 Patent (Claim One) is dismissed with prejudice.  \nIT IS SO ORDERED.  \n \nDated:   March 6, 2025  \n \n______________________________________  \nJOSEPH C.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: VB Assets, LLC sued Amazon.com Services LLC, alleging willful infringement of patents related to smart speaker technology by Amazon's Alexa. The jury found Amazon willfully infringed certain claims of four patents, awarding $46.7 million in damages. While the court upheld most of the jury's decisions, it found there was insufficient evidence for one patent claim.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether Amazon's Alexa infringed on VB Assets' patents related to smart speaker technology and if such infringement was willful.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court upheld the jury's finding that Amazon infringed on three of the patents but overturned the jury's finding on one patent claim due to insufficient evidence. Additionally, the court granted VB Assets an ongoing royalty with further briefing required to determine the rate, as well as pre- and post-judgment interest.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: VB Assets said Amazon’s Alexa was using their patented ideas without permission. The jury mostly agreed and decided Amazon did this on purpose, giving VB Assets a lot of money. But the judge said the jury made a mistake on one part, and Amazon didn't infringe on one of the patents. The judge also decided that Amazon should pay VB Assets a little bit of money for every future Alexa sale involving the same technology, but more discussions are needed to decide how much.",

At the end, the jury found that Defendant Amazon.com Services LLC \n(“Defendant” or “Amazon” ) willfully infringed claims of four patents owned by Plaintiff  VB \nAssets, LLC (“Plaintiff” or “VB Assets”) , and that Defendant had failed to prove that those cla ims \nare invalid .  Presently before the Court are the parties’ post- trial motions .  (D.I. 298; D.I. 300).1  \nFor the reasons that follow, the Court will GRANT -IN-PART and DENY- IN-PART Defendant’s \nmotion for judgment as a matter of law; and will GRANT -IN-PART and DENY- IN-PART  \nPlaintiff’s motion for an ongoing royalty, pre -judgment interest, post -judgment interest and \nenhanced damages.   \nI. BACKGROUND  \nPlaintiff  owns several patents related to its smart speaker technology.  Defendant  is the \nowner of Alexa, a voice -based artificial intelligence assistant that interacts with users through \nAlexa- enabled devices.   At trial,  Plaintiff alleged  that Alexa infringed claim 13 of U.S. Patent No. \n8,073,681 (“the ’681 patent”), claim 25 of U.S. Patent No. 9,626,703 (“the ’703 patent”), claim 40 \nof U.S. Patent No. 7,818,176 (“the ’176 patent”)  and claim 23 of U.S. Patent 9,269,097 (“the ’097 \npatent”)  (collectively, “the asserted  claims ” of “the asserted patents”) .2  Defendant denied \ninfringement and challenged the validity of the asserted claims.  Specifically, Defendant argued \n \n1  Each party filed a single post- trial motion but moved for relief on multiple grounds. \n \n2  Plaintiff had also alleged infringement of U.S. Patent No. 9,015,049 and U.S. Patent No. \n8,886,536.  The claims of the former patent w ere invalidated by the Patent Trial and Appeal \nBoard.  See Amazon.com, Inc , et. al. v. VB Assets, LLC , IPR2020-01346, 2022 WL 320531, \nat *16 (PTAB  Feb. 1, 2022).  The latter patent was dropped before trial as a result of \nnegotiations between the parties.  ( See D.I. 255 at 1).  \n Case 1:19-cv-01410-MN     Document 325     Filed 09/30/24     Page 2 of 41 PageID #:\n<pageID> \n2 the asserted claims of the ’703, ’176 and ’097 patents are patent ineligible,3 and that all asserted \nclaims are invalid for lack of adequate written description and obviousness over the prior art.  After \na five- day trial, the jury found all the asserted claims willfully infringed, not invalid and not patent \nineligible.  ( See D.I. 291).  The jury then awarded Plaintiff running royalty damages of \n$46.7 million.  ( Id. at 7).  \nBoth parties filed post-trial motions that are now before the Court.  Defendant renewed its \nmotion for judgment as a matter of law on infringement of all the asserted claims, invalidity for \nlack of adequate written description for claim 23 of the ’097 pate nt, ineligibility for all asserted \nclaims and willfulness.  (D.I. 299).  Plaintiff ask s the Court to award pre -judgment and post -\njudgement interest on the jury’s damages award, an ongoing royalty and enhanced damages.  (D.I.  301).  The Court addresses the motions below. \nII. DEFENDANT’S MOTION FOR JUDGMENT AS A MATTER OF LAW  \nA. Legal Standard \nBefore a case is submitted to a jury, the Court may grant judgment as a matter of law if it \n“finds that a reasonable jury would not have a legally sufficient evidentiary basis to find for the [moving] party on that issue.”  F\nED. R. CIV. P. 50(a)(1).  Judgment as a matter of law is granted \n“sparingly” and is only warranted “if, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the \nnonmovant and giving it the advantage of every fair and reasonable inference, there is insufficient evidence from which a jury reasonably could find liability.”  Lightning Lube v. Witco Corp., 4 F.3d 1153, 1166 (3d Cir. 1993).  If the court denies the motion, following the entry of  judgment, a party \nmay file a renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law.  F\nED. R. CIV. P. 50(b).   \n \n3  The jury was instructed to consider whether the elements in each of these claims, \nconsidered individually and as an ordered combination, involved only activities which a person of ordinary skill in the art would have considered to be well -understood, routi ne, \nand conventional.  (D.I. 288 at 19).   Case 1:19-cv-01410-MN     Document 325     Filed 09/30/24     Page 3 of 41 PageID #:\n<pageID> \n3 A court may grant a renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law if the movant shows \n“that the jury’s findings, presumed or express, are not supported by substantial evidence or, if they \nwere, that the legal conclusion(s) implied [by] the jury’s verdict cannot in law be supported by those findings.”  Pannu v. Iolab Corp., 155 F.3d 1344, 1348 (Fed. Cir. 1998) (internal quotation marks omitted).  “‘ Substantial’ evidence is such relevant evidence from the record taken as a whole \nas might be accepted by a reasonable mind as adequate to support the finding under review.”  Perkin -Elmer Corp. v. Computervision Corp., 732 F.2d 888, 893 (Fed. Cir. 1984).  The Court may \nnot “weigh the evidence, evaluate the credibility of the witnesses, or substitute its own version of the facts for the jury’s findings.”  Dow Chem. Co. v. Nova Chems. Corp. (Can.) , C.A.  No. 05-737-\nJJF, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 77389, at *4 (D. Del. July 30, 2010).  Furthermore, the Court must \ngive the verdict winner “the benefit of all logical inferences that could be drawn from the evidence presented, resolve all conflicts in  the evidence in [their] favor and, in general, view the record in \nthe light most favorable to [them].”  Williamson v. CONRAIL , 926 F.2d 1344, 1348 (3d Cir. 1991).  \nMoreover, in the Third Circuit, when the movant bears the burden of proof on an issue, judgment as a matter of law is appropriate only if  “there is insufficient evidence for p ermitting any different \nfinding.”  Fireman’s Fund Ins. Co. v. Videfreeze Corp., 540 F.2d 1171, 1177 (3d Cir. 1976). \nB. Infringement  \nThe jury found that Defendant infringed claim 13 of the ’681 patent, claim 25 of the ’703 \npatent, claim 40 of the ’176 patent and claim 23 of the ’097 patent.  (D.I. 291 at 2).  Defendant \nmoves for judgment as a matter of law on infringement of all the asserted claims .  (D.I. 298).  For \nthe reasons discussed below, the Court denies Defendant’s motion for the ’681 patent, the ’176 \npatent, and the ’097 patent, but grants Defendant’s motion for the ’703 patent.    Case 1:19-cv-01410-MN     Document 325     Filed 09/30/24     Page 4 of 41 PageID #:\n<pageID> \n4 1. Claim 13 of the ’681 p atent  \nThe ’681 patent is titled “ System and M ethod for a Cooperative Conversational V oice User \nInterface.”  Claim 13 of the ’681 patent claims:   \n13. A non-transitory computer readable medium containing computer- executable \ninstructions for providing a cooperative conversational voice user interface, the \ncomputer-executable instructions operable when executed to:  \nreceive an utterance at a voice input device, during a current conversation with a \n user, wherein the utterance includes one or more words that have different  meanings in different contexts;  \naccumulate short -term shared knowledge about the current conversation, wherein \nthe short-term shared knowledge includes knowledge about the utterance received at the voice during the current conversation;  accumulate long -term shared knowledge about the user, wherein the long- term \nshared knowledge includes knowledge about one or more past conversations with the user;  \n identify a context associated with the utterance, wherein a conversational speech engine identifies the context associated with the utterance from the short- term \nshared knowledge and the long-term shared knowledge; \n \nestablish an intended meaning for the utterance within the identified context, wherein the conversational speech engine establishes the intended meaning within the identified context to disambiguate an intent that the user had in speaking the one or more words that have the different meanings in the different contexts; and  generate a response to the utterance, wherein the conversational speech engine grammatically or syntactically adapts the response based on the intended meaning established within the identified context.  \n \n(JTX-1,’681 patent at  21:6-35).  \n \nDefendant argues that no reasonable jury could have found c laim 13 to be infringed by \nAlexa for three reasons : (1) there was no evidence proving “computer executable instructions” in \nAlexa, such as “Alexa source code, technical documents, or testimony from Amazon witness es” \n(D.I. 299 at 10) ; (2) no evidence “[identified] at least one  received utterance and [explained] how Case 1:19-cv-01410-MN     Document 325     Filed 09/30/24     Page 5 of 41 PageID #:\n<pageID> \n5 Alexa pe rforms each of the claimed steps for that same utterance ” (id. at 13);4 and (3) Plaintiff \ndid not establish that Alexa accumulated either “short -term” or “long -term” knowledge .  (D.I. 319 \nat 8).  The Court disagrees.  \nThe jury heard Plaintiff’s infringement expert, Dr. Polish,  analyze each element of c laim \n13 and then explain how “technical documents” and “[h is] own use of the system” demonstrated \nthat those elements were present in Alexa.  ( Tr. 339:1- 2; see also  Tr. 296:9 -20; 298:9- 22; 337:9-\n351:23)  (explaining how various aspect s of Alexa meet each element of claim 13 ).  Dr. Polish also \nused a demonstrative video to bring to life his testimony explaining how, in his opinion, Alexa \npractices each step of c laim 13.5  (Tr. 340:6- 17; see also  Tr. 340:17 -346:3, 346:25- 348:21)  \n(discussing how Alexa cooperatively converses with a user setting an alarm ; and how Alexa is \nable to decipher that various numbers correspond to desired alarm times) ).  The jury was further \npresented with evidence Alexa could  disambiguate user intent through utilizing long- term or short -\nterm information in response to the utterance “Hunger Games.”  ( Tr. 349:5- 10; see also  Tr. 328:20-\n332:1)  (testifying  step-by-step, how Alexa disambiguated the utterance “Hunger Games.”) .  \nDr. Polish conceded that he did not show Alexa pe rforming each step of c laim 13 in \nresponse to “one specific utterance.”  (Tr. 395:2).  Rather, Dr. Polish presented the jury with \n \n4  Specifically, Defendant asserts that Dr. Polish did not “map a single utterance to the claim \nelements” and instead used multiple, disparate utterances to demonstrate each of the steps in isolation .  (D.I. 299 at 14) . \n \n5  When deciding a motion for judgment as a matter of law, the Court must assess the evidence presented at trial.  Demonstrative exhibits, such as Dr. Polish’s videos, are not by themselves evidence, and, therefore, cannot be a standalone basis to support judgment as a matter of law.  In contrast, expert testimony that is aided by use of a demonstrative exhibit can be properly considered when assessing judgment as a matter of law.  See, e.g., SSL Servs., LLC v. Citrix Sys. , 769 F.3d 1073, 1088 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (finding that an expert’s \nuse of “demonstrative slides” to prove infringement constituted substantial evidence to support the jury’s verdict). Case 1:19-cv-01410-MN     Document 325     Filed 09/30/24     Page 6 of 41 PageID #:\n<pageID> \n6 testimony (using demonstratives ) of Alexa per forming each claim element in response to different \nutterances.  Although Dr. Polish’s testimony may have been more persuasive had he shown Alexa \ncomplete all the claim elements in response to one specific utterance,  it was not unreasonable for \nthe jury to infer that if Alexa was able to perform each step prompted by different utterances, then \nAlexa likewise was able to perform each step prompted by the same utterance.  And t he Court \ncannot “substitute its own conclusions for tha t of the jury where the record evidence supports \nmultiple inferences.”  Bd. of Regents v. Bos. Sci. Corp., C.A. No. 18- 392, 2024 WL 2848471, 2024 \nU.S. Dist. LEXIS 99773, at *5- *6 (D. Del. June 5, 2024).   \nMoreover, despite not viewing Alexa’s source code, the jury was presented with substantial \nevidence that Alexa was programmed with “computer -executable instructions ,” as required by \nclaim 13.  First, Dr. Polish opined that the entirety of cl aim 13’s preamble, including computer -\nexecutable instructions, w as present in the Alexa device.  (Tr. 337:24- 338:6) .  Second, the jury \ncould reasonably infer  computer -executable instructions enabled Alexa to pe rform each element \nof claim 13.  The jury was entitled to rel y on circumstantial evidence, such as Alexa’s actual ability \nand operation, to conclude Alexa contained computer -executable instructions .  See Lucent Techs., \nInc. v. Gateway, Inc. , 543 F.3d 710, 723 (Fed. Cir. 2008) ( “A patentee may rely on either direct or \ncircumstantial evidence to prove infringement .”).  Substantial evidence demonstrated Alexa was \nable to perform each and every element of c laim 13; and technological devices are unable to \nperform intended functions without source code or computer executable instructions.  Therefore, \nthe jury was entitled to “evaluate the weight  to be  attributed to this circumstantial evidence and to \ndecide whether to draw the inferences [Plaintiff] sought.”   Power Integrations, Inc. v. Fairchild \nSemiconductor  Int’l, Inc. , 935 F . Supp. 2d 747, 759 (D. Del. 2013).   \nThus , the Court concludes the jury reasonably found infringement of claim 13.  Case 1:19-cv-01410-MN     Document 325     Filed 09/30/24     Page 7 of 41 PageID #:\n<pageID> \n7 2. Claim 40 of the ’176 p atent  \nThe ’176 p atent is titled “ System and M ethod for S electing and Presenting A dvertisements \nBased on N atural Language P rocessing of V oice- Based Input.”  Claim 40 of the ’176 patent claims: \n40. A system for selecting and presenting advertisements in response to processing \nnatural language utterances, compris ing: \n \nan input device that receives a natural language utterance containing at least one request at an input device;  a speech recognition engine coupled to the input device, wherein the speech recognition engine recognizes one or more words or phrases in the natural language utterance;  \n \na conversational language processor coupled to the speech recognition engine, wherein the conversational language processor is configured to:  \ninterpret the recognized words or phrases, wherein interpreting the recognized words or phrases includes establishing a context for the natural language utterance, select an advertisement in the context established for the natural language utterance; and  present the selected advertisement via \nan output device; and  \n \nan adaptive misrecognition engine configured to determine that the conversational language incorrectly interpreted the words or phrases in response to detecting a predetermined event, wherein the conversational language processor reinterprets the words or phrases in response to the predetermined event.  \n(JTX-3, ’176 patent  at 16:48-17:6).  \nAmazon argues that the jury could not have reasonably found infringement of claim 40 \nbecause Plaintiff did not “identify any ‘adaptive misrecognition engine’ in Alexa and a \n‘predetermined event’ in response to which the engine determine s that words or phrases were \nincorrectly interpreted.”\n6  (D.I. 299 at 15).  Again, the Court disagrees.  \n \n6  Defendant’s complaints about Plaintiff’s evidence appear to be rooted in form, and not \nsubstance.  Plaintiff had to prove that Alexa has an “adaptive misrecognition engine” – not \nthat Alexa contains a component labeled “adaptive misrecognition engine.” Case 1:19-cv-01410-MN     Document 325     Filed 09/30/24     Page 8 of 41 PageID #:\n<pageID> \n8 As a preliminary note, the Court was not asked to (and did not ) construe the term \n“predetermined event” in c laim 40 .  That term, thus, was given its plain and ordinary meaning.  At \ntrial, Amazon’s expert, D r. Johnson, explained that a “predetermined event” is “something else the \nuser says afterwards [that] might indicate the system misunderstood.”  (Tr. 743:7- 9).  B ased on \nDr. Johnson’s testimony, the jury could have decided that “a predetermined event” is anything a \nuser says which may indicate to the devi ce that it was not providing information the user sought.   \nPlaintiff presented ample evidence at trial establishing that Alexa contains “an adaptive \nmisrecognition engine configured to determine that the conversational language  [processor]  \nincorrectly interpreted the words or phrases in response to detecting a predetermined event . . ..”  \n(JTX-3,’176 patent  at 17:1- 4).  First, Dr. Polish opined that Alexa Shopping contains the last \nelement of c laim 40.  (Tr. 357:10- 18).  He supported his opinion with references to technical \ndocuments like the “NLU deep dive document ,” which he explained demonstrated Alexa’s ability \nto re-rank a user’s intent “in response to getting some information that indicated that [it] had gotten \nit wrong.”  (Tr. 358:9- 12; PTX -226 at 22;  see also  Tr. 409:20- 410:12 (discussing the re -ranking \nprocessing in Alexa’s NLU ); Tr. 319:13- 23; PTX -78 (discussing that Amazon’s technical \ndocuments show that Alexa has a “blueshift intent format” which is a “collection of intents and scores for them .”)).  Furthermore, Dr. Polish utilized a demonstrative video, along with his \ntestimony , to explain that when Alexa was presented with the term  “Hunger Games,” Alexa re-\nranked and re -scored the user’s intent to conclude whether the term referenced a movie, album, \nsong or book with that title.  (Tr. 331- 332; PTX -226 at 18- 22).  Additionally, Mr. Peck, Plaintiff’s \nsource code expert, testified Alexa is coded to take the list of user interpretations and then reorder \nand re -rank them.  ( See Tr. 449:3- 9).  Defendant’s expert, Dr. Strom, likewise explained Alexa’s \nre-ranking me thod:  Case 1:19-cv-01410-MN     Document 325     Filed 09/30/24     Page 9 of 41 PageID #:\n<pageID> \n9 . . . t he different intents that are coming from the different neural \nnetworks, they’re compiled into what we call an NBest list, so that’s \na list of all the intent, and each one  of the intents  has a confidence \nscore designed with it, depending on how sure we are about that meaning . . . then we have other machine learning methods that can boost or lower the score of some intents, depending on other factor s \nlike other features in the system.  This is called re -ranking . . . \n (Tr. 565:7-16).   \n \nUltimately,  Plaintiff presented substantial evidence that Alexa Shopping is configured to \nre-rank and re -score a user’s intent after the receiving verbal feedback  or incorporating other \ncontext cues which  indicate that its initial intent ranking was incorrect.   Such evidence supports \nthe jury’s conclusion that Defendant infringes claim 40.  ( See also  Tr: 351:25-358:15) (explaining \nhow each and every element of claim 40 is present in  Alexa.). \n3. Claim 23 of the ’097 p atent  \nThe ’097 patent is titled “ System and M ethod for Delivering Targeted Advertisements \nand/or Providing N atural Language Processing B ased on A dvertisements.”  Claim 23 of the ’097 \npatent claims:  \n23. A system providing natural language processing based on advertisements, the system \n comprising:  \n one or more physical processors programmed with computer program instructions which, when executed, cause the one or more physical processors to:  \nprovide an advertisement associated with a product or service for  \npresentation to a user; \n \nreceive a natural language utterance of the user; and  \n \ninterpret the natural language utterance based on the advertisement and, responsive to the existence of a pronoun in the natural language utterance, determine whether the pronoun refers to one or more of the product or service or a provider of the product or service.  \n   \n(JTX-5,’097 patent at 14:66-15:12). Case 1:19-cv-01410-MN     Document 325     Filed 09/30/24     Page 10 of 41 PageID #:\n<pageID> \n10 Amazon argues that no reasonable jury could find infringement of c laim 23 because \n“Dr. Polish offered only a conclusion that Alexa met this limitation” and did not present “source \ncode” or “testimony from an Amazon engineer” to support his “speculative” opinion.  (D.I. 299 at \n16-17).  Yet again, the Court disagrees.   \nDr. Polish utilized an example to show that Alexa is responsive to and can recognize a \npronoun in an utterance and then recognize whether that pronoun refers to a previously presented \nadvertisement.  ( See Tr. 361: 14-362:13) (discussing his own use of the system and an  \nadvertisement for an iPhone case) .  When Alexa was prompted with an utterance – Dr. Polish used \nutterances containing the  pronouns “peach” and “stone”  – Alexa was able to tie that utterance back \nto the color of an item in a potential purchase discussed previously, rather than  concluding the \nutterance referred to a  fruit or a rock .  (See Tr. 413:18- 21) (Dr. Polish stating, “[i] t just seems clear \nthat the existence of the pronoun tells Alexa that we’re talking about the purchase that we were \nmaking previously.” ).  Although Dr. Polish did not discuss technical documents or Alexa’s source \ncode, the jury was entitled to agree with Dr. Polish that “the behavior of the system speaks for \nitself.”   (Tr. 414:8).  Juries are permitted to rely on circumstantial evidence, like the behavior of \nAlexa, to conclude there i s infringement.  See Martek Biosciences Corp. v. Nutrinova, Inc., \n579 F.3d 1363, 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (“A patentee may prove infringement by any method of analysis that is probative of the fact of infringement, and circumstantial evidence may be \nsufficient.”)  (internal citations and quotation marks omitted) ; see also  Alco Std. Corp. v. TVA, \n808 F.2d 1490, 1503 (Fed. Cir. 1986) (“Although the evidence of infringement is circumstantial, \nthat does not make it any less credible or persuasive .”).  Further, the jury could have simply found \nDr. Polish credible and relied on his purportedly “conclusory” opinion.  ( See, e.g., Tr. 358:16-  \n362:17)  (Dr. Polish opining that  Alexa infringes each and every element of claim 23).  It is not the Case 1:19-cv-01410-MN     Document 325     Filed 09/30/24     Page 11 of 41 PageID #:\n<pageID> \n11 role of the Court, on a motion for judgment as a matter of law, to weigh the credibility of the \nwitnesses.  Accordingly, the Court denies Amazon’s motion.  \n4. Claim 25 of the ’ 703 p atent  \nThe ’703 p atent is titled “Voice Commerce. ”  Claim 25 of the ’703 patent (“claim 25”) \nclaims: \n25. A system for providing voice commerce, the system comprising: \n \none or more physical processors programmed with computer program instructions \n which, when executed, cause the one or more physical processors to: \n  receive a user input comprising a natural language utterance;  \n  provide, without further user input after the receipt of the user input, the  \n  natural language utterance as an input to a speech recognition engine; \n  obtain, without further user input after the receipt of the user input, one or  \n  more words or phrases recognized from the natural language utterance as    an output of the speech recognition engine; \n  \ndetermine, without further user input after the receipt of the user input, a context based at least on the one or more words or phrases;  identify, without further user input after the receipt of the user input, the product or service to be purchased on behalf of the user based at least on the determined context;  obtain payment information with which to pay for the product or service; \n   \nobtain, without further user input after the receipt of the user input, shipping information with which to deliver the product or service, wherein the shipping information specifies a name or address of a recipient to which the product or service is to be delivered after the product or service is purchased; and  \n provide, without further user input after the receipt of the user input, a \n request for user confirmation to use the payment information and the \nshipping information for a purchase transaction for the product or service. \n \n(JTX-2, ’703 patent at 26:8-43).  Case 1:19-cv-01410-MN     Document 325     Filed 09/30/24     Page 12 of 41 PageID #:\n<pageID> \n12 Amazon argues that no reasonable jury could find infringement of c laim 25 because \nPlaintiff  did not: ( 1) present “source code or back -end Alexa operations” that evidence “computer \ninstructions;” (2) prove Alexa “obtain[s], without further user input after the receipt of the user \ninput, shipping information with which to deliver the product or service;” and ( 3) prove Alexa \n“provide[s], without further user input after the receipt of the user input, a request for user \nconfirmation to use the payment information and the shipping information for a purchase \ntransaction.”  (D.I. 299 at 17- 18).  T he Court finds merit in Amazon’s third argument.  \nTo prove infringement, Plaintiff must establish, by a preponderance of the evidence, that \neach and every claim element is present in the accused device.  See Catalina Mktg. Int’l v. \nCoolsavings.com, Inc., 289 F.3d 801, 812 (Fed. Cir. 2002) (“Literal infringement requires the \npatentee to prove that the accused device contains each limitation of the asserted claim.”).  The \njury was instructed “[i]f the accused product or process does not contain one or more elements or \nsteps recited in a claim, there is no in fringement.”  ( Tr. 892:12- 14).  Relevant here, the last  element \nof claim 25 requires “ a request for user confirmation to use  the payment information and the \nshipping information for a purchase transaction for the product or service.”  ( JTX-2,’703 patent  at \n26:41- 43) (emphas is added).  Accordingly, to find Defendant infringed claim 25, there must have \nbeen s ubstantial evidence that Alexa made “a request for user confirmation to use the payment and \nthe shipping information.”   (Id.).   \nSimply put, however, the jury was not presented with substantial  evidence to reasonably \nconclude Alexa provided “a request for user confirmation to use the payment and the shipping \ninformation.”  Plaintiff presented evidence, through the testimony of Dr. Polish, that Alexa responds “buy it now” when completing a transaction.  In its brief, Plaintiff argues  the prompt \n“buy it now” constitutes “a request for user confirmation to use the payment and shipping Case 1:19-cv-01410-MN     Document 325     Filed 09/30/24     Page 13 of 41 PageID #:\n<pageID> \n13 information” because  Alexa previously stores a user’s payment and shipping information.   \n(D.I.  311 at 15).  Problematically, however, Plaintiff did not introduce evidence at trial suggesting \nthat “buy it now” i s shorthand for, or equivalent to, “user confirmation to use the payment and \nshipping information.”   In everyday interactions, when a person directs another to “buy it now” \nthey are not necessarily confirming use of a  payment method or shipping information.  Rather, and \nliterally, “buy it now” only expresses the end goal of purchase, it does not confirm the means for \nexecution.   \nMoreover, testimony from Dr. Polish did not establish that Alexa p erforms each element \nof claim 25.  At trial, Dr. Polish was asked whether the last element of c laim 25 was “illustrated \nin [his] video demonstration.”   (Tr. 368:17- 18).  Dr. Polish replied that it was because Alexa \n“provided information about what was going on.”  (Id. at 19 -20).  Notably, Dr. Polish did not  state \nthat Alexa asked for confirmation to use his payment or shipping information, only that it “provided information about what was going on.”  This statement does not amount to evidence \nthat Alexa performs the last element of claim 25.\n7  See, for example, United States v. Bailey , \n598 Fed. Appx. 117, 122 at n.10 (3d Cir. 2015) (“While [plaintiff ’s] counsel’s statements or \nquestions are not evidence, answers are . . .”).  Moreover, a reasonable juror viewing the demonstrative would not have concluded Alexa asked for user confirmation.  In actuality , the \ndemonstrative , as described in Dr. Polish’s testimony, showed Alexa describing a product’s color, \nprice, and shipment time, and then stating, “you can say ‘buy it now.’”  ( See Tr. 421:23- 422:14)  \n(discussing what occurred in the demonstrative video) .  After Dr. Pol ish said, “buy it now,” the \ndevice informed Dr. Polish where it was shipping the product and its  total cost.  Alexa neither \n \n7   In the same exchange of questioning, Dr. Polish also contradictorily affirmed the purchase \nwas charged to his credit card without further input, even though the claim requires that \nAlexa make a request for confirmation to use a payment method.  (Tr. 369:8- 10).   Case 1:19-cv-01410-MN     Document 325     Filed 09/30/24     Page 14 of 41 PageID #:\n<pageID> \n14 asked for user confirmation to use a shipping address, nor did it mention a payment method at all.  \nDr. Polish affirmed this interpretation by stating Alexa executed the transaction without further input.  (Tr. 368:22-24; Tr. 422:7- 15).  Dr. Johnson, Amazon’s expert , highlighted this discrepancy \nto the jury and stated  Alexa did not make “a request for confirmation of payment or shipping \ninformation” and instead made a “statement that [the product was] ordered.”  (Tr. 709:15-17; see also Tr. 709:23-24) ( “Alexa doesn’t ask for that particular confirmation when you buy \nsomething.”).  Further, on cross examination, Dr. Polish acknowledged that he did not prove t hat \nAlexa provides a request for user confirmation to use the payment information and shipping information.  (Tr. 419: 20-24) (Q: “. . . Nowhere did you show Alexa saying Dr. Polish, please \nconfirm this payment information and the shipping information, right? A: “I think that’s right, I \nthink the receipt was sent - - was sent via e- mail.” ).   \nIn light of the above, the Court finds the jury’s verdict as to this claim is not supported by \nsubstantial evidence.  Indeed, even when “‘viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the \nnonmovant and giving it the advantage of every fair and reasonable inference, there is insufficient evidence from which a jury reasonably could find ’ for the nonmovant.”  Trans web, LLC v. 3M \nInnovative Props. Co., 812 F.3d 1295, 1301 (Fed. Cir. 2016)  (quoting Lightning Lube, Inc. 4 F.3d \n1153 at 1166) .  Therefore, the Court grants Amazon’s motion for judgment as a matter of law with \nregard to infringement of claim 25 of the ’703 patent.  \nC. WILLFUL INFRINGEMENT  \nThe jury found that VB Assets proved, by a preponderance of the evidence, that Amazon \nwillfully infringed the asserted claims of the ’681 patent, the ’176 p atent and the ’097 p atent.  \n(D.I.  291 at 3).  Willful infringement is a question of fact and the jury’s determination as to \nwillfulness is reviewable under the substantial evidence standard.  See Braun Inc. v. Dynamics Corp. of Am., 975 F.2d 815, 822 (Fed. Cir. 1992).  Case 1:19-cv-01410-MN     Document 325     Filed 09/30/24     Page 15 of 41 PageID #:\n<pageID> \n15 The jury also concluded that the ’703 patent was willfully infringed; but, for the reasons \nexplained above, the Defendant’s motion with regards to this patent is mooted by the Court’s \ndecision that the jury could not have reasonably concluded that claim 25 of the ’703 patent was \ninfringed.   \n1. Legal Standard \nWillful infringement is found where the defendant both knew of the asserted patent and \nknew its conduct amounted to infringement of the asserted patent.  “Knowledge of the asserted \npatent and evidence of infringement is necessary, but not sufficient, for a finding of willfulness.  Rather, willfulness requires deliberate or intentional infringement.”  Bayer HealthCare LLC v. \nBaxalta Inc., 989 F.3d 964, 988 (Fed. Cir. 2021).  “A finding of ‘subjective willfulness,’ proof that \nthe accused infringer acted in th e face of a risk of infringement that was ‘either known or so \nobvious that it should have been known to the accused infringer’ can satisf y this standard.”   Sunoco \nPartners Mktg. & Terminals L.P. v. Powder Springs Logistics , LLC , 624 F. Supp. 3d 473, 480-\n481 (D. Del. 2022) (quoting Halo Elecs., Inc. v. Pulse Elecs., Inc., 579 U.S. 93, 101 (2016)).  \n2. Analysis \nAmazon argues there cannot be willful infringement because it “requires an actual charge \nof infringement” and there is “no evidence that plaintiff gave Amazon notice of alleged infringement before filing suit.”  (D.I. 299 at 26).  Amazon’s argument, however, is legally \ninaccurate.  Although it is true that Plaintiff must show that Amazon had notice of the patent and \nthat Amazon  knew its conduct amounted to infringement, Plaintiff need not show that notice came \nin the form of an explicit accusation of infringement from Plaintiff to Amazon.  See , e.g., Smith \nEng’g Co., Inc. v. Eisenmann Corp., 28 Fed. Appx. 958, 965- 966, (Fed. Cir. 2002) (finding willful \ninfringement because the defendant “knew  about the patent four years prior to the filing of the \nsuit,” even though Defendant was not directly “notified [by Plaintiff] of the patent prior to the Case 1:19-cv-01410-MN     Document 325     Filed 09/30/24     Page 16 of 41 PageID #:\n<pageID> \n16 filing of the complaint.”).  As discussed below, there was substantial evidence to establish  notice \nof the patents and notice that practicing those patents ’ claims  would constitute infringement.   \na. Knowledge of the Patents  \nThe jury was presented with evidence that Amazon learned of the ’176 and ’681 patents \nduring a “very deep dive” meeting at VoiceBox’s8 office in October 2011.9  (Tr. 156:4-158:7; \nTr. 160:20- 161:3; Tr.161:9- 19).  The jury also viewed the presentation VoiceBox gave to Amazon \nat the meeting, which contained a slide titled “Voice Box Patents” and displayed the cover page \nof the ’176 patent.  (See PTX -65 at 10; see also  Tr. 160:17-19).  Separately, Mr. Hayden, the Vice-\nPresident of I ntellectual Property at Amazon, confirmed that Amazon knew of the ’681 patent in \n2015.  ( See Tr. 466:16- 20; see also  PTX -158 at 21 ).  \nEvidence also established  Amazon became aware of the ’097 patent in the spring of 2017.  \nMr. Kennewick , one of the inventors of the ’097 patent, testified that VoiceBox engaged in \npotential acquisition discussions with Amazon, in which the parties discussed VoiceBox’s \nintellectual property and patents.  Related to those discussions, VoiceBox provided Amazon with \na comprehensive list of its intellectual property, which included the ’097 patent.  (See Tr. 176:8-\n177:5; see also  PTX -629).  This is sufficient evidence that Amazon had knowledge of the asserted \npatents.  \n \n8  VoiceBox was the successor entity to VB Assets  (see Tr. 143-144) and retained all the \nasserted patents from VoiceBox  (see Tr. 186).  \n \n9   Mr. Kennewick testified that VoiceBox and Amazon discussed VoiceBox’s patents, as well \nas the additional pending patents.  (Tr. 161:2 -3).  In October 2011, the ’681 patent had not \nissued and was a pending patent.  Therefore, drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of VB Assets, it is reasonable for the jury to conclude  the application that issued as the ’681 \npatent two months later was discussed at the October 2011 meeting.  Case 1:19-cv-01410-MN     Document 325     Filed 09/30/24     Page 17 of 41 PageID #:\n<pageID> \n36 the Court should deny an ongoing royalty because VB Assets has not met its burden of proving \nentitlement to the royalty or the specific rate, the jury’s awarded rate was over -inflated, and the \nrequested royalty base “double -counts users and includes predominately non-infringing \nactivity.”17  (D.I. 312 at 22).   \n1. Legal Standard \n“When a patentee requests running royalty damages, and the jury awards damages through \ntrial, district courts have authority to craft a compulsory ongoing royalty for future sales of products the jury found to infringe.”  Godo Kaisha IP Bridge 1 v. TCL Commun. Tech. Holdings \nLtd., Civ. No. 15-634- JFB, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 70752, at *11 (D. Del. Apr. 26, 2019).  \n“Although an ongoing royalty is not aut omatic, ‘the Federal Circuit has indicated that a prevailing \npatentee should receive compensation for any continuing infringement.’”  Purewick Corp. v. Sage Prods., LLC , 666 F. Supp. 3d 419, 448 (D. Del. 2023) ( quoting Apple, Inc. v. Samsung Elecs. Co., \nCase No.: 12 -CV-00630- LHK, 2014 WL 6687122, at *7 (N.D. Cal. Nov. 25, 2014)).  To determine \nan appropriate ongoing royalty, the Court must consider “what a hypothetical negotiation would look like after the prior infringement verdict.”  XY, LLC v. Trans Ova Genetics, L.C., 890 F.3d \n1282, 1297 (Fed. Cir. 2018); s ee also id. at 1297 (“ [T]here is a fundamental differ ence between a \nreasonable royalty for pre -verdict infringement and damages for post -verdict infringement”)  \n(internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  Of course, the hypothetical negotiation may be impacted by a change in the marketplace, a change in demand for the patented product, and, importantly, the fact that the Court has determined the patent to be valid and infringed.  See ActiveVideo Networks, Inc. v. Verizon Comm uns., Inc., 694 F.3d 1312, 1342 (Fed. Cir. 2012) \n \n17  Specifically, Amazon argues Mr. Reed’s damages calculation does not reflect “new” \ncustomers, and instead only demonstrates the change in monthly active users  – some of \nwhich may have been customers previously but became temporarily inactive.  (D.I. 312 at 22).  Case 1:19-cv-01410-MN     Document 325     Filed 09/30/24     Page 37 of 41 PageID #:\n<pageID> \n37 (stating that a verdict of infringement and validity creates a “substantial shift in the bargaining \nposition of the parties.”).  The burden of proving damages for the ongoing royalty remains with the patentee.  See Creative Internet Adver. Corp. v. Yahoo! Inc., 674 F. Supp. 2d 847, 854 ( E.D. \nTex. 2009) (“When injunctive relief is denied . . . and the Court instead considers whether an \ninfringer should pay an ongoing royalty, the Court finds that the burden of proving damages remains with the patentee.”).  \n2. Analysis \nThe Court finds that Plaintiff is entitled to an ongoing royalty.  T he jury found that Amazon \nwillfully infringed the asserted patents through the end of 2023 and, since then, Amazon has continued to infringe three of the patents .  The Court, however, cannot on the record before it \ndetermine what that ongoing royalty rate should be.   \nPlaintiff contends it does not need to “demonstrate a change in the parties’ post -verdict \nbargaining position” because it “has not asked for an upward departure from the jury award.”  (D.I.  318 at 7).  In other words, Plaintiff argues that if the Court agrees to issue an ongoing royalty, \nPlaintiff is  entitled to the rate awarded by the jury.  Although it is true that the jury’s awarded rate \nshould serve as a starting point for an ongoing royalty, the Court must conclude that “other considerations do not compel a departure from the jury’s assessment of the proper royalty rate.” Erfindergemeinschaft UroPep GbR v. Eli Lilly & Co., Case No. 2:15- CV-1202- WCV, 2017 WL \n3034655, at *7 (E.D. Tex. July 18, 2017).  Indeed, t he Federal Circuit has “instructed” d istrict \ncourts to consider post -verdict factors – such as “changes related to the market for the patented \nproducts” – which may indicate that the rate should differ from the jury’s rate.   Trans Ova \nGenetics, L.C. , 890 F.3d at  1297.  Therefore, because “a patentee bears the burden of proving its \ndamages by a preponderance of the evidence,” the patentee must present relevant post -verdict \nfactors which would frame the new, hypothetical negotiation.  E MC Corp. v. Zerto, Inc ., C.A. No. Case 1:19-cv-01410-MN     Document 325     Filed 09/30/24     Page 38 of 41 PageID #:\n<pageID> \n38 12-956 (GMS), 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 126908, at *3 (D. Del. Aug. 10, 2017).  Here, Plaintiff has \nfailed to present the Court with information on how circumstances have changed.  As a result , the \nCourt is ill- equipped to assess whether the jury’s awarded royalty rate would be an appropriate \nrate for the ongoing royalty and orders further briefing on this issue.  The Court will give Plaintiff \nuntil October 10, 2024, to submit papers of no more than five pages , setting forth its proposed \nongoing royalty rate and the reasoning therefor in accordance with this opinion.  Defendant must \nsubmit its answer , which shall not exceed five pages, by October 24, 2024 .  No other papers will \nbe accepted.  After receipt of the  aforementioned briefing and proper review, the Court will issue \nan appropriate O rder.   \nC. PRE -JUDGMENT INTEREST  \nUpon a finding of infringement, Plaintiff is entitled to prejudgment interest under 35 U.S.C. \n§ 284.  Sensonics, Inc. v. Aerosonic Corp., 81 F.3d 1566, 1574 (Fed. Cir. 1996).  Prejudgment interest should only be limited or denied “where the patent owner has been responsible for undue delay in prosecuting the lawsuit.”  GM Corp. v. Devex Corp., 461 U.S. 648, 657 (1983).  \nNevertheless, “the withholding of prejudgment interest based on delay is the exception, not the rule.”  Lummus Indus. v. D.M. & E. Corp., 862 F.2d 267, 275 (Fed. Cir. 1988).  \nDefendant argues Plaintiff is not entitled to pre -judgment interest because “it delayed \nasserting its patents, causing damages to escalate.”  (D.I. 312 at 24).  Defendant points to meetings it had with Plaintiff in 2017, where it asserts Plaintiff could ha ve inform ed it of infringement.  ( Id.).  \nNotably, however, “to show that a delay was undue, a defendant must, at least generally, show that it was prejudiced.”  Kaufman v. Microsoft Corp., 34 F.4th 1360, 1375 (Fed. Cir. 2022).  Prejudice \nis not shown where  a defendant “merely argues that its damages are higher due to the delay in \nfiling the suit.”  MHL Custom, Inc. v. Waydoo USA, Inc., C.A. No. 21-0091- RGA, 2023 U.S. Dist. \nLEX IS 158243, at *19 (D. Del. Sept. 7, 2023).  Amazon argues that “VB Assets deprived Amazon Case 1:19-cv-01410-MN     Document 325     Filed 09/30/24     Page 39 of 41 PageID #:\n<pageID> \n39 of any meaningful opportunity to reengineer Alexa;” but, significantly, Amazon does not argue \nthat it would have  done so.  ( D.I. 312 at 25).   In fact, Amazon, in the same brief, also asserts it \n“had no reason to stop selling or redesign the accused products when VB Assets finally did file suit.”  (D.I. 312 at 17).  Therefore, the Court does not find that VB Assets’ delay was prejudicial to Amazon and shall award Plaintiff pre-judgment interest. \nTo calculate the pre- judgment interest rate, district courts are afforded “wide latitude” and \nmay use a variety of “statutory rates set by states, U.S. Treasury bill rate, and the prime rate.” Schwnedimann v. Arkwright Advanced Coating, Inc., 959 F.3d 1065, 1076 (Fed. Cir. 2020). Notably, in the District of Delaware, selecting “[t]he prime rate is by far the most common practice.”  ArcherDX, LLC v. Qiagen Sciences, LLC , C.A. No. 18- 1019 (MN), 2022 U.S. Dist. \nLEXIS 178509, at *54 (D. Del. Sept. 30, 2022).  D elaware courts “have recognized that the prime \nrate best compensate[s] a patentee for lost revenues during the period of infringement because the prime rate represents the cost of borrowing money, which is a better measure of the harm suffered as a result of the loss of the use of money over time.”  IMX , Inc. v. Lendingt ree, LLC , 469 F. Supp. \n2d 203, 227 (D. Del. 2007) (internal quotations omitted).  Neither party contests use of the prime rate.  Accordingly, the Court awards pre -judgment interest compounde d quarterly at the prime rate \napplied to the adjusted award of $40,007,600.   \nD. POST -JUDGMENT INTEREST  \n“Post -judgment interest is mandatory for damages awarded in a civil case.”  Archer DX, \nLLC, 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 178509 at *55; see also  28 U .S.C. § 1961(a) ( “Interest shall be \nallowed on any money judgment in a civil case recovered in a district court.” ).  Post-judgment \ninterest is awarded at the rate “equal to the weekly average 1 -year constant maturity Treasury yield \n. . . for the calendar week preceding the date of the judgment.”  Id.   The calendar week preceding \nthe date of judgment, November 8, 2023, was October 30 through November 3, 2023.

    "summary": "1. Summary:\nIn Bartz et al. v. Anthropic PBC, the plaintiffs, a group of authors, sued the AI company Anthropic for copyright infringement, claiming that the company had illegally used their books to train its large language model (LLM), Claude. Anthropic had accumulated a vast digital library by both purchasing and illegally downloading millions of books, using these works to train AI models. The court granted summary judgment in favor of Anthropic, finding that using the books to train the AI was transformative and constituted fair use under Section 107 of the Copyright Act, but denied such judgment for the pirated copies retained in Anthropic's central library.\n\n2. Key Legal Issue:\nThe main legal issue is whether Anthropic's use of copyrighted books to train its AI models constitutes 'fair use' under Section 107 of the Copyright Act, particularly considering the books were acquired, in part, through piracy and were used to develop a highly profitable AI service.\n\n3. Court's Holding:\nThe court held that the use of the books to train AI models was a fair use due to its transformative nature, as the AI was creating novel outputs and not directly competing with the authors' works. However, Anthropic’s retention of pirated copies for its library did not qualify as fair use, and this issue remains for trial.\n\n4. ELI5 Explanation:\nImagine Anthropic is like a giant robotic student that reads a lot of books to learn how to write like humans. This robot read a bunch of books, including ones it didn’t legally pay for, to get really good at writing text. The authors said this was unfair because the robot stole some of the books. The court agreed that teaching the robot was okay because it was making new creations with what it learned, but keeping the stolen books just sitting in a library for other uses was not okay.",

The firm also purchased copyrighted books \n(some overlapping with those acq uired from the pirate sites), tore off the bindings, scanned \nevery page, and stored them in digitized, searchable files.  Al l the foregoing was done to amass \na central library of “all the books in the world” to  retain “forever.”  Fr om this central library, \nthe AI firm selected various sets and subsets of digitized books to trai n various large language \nmodels under development to pow er its AI services.  Some of these books were written by \nplaintiff authors, who now sue for copyright infringement.  On summary judgment, the issue is \nthe extent to which any of the uses of the works in question qualify as “fair uses” under \nSection 107 of the Copyright Act.  \nSTATEMENT \nDefendant Anthropic PBC is an AI software  firm founded by form er OpenAI employees \nin January 2021.  Its core offe ring is an AI software servic e called Claude.  When a user Case 3:24-cv-05417-WHA     Document 231     Filed 06/23/25     Page 1 of 32 \n2 1 \n2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 \n10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 United States District Court \nNorthern District of Californi a prompts Claude with text, Claude quickly res ponds with text — mimic king human reading and \nwriting.  Claude can do so because Anthropic trained Claude — or rather trained large \nlanguage models or LLMs underlying various ve rsions of Claude — using books and other \ntexts selected from a central library Anthropi c had assembled.  Claude was first released \npublicly in March 2023.  Seven succ essive versions of Claude have  been released since.  Users \nmay ask Claude some questions for free.  Demanding users and corporate clients pay to use \nClaude, generating over one billion dollars  in annual revenue (Opp. Exh. 18).   \nPlaintiffs Andrea Bartz, Charles Graeber, and Kirk Wallace Johnson are authors of books \nthat Anthropic copied from pirated and purchased  sources.  Anthropic a ssembled these copies \ninto a central library of its own, copied further various sets and subsets of those library copies \nto include in various “data mixes,” and used these mixes to train various LLMs.  Anthropic \nkept the library copies in place as a permanent,  general-purpose resource even after deciding it \nwould not use certain copies to  train LLMs or would never use them again to do so.  All of \nAnthropic’s copying was without plaintiffs’ auth orization.   \nAuthor Bartz wrote four novels Anthropic copied and used:  The Lost Night: A Novel , \nThe Herd , We Were Never Here , and The Spare Room .  Author Graeber wr ote two non-fiction \nbooks likewise at issue:  The Good Nurse: A True Story of  Medicine, Madness, and Murder , \nand The Breakthrough: Immunotherapy and the Race to Cure Cancer .  And, Author Johnson \npenned three non-fiction books also copied and used:  To Be A Friend Is Fatal: The Fight to \nSave the Iraqis America Left Behind , The Feather Thief: Beauty, Obsession, and the Natural \nHistory Heist of the Century , and The Fishermen and the Dragon:  Fear, Greed, and a Fight \nfor Justice on the Gulf Coast .  Plaintiffs Bartz Inc. and MJ + KJ  Inc. are corporate entities that \nAuthor Bartz and Author Johnson respectively se t up to market their works.  Between them, \nthese five plaintiffs (“Aut hors”) own all the copyrights in  the above-listed works.   \nFrom the start, Anthropic “ha[d] many places  from which” it could have purchased \nbooks, but it preferred to steal them to avoid “l egal/practice/business sl og,” as cofounder and \nchief executive officer Dario Amodei put it ( see Opp. Exh. 27).  So, in January or February \n2021, another Anthropic cofounder, Ben Mann, downloaded Books3, an online library of Case 3:24-cv-05417-WHA     Document 231     Filed 06/23/25     Page 2 of 32 \n3 1 \n2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 \n10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 United States District Court \nNorthern District of Californi a 196,640 books that he knew had been assembled from unauthorized copi es of copyrighted \nbooks — that is, pirated.  Anthropic’s next  pirated acquisitions involved downloading \ndistributed, reshared copies of other pirate libraries.  In June 2021, Mann downloaded in this \nway at least five million copies  of books from Library Genesis, or LibGen, which he knew had \nbeen pirated.  And, in July 2022, Anthropic likew ise downloaded at least two million copies of \nbooks from the Pirate Library Mirror, or PiLi Mi, which Anthropic knew had been pirated \n(Opp. Exh. 6 at 4; Opp. Expert Zhao ¶¶ 17–29; see Class Cert. (“CC”) Opp. Expert Iyyer \n¶¶ 45–46).  Although what was downloaded and later duplicated from these sources was \nsometimes referred to as data or datasets, at bottom they contained full-text “ebooks or scans of \nbooks” saved in individual files in formats like .pdf , .txt, and .epub ( see, e.g. , Opp. Exh. 12 at -\n0391318).  For Books3, most filenames identified  the book inside.  For LibGen and PiLiMi, \nAnthropic downloaded a separate catalog of bi bliographic metadata fo r each collection, with \nfields like title, author, and ISBN ( see, e.g. , ibid.; Opp. Exh. 16 -0533972–73).  Anthropic \nthereby pirated over seven million copies of books, including copi es of at least two works at \nissue for each Author.1   \nAs Anthropic trained successive LLMs, it became convinced that using books was the \nmost cost-effective means to achieve a world-class LLM.  During this time, however, Anthropic became “not so gung ho about” traini ng on pirated books “for  legal reasons” (Opp. \nExh. 19).  It kept them anyway ( e.g., Opp. Exh. 17 at 93–94; CC Opp. Exh. 35 at -0273474).   \nTo find a new way to get books, in February 2024, Anthropic hired the former head of \npartnerships for Google’s book-s canning project, Tom Turvey.  He was tasked with obtaining \n“all the books in the world” while still avoidi ng as much “legal/practice/business slog” as \n \n1  Specifically, those works were ( see Opp. Expert Zhao ¶ 36; CC Br . Expert Zhao ¶ 66):   \n Author Bartz’s The Herd (five copies total) (i n LibGen and PiLiMi); \n Author Bartz’s The Lost Night  (three copies total) (in B ooks3, LibGen, and PiLiMi);  \n Author Graeber’s The Breakthrough (four copies) (in Books3, LibGen, and PiLiMi); \n Author Graeber’s The Good Nurse (five copies total) (i n Books3 and LibGen); \n Author Johnson’s To Be A Friend Is Fatal (one copy) (in Books3); and \n Author Johnson’s The Feather Thief  (four copies total) (i n Books3, LibGen, PiLiMi). \nSome evidence suggests Anthropic downloaded s till more copies before culling empty files, \nduplicates, and so on to reach the numbers kept  in the central library and counted here.

So, in spring 2024, Turvey sent an email or two to major \npublishers to inquire into licensing books fo r training AI.  Had Turvey kept up those \nconversations, he might have reached agreemen ts to license copies  for AI training from \npublishers — just as another major technology company soon di d with one ma jor publisher \n(e.g., Opp. Expert Malackowski ¶¶ 50, 64).  But Tu rvey let those conversations wither.   \nInstead, Turvey and his team emailed majo r book distributors and retailers about bulk-\npurchasing their print copies fo r the AI firm’s “research lib rary” (Opp. Exh. 22 at 145; Opp. \nExh. 31 at -035589).  Anthropic spent many millions  of dollars to purchase millions of print \nbooks, often in used condition.  Then, its serv ice providers stripped the books from their \nbindings, cut their pages to size, and scanned the books into digital fo rm — discarding the \npaper originals.  Each print book resulted in a PDF copy containing images of the scanned \npages with machine-readable te xt (including front and back c over scans for softcover books).  \nAnthropic created its own catalog of bibliographic metadata fo r the books it was acquiring.  It \nacquired copies of millions of  books, including of all work s at issue for all Authors.2   \nAnthropic may have copied por tions of Authors’ books on ot her occasions, too — such \nas while copying book reviews, academic papers, in ternet blogposts, or th e like for its central \nlibrary.  And, Anthropic’s scanning service prov iders may have copied Authors’ print books \nalong the way to delivering the final digital copi es to Anthropic.  But neither side here \nspecifically raises legal issues implicated by any such copies.  Nor will this order. \nFrom all the above sources, Anthropic cr eated a general “research library” or \n“generalized data area.”  What was this for?  As Turvey said, this was a “way of creating \ninformation that would be volum inous and that we would use fo r research,” or otherwise to \n \n2   In other words, within the scanned books we re one or more copies of the following works: \n Author Bartz’s The Herd ; \n Author Bartz’s The Lost Night ; \n Author Bartz’s We Were Never Here ; \n Author Bartz’s The Spare Room ; \n Author Graeber’s The Breakthrough ; \n Author Graeber’s The Good Nurse ; \n Author Johnson’s To Be A Friend Is Fatal ;  \n Author Johnson’s The Feather Thief ; and, \n Author Johnson’s The Fishermen . Case 3:24-cv-05417-WHA     Document 231     Filed 06/23/25     Page 4 of 32 \n5 1 \n2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 \n10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 United States District Court \nNorthern District of Californi a “inform our — our products” (Opp. Exh. 22  at 145–46, 194).  The copies  were kept in the \noriginal “version of the underl ying” book files Anthropic had “ obtained or created,” that is, \npirated or scanned (Opp. Exh. 30 at 3, 4).  Anthro pic planned to “store everything forever; we \nmight separate out books into categories[, but t]here [wa]s no compelling reason to delete a \nbook” — even if not used for training LLMs.  Ov er time, Anthropic inve sted in building more \ntools for searching its “general  purpose” library and for accessi ng books or sets of books for \nfurther uses ( see CC Br. Exh. 12 at -0144509; CC Reply Exh. 45 at -0365931–32, -0365939–\n42 (reviewing and seeking to  improve “[w]hat [ ] researchers do  today if they want to search \nfor a book,” including improving bibl iographic metadata and conso lidating varied resources)). \nOne further use  was training LLMs.  As a prelimina ry step towards training, engineers \nbrowsed books and bibliographic metadata to lear n what languages the books were written in, \nwhat subjects they concerned, whether they we re by famous authors or not, and so on — \nsometimes by “open[ing] any of the books” and sometimes using software .  From the library \ncopies, engineers copied the sets or subsets of books they believed  best for training and \n“iterate[d]” on those selections over time.  For instan ce, two different subsets of print-sourced \nbooks were included in “data mixe s” for training two different LL Ms.  Each was just a fraction \nof all the print-sourced books.  Similarly, differen t sets or “subsets” or “parts of” or “portions” \nof the collections sourced from Books3, LibGen, and PiLiMi we re used to train different \nLLMs.  Anthropic analyzed the consequences  of using more books, fewer books, different \nbooks.  The goal was to improve the “data mix “ to improve each LLM and, ultimately, \nClaude’s performance for paying customers.3     \n \n3   (See, e.g. , Opp. Exh. 12 at -0391318 (engineers were  able to “open any of the books”); CC \nReply Exh. 45 at -0365941 (some engineers “want[ed ] to search for a book”  and get its “scanned \nbook file[ ]”); Opp. Exh. 30 at 3 (made copies of “each such dataset or portions thereof” for \ntraining); Opp. Exh. 6 at 3–4 (trained  on “portions of datasets,” w ith at least two such portions \nfrom LibGen and four from PiLiMi); Opp. E xpert Zhao ¶¶ 27–28, 30–31 (plus two more from \nPiLiMi, and at least three from scanned books);  CC Opp. Exh. 35 at -0273477–82 (tested subsets \nof pirated and purchased-and-sca nned books to see consequences fo r training); CC Br.

Case 3:24-cv-05417-WHA     Document 231     Filed 06/23/25     Page 5 of 32 \n6 1 \n2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 \n10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 United States District Court \nNorthern District of Californi a Over time, Anthropic came to value most highly for its data mixes books like the ones \nAuthors had written, and it valued them because of the creative expressions they contained.  \nClaude’s customers wanted Claude  to write as accurately and as  compellingly as Authors.  So, \nit was best to train the LLMs underlying Claude  on works just like the ones Authors had \nwritten, with well-curated facts, well-org anized analyses, and captivating fictional \nnarratives — above all with “good writing” of  the kind “an editor would approve of” (Opp. \nExh. 3 at -03433).  Anthropic could have trai ned its LLMs without using such books or any \nbooks at all.  That would have required sp ending more on, say, staff writers to create \ncompeting exemplars of good writin g, engineers to revise bad ex emplars into better ones, \nenergy bills to power more r ounds of training and fine-tuning, and so on.  Having canonical \ntexts to draw upon helped ( e.g., Opp. Expert Zhao ¶ 81). \nEach work selected for training any given LLM  was copied in four main ways — and in \nfact so many times that Anthropic admits it would be impractical even to estimate.   \nFirst , each work selected was copied from the ce ntral library to create a working copy for \nthe training set.   \nSecond , each work was cleaned to remove a sm all amount of lower-v alued or repeating \ntext (like headers, footers, or  page numbers), with a “cleaned”  copy resulting.  If the same book \nappeared twice, or if while looking across the entire provisional traini ng set it became clear \nthere was some other reason to cull a book or cat egory, Anthropic had the capability to delete \nrelevant copy(ies) from the set at this step ( see CC Br. Expert Zhao ¶¶ 71–72).   \nThird , each cleaned copy was translated into  a “tokenized” copy.  Some words were \n“stemmed” or “lemmati zed” into simpler forms (e.g., “stu dying” to “study”).  And, all \ncharacters were grouped into  short sequences and translated into corresponding number \nsequences or “tokens” according to an Anthropi c-made dictionary.  Th e resulting tokenized \ncopies were then copied repeat edly during training.  By one acc ount, this process involved the \niterative, trial-and-error discove ry of contingent statistical relationships between each word \nfragment and all other word fragments both with in any work and across trillions of word Case 3:24-cv-05417-WHA     Document 231     Filed 06/23/25     Page 6 of 32 \n7 1 \n2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 \n10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 United States District Court \nNorthern District of Californi a fragments from other copied books , copied websites, and the like.   Other steps in training are \nnot at issue here ( id. ¶¶ 73–76; see Opp. Expert Zhao ¶ 38 & n.6).   \nFourth , each fully trained LLM itself retained “compressed” copies of the works it had \ntrained upon, or so Authors cont end and this order takes for gr anted.  In essence, each LLM’s \nmapping of contingent relationshi ps was so complete it mapped or indeed simply “memorized” \nthe works it trained upon almost verbatim.  So, if each completed LLM had been asked to \nrecite works it had trained upon, it could have done so ( e.g., Opp. Expert Zhao ¶ 74).  Further \nsteps refining the LLM are not at issue here. \nHowever, that was as far as the training c opies propagated toward s the outside world.  \nWhen each LLM was put into a public-facing vers ion of Claude, it was complemented by other \nsoftware that filtered user i nputs to the LLM and filtered ou tputs from the LLM back to the \nuser ( id. ¶¶ 75–77).  As a result, Aut hors do not allege that any infringing copy of their works \nwas or would ever be provided to users by the Cl aude service.  Yes, Claude could help less \ncapable writers create works as well-written as Au thors’ and competing in the same categories.  \nBut Claude created no exact copy, nor any subs tantial knock-off.  No thing traceable to \nAuthors’ works.  Such allegations are simply no t part of plaintiffs’ amended complaint, nor in \nour record.   \nNeither side puts directly at issue any copies of any works that might  have been used for \nthe filtering software.  Nor will this order. \nIn sum , the copies of books pirated or purchas ed-and-destructively-scanned were placed \ninto a central “research library” or “generalized data area,” sets or subsets were copied again to \ncreate training copies for data mixes, the trai ning copies were successively copied to be \ncleaned, tokenized, and compressed into any gi ven trained LLM, and once trained an LLM did \nnot output through Claude to the public any furt her copies.  Finally, once Anthropic decided a \ncopy of a pirated or scanned book in the library w ould not be used for tr aining at all or ever \nagain, Anthropic still retained that work as a “har d resource” for other uses or future uses.  At \nleast one work from each Author was present in every phase described above.   \n*  *  * Case 3:24-cv-05417-WHA     Document 231     Filed 06/23/25     Page 7 of 32 \n8 1 \n2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 \n10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 United States District Court \nNorthern District of Californi a In August 2024, the three i ndividual authors brought th is putative class action \ncomplaining that Anthropic had infringed its fe deral copyrights by pira ting copies for its \nlibrary and by reproducing them to  train its LLMs (Compl. ¶¶ 45–46, 71; see Amd. Compl. \n¶¶ 47–48, 75).  In October 2024, a scheduling or der required that any motion for class \ncertification be brought by Ma rch 6, 2025 (Dkt. No. 49).   \nThe individual authors soon amended their co mplaint to include af filiated corporate \nentities as named plaintiffs, with consent.  A nd, Anthropic chose not to move to dismiss the \namended complaint, as it earlier had planned ( see Dkt. No. 37).  Instead, Anthropic moved to \nallow an early motion for summ ary judgment on fair use, even  before class certification \n(Dkt. No. 88; see Feb. 25, 2025 Tr. 15).  Permission was granted.  \nAnthropic now moves for summary judgment on  fair use only.  Fair use is a legal \nquestion for the judge with underl ying fact questions, if any, fo r the jury.  To prevail on \nsummary judgment, Anthropic must  rely on undisputed facts and/or  factual inferences favoring \nthe opposing side.  Anthropic t hus bears the burdens of prod uction and persuasion in this \nmotion.  See Google LLC v. Oracle Am., Inc. , 593 U.S. 1, 23–24 (2021); Andy Warhol Found. \nfor the Visual Arts, Inc. v. Goldsmith , 598 U.S. 508, 547 n.21 (2023); Campbell v. Acuff-Rose \nMusic, Inc. , 510 U.S. 569, 590 & n.20, 594 (1994); see also Nissan Fire & Marine Ins. Co. v. \nFritz Cos. , 210 F.3d 1099, 1102–03 (9th Cir. 2000). \nNotably, in its motion, Anthropic argues that pirating initial copies of Authors’ books and \nmillions of other books was justified because a ll those copies were at least reasonably \nnecessary for training LLMs — and yet Anthropic has resisted putting into the record what \ncopies or even sets of copies were in fact used for training LLMs.  For example, at oral \nargument, Anthropic asserted that  if a purported fair us er had retained pirated copies for uses \nbeyond the fair use, then her piracy would not be excused by the fair use (Tr. 53, 56).  But \nwhen Authors earlier interrogate d Anthropic in discovery abou t what library copies (the \noriginal copies “obtained or cr eated” by Anthropic) Anthropic had recopied for further uses, \nAnthropic responded that providing informati on about any copies made for uses beyond \ntraining commercially released LLMs would be ove rbroad, and that it coul d not count up all its Case 3:24-cv-05417-WHA     Document 231     Filed 06/23/25     Page 8 of 32 \n9 1 \n2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 \n10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 United States District Court \nNorthern District of Californi a copying even for LLMs in any case ( e.g., Opp Exh. 30 at 3).  We know that Anthropic has \nmore information about what it in fact copied  for training LLMs (or not).  Anthropic earlier \nproduced a spreadsheet that showed the composition of various data mixes used for training \nvarious LLMs — yet it clawed back that spread sheet in April (Opp. Fredricks Decl. ¶¶ 2–3).  A \ndiscovery dispute regarding that spreadsheet re mains pending.  But Anthropic did not need a \ncourt order to offer up what it possessed in support  of its motion.  All defi ciencies must be held \nagainst Anthropic and no t the other way around.   \nThis is the first substantive order in this  case.  A contemporaneous motion for class \ncertification remains pending.  It  proposes one class related to works that were pirated \n(whether or not used to train LLMs), and a second class related to works that were purchased, \nscanned, and used in training LLMs.  This  order follows full br iefing, a hearing, and \nsupplemental briefing. \nTo summarize the analysis that now follows, the use of the books  at issue to train Claude \nand its precursors was exceedingly transformative and was a fair use under Section 107 of the Copyright Act.  And, the digiti zation of the books purchased in  print form by Anthropic was \nalso a fair use but not for the same reason as applies to the training co pies.  Instead, it was a \nfair use because all Anthropic did was replace th e print copies it had pu rchased for its central \nlibrary with more convenient space-saving and searchable digital copies for its central \nlibrary — without adding new c opies, creating new works, or re distributing existing copies.  \nHowever, Anthropic had no entitlement to use pira ted copies for its cent ral library.  Creating a \npermanent, general-purpose libra ry was not itself a fair use ex cusing Anthropic’s piracy.   \nANALYSIS \nSection 107 of the Copyright Ac t identifies four factors for determining whether a given \nuse of a copyrighted work is a fair use: \n \n[T]he fair use of a copyrighted work . . . for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporti ng, teaching (including multiple \ncopies for classroom use), scholar ship, or research, is not an \ninfringement of copyright.  In determining whether the use made \nof a work in any particular case is a fair use the factors to be \nconsidered shall include —   Case 3:24-cv-05417-WHA     Document 231     Filed 06/23/25     Page 9 of 32 \n10 1 \n2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 \n10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 United States District Court \nNorthern District of Californi a  \n(1) the purpose and character of the use, including whether such \nuse is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational \npurposes; \n(2) the nature of the copyrighted work; (3) the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to \nthe copyrighted work as a whole; and  \n(4) the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of \nthe copyrighted work.  \nThese factors presuppose a “use.”  So, at th e threshold, a court must decide whether a \n“copyrighted [work] has been used in multiple ways,” then evaluate each.  Warhol , 598 U.S. at \n533.  Uses do not turn on “the subjective intent of the user” but on “an objective inquiry into \nwhat use was made, i.e., what the user d[id] with  the original work.”  Id. at 544–45.  A “use” \nshould be construed narrowly enough to not “swa llow” distinguishable infringing uses, much \nless categories of exclusive rights  in toto .  Id. at 541, 543 n.18, 546–48.  Sometimes, the \nchallenged copying involves just one use:  In Perfect 10, Inc. v. Amazon.com, Inc. , Google \nvisited websites having full-sized  images, made only reduced-si zed copies, and incorporated \nthose directly into its search e ngine — the sole use of the thum bnails being as “pointer[s]” to \nthe images themselves.  508 F.3d 1146, 1157, 1160, 1165 (9th Cir. 2007).  Sometimes, the \ncopying involves many uses:  In the Google Books cases, Google borrowed books from \nlibraries, made both full-image a nd text-only copies, and incorpor ated different copies into \ndifferent tools — one use bei ng to reveal information “ about those books ,” another use being \nto provide the books to print-disabled patrons, and still another being to back up the print \nbooks if lost.  Authors Guild v. Google, Inc. , 804 F.3d 202, 217 (2d Cir. 2015) (quoted); \nAuthors Guild, Inc. v. HathiTrust , 755 F.3d 87, 97, 101, 103 (2d Cir. 2014) (other cited uses).   \nOur parties debate an instructive decision.  In American Geophysical Union v. Texaco \nInc., Texaco employees used scient ific articles in a central library, used copies of them in \npersonal desk libraries, and used selected copies  again in the scientific laboratory — the first \nuse paid for, the second infringing, and the third pl ausibly fair but in fact  a rare occurrence.  \n802 F. Supp. 1, 4–5, 14 (S.D.N.Y. 1992) (Judge Pierre Leval), aff’d , 60 F.3d 913, 918–19, 926 \n(2d Cir. 1994).   Case 3:24-cv-05417-WHA     Document 231     Filed 06/23/25     Page 10 of 32 \n11 1 \n2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 \n10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 United States District Court \nNorthern District of Californi a Here, our parties contest what use or uses ar e at issue.  Anthropic contends it copied \nAuthors’ books only for one use:  Only to train LLMs.  By contrast , Authors contend it did so \nfor at least two uses:  First to build a vast, central library of  potentially useful content, and \nsecond to train specific LLMs using shifting sets and subsets of that content — over time \nselecting the more well-organ ized and well-expressed works for training.  Authors also \ncomplain that the print-to-digital format change  was itself an infringeme nt not abridged as a \nfair use (Opp. 15, 25).  Authors do not allege , however, that any LLM outputs infringing upon \ntheir works ever reached users of th e public-facing Claude service.   \nThis order addresses each of th e four factors in turn, pointi ng out how each applies to the \ntraining copies and to the purchased  and pirated library copies.  It  concludes with an integrated \nanalysis.   \n1. THE PURPOSE AND CHARACTER OF THE USE. \nFor a given use at issue, the fi rst factor addresses “the purpose and character of th[at] use, \nincluding whether [it] is of a co mmercial nature or is for nonpr ofit educational purposes.”  17 \nU.S.C. § 107(1). \nA. THE COPIES USED TO TRAIN SPECIFIC LLM S. \nAll agree that one use at issue was training LLM s to receive text inputs and return text \noutputs.  More specifically, Anth ropic used copies of Authors’ copyrighted works to iteratively \nmap statistical relationships between every text -fragment and every sequ ence of text-fragments \nso that a completed LLM could receive new text i nputs and return new text outputs as if it were \na human reading prompts and writing responses.  Authors further argue — and this order takes \nfor granted — that such trai ning entailed “memoriz[ing]” work s by “compress[ing]” copies of \nthose works into the LLM (Opp. 16–17; see Opp. Expert Zhao ¶ 74).  The LLMs “memorize[d] \nA LOT, like A LOT” (Opp. Exh. 35 at -029109).  Re gardless, the “purpose and character” of \nusing works to train LLMs was tran sformative — spectacularly so. \nTo repeat and be clear:  Au thors do not allege that any LLM output provided to users \ninfringed upon Authors’ works.  Our record s hows the opposite.  Users interacted only with the \nClaude service, which placed additional softwa re between the user and the underlying LLM to Case 3:24-cv-05417-WHA     Document 231     Filed 06/23/25     Page 11 of 32 \n12 1 \n2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 \n10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 United States District Court \nNorthern District of Californi a ensure that no infringing output ever reached th e users.  This was akin to the limits Google \nimposed on how many snippets of text from any one book could be seen by any one user \nthrough its Google Books service, preventing its sear ch tool from devolving into a reading tool.  \nGoogle , 804 F.2d at 222.  Here, if the outputs s een by users had been infringing, Authors \nwould have a different case.  And, if the outpu ts were ever to beco me infringing, Authors \ncould bring such a case.  But that is not this case.   \nInstead, Authors challenge only the inputs, not the outputs, of these LLMs.  They point to \nthe fully trained LLMs and the Claude service only to shed light on how training itself uses \ncopies of their works and the ways the Claude service could be used to produce still other works that would compete with their works.  This order does the same.  Authors’ arguments \nthat the training use is not transformative ar e unavailing.  \nFirst , Authors argue that using works to tr ain Claude’s underlying LLMs was like using \nworks to train any person to r ead and write, so Aut hors should be able to exclude Anthropic \nfrom this use (Opp. 16).  But Authors cannot righ tly exclude anyone from using their works for \ntraining or learning as su ch.  Everyone reads texts, too, then  writes new texts.  They may need \nto pay for getting their hands on a text in the first instance.  But to make anyone pay \nspecifically for the use of a book each time they r ead it, each time they  recall it from memory, \neach time they later draw upon it when writing new things in ne w ways would be unthinkable.  \nFor centuries, we have read and re-read books.  We have admired, memori zed, and internalized \ntheir sweeping themes, their substantive points, a nd their stylistic solutions to recurring writing \nproblems.   \nSecond , to that last point, Authors further ar gue that the training was intended to \nmemorize their works’ creative elements — not just thei r works’ non-protectable ones (Opp. \n17).  But this is the same argument.  Agai n, Anthropic’s LLMs have not reproduced to the \npublic a given work’s creative elements, nor even  one author’s identifi able expressive style \n(assuming arguendo that these are even copyrightab le).  Yes, Claude has outputted grammar, \ncomposition, and style that the underlying LLM distilled from thousands of works.  But if \nsomeone were to read all the modern-day clas sics because of their exceptional expression, Case 3:24-cv-05417-WHA     Document 231     Filed 06/23/25     Page 12 of 32 \n13 1 \n2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 \n10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 United States District Court \nNorthern District of Californi a memorize them, and then emulat e a blend of their best writ ing, would that violate the \nCopyright Act?  Of course not.  Copyright does not extend to “m ethod[s] of operation, \nconcept[s], [or] principle[s]” “i llustrated[ ] or embodied in [a ] work.”  17 U.S.C. § 102(b); see, \ne.g., Nichols v. Universal Pictures Corp. , 45 F.2d 119, 120–22 (2d Cir. 1930) (Judge Learned \nHand) (stage properties a nd storytelling elements); Apple Comput., Inc. v. Microsoft Corp. , 35 \nF.3d 1435, 1445 (9th Cir. 1994) (“user-friendl y” design principles  and elements); Swirsky v. \nCarey , 376 F.3d 841, 848 (9th Cir. 2004) (music theo ry principles and ch ord progressions).  \nThird , Authors next argue that computers noneth eless should not be allowed to do what \npeople do.  \nAuthors cite a decision seemi ng to say as much (Opp. 16–17).  But the judge there twice \nemphasized while discussing “purpos e and character” of the use th at what was tr ained was “not \ngenerative AI (AI that writes new content its elf).”  Rather, what was trained — using a \nproprietary system for finding court opinions in response to a given legal topic — was a \ncompeting AI tool for finding cour t opinions in response to a give n legal topic.  That was not \ntransformative.  Thomson Reuters Enter. Cent re GmbH v. Ross Intell. Inc. , 765 F. Supp. 3d \n382, 398 (D. Del. 2025) (Judge Stephanos Bibas), appeal docketed , No. 25-8018 (3d Cir. Apr. \n14, 2025). \nA better analogue to our facts would be an AI tool trained — us ing court opinions, and \nbriefs, law review articles, and the like — to receive legal prompts and respond with fresh legal \nwriting.  And, on facts much like those, a differen t court came out the ot her way.  It found fair \nuse.  White v. W. Pub. Corp. , 29 F. Supp. 3d 396, 400 (S.D.N.Y. 2014) (Judge Jed Rakoff). \nThe latter use stood sufficiently “orthogona l” to anything that any copyright owner \nrightly could expect to control.  See Warhol , 598 U.S. at 538–40.  It could thus be freed up for \nthe copyist to use, “promot[ing] th e progress of science and the arts, without  diminishing the \nincentive to create.”  Id. at 531 (emphasis added); see U.S.  CONST . art. I, § 8, cl. 8 .       \nIn short, the purpose and character of using copyrighted works to train LLMs to generate \nnew text was quintessentially transformative.  Like any reader aspi ring to be a writer, \nAnthropic’s LLMs trained upon works not to race ahead and replicate or supplant them — but Case 3:24-cv-05417-WHA     Document 231     Filed 06/23/25     Page 13 of 32 \n14 1 \n2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 \n10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 United States District Court \nNorthern District of Californi a to turn a hard corner and create something different.  If this trai ning process reasonably \nrequired making copies within the LLM or ot herwise, those copies  were engaged in a \ntransformative use. \nThe first factor favors  fair use for the training copies. \nB. THE COPIES USED TO BUILD A CENTRAL LIBRARY . \nBut that is not the only use at issue.  R ecall that Anthropic purchased millions of print \nbooks for its central library and pirated millions of  digital books for its central library, too.  It \nused specific sets and subsets of  books for training specific LLMs.  And, it then retained all the \ncopies in its central library fo r other uses that might arise even after deciding it would not use \nthem to train any LLM (at all or ever again) .  Anthropic seems to believe that because some of \nthe works it copied were sometimes used in tr aining LLMs, Anthropic wa s entitled to take for \nfree all the works in the world and keep them fo rever with no further accounting.  There is no \ncarveout, however, from the Copyrig ht Act for AI companies.   \nBecause the legal issues di ffer between the library copies Anthropic purchased and \npirated, this order take s them in turn.   \n(i) The Purchased Library Copies Con verted from Print to Digital. \nAnthropic purchased  millions of print copies to “bu ild a research library” (Opp. Exh. 22 \nat 145, 148).  It destroyed each print copy while re placing it with a digital copy for use in its \nlibrary (not for sharing nor sale outside the company).  As to thes e copies, Authors do not \ncomplain that Anthropic failed to pay to acqui re a library copy.  Aut hors only complain that \nAnthropic changed each copy’s format from print to digital ( see Opp. 15, 25 & n.14).  On the \nfacts here, that format cha nge itself added no new copies , eased storage and enabled \nsearchability, and was not done for purposes trenching upon the copyright owner’s rightful \ninterests — it was transformative. \nAnthropic purchased its print copies fair  and square.  With each purchase came \nentitlement for Anthropic to “d ispose[ ]” each copy as it saw fit.  17 U.S.C. § 109(a).  So, \nAnthropic was entitled to keep the copies in its central library for all th e ordinary uses.  Yes, Case 3:24-cv-05417-WHA     Document 231     Filed 06/23/25     Page 14 of 32 \n15 1 \n2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 \n10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 United States District Court \nNorthern District of Californi a Anthropic changed the format of these library copies from print to digital — giving rise to the \nissue here.   \nAll agree on the facts of  the format change.  Anthropic “destructively scan[ned]” the \nprint copies to create the digi tal ones.  Anthropic or its vendor s stripped the bindings from the \nprint books, cut the pages to workable dimensio ns, and scanned those pages — discarding each \nprint copy while creating a digital one in its pl ace.  The digital copy was then housed in the \n“research library” or “generalized data ar ea” in place of the print copy (Opp. Exh. 22 at 145–\n46, 193–94).  Authors do not allege and our record  does not show that Anthropic provided its \nconverted digital copies of print boo ks to anyone outside Anthropic.   \nThe parties disagree about the legal consequences of the format change .  Was scanning \nthe print copies to create digi tal replacements transformative?  Anthropic argues it was because \nit was reasonably necessary to training LLMs.  Authors argue it was a distinguishable step \nrequiring independent ju stification.      \nHere , for reasons narrower than Anthropic offers, th e mere format change was a fair use.    \nStorage and searchability are not creative pr operties of the copyrighted work itself but \nphysical properties of the frame around the work or informational properties about  the work.  \nSee Texaco , 802 F. Supp. at 14 (physical), aff’d , 60 F.3d at 919; Google , 804 F.3d at 225 \n(informational); Sony Corp. of Am. v. Universal City Studios, Inc.  (“Sony Betamax ”), 464 U.S. \n417, 447 (1984) (rightful interests).  In Texaco , the court reasoned that if a purchased scientific \njournal article had been copied  “onto microfilm to conserve sp ace, this might [have been] a \npersuasive transformative use.”  802 F. Supp. at 14 (Judge Pierre Leval), aff’d , 60 F.3d at 919 \n(reducing “bulk[ ]” “might  suffice to tilt the firs t fair use factor in fa vor of Texaco if these \npurposes were dominant“).  In Google Books , the court reasoned that a print-to-digital change \nto expose information about th e work was transformative.  Google , 804 F.3d at 225 (Judge \nPierre Leval).  And, in Sony Betamax , the Supreme Court held that making a recording of a \ntelevision show in order to instead watch it at a later time was copyi ng but did not usurp any \nrightful interest of the copyri ght owner.  464 U.S. at 447, 455.  Important to the Supreme \nCourt’s reasoning was the expect ation that most such copier s would not distribute the Case 3:24-cv-05417-WHA     Document 231     Filed 06/23/25     Page 15 of 32 \n16 1 \n2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 \n10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 United States District Court \nNorthern District of Californi a permanent copies of th e work.  Finally, in A&M Records, Inc. v. Napster, Inc. , our court of \nappeals recognized the reasoning just explained, and therefor e rejected by contrast a \ndigitization effort that was touted  as space-shifting but in fact re sulted in the multiplication of \ncopies shared with outsiders through a file -sharing service.  239 F.3d 1004, 1019 (9th Cir. \n2001), aff’g in this part 114 F. Supp. 2d 896, 912–13, 915–16 (N.D. Cal. 2000) (Judge Marilyn \nHall Patel) (citing Sony Betamax and Texaco ).   \nHere, every purchased print copy was copied in order to save storage space and to enable \nsearchability as a digital copy.  The print origin al was destroyed.  One replaced the other.  And, \nthere is no evidence that the new,  digital copy was shown, shared, or sold outside the company.  \nThis use was even more clearl y transformative than those in Texaco , Google , and Sony \nBetamax (where the number of copies went up by  at least one), a nd, of course, more \ntransformative than those uses rejected in Napster (where the number went up by “millions” of \ncopies shared for free with others).  \nYes, Anthropic is a commercial outfit.  And, th is order takes for gran ted that Anthropic in \nfact benefited from the print-to-d igital format change  — or it would not have gone to all the \ntrouble.  But the crux of the first fair use factor ’s concern for “commercial ” use is in protecting \nthe copyright owners and their entitlements to ex ploit their copyright as they see fit (or not).  \nSee, e.g. , Harper & Row, Publishers, Inc. v. Nation Enters. , 471 U.S. 539, 562 (1985).  That \nthe accused is a commercial entity is indicative, not dispositive.  That the accused stands to \nbenefit is likewise indicative.  But what matters  most is whether the fo rmat change exploits \nanything the Copyright Act reserv es to the copyright owner.  Anthropic already had purchased \npermanent library copies (print ones).  It did no t create new copies to share or sell outside.   \nYes, Authors also might have wished to char ge Anthropic more for digital than for print \ncopies.  And, this order takes for granted that  Authors could have succeeded if Anthropic had \nbeen barred from the format change.  “But th e Constitution’s language [in Clause 8] nowhere \nsuggests that [the copyright ow ner’s] limited exclusive right shoul d include a right to divide \nmarkets or a concomitant right to charge different purchasers different prices for the same \nbook, [merely] say to increas e or to maximize gain.”  See Kirtsaeng v. John Wiley & Sons, Case 3:24-cv-05417-WHA     Document 231     Filed 06/23/25     Page 16 of 32 \n17 1 \n2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 \n10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 United States District Court \nNorthern District of Californi a Inc., 568 U.S. 519, 552 (2013); see also U.S.  CONST . art. I., § 8, cl. 8.  Nor does the Copyright \nAct itself.  Section 106 sets out exclusive right s that fair uses under Section 107 abridge.  \nSection 106(1) reserves to the copyright owner the right to ma ke reproductions.  But on our \nfacts we face the unusual situation where one copy entirely replaced the another.  And, \nSection 106(2) reserves to the c opyright owner the righ t to make derivative works that add or \nsubtract creative material — as occurs in a “translation, musical arra ngement, dramatization, \nfictionalization, motion picture version, sound recording, art reproduction, abridgment, [or] \ncondensation” of a book, 17 U.S.C.  § 101 (definitions).  For some “o ther modification[ ]” of a \nbook to constitute a “derivative work,” it must  itself “represent an  original work of \nauthorship.”  Ibid.  But on our facts the format was changed but no content was added or \nsubtracted.  See Mirage Editions, Inc. v. Albuquerque A.R.T. Co. , 856 F.2d 1341, 1342, 1343–\n44 (9th Cir. 1988) (yes where elements added to create ne w decorative ceramic).4  \nSection 106(3) further reserves to  the copyright owner the right to distribute copies.  But again, \nthe replacement copy here was kept in the central library, not distributed.  Cf. Fox News \nNetwork, LLC v. TVEyes, Inc. , 883 F.3d 169, 176–78 (2d Cir. 2018) (enabling searching for \n“information about the material” can  be transformative use, even if some distribution results);  \nLewis Galoob Toys, Inc. v. Nintendo of Am., Inc. , 964 F.2d 965, 968, 971 (9th Cir. 1992) \n(using nifty converter to “merel y enhance[ ]” audiovisual di splays emitted from purchased \nvideogame cartridge was fair us e of those displays partly because no surplus copies of \ncartridge or displays were ever created). \nAs a result , Anthropic’s format-change from print libra ry copies to digital library copies \nwas transformative under fair use factor one.  Anthropic was entitled to retain a copy of these \nworks in a print format.  It retained them in stead in a digital form at, easing storage and \n \n4   Even if print-to-digital format change did infringe the right to prepare derivative works, \nAuthors have conceded that “Plaintiffs’ infr ingement claims are pr edicated on Anthropic’s \nunauthorized reproduction (17 U.S.C. § 106(1)); Plaintiffs are not alleging infringement by \nAnthropic of any right to prepare derivative works ( id. at § 106(2))” (Dkt. No. 203 at 2 (citations \noriginal)).  Whether this concessi on had consequence for copies tokenized and used for training or \n“compressed” into the trained LLMs is not reached by this order because Anthropic does not rely \non Authors’ concession and those copies were here used transformatively. Case 3:24-cv-05417-WHA     Document 231     Filed 06/23/25     Page 17 of 32 \n28 1 \n2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 \n10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 United States District Court \nNorthern District of Californi a  \nA. THE COPIES USED TO TRAIN SPECIFIC LLM S. \nThe copies used to train specific LLMs did not and will not displace demand for copies \nof Authors’ works, or not in the way th at counts under the Copyright Act.   \nAgain, Authors concede that tr aining LLMs did not result in any exact copies nor even \ninfringing knockoffs of their works being provided  to the public.  If that were not so, this \nwould be a different case.  Authors remain free to bring that case in th e future should such \nfacts develop.   \nInstead, Authors contend generica lly that training LLMs will result in an explosion of \nworks competing with their works — such as by creating alternative summaries of factual \nevents, alternative examples of  compelling writing about ficti onal events, and so on.  This \norder assumes that is so (Opp. 22–23 (citing, e.g.,  Opp. Exh. 38)).  But Authors’ complaint is \nno different than it would be if they compla ined that training school children to write well \nwould result in an explosion of competing works.  This is not the kind of competitive or creative displacement that conc erns the Copyright Act.  The Act seeks to advance original \nworks of authorship, not to protect  authors against competition.  Sega , 977 F.2d at 1523–24.    \nAuthors next contend that tr aining LLMs displaced (or will ) an emerging market for \nlicensing their works for the narrow purpose of trai ning LLMs (Opp. 21–22).  Anthropic \nargues that transactional costs would exceed Anthropic’s expected benefit from any such \nbargain, prompting it to cease dealing with any ri ghtsholders or else to  cease developing such \ntechnology altogether (Br. 22–23).  Our record could support either account — so this order \nmust assume Authors are correct.  A market could develop (Opp. 19–21 (citing record)).  Even \nso, such a market for that use is not one the Copyright Act entitles Au thors to exploit.   \nNone of the cases cited by Authors requires a different result.  All contemplated losses of \nsomething the Copyright Act properly protected — not the kinds of fair uses for which a \ncopyright owner cannot rightly  expect to control.  See TVEyes, Inc. , 883 F.3d at 181 (use of a \nright legally reserved to a nd factually already being li censed by copyright owner); Texaco , 60 \nF.3d 931 (same); Ringgold v.

Seltzer v. Green Day, Inc. , 725 F.3d 1170, \n1179 (9th Cir. 2013) (no evidence use could be  or “was likely to” be marketable). \nThe fourth factor thus favors  fair use for the training copies. \nB. THE COPIES USED TO BUILD A CENTRAL LIBRARY . \n(i) The Purchased Library Copies Con verted from Print to Digital. \nFor these copies, this order assumes Anthropic’s format change from print to digital \ndisplaced purchases of new dig ital copies that Anthropic woul d have made directly from \nAuthors (had it not been able to  purchase print copies in us ed condition).  But for reasons \nstated under the first factor, such losses did not relate to something the Copyright Act reserves \nfor Authors to exploit.  It  was a format change.   \nAuthors’ next argument, it seem s, is that the format cha nge nonetheless exposed it to \nusurpation of the opportunity to sell  rightful copies because Anthropic might transmit \nadditional unauthorized digital copies more r eadily than it could have transmitted additional \nunauthorized print copies — and that the same  would be true for al l format converters ( cf. Opp. \n25 n.14; Opp. Expert Malackowski ¶ 52).  But afte r much discovery, there is no inkling in our \nrecord of intent to redistribut e library copies once acquired nor of inability to secure that \nvaluable library against outside actors.  And, if the internal, central libra ry copies did or do in \nfact lead to further reproduc tion or distribution, those furthe r copies remain  redressable \nseparately by Authors.  The format change  did not itself usurp the Authors’ rightful \nentitlements. \nThis factor is thus neutral  for the purchased libra ry copies converted fro m print to digital. \n(ii) The Pirated Library Copies. \nThe copies used to build a central library and that were obtained from pirated sources \nplainly displaced demand for Authors’ books — copy for copy.  Not every person who merely \nintends to make a fair use of a work is thereby entitled to a full copy in  the meantime, nor even \nto steal a copy so that achieving this fair use is  especially simple or co st-effective.  Here, the \ncopies employed in training LLMs were one th ing, but the copies acquired to assemble a Case 3:24-cv-05417-WHA     Document 231     Filed 06/23/25     Page 29 of 32 \n30 1 \n2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 \n10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 United States District Court \nNorthern District of Californi a convenient, general-purpose library of works for various uses for which the company might \nhave of them, if any, was a different use altogether.   \nAnthropic has almost no rebuttal on these points.  First , Anthropic argues that “Claude’s \nservices do not reduce [or usurp] the value of  Plaintiffs’ works through substitution in their \ntraditional markets” ( see Br. Expert Peterson ¶ 33).  But st ealing pirated copies of Authors’ \nworks plainly did.  Second , Anthropic argues that it may have  been able to purchase some \nbooks on the open market (and some other te xts), but not other texts it copied ( cf. id.  ¶ 48 (re \nlicensing)).  But this case does not concern those other texts it could not have purchased.  It \ncould have purchased Authors’ books (and ma ny others).  In f act it later did.  Finally , \nAnthropic argues that the effect on these text s from one book foregone was too small to be \nconsidered ( see id. ¶ 77).  But the test requi res that we contemplate the likely result were the \nconduct to be condoned as a fair use — namely to steal a work you could otherwise buy (a \nbook, millions of books) so long as you at least loosel y intend to make further copies for a \npurportedly transformative use (writing a book revi ew with excerpts, training LLMs, etc.), \nwithout any accountability.  As Anthropic itself suggested, “Tha t would destroy the [entire] \npublishing market if that were the case” ( see Tr. 53; see also Tr. 32, 41; Opp. Expert \nMalackowski ¶¶ 31–34, 38). \nThe fourth factor points against fair use for the pira ted library copies. \n5. OVERALL ANALYSIS . \nAfter the four factors and any others deemed relevant are “ex plored, [ ] the results [are] \nweighed together, in light of the purposes of copyright.”  Campbell , 510 U.S. at 578. \nThe copies used to train specific LLMs were justified as a fair us e.  Every factor but the \nnature of the copyrighted work favors this re sult.  The technology at issue was among the most \ntransformative many of us will see in our lifetimes.     \nThe copies used to convert purchased print library copies into digital library copies were \njustified, too, though for a different fair use.  The first factor strongly favo rs this result, and the \nthird favors it, too.  The fourth is neutral.  Only the second slightly  disfavors it.  On balance, as Case 3:24-cv-05417-WHA     Document 231     Filed 06/23/25     Page 30 of 32 \n31 1 \n2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 \n10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 United States District Court \nNorthern District of Californi a the purchased print copy was destroyed and its di gital replacement not re distributed, this was a \nfair use. \nThe downloaded pirated copies used  to build a central library were not justified by a fair \nuse.  Every factor points agains t fair use.  Anthropic employees said copies of works (pirated \nones, too) would be retained “forever” for “gen eral purpose” even after Anthropic determined \nthey would never be used for training LLMs.  A separate justificati on was required for each \nuse.  None is even offered here except  for Anthropic’s pocke tbook and convenience. \nAnd, as for any copies made from central library copies but not used for training, this \norder does not grant summary judgm ent for Anthropic.  On this record in this posture, the \ncentral library copies were retained even when no longer serving as sources for training copies, \n“hundreds of engineers” could acc ess them to make copies for other uses, and engineers did \nmake other copies.  Anthropic ha s dodged discovery on these points ( e.g., Opp. Exh. 17 at 93–\n94 (retained); Opp. Exh. 22 at 196 (no limits ); Opp. Exh. 30 at 3, 4 (no accounting); see also \nOpp. 15).  We cannot determine the right answer concerning such copies because the record is \ntoo poorly developed as to them.  Anthropic is not entitled to an or der blessing all copying \n“that Anthropic has ever made af ter obtaining the data,” to use its words (Opp. Exh. 30 at 3, 4). \nCONCLUSION \nWith respect to the training copi es and the print-to-digital co nverted copies, this order has \ndrawn all ambiguities and inferenc es in favor of the opposing si de, namely Authors.  With \nrespect to the pirated copies, this order has al so accepted the Authors’ version of the facts.  \nAuthors did not move for summ ary judgment but if they had, then we would have been \nobligated to accept all reasonable views given the evidence in defendant’s favor instead.  \nThis order grants summary judgment for Anthro pic that the training use was a fair use.  \nAnd, it grants that the pr int-to-digital format chan ge was a fair use for a different reason.  But it \ndenies summary judgment for Anth ropic that the pirated library copies must be treated as \ntraining copies.   \nWe will have a trial on the pirated copies used  to create Anthropic’s central library and \nthe resulting damages, actual or  statutory (including for willfu lness).

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: The case involves Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and CF Dynamic Advances LLC suing Amazon.com, Inc. for patent infringement related to a natural language interface (NLI) technology. The patent in question details a method for processing natural language inputs using a natural language query (NLQ) processor, which finds applications in products like Amazon Alexa. The court's main task was to interpret and provide constructions for disputed terms in the patent claims to assist in deciding the infringement issue.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: The key legal issue in this case is the construction of several disputed terms in the '798 Patent claims to determine if Amazon's products infringe on the patent held by Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and CF Dynamic Advances LLC.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court provided specific interpretations for the disputed terms within the '798 Patent claims, which are necessary for determining whether Amazon products infringe on the patent in question.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine a game with a secret language where you have specific words that mean different things. One day, someone else uses similar words in their game, and you think they're copying you. This case is like going to a referee to decide what those special words really mean to see if someone is cheating by using your secret words in their game. Here, the referee is the court, and they're trying to figure out what certain parts of a technology-related patent (basically an official \"no copying\" certificate) really mean to see if Amazon copied them for things like Alexa.",

PEEBLES U.S. MAGISTRATE JUDGE  \n \nREPORT AND RECOMMENDATION  \n \n Plaintiffs Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute ( \"RPI\") and  CF Dynamic \nAdvances, LLC ( \"Dynamic  Advances \") have commenced this action \nagainst defendant Amazon.com , Inc. ( \"Amazon \"), alleging patent \ninfringement . The patent at issue discloses a  natural language interface \n(\"NLI\") consisting  of a method for processing natural language inputs \nprovided by a user through a search  of language -based data bases.  \nPlaintiffs allege that certain of Amazon's products and services infringe \nupon cl aims contained within the patent.  \n Despite their best efforts, the parties have been unable to agree on \nthe proper construction to be attributed to several claim terms contained \nwithin RPI's  patent, and now seek guidance from the court with regard to \neleven  such terms . The question of claim construction has been referred \nto me for the issuance of a report and recommendation to the assigned district judge. Based upon the comprehensive submissions from the \nparties and a claim construction hearing conduct ed by the court, I make Case 1:18-cv-00549-BKS-TWD   Document 168   Filed 09/30/21   Page 2 of 52  3 \n the recommendations that follow.     \nI. BACKGROUND  \n At the center  of this case is United States Patent No. 7,177,798 \n(\"’798 Patent \"), issued on February 13, 2007,  and entitled \"Natural \nLanguage Interface Using Constrained Intermediat e Dictionary of \nResults .\"1 The ’798 Patent discloses innovations in the area of NLI that are  \nused to process inputs in t he form of natural language q ueries. The patent  \nlists Dr. Cheng Hsu , a professor at RPI, and Dr. Veera Boonjing , a former \ndoctoral candidate at RPI who now teaches in Thailand,  as the inventors, \nand RPI as the assignee of rights under the patent. Dynamic Advances,  a \nlimited liability company headquartered in Texas, is the exclusive licensee \nunder  the patent. The ’798 Patent was issued based upon an application \nfiled on May 21, 2001, and traces its ro ots back to a continuation-in -part \napplication filed on  or about  April 7, 2000,2 but later abandoned, and a \nprovisional application filed on May 19, 2000.   \n \n1  The ’798 Patent  can be found at various locations on the docket. See, e.g., Dkt. \nNos. 1 -1, 142- 2, 143- 2. \n \n2  Although the specification identifies the filing date of the priority application as \nApril 17, 2000, Amazon's expert in this action has suggested that the application was \nfiled on April 7 , 2000, and that the reference to the 17th is a typographical error.  See \nDkt. No. 142 -14 at 9 n.2.  Because the exact date is immaterial to the issues discussed \nin this report and recommendation, I find no need at this juncture to resolve the \ndiscrepancy.

Claims 1 and 9, which are set \nforth below, are  the patent's only two independent claims  and provide a \nuseful backdrop for addressing the terms implicated in the claim \nconstruction exercise .3   \n’798 Patent, Claim 1  \n1. A method for processing a natural language  input \nprovided by a user, the method comprising:  \nproviding a natural language query input by the \nuser;  \nperforming, based on the input, without \naugmentation,  a search of one or more language -\nbased databases including at least one metadata \ndatabase  comprising at least one of a group of \ninformation types comprising:  \ncase information ; \nkeywords;  \ninformation models; and  \ndataba se values;  \nproviding, through a user interface, a result of the search to the user ;  \nidentifying, for one or more language -based \ndatabases, a finite number of database objects;  and \ndetermining a plurality of combinations of the \nfinite number of database ob jects . \n \n’798 Patent, Claim 9  \n9.

Id. at 13: 42-44.   \nA mapping processor 206 performs a mapping between incoming \nobjects and database objects 204 A, and may generate database queries \nfrom the objects and interpretations provided by the identifier 205 and the \nprocessor 207, respectively. ’798 Patent,  13:52 -56. The processor 206 \nmay, for example, generate structural query language ( \"SQL\") queries \nused to locate database  objects 204A, and those queries may be \nexecuted by an SQL search engine, and the processor 201 may provide a \nquery result 203  to the user through, for example, a graphical user \ninterface.

DISCUSSION  \n A. Claim Construction: The Legal Framework  \n  1. Gener al Principles  \nPatent claim construction is a mixed  issue of law and fact to be \ndecided by the court . Teva Pharmas. USA, Inc. v. Sandoz, Inc. , 574 U.S. \n318, 331 -32 (2015). When the court \"reviews . . . evidence intrinsic to the \npatent (the patent claims and specification, along with the patent's \nprosecution history), the . . . determination will amount . . . to a Case 1:18-cv-00549-BKS-TWD   Document 168   Filed 09/30/21   Page 10 of 52  11 \n determination of law[.] \" Teva Pharmas. USA, Inc. , 574 U.S. at 331. If it \nbecom es necessary to  \"look beyond the patent's intrinsic evidence \" and \nconsult extrinsic  evidence  to provide accurate interpretations of disputed \nclaims, the determinations are considered \"subsidiary factual findings. \" Id. \nSubsidiary factual findings have been described as \"the 'evidentiary \nunderpinnings' of claim construction. \" Id. at 331 -32.  \n When construing a patent, as a general rule, a court assigns \ndisputed terms their ordinary and customary meaning as they would have \nbeen understood by a person of ordinary skill in the art ( \"POSITA \"), as of \nthe date of filing on  or about  April 7, 2000 , when read in the context of the \npatent specification and prosecution history.8 SpeedTrack, Inc. v. \nAmazon.com  (\"SpeedTrack \"), 998 F.3d 1373, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2021);  \nPower Integrations, Inc.  v. Fairchild Semiconductor Int'l, Inc. , 904 F.3d \n \n8  The parties did not address the characteristics of a POSITA in their briefs. \nPlaintiffs' expert, Dr. Steven Shwartz, has opined that a POSITA is \"a person with two \nyears of graduate or post -graduate level work in natural language processing and \ndatabase systems and at least two years of experience in commercial research or development of natural language interfaces for databases.\" Dk t. No. 142- 15 at 8.  \nDr. Earl Sacerdoti, Amazon's expert, has described a POSITA as a person \"hav[ing] a graduate degree in computer science, or a similar field, with course work in artificial intelligence including natural language processing\" or, alternatively, as a person who \"would have a bachelor's degree in such a field with 2 or more years of industry experience in natural language query processing.\" Dkt. No. 142- 14 at 9. In my view, \nthe distinctions between the proffered characteristics of a POSITA in this case are not material for determining any of the issues at stake. For that reason, when resolving the disputes between the parties, I have considered each expert's definition of a POSITA.  \n Case 1:18-cv-00549-BKS-TWD   Document 168   Filed 09/30/21   Page 11 of 52  12 \n 965, 971 (Fed. Cir. 2018); Phillips v. AWH Corp. , 415 F.3d 1303, 1312-13 \n(Fed. Cir. 2005).  \"[T]he ordinary and customary meaning of a claim term \nis the meaning that the term would have to a [POSITA]  in question at the \ntime of the invention[.] \" Phillips , 415 F.3d at 1313; accord, Finjan, Inc. v. \nCisco Sys., Inc. , 837 F. App'x  799, 804 (Fed. Cir. 2020) . \nThere are two exceptions to this general rule , only one of which is \nrelevant to this action . In particular, a claim term will be afforded a \nmeaning other than its ordinary one when the patentee clearly and \nunmistakably disavow s the full scope of the term either in the patent \nspecification or during prosecution of the patent application. SpeedTrack, \nInc., 998 F.3d at 1377 -78; Butamax(TM) Advanced Biofuels LLC v. Gevo, \nInc., 746 F.3d 1302, 1309 (Fed. Cir. 2014); Thorner v. Sony Com puter \nEntm't Am., LLC, 669 F.3d 1362, 1365 (Fed. Cir. 2012).  \"A disavowal must \nbe clear, but it need not be explicit. \" Techtronic Indus. Co. Ltd. v. Int'l \nTrade Comm'n , 944 F.3d 901, 907 (Fed. Cir. 2019) (internal quotation \nmarks omitted).  \"Disavowal may be inferred from clear limiting descriptions \nof the invention in the specification or prosecution history ,\" or \"an inventor \nmay . . . disavow claim scope by distinguishing the claimed invention over \nthe prior art. \" Techtronic Indus. Co. Ltd. , 944 F.3d at  907 (internal \nquotation marks omitted).  This exception to the general  rule that patent Case 1:18-cv-00549-BKS-TWD   Document 168   Filed 09/30/21   Page 12 of 52  13 \n terms should be given their ordinary meaning is both narrow and exacting. \nThorner , 669 F.3d at 1366-67.  \n While the words of a patent claim will generally c ontrol, they must \nnot be interpreted in isolation and the POSITA \"is deemed to read the \nclaim term not only in the context of the particular claim in which the \ndisputed term appears, but in the context of the entire patent, including the \nspecification.\"  Phillips, 415 F.3d at 1313 . A patent's specification often \nconstitutes the \"single best guide to the meaning of a disputed term. \" \nVitronics  Corp. v. Conceptronic, Inc. , 90 F.3d 7576,  1582  (Fed Cir. 1996); \naccord, Phillips , 415 F.3d at 1314. In this respect, a patent specification, \nwhich is like an  internal dictionary, must be carefully reviewed to \ndetermine whether, for example, the inventor has used a particular term in \na manner inconsistent with its ordinary meaning . Vitronics Corp. , 90 F.3d \nat 1582. When r esorting to a patent's specification for guidance with \nrespect to disputed claim terms, a court must consider it as a whole and , \nwhere possible, all portions should be read in a manner that renders the \npatent internally consistent . Budde v. Harley -Davidson , Inc. , 250 F.3d \n1369, 1379 -80 (Fed. Cir. 2001) .  \nAlthough the language of a patent specification can provide \nimportant clues regarding the proper construction of a disputed  claim term, Case 1:18-cv-00549-BKS-TWD   Document 168   Filed 09/30/21   Page 13 of 52  14 \n there are limitations upon its usefulness . \"[W]hile it is true that claims are \nto be interpreted in light of the specification and with a view to ascertaining \nthe invention, it does not follow that limitations from the specification may \nbe read into the claims [.]\" Sjolund v. Musland , 847 F.2d 1573, 1581 (Fed. \nCir. 1988) (emphasis in original) ; accord, Kinik Co. v. Int'l Trade Comm'n , \n362 F.3d 1359, 1364 (Fed. Cir. 2004). \" Nor should particular embodiments \nin the specification be read into the claims; the general rule is that the claims of a patent ar e not limited to the preferred embodiment. \" Cornell \nUniv. v. Hewlett -Packard Co., 313 F. Supp. 2d 114, 126 (N.D.N.Y. 2004) \n(citing, inter alia , Texas Digital Sys., Inc. v. Telegenix, Inc., 308 F.3d 1193, \n1204 (Fed. Cir. 2002)).  \n In addition to the ordinar y meaning of a claim term itself and the \npatent's specification, the prosecution history related to the patent in issue \ncan help inform the determination of a proper claim construction . Phillips , \n415 F.3d at 1317. That history is generally comprised of \"the complete \nrecord of proceedings before the Patent and Trademark Office [( \"PTO\")], \nincluding any express representations made by the applicant regarding the scope of the claims \" and an examination of any relevant prior art . \nVitronics , 90 F.3d at 1582 -83. Such evidence, which typically chronicles \nthe dialogue between the inventor and the PTO leading up to the issuance Case 1:18-cv-00549-BKS-TWD   Document 168   Filed 09/30/21   Page 14 of 52  15 \n of a patent, and thus can act as a reliable indicator of any limitations or \nconcessions on the part of the applicant, oftentimes proves highly  \ninstructive during claim construction. See Phillips , 415 F.3d at 1317 ( \"[T]he \nprosecution history can often inform the meaning of the claim language by demonstrating how the inventor understood the invention and whether the \ninventor limited the invention in the course of prosecution, making the \nclaim scope narrower than it would otherwise be. \"). \n  2. Stare Decisis  \n On June 12, 2014 , I issued a decision and order in Rensselaer \nPolytechnic Institute v. Apple, Inc.  (\"Apple \"), Civil Action No. 13 -CV-0633 \n(N.D.N.Y., June 12, 2014), construing several disputed claim terms from \nthe ’798 Patent .9  Inasmuch as that case was ultimately settled shortly \nbefore trial, the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals did not have occasion to pass upon the claim constructio n determination from that action. Although \nthe defendant in that case was Apple, Inc. , and Amazon was not a party  to \nthe litigation , and thus is not bound by res judicata  or collateral estoppel \nwith regard to those claim constructions, plaintiffs argue that  I should \n \n9  Specifically, that decision addressed the terms \"natural language query input,\" \n\"based on the input, without augmentation,\" \"metadata database,\" \"case,\" \"case \ninformation,\" \"information models,\" \"database objects,\" \"determining a plurality of combinations of the finite number of database objects,\" \"identifying  a finite number of \npermutations of plurality of database objects,\" and \"reference dictionary.\" Apple, No. 13-CV-0633, Dkt. No. 104 at 44.  Case 1:18-cv-00549-BKS-TWD   Document 168   Filed 09/30/21   Page 15 of 52  16 \n recommend the same constructions of mutually disputed claim terms  in \nthe interests of  consistency and predictability. Addressing that argument in \nsupplemental submissions, Amazon argues that the Federal Circuit Court \nof Appeals ' recent decision in Speed Track undermines the significance of \nmy construction s in Apple.  \nHorizontal stare decisis is a discretionary doctrine. Most district \ncourts do not treat other district courts ' decisions , including those issued \nby courts in the same distric t, as precedential . This is true for district \ncourts presiding over claim construction issues where another district court \nhas ruled on identical claim terms. See, e.g., Verizon Cal., Inc. v. Ronald \nKatz Tech. Licensing, P.A., 326 F. Supp. 2d 1060, 1069 (C .D. Calif. 2003); \nTexas Instruments, Inc. v. Linear Techs. Corp., 182 F. Supp. 2d 580, 589 \n(E.D. Tex. 2002).  This notwithstanding, however, c laim construction \nrulings by other district courts are generally deemed highly relevant and  \ncan be regarded as  persuasive authority. Depomed, Inc. v. Sun Pharma \nGlobal FZE , No. 11 -CV-3553, 2012 WL 3201962, at *4 (D. N.J. Aug. 3, \n2012); see also KX Indus., L.P. v. PUR Water Purification Prods., Inc. , 108 \nF. Supp. 2d 380, 387 (D. Del. 2000) (affording deference to the c ourt's \nown previous claim construction rulings related to the same patent); cf. \nTech. Licensing Corp. v. Blackmagic Design Pty Ltd. , No. 13 -CV-5184, Case 1:18-cv-00549-BKS-TWD   Document 168   Filed 09/30/21   Page 16 of 52  17 \n 2016 WL 8902602, at *5 (N.D. Calif. Nov. 23, 2016) (concluding that stare \ndecisis does not apply to different district courts' interpretations of disputed \nclaims but describing those decisions \"as relevant intrinsic evidence \" for \npurposes of its own claim construction analysis).    \nTo the extent stare decisis applies to this court's previous claim \nconstruction ruling in the Apple litigation, it would apply only to the \nfollowing two disputed terms: (1) \"based on the input, without \naugmentation, \" and (2) \" metadata database. \" Although there are three \nadditional claim  terms  that were construed by the court in the Apple  \nlitigation and are now in dispute in this action, Amazon contends those \nterms are indefinite – an argument that was not presented by Apple and is \nseparate and apart from the proper interpretation of the disputed terms. \nThose three claim  terms  include:  (1) \"case information, \" (2) \"case, \" and (3) \n\"determining a plurality of combinations of the finite number of database \nobjects. \" Other than arguing in definiteness, Amazon does not offer \nproposed constructions for these three terms.10 \n \n10  The P atent Trial and A ppeal Board (\"PTAB\")  has not construed the terms \"case\" \nor \"determining a plurality of combi nations of the finite number of database objections.\" \nIt did, however, construe the term \"case information\" in the same way as the court did \nin Apple on more than one occasion, including in decisions denying two inter partes  \nreview  (\"IPR\") petitions filed by both Apple and Amazon, and in denying motions by \nAmazon for rehearing. See Dkt. Nos. 143- 4 at 6 -7, 143-5 at 4 -7, 14- 17, 143-7 at 10- 11.  Case 1:18-cv-00549-BKS-TWD   Document 168   Filed 09/30/21   Page 17 of 52  48 \n renumbered when the ’798 Patent was issued, see Dkt. No. 142 -5 at 11,  \noriginally required interpretation of permutations \" to determine a res ult.\" Id. \nat 69. The patent examiner rejected this claim because it simply \n\"manipulates an abstract idea\"  and did \" not have any post or pre  computer \nprocess activity. \" Id. at 25. In response to the rejection, the applicant s \namended the claim to require that the computer \"provide a determination, \" \nrather than simpl y \"determin e a result .\" Id. at 16-17 . The applicant s then \nargued, based upon the amended language, that \" an output is g enerated \nwhich is representative of an interpretation of the natural language input \" \nand that such output is \" hardly a mere abstraction \" and is instead a \n\"useful, concrete \" result. Id. at 20-21. Based upon this exchange , \nAmazon's expert, Dr. Sacerdoti, con tends that  a POSITA \"would recognize \nthat the only 'useful, concrete ' result that arguably occurs ' post computer ' \nin the patented process is that the user receives the output that the \ncomputer has generated. \" Dkt. No. 142 -14 at 48  (alteration omitted) .  \n Amazon's reasoning is flawed . As the prosecution history \nestablishes , the inventor s argued that Claim 9 was allowable because it \nincluded pre- computer processing activity of receiving a natural language \ninput, not post -processing a ctivity of outputting the result to the user. Dkt. \nNo. 142-5 at 20-21 . By adding, following a rejection, the limitation Case 1:18-cv-00549-BKS-TWD   Document 168   Filed 09/30/21   Page 48 of 52  49 \n \"receiving a natural language input \" and changing \" determine a result \" to \n\"provide a determination of a result \" the inventors argued that the output \n\"is generated which is representative of an interpretation of the natural \nlanguage input. \" Id. at 20. Accordingly, the applicant s noted, \"there is pre-\ncomputer process activity of receiving natural language input. \" Id. at 21. \n Based upon the f oregoing I recommend that the court reject the \nsuggestion by Amazon that the result being provided in Claim 9 must  \nalways  be to the user. I further recommend the court not construe this \nterm as proposed by plaintiffs.  \nIV.

    "summary": "**1. Summary:**\n\nIn the case of *Syncsort Inc. v. Innovative Routines International, Inc.*, the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey addressed the misappropriation of trade secrets and unfair competition claims brought by Syncsort against its competitor, IRI. The case centered on IRI's use of Syncsort's confidential reference materials to develop a translator program, \"ssu2scl,\" which enabled users to convert job-control scripts written for Syncsort's software to be compatible with IRI's software, CoSORT. This dispute involves the field of data transformation software but does not primarily engage AI or automated systems, apart from the software's functional capacities to translate script languages.\n\n**2. Key Legal Issue:**\n\nThe main legal issue is whether IRI misappropriated Syncsort's trade secrets by using the SyncSort UNIX Reference Guide and job-control scripts to develop a script translation utility, thereby unfairly competing with Syncsort.\n\n**3. Court's Holding:**\n\nThe court held that Syncsort's command language constituted a trade secret and found that IRI had misappropriated this by using Syncsort's proprietary information to create the ssu2scl translator. As a result, the court granted Syncsort injunctive relief, barring IRI from using or distributing the translator and any derived materials, and ordered the destruction of all related copies and documents.\n\n**4. ELI5 Explanation:**\n\nImagine two companies making different kinds of software that help big institutions like banks sort and change their data from one format to another. Company A (Syncsort) built a tool that lets users create automated instructions (scripts) in a secret language, saving them a lot of time and effort. Company B (IRI) wanted users to switch to its software. So, they took Company A's instruction book (without permission) and made a tool to help users apply the same scripts in Company B’s software. This was like taking a recipe book secret and changing its units so you can bake the same cake using your oven. The judge decided this was unfair and told Company B to stop and destroy all the copies they had.",

(know n as “IRI”), which develop and sell data \ntransformation software.  Data transformation is  the process of taking data in one form and \nchanging into another form (such as editing or  reordering the data). Syncsort produces and \nlicenses a data transformation so ftware product called SyncSort UNIX. IRI markets a directly \ncompeting product called CoSORT. \nUsers of the software are able to write and save job-control script s, which are sequences \nof instructions and commands for particular data  transformation tasks. The scripts are reusable, \nso users do not have to rewr ite the scripts for each task they wish to perform. Case 2:04-cv-03623-WHW-MCA   Document 192   Filed 08/18/11   Page 1 of 36 PageID: <pageID>2 \n The job-control scripts are written in a comman d language that is uni que to the respective \nsoftware product.  The CoSORT command languag e is incompatible with SyncSort UNIX, and \nthe SyncSort UNIX command language is incompatible with CoSORT. \nThe incompatibly between the two command languages creates a sign ificant barrier to \nswitching software vendors because creation of new scripts is a costly endeavor. If a customer \ndecides to switch software products, the customer  must recreate its job-c ontrol scripts so that \nthey are compatible with the new software. \nIn response to this barrier to switching products, IRI developed a computer program—\nssu2scl—which can translate scripts written in  the SyncSort UNIX comm and language into the \nCoSORT command language. This translator allo ws SyncSort UNIX customers to switch to \nCoSORT without going through the effort  of rewriting job-control scripts. \nSyncsort has twice sued IRI in this Court alleging, among other cl aims, misappropriation \nof trade secrets and unfair competition; Syncsort seeks injunctive relief and damages. The first \nsuit resulted in a bench trial and the fact findings and legal conc lusions that follow. \nEarlier, the Court had decided motions fo r summary judgment. The Court ruled that \nSyncsort’s trade secret misappropriation and unfair competition claims could proceed to trial. Although Syncsort’s demand for mone tary damages was struck because there was no evidence to \nsupport a causal link between IRI’s use of the tr anslator and the monetary damages claimed by \nSyncsort. \nThe Court has reviewed the pa rties’ proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law \nagainst the backdrop of the Court’s notes, recoll ection and trial transcri pts. Notwithstanding the \nmicro-factual submissions of the parties, the Court believes and finds many submissions to be \nirrelevant, hyperbolic rhetoric, and not necessary to the Court’s ultimate conclusions. Case 2:04-cv-03623-WHW-MCA   Document 192   Filed 08/18/11   Page 2 of 36 PageID: <pageID>3 \n This opinion has concentrated on the materi al and supportive facts necessary to answer \nthe primary questions: Is information sufficient to  create the ssu2scl translator a recognizable \ntrade secret? If so, did IRI misa ppropriate this trade secret? A nd, is Syncsort entitled to an \ninjunction? \nThe Court has evaluated the credibility of a ll witnesses testing not only what they said \nbut how they said it and what wa s not said against these criteria: Was this more likely so or not? \nDid what was said make sense in the totality of circumstances? To the extent any finding of fact \nreflects a legal conclusion, it shall be to that ex tent deemed a conclusion of law, and vice versa. \n \nFINDINGS OF FACT \nA. Background \n1.

Development of SyncSort UNIX and the Reference Guide  \n9. Syncsort designed SyncSort UNIX so that  a user could use the product by giving \nit commands coded in a particular command language. The SyncSort UNIX command language \nis an extensive symbolic system by which a user instructs the Sync Sort UNIX program to \nperform specific data processi ng and sorting jobs. The language is comprised of (i) words and \nsymbols that have particular meaning within  the language (“options” and “keywords”) (the \nrespective meanings of which are referred to as the language “sem antics”), and (ii) the specific \nrules or “syntax” for forming valid program expr essions out of those options and keywords. PTO \nStip. ¶¶ 9, 11.  \n10. SyncSort UNIX cannot perform the tasks desired by the user unless the command \nlanguage statements used to invoke those tasks ar e specified correctly in  accordance with the \nsyntax and semantics of the language. See Pl. Ex. 584 ¶ 10. Case 2:04-cv-03623-WHW-MCA   Document 192   Filed 08/18/11   Page 4 of 36 PageID: <pageID>5 \n 11. The SyncSort UNIX command language is not generally known to others \n(unauthorized users and competitors) in the co mputer industry. Trial Tr. 58:13-58:15, Jan. 19, \n2011. \n12. SyncSort UNIX command language statements  are particularly useful when used \nin combination, to perform a set of data transf ormation tasks that comprise a practical data \nprocessing task that the user wishes to perform. SyncSort UNIX users are ab le to create and save \nsuch a series of instructions for their particular data transformation jobs as text files. Such text \nfiles are called job-control scripts. These scripts consist of a series of statements that include \noptions, keywords and user-supplied names and data, each arranged in  accordance with the \nsyntax of the language. The script s save users the labor of physic ally entering the text of their \ndesired commands line by line for each of their jobs and eliminate associated typing errors. \nThese scripts are often run repetitively in a commercial data processing department. It is a \npractical necessity, therefore, to  have the specifications for Sy ncSort UNIX data transformation \njobs stored in the form of scripts. PT O Stip. ¶ 13; Trial Tr. 195:1-195:21, Jan. 20, 2011. \n13. Syncsort developed the SyncSort UNIX Reference Guide that defines commands, \nparameters and syntax and formal grammar definitions of the SyncSort UNIX command \nlanguage. PTO Stip. ¶¶ 10-12. The Reference Guide is nearly 400 pages. Pl. Ex. 114 \n14. The Reference Guide describes the s yntax of the SyncSort UNIX command \nlanguage in a comprehensive series of precise, fo rmal definitions which, together, are known as a \ngrammar. PTO Stip. ¶ 12. The Reference Guide sets out the rules for each “option” or \n“statement” in the language. In addition, ther e are other sections of the Reference Guide \nconcerning program usage, and an extensive appe ndix that defines numerous keywords, specifies Case 2:04-cv-03623-WHW-MCA   Document 192   Filed 08/18/11   Page 5 of 36 PageID: <pageID>6 \n acceptable data types for various operations, and sets forth additional technical details \nconcerning the language. See generally  Pl. Ex. 114. \n15. Syncsort invested over $13 million to de velop SyncSort UNIX and the SyncSort \nUNIX command language approx imately between 1992 and 2005. See Trial Tr. 481:3-481:16, \nMay 10, 2011. \n16. Before developing SyncSort UNIX, Sync sort had developed several mainframe \ncomputer versions of SyncSort. One such vers ion, SyncSort MVS, was developed for the MVS \nmainframe operating system and was based on the sort language for IBM’s DFSort, which is in \nthe public domain. Trial Tr. 154:12-155:15, Jan. 20, 2011. The SyncSort UNIX command \nlanguage is quite different from the languages that Syncsort created for use with its mainframe-\nbased software, including Sync Sort MVS. Trial Tr. 333:22-334: 3, Jan. 21, 2011; Trial Tr. 155:4-\n155:6, Jan. 20, 2011. A full knowledge of the S yncsort MVS command language would not \npermit one to write a translator for Sync Sort UNIX. Trial Tr. 333:25-334:3, Jan. 21, 2011. \n17. In 1990, 1991 and 1992, IRI developed a command language for CoSORT known \nas SortCL. PTO Stip. ¶ 15. The SortCL command language has always been incompatible with \nSyncSort UNIX, just as the SyncSort UNIX co mmand language is incompatible with CoSORT. \nPTO Stip. ¶ 21. \n18. The SyncSort UNIX command language a nd IRI’s SortCL each require that \ninstructions be provided to them in precisely defined structures, in ac cordance with the term \ndefinitions and syntax of their respective comm and languages. Neither program has “artificial \nintelligence” capabilities to try to  guess what a user intends. If the desired instructions are not \nstated in the correct form, the program will eith er fail or provide incorrect results. The proper Case 2:04-cv-03623-WHW-MCA   Document 192   Filed 08/18/11   Page 6 of 36 PageID: <pageID>7 \n “form” for these instructions is the form sp ecified by the command language for the program.

Due to the specificity of the formal language requirements of SyncSort UNIX and \nthe arbitrary nature of many of the words, symb ols and syntax Syncsort selected in developing \nthe SyncSort UNIX command language, it woul d be difficult for a computer programming \ncompany in the same industry as Syncsort to  recreate the grammar of SyncSort UNIX from \ngeneral knowledge of the industry without ha ving access to the SyncSort UNIX Reference \nGuide, even if the developer ha d access to scripts wr itten in the SyncSort UNIX language. Trial \nTr. 331:6-332:11, Jan. 21, 2011. \nC. Measures Used to Protect the Secrecy of the SyncSort UNIX Command Language \n20. There is a custom in the software in dustry of keeping software intended for \ncommercial use and all related materials protected by confidentiality agreements and trade-secret status. Trial Tr. 69:2-70:3, Jan. 19, 2011. Such is evident in use of legends on software manuals, \nuse of non-disclosure agreements and contractual provisi ons with end users, resellers and other \nparties. The industry understands these legends and agreements to restrict one from using or \ndisclosing information related to the software in an unauthorized manner. Trial Tr. 349:12-350:1, \n350:8-350:25, Jan. 21, 2011. \n21. Since creating its SyncSort UNIX command language in the early 1990s, Syncsort \nhas taken precautions to prevent any detailed in formation concerning the elements and workings \nof the command language from becoming pub licly known. Trial Tr. 104:3-105:8, Jan. 20, 2011. \nSome of the precautions and measures taken to pr otect the trade secret nature of the SyncSort \nUNIX command language include: \ni. Requiring all users, including thos e who use SyncSort UNIX on a trial \nbasis, to enter into a license agreemen t that restricts the use of SyncSort Case 2:04-cv-03623-WHW-MCA   Document 192   Filed 08/18/11   Page 7 of 36 PageID: <pageID>8 \n UNIX and its related manuals and ma terials and binds the licensee to \nmaintain the confidentiality of “any information” related to SyncSort \nUNIX. Trial Tr. 468:23-469:16, May 5, 2011; Trial Tr. 104:15-104:17, \nJan. 20, 2011; Pl. Ex. 441 ¶ 4. \n \nii. Requiring all Syncsort employees (including clerical employees), \ncontractors or business part ners to execute confidentiality agreements that \nforbid such parties to copy, remove fro m Syncsort’s premises, or disclose \nto anyone outside Syncsort’s direct employ, any information considered \nconfidential, including software documentation without  prior written \napproval by a vice president of S yncsort. Trial Tr. 104:3-104:8, Jan. 20, \n2011; Pl. Ex. 469; Pl. Ex. 584¶ 14(c). S yncsort has also made clear to \nemployees in its technical support group who assist customers with \nSyncSort UNIX that they are to keep the SyncSort UNIX language \nconfidential. Trial Tr . 404:11-404:21, Jan. 25, 2011. \n \niii. Requiring all SyncSort UNIX resellers and distributors to enter into a \nReseller Agreement containing confid entiality provisions that bind the \nreseller or distributor, its custom ers and its employees. Trial Tr. 108:9-\n108:13, Jan. 20, 2011; Pl. Ex. 470; Pl. Ex. 584 ¶ 14(d). The Reseller \nAgreement serves to ensure that resellers and dist ributors and their \nemployees keep information, such as software documentation, \nconfidential, and that they do not disc lose such information to any third \nparty without Syncsort’s prior written approval. See, e.g. , Pl. Ex. 470 § 3 \n¶¶ 1.3, 1.6; § 4 ¶¶ 1.1, 12.3, 16.2, 16.3, 19.6. \n \niv.

Data transformation software is generall y licensed either for a set term or in \nperpetuity. Term licensees generally receive maintenance and support du ring the term, whereas \nperpetual licensees typically sign renewable ma intenance agreements. Tr ial Tr. 71:15-73:2, Jan. \n19, 2011.  \n23. Syncsort sells term licenses. IRI sells perpetual licenses. \n24. Customers may switch from one software produ ct to another at anytime. But, they \nmay be dissuaded from doing so because of the co st of translating job-co ntrol scripts from the \ncommand language of one softwa re product to another.  \n25. The incompatibly between the two co mmand languages creates a significant \nbarrier to switching software vendor s because creation of new scripts is a costly endeavor.  If a \ncustomer decides to switch software products, th e customer must recreate its job-control scripts \nto be compatible with the new software. \n26. In response to this barrier to switc hing products, in 2000, IRI developed a \ncomputer program—ssu2scl—which can transl ate scripts written in the SyncSort UNIX \ncommand language into the CoSORT command langua ge.  This translator allows SyncSort \nUNIX customers to switch to CoSORT without going through the effort of rewriting job-control scripts. \n27. The trade secret status of the SyncSort  UNIX command language is of great value \nto Syncsort because it prevents competitors from  using that language to lure away Syncsort’s \ncustomers. Where a customer has hundreds of scri pts that must be made compatible with a \ncompeting software product, the cost of script conversion is a key consideration in evaluating the \noverall cost of switching to a compe ting product. Trial Tr. 76:7-76:19, Jan. 19, 2011. Case 2:04-cv-03623-WHW-MCA   Document 192   Filed 08/18/11   Page 9 of 36 PageID: <pageID>10 \n Additionally, the cost associat ed with making SyncSort UNIX scripts compatible with a \ncompeting product may prevent Syncsort’s curren t customers from using the threat of taking \ntheir scripts elsewhere as a bargaining chip in  license renewal negotiations. Trial Tr. 79:22-\n81:24, Jan. 19, 2011. \n28. Eliminating the SyncSort UNIX command language’s trade secr et status would \nincrease competitors’ ability to sell their own products to existing SyncSort UNIX customers. \nSee R. Friedland Dep. 209:20-209:24, 210:8-210:11, Ma y 16, 2006 (ssu2scl can be “an important \naid in IRI’s ability to sell CoSO RT to SyncSort customers”). Allowing Syncsort’s competitors to \ndisregard the trade secret status of the SyncSort UNIX command language would allow \ncompetitors to reverse engineer, translate, and otherwise incorporate that language into \ncompeting products. \n29. IRI has admitted that it provides the “u seful” service of “c onvert[ing] [Syncsort \ncustomers’ scripts] in an accurate way and in a timely way” before their SyncSort UNIX license \nperiods ended. PI Hr’g Tr. 4:4-4:20, Jan. 5, 2005. \n30. From May to July of 2000, IRI developed a computer program that was capable \nof translating scripts wr itten in the SyncSort UNIX command la nguage into scripts in the SortCL \ncommand language. This followed an earlier, unsa tisfactory attempt by IRI to develop such a \nutility (ss2scl). The translation program developed as a result of IRI’s effo rt is called ssu2scl. \nThe creation of ssu2scl required extensive knowledge of the proprietary SyncSort UNIX \ncommand language. Trial Tr. 213:3-213:22, Jan. 2 0, 2011. IRI also developed a utility called \nrescript that would automatica lly run CoSORT on the SyncSort  UNIX script that had been \ntranslated by ssu2scl. Haines Dep. 12: 15-12:18, 13:1-13:7, 111:11- 111:15, May 13, 2005.

PTO \nStip. ¶ 20.  \n31. Rick Haines, the programmer who wrot e ssu2scl and rescript, relied on two \nsources of information to l earn the SyncSort UNIX comman d language: the SyncSort UNIX \nReference Guide and SyncSort UNIX scripts.  Haines Dep. May 13, 2005, 15:13-15:20; Trial Tr. \n171:18-172:2, Jan. 20, 2011. Haines’s primary sour ce of knowledge of the grammar of the \nSyncSort UNIX command language was the Sync Sort UNIX Reference Guide. Haines used \nscripts to test the effectiveness of ssu2scl and rescript after he created these utilities by copying \ninformation from the Reference Guide.  \n32. Notwithstanding earlier denial s, IRI, through its counsel, conceded that it had \naccess to and used the Reference Guide to develop ssu2scl. Trial Tr. 171:18-172:2, Jan. 20, \n2011. \n33. Certain translation mechanisms in the ss u2scl source code tracked the Reference \nGuide word-for-word. This tracking was not a coinci dence. The source code demonstrates that \nIRI took significant parts of its  translator code from the defi nitions of SyncSort UNIX command \nlanguage as they were specifically set out in the Reference Guide. Trial Tr. 201:16-203:16, Jan. \n20, 2011. \n34. In late 1997 or early 1998, IRI obtained a copy of the SyncSort UNIX Reference \nGuide dated 1996 from an unspecified Brazilian di stributor, instead of receiving a copy from \nSyncsort or another authorized  source. PI Hr’g Tr. 19:19-19 :25, 59:11-59:19, Jan. 5, 2005; Pl. \nEx. 114. IRI later characterized the source as a reseller and claimed that it could not provide any \nfurther details concerning the circumstances of  how IRI obtained the Guide. D. Friedland Dep. \n292:14-292:20, May 19, 2006. Case 2:04-cv-03623-WHW-MCA   Document 192   Filed 08/18/11   Page 11 of 36 PageID:\n <pageID>12 \n 35. On the same page that identified the year  that IRI’s copy of the Reference Guide \nwas published, there is an explicit statement that the Reference Guide, like all versions of the Reference Guide, is a confidential document for use only by licensees. See Pl. Ex. 114. \nSpecifically, page 2 of the copy of the Refere nce Guide in IRI’s po ssession contains the \nfollowing legend:  \nThis document contains proprietary  and confidential material, and \nis only for use by lessees of the SyncSort proprietary software \nsystem. This publication may not be reproduced in whole or in \npart, in any form, except with wr itten permission from Syncsort \nIncorporated. \n \nPl. Ex. 114. \n36. It is accepted practice in the computer so ftware industry to treat all software \nmanuals bearing confidentiality notices as confidential. Trial Tr. 348:25-350:1, 295:5-295:16, \nJan. 21. 2011; Pl. Ex. 60 (IRI’s Co-SORT Manual b ears a similar confiden tiality notice). IRI \nused the copy of the Reference Guide that it ob tained for the purpose of creating ssu2scl and for \notherwise improving IRI’s script conversion capabilities in orde r to take away Syncsort’s \ncustomers. \n37. The Reference Guide was readily available to Haines because Susan Strickland \n(an IRI product tester) kept th e guide in the office’s libr ary. Strickland Dep., 149:21-150:6, May \n17, 2006. Strickland herself used the Reference Guid e to help her understand certain details of \nSyncSort UNIX when creating a SortCL version of SyncSort UNIX scripts. PI Hr’g Tr. 60:21-\n61:11, Jan. 5. 2005; Strickland Dep. 214:25-215:8; 216:11-216:8, May 17, 2006. \n38. IRI relied upon the Reference Guide to learn the syntax of the SyncSort UNIX \ncommand language. This allowed IRI to create ssu2s cl as well to have a resource when IRI \nneeded to understand certain SyncSort UNIX pr oprietary commands when it manually converted Case 2:04-cv-03623-WHW-MCA   Document 192   Filed 08/18/11   Page 12 of 36 PageID:\n <pageID>13 \n SyncSort UNIX scripts into SortCL. IRI, more lik ely than not, could not have developed ssu2scl \nwithout the Reference Guide. \n39. IRI sought to and did obtain as many sc ripts from SyncSort UNIX customers as it \ncould in order to create a means to test the eff ectiveness of ssu2scl and make improvements to it. \nBy the time that IRI began to develop ssu2scl , it had collected between ten and 100 SyncSort \nUNIX scripts from customers, which IRI states th at it used in its initial development of the \ntranslator. IRI, however, continued to try to improve and refine the translator as it obtained more \nand more scripts. Haines Dep. 15:13-20, 16:9-16:25;18:21-18:23, 118:13-118:19, May 13, 2005; \nsee also  Strickland Dep. 207:15-207:16, May 17, 2006 (IR I improved ssu2scl to translate \ncustomer’s additional SyncSort UNIX scripts). \n40. That scripts may contain proprietary information belonging to SyncSort UNIX \nlicensees regarding the business processes of thos e licensees does not negate the fact that these \nsame scripts also contain trade secret information belonging to Syncsort, which those licensees \nhave agreed by contract to keep confidential. \n41. As noted, ssu2scl’s only pur pose is to translate script s written in the SyncSort \nUNIX command language to SortCL so that the resulting output is the same. Haines Dep. 13:1-\n13:7, May 13, 2005. IRI’s president con ceded that the only reason to cr eate such a translator is to \ncompete. PI Hr’g Tr. 44:19-44:22, Jan. 5, 2005. IR I’s manifest purpose in developing ssu2scl \nand rescript was to lure Syncsort’s cust omers by creating an ar tificial one-way cross-\ncompatibility between the two programs.  There was a companywide discussion by \n“[e]verybody” at IRI that IRI needed a working translation program. Strickland Dep. 137:7-\n137:15, May 17, 2006; P. Friedland Dep. 50:22-50:25, June 21, 2006.  Case 2:04-cv-03623-WHW-MCA   Document 192   Filed 08/18/11   Page 13 of 36 PageID:\n <pageID>14 \n 42. IRI’s president, Paul Friedland, admitted that the translator that IRI developed \nwas useful for converting SyncSort UNIX customer s to CoSORT in precisely the way that IRI \nhad originally envisioned: “if [a SyncSort UNIX customer] has hundreds [or] thousands of \nscripts, if he is looking at our product as a c onversion tool, he needs to  convert them in an \naccurate way and in a timely way. . . . if he di dn’t have such a tool, he couldn’t do it. He \ncertainly couldn’t do it in this time frame require d before [the customer’s five-year SyncSort \nUNIX license expired].” PI Hr’g Tr. 4:4-4:20, Jan. 5, 2005. \n43. Although IRI claims that only a “handful ” of IRI customers use ssu2scl, David \nFriedland, IRI’s Vice President, ad mitted that IRI “considered this  utility to be important,” and \nthat these customers are a “significant share” of IRI’s business. D. Friedland Dep. 312:14-313:1; \n313:6-313:13; 313:23-314:1; 315:20-315:22, Ma y 19, 2006. Lisa Mangino, IRI’s employee \nresponsible for selling CoSORT, estimated that fi fty percent of IRI’s customers were SyncSort \nlicensees. Mangino Dep. 32:18-32:25, May 15, 2005. \n44. IRI markets CoSORT, in combination with ssu2scl, as a replacement for SyncSort \nUNIX. When this lawsuit began IRI’s website stat ed: “Notice to Other Sort Users. CoSORT . . . \nincludes . . . conversi on utilities, including rescript  and ssu2scl , to automatically replace and/or \nconvert (respectively) SyncSort  job specification files on UNIX systems and improve sort \nperformance.” Pl. Ex. 442-2. \n45. IRI’s website advertised both ssu2scl’s ability to make SyncSort UNIX scripts \n“run in CoSort instead” as well as IRI’s abilit y to “assist [the customer] in that [script \nconversion] process”:   Case 2:04-cv-03623-WHW-MCA   Document 192   Filed 08/18/11   Page 14 of 36 PageID:\n <pageID>15 \n Challenge: \n \nA SyncSort UNIX . . . user wants to use CoSort . . . to . . . \nconvert[] certain job scripts he/she wrote for SyncSort UNIX . . . to \nrun in CoSort instead. \n \nSolution: \n \nThe free conversion tool, SSU2SCL, can translate many basic job \nscripts in SyncSort UNIX syntax so you can automatically convert \nthem for use in the CoSort p ackage’s Sort Control Language \n(SortCL) program. For more advan ced SSU scripts, it is possible \nfor you to translate them by hand, or for IRI to assist you in that \nprocess. \n \nPl. Ex. 552. \n46. IRI also published a documen t titled Legacy Sort Mi gration: Upgrading to \nCoSORT which states: \nIn addition to script conversion, CoSORT also features drop-in \nreplacement facilities for near-term SyncSort UNIX lease expiry \nsituations . . . . With such plug ‘n’ play facilities, there is no impact on front-end applications -- existing sort application scripts stay in \nplace so that operations can contin ue without any migration effort. \n \nPl. Ex. 448. \n47. As of trial, IRI continued to revise and update this document. Trial Tr. 485:19-\n487:2 May 10, 2011; Pl. Ex. 712. \n48. IRI employees tasked with facilitatin g SyncSort UNIX conv ersions (including \nStrickland, Haines and Rob Fr iedland) obtained knowledge of  the SyncSort UNIX command \nlanguage from some source that had access to Sy ncsort’s confidential information. It is more \nlikely than not that they, and IRI, knew that both the SyncSort UNIX sc ripts and the Reference Case 2:04-cv-03623-WHW-MCA   Document 192   Filed 08/18/11   Page 15 of 36 PageID:\n <pageID>16 \n Guide in IRI’s possession were disclosed to IRI in breach of a S yncsort confidentiality \nagreement. \n49. Once IRI finally succeeded in creating a usab le translator, ssu2scl, IRI used it to \nconvert the SyncSort UNIX script s of a significant number of prospective customers, some of \nwhom had hundreds of scripts that required conversion. \n50. IRI has used ssu2scl to take Syncsort customers: Bank of America, Innovata, \nEmbratel, El Corte Ingles and HSBC in Brazil a ll worked with IRI to convert their SyncSort \nUNIX scripts to CoSort scripts using the ssu2scl translator. See, e.g. , Pl. Exs. 359, 130-8, 524-\n413, 217, 139, 220, 266, 386, 482-24, 212; Strickland Dep. 187:24-188:10, May 17, 2006. \n51.

Before this laws uit, IRI had not looked for any of these \nmaterials on the Internet. PI  Hr’g Tr. 69:13-69:15, Jan, 5, 2005. \n53. These references, considered alone or in combination, do not nullify a trade secret \nstatus of the SyncSort  UNIX command language: \n(i) The SyncSort UNIX Release 1 Technical Specification is a marketing document \nthat tells a user what SyncSort UNIX can  do, but not how the language does it. It \ndoes not define any of the language s yntax. While it describes the general \nfunction of a number of program “option”  words, it does not mention or define \nany of the more than 100 “keywords” lis ted in the index at page I.6 of the \nReference Guide. See PI Hr’g Tr. 64:3-66:10, Jan. 4, 2005. \n \n(ii) The “Millersville College” (Weigel) Internet document describes one SyncSort \nUNIX script posted on the Internet without  Syncsort’s knowledge or permission \nand has since been removed. PI Hr’g Tr. 111:1-111:22, Jan. 5, 2005; Pl. Ex. 584 ¶ \n24; Def. Ex. 6. \n \n(iii) The “Paul Boal” Internet paper is a document explaining some aspects of \nSyncSort UNIX scripting, which was publis hed on Paul Boal’s personal web site. \nIt contains four pages of simplistic sample scripts. Boal is not and has never been \nan employee, agent or representative of  Syncsort, nor otherwise affiliated with \nSyncsort in any way. Syncsort had never approved such posting or Boal’s use of \nthe Syncsort logo on the cover of his pa per. Shortly after this paper came to \nSyncsort’s attention during the he aring on January 5, 2005, its personnel \ncontacted Boal and asked him to remove th e paper from his Internet site. It has \nbeen removed. Pl. Ex. 584 ¶ 23; Def. Ex. 5. \n \n(iv) IT ToolBox forum discussions are each brief discussions fr om 2004 that address \none or two minute aspects of the scripts characterized by repe ated suggestions by \na Syncsort employee, Gary Spauldin g, to “contact technical support” and \nculminating in Spaulding expressly instructing a forum participant that had posted \ncommand language syntax that “since the syntax is proprietary to the company \nand intended for licensed users only, we would appreciate it if SyncSort syntax \nwas not posted to public forums. Licensed us ers who need help with the specific Case 2:04-cv-03623-WHW-MCA   Document 192   Filed 08/18/11   Page 17 of 36 PageID:\n <pageID>32 \n further finds that IRI knowingly misappropriated this trade secret  in the use of a copy of the \nReference Guide obtained from Brazil and job-control scripts. \nB. IRI is Liable for Unfair Competition  \nFor the same substantive reasons that IRI is li able to Syncsort for misappropriation of trade \nsecrets, IRI is liable for unfair competition. See Hoffman-La Roche Inc. v.Genpharm Inc. , 50 F. \nSupp. 2d 367, 380-81 (D.N.J. 1999) (Walls, J.) (misappropriation of a trade secret constitutes unfair competition under New Jersey law). \nC. Injunctive Relief  \nWhen assessing the merits of a request for inj unctive relief in a di versity of citizenship \naction, federal courts generally will apply state law. 13 Moore’ s Federal Practice - Civil § 65.07; \n28 U.S.C. § 1652 (“The laws of the several states, except where the Constitution or treaties of the \nUnited States or Acts of Congress otherwise requ ire or provide, shall be regarded as rules of \ndecision in civil actions in the courts of th e United States, in cases where they apply.”). \nTo obtain a permanent injunction, New Jersey  relies upon “proof th at the applicant’s \nlegal right to such reli ef has been established and that the injunction is necessary to prevent a \ncontinuing, irreparable injury.”  Verna v. Links at Valleybrook Neighborhood Ass’n , 371 N.J. \nSuper. 77, 89 (App. Div. 2004). Such is demonstrat ed by the factors found in the Restatement \n(Second) of Torts:  \n(1) the character of the interest to be protected; (2) the relative \nadequacy of the injunction to the plaintiff as compared with other \nremedies; (3) the unreasonable delay in bringing suit; (4) any \nrelated misconduct by plaintiff; (5) the comparison of hardship to \nplaintiff if relief is denied, and hardship to defendant if relief is \ngranted; (6) the interests of othe rs, including the public; and (7) the \npracticality of framing the order or judgment \n Case 2:04-cv-03623-WHW-MCA   Document 192   Filed 08/18/11   Page 32 of 36 PageID:\n <pageID>33 \n Sheppard v. Township of Frankford , 617 A.2d 666, 669 (N.J. App. Div. 1992) (quoting \nRestatement (Second) of Torts § 936 (1977)).  \n1. Syncsort’s Property Interest Is of a Ch aracter That Should be Protected \nSyncsort’s property interest in  its trade secret is worthy of  protection. Courts have not \nhesitated to enjoin competitor s from using trade secrets. See, e.g. , Rohm & Haas , 689 F.2d at \n433. \n2. Money Damages Are Inadequate \nMoney damages are inadequate because IRI’s misappropriation is c ontinuing, irreparable \nharm. The sole purpose of the ssu2scl translator is  to lure Syncsort’s cu stomers, if IRI is not \nenjoined from use of Syncsort’s trade secret, it will, in all likelihood cont inue to use Syncsort’s \nproprietary information to compete against Syncso rt. Even if a damage award were available in \nthis case and damages were presently ascertainable, a monetary award would not adequate compensate for future lost goodwill and commer cial profits. Moreover, the nature of trade \nsecrets demand injunctive relief: if IRI is permitt ed to continue using th e proprietary information, \nthe information may no longer be considered secret a nd once lost, a trade secret  is lost forever. It \nwould be difficult to quantify the exte nt of the loss of secrecy status. \n3. Syncsort Promptly Sued IRI  \nSyncsort sued IRI within four  months of learning of the misappropriation. There was no \ndelay, nor have the defendants suggested that there was. \n4. There is No Evidence of Misconduct by Syncsort  \nThere is no evidence that Syncsort has unclean hands in this matter. \n  Case 2:04-cv-03623-WHW-MCA   Document 192   Filed 08/18/11   Page 33 of 36 PageID:\n <pageID>34 \n 5. The Balance of Hardships Favors Syncsort \nAs discussed, without an injunction, Syncsort will likely continue to  face the prospect of \nlost customers and continued misappropriation of its  trade secrets. Even if IRI claimed hardship \nfrom an injunction (it is not clear that it does),  those claims are illegitimate as Syncsort only \nseeks an injunction agai nst IRI’s law-breaking. See York Intern. Corp., IMECO, LLC v. York \nHvac Systems Corp. , Civ. No. 09-3546, 2010 WL 1492851, at *4 (D.N.J. Apr. 14, 2010) (Walls, \nJ.) (although they may suffer “some economic losses”  if unable to use the disputed mark, they \n“can hardly claim to be harmed, since they br ought any and all difficulties occasioned by the \nissuance of an injunction upon themselves”) (citation and brackets omitted). \n6. The Public Interest Favors Syncsort \nIRI argues that an injunction in this case would harm the public interest, specifically \nSyncsort’s current licensees, because it would restri ct the use of job control scripts by Syncsort’s \ncustomers. IRI argues that these scripts are a licensee’s intellectual property and that the \nlicensees never agreed to limit the use of the job control scripts. \nIRI’s argument is misplaced. SyncSort UNIX lic ensees sign an agreement in which they \npromise not to “disclose any information related to the Software.” Pl. Ex. 441 ¶ 4. Software id \ndesigned not only the computer software, but also includes “any printed documentation and \nmaterials, and any ‘on-line’ or electronic docum entation provided by Syncsort related to such \nsoftware.” Pl. Ex. 441 preamble. This definiti on includes the SyncSort UNIX Reference Guide, \nwhich documentation related to the software. The information contained in job control scripts \nnecessarily includes parts of the command la nguage taken from the SyncSort UNIX Reference \nGuide. It follows that the job c ontrol scripts contain at least so me proprietary information, which Case 2:04-cv-03623-WHW-MCA   Document 192   Filed 08/18/11   Page 34 of 36 PageID:\n <pageID>35 \n licensees have agreed not to disclose. There is  no harm to them by prohibiting IRI from inducing \nlicensees to breach the licensing agreements. \n7. There Is No Impractically to Issuing the Order Granting Injunctive \nRelief \n \nInjunctive relief here requires an order that  IRI will cease from using Syncsort’s trade \nsecrets, specifically in the form of a translator and use of proprietary kno wledge gained from job \ncontrol scripts and the SyncSort UNIX Reference Guide. IRI points to no reason why it would be \nimpractical to issue such a speci fic order or administering it. \nCONCLUSION \nIRI misappropriated Syncsort’s proprietar y trade secret and engaged in unfair \ncompetition through its use of the SyncSort  UNIX Reference Guide and SyncSort UNIX \nlicensees’ job control scripts to cr eate and fine tune IRI’s abilit y to translate the SyncSort UNIX \ncommand language to the CoSort command language. S yncsort is entitled to injunctive relief. \nORDER \nIt is ORDERED that defendant, its officers, di rectors, agents, servan ts, employees and all \npersons in active concert or participation with  any of them are permanently restrained and \nenjoined from: \n1. using, marketing, selling or di stributing the software util ities known as “ssu2scl” and \n“rescript” or any other software that include s the capabilities of in terpreting, parsing or \ntranslating job control scripts in the SyncSort UNIX command language; \n \n2. accessing or using any non-publicly availabl e information derived from plaintiff’s \nsoftware products, including associated prin ted documentation and materials, including, \nwithout limitation, any version of the S yncSort UNIX Reference Guide and any job \ncontrol scripts written in the SyncSort UNIX language; \n \n3. soliciting or accepting non-publicly availabl e copies of SyncSort UNIX job control \nscripts from any person; Case 2:04-cv-03623-WHW-MCA   Document 192   Filed 08/18/11   Page 35 of 36 PageID:\n <pageID>36 \n 4. making any reference to ssu2scl  or rescript in any website , advertising or marketing \nmaterials; \n \n5. making any reference to the ab ility to translate SyncSort UNIX job control scripts into \nany other command language or job control parameters, including without limitation \nSortCL, in any website, advertisi ng or marketing materials; and  \n \n6. inducing any Syncsort customer to disclose to any of them, or accepting from any \nSyncsort customer, information regardi ng plaintiff’s software products, including \nassociated printed documentati on and materials or any SyncSo rt UNIX job control script. \n \nIt is ORDERED that defendant, its officers, directors, agents, se rvants, employees and \nattorneys, and all persons in active con cert or participation with any of them: \n \n1. destroy all copies in their po ssession or under thei r control, whether located within the \nUnited States or abroad, of ssu2scl and resc ript and all source code and documentation \nrelated thereto;   \n \n2. destroy all copies in their po ssession or under thei r control, whether located within the \nUnited States or abroad, of any non-public ly available information derived from \nplaintiff’s software products , including associated printed documentation and materials \n(including, without limitation, any version of the SyncSort UNIX Reference Guide and \nany SyncSort UNIX job c ontrol scripts); and  \n \n3. provide to plaintiff within 30 days of this order written certification of compliance with \nparagraphs 1 and 2. \n \n \nAugust 18, 2011 \n \n/s/ William H.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**:\n   The court case involves WeRide Corp., an autonomous vehicle company, suing former employees Kun Huang and Jing Wang, along with companies Zhong Zhi Xing Technology Co. Ltd. (ZZX) and AllRide.AI, Inc. The lawsuit claims misappropriation of trade secrets related to WeRide's software and technology for autonomous vehicles, as well as breach of contract and other related claims. The court granted a preliminary injunction, finding that WeRide is likely to succeed on its trade secret claims against Huang, ZZX, and AllRide, but not against Wang.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**:\n   The primary legal issue is whether the defendants misappropriated WeRide's trade secrets in violation of the Defend Trade Secrets Act (DTSA) and the California Uniform Trade Secrets Act (CUTSA).\n\n3. **Court's Holding**:\n   The court granted the preliminary injunction in part, ruling that WeRide was likely to succeed on its trade secret misappropriation claims against Kun Huang, ZZX, and AllRide. The court ordered the defendants to cease use of WeRide's confidential information and allowed for expedited discovery. However, the court denied the injunction against Jing Wang for trade secret misappropriation and defamation because WeRide failed to demonstrate a likelihood of success on these claims.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**:\n   Imagine you came up with a secret recipe for the best cookies ever, and you hired some friends to help you bake them. One of your friends leaves your baking company and starts sharing your secret recipe with someone else to make their own cookie shop. You take them to court, and the judge says that you have a good chance of winning the case against some of your former friends because your cookie recipe is your protected secret, and they're not supposed to share it. The judge stops your old friends from using your recipe until the case is over.",

Background \nIn the past number of years, eac h of the parties has worked to develop autonomous \nvehicles for the Chinese marke t.  Autonomous vehicle technology  is still young, but it could well \nbe the next disruptive technology worth trillions  of dollars over the coming decades.  Roger \nLanctot, Strategy Analytics, Accelerating the Future: The Ec onomic Impact of the Emerging \nPassenger Economy  5 (2017), available at  https://newsroom.intel.com/newsroom/wp-\ncontent/uploads/sites/11/2017/05/ passenger-economy.pdf.  It has  the potential to remake the \nindustry and market for both vehi cles and ride-ha iling services .  See generally id.   Unsurprisingly, \nthe autonomous vehicle industry is crowded with competitors.  See Huang Decl. ¶ 6.  WeRide \nclaims to have invested at least $45 million to develop its cod e base alone.  Li Decl. ¶¶ 10-11.  \nLast year, AllRide and/or ZZX  announced plans to hire 100 engin eers before the end of 2018.  \nZhang Decl. ¶ 29.   \nAutonomous vehicles are base d on complex technology that requir es significant time and \nresources to develop.  It may take weeks to develop basic compu ter modules before starting road \ntests with a safety driver at the steeri ng wheel.  Walte r Decl. ¶¶ 58, 62 .  Developers use a process \ncalled “deep learning” to teach the autonomous vehicle systems how to respond to new or \nunexpected events by entering lar ge amounts of exemplary data i nto the systems’ algorithms.

Lu Decl. ¶ 7.  Around \nthat time, WeRide co -founders Tony Han and Y an Li recruited Hua ng to join as the Director of \nHardware Engineering.  Id.   \nWeRide has developed modules in i ts code base related to three areas relevant here: HD \nmapping, sensor fusion-based local ization, and state machines.  Autonomous vehicles require \nspecial maps, called HD maps, w hich are constructed by test veh icles repeatedly driving through a \ncertain area while collecting da ta with multiple sensors.  Walt er Decl. ¶¶ 23-25.  Sensor fusion-\nbased localization is the proce ss of combining data collected b y the various sensors on a vehicle \n(the “sensor-fusion”) and then us ing that data to pinpoint the vehicle’s location in a mapped area \n(the “localization”).  Id. ¶ 68.  State machines are decisi on models that decide how an au tonomous \nvehicle will act or preform in di fferent scenarios or “states.”   Id. ¶ 80.  WeRide did not invent \nthese concepts, but it claims the source code and algorithms it  developed to implement them are its \ntrade secrets.  Walter Ex.

AllRide and ZZX’s Untimely Filing \nOn March 18, 2019—just three days be fore the scheduled hearing on this Motion—ZZX \nand AllRide moved for leave to f ile supplemental briefing and a ttached a proposed supplemental \nbrief.  Dkt. 112.  The factual basis for the proposed brief res ts entirely on the document for which \nHuang requested judicial not ice on March 14, 2019, and their ar gument in the proposed brief \nlargely tracks an argument made  Huang makes in his Motion to Di smiss.

The Court \nsimilarly DENIES Wang’s request f or judicial notice of the same  document as to this Motion.  \nDkt. 113. III. Legal Standard \nA preliminary injunction is an “extraordinary remedy that may o nly be awarded upon a \nclear showing that the  plaintiff is entitle d to such relief.”  Winter v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc ., \n555 U.S. 7, 22 (2008).  To obtain a p reliminary injunction, a p laintiff must show “ that he is likely \nto succeed on the merits, that he  is likely to suffer irreparab le harm in the absence of preliminary \nrelief, that the balance of equities tips in his favor, and tha t an injunction is in t he public interest.”  \nId. at 20.  The Ninth Circuit has held that courts may “balance” “ the elements of the preliminary \ninjunction test . . . so that a st ronger showing of one element  may offset a weaker showing of \nanother.”  All. for the Wild Rockies v. Cottrell , 632 F.3d 1127, 1131 (9th Cir. 2011).  Thus, a court \nmay issue a preliminary injuncti on where the plaintiff raises “ serious questions going to the merits \nand the balance of hardships tilt s sharply” in the plaintiff’s favor, assuming the other two elements \nhave been met.  Id. at 1131-32.  The Court does not accept Wang’s argument that th e “serious \nquestion” was overruled by t he Supreme Court in Winter .  Wang O’ppn at 8 n.1.  The Ninth \nCircuit has expressly held that “the ‘serious questions’ approa ch survives Winter  when applied as \npart of the four-element Winter  test.”  Cottrell , 632 F.3d 1127 at 1131-32 .  \nAllRide and ZZX raise many objec tions to the evidence offered b y WeRide.  District \ncourts, though, “may give . . . inadmissible evidence some weig ht . . . [to] prevent[] irreparable \nharm before trial.”  Johnson v. Couturier , 572 F.3d 1067, 1083 (9th Cir. 2009).  For example, \ndistrict courts may consider he arsay on a motion for a prelimin ary injunction.  Id.  However, the \nCourt does not suggest that ev identiary issues  should have no b earing on its consideration of the \nMotion.  Rather, evidentiary issu es “properly go to weight rath er than admissibility.”  Go Daddy \nOperating Co., LLC v. Ghaznavi , 2018 WL 1091257, at *14 (N.D. Cal. Feb. 28, 2018).

Success on the Merits \nA. Trade Secret Misappropriation \nWeRide brings trade secret misa ppropriation claim s against all Defendants under the \nfederal Defend Trade Secrets A ct (“DTSA”) (18 U.S.C. § 1836) an d California Uniform Trade \nSecrets Act (“CUTSA”) (Cal . Civ. Code § 3426.1).  To commence d iscovery and to obtain a \npreliminary injunction, a plainti ff must first identify its all eged trade secrets with “reasonable \nparticularity.”  Cal . Civ. Proc. Code § 2019.210; Action Learning Sys., Inc. v. Crowe , 2014 WL \n12564011, at *4 (C.D. Cal. Aug. 11, 2014).  Both laws require a  plaintiff to show that it possessed \na trade secret, that the defenda nt misappropriated the trade se cret, and that the defendant’s conduct \ndamaged the plaintiff.3  Space Data Corp. v. X , 2017 WL 5013363, at *1 (N.D. Cal. Feb. 16, \n2017) (citing 18 U.S.C. § 1839(5)  and Cal. Civ. Code § 3426.1(b )).  A “trade secret” is \ninformation that (1) derives inde pendent economic value, actual  or potential, from not being \ngenerally known to, or readily a scertainable by other people wh o can obtain economic value from \nits disclosure or use and (2) is subject to reasonable efforts to maintain its secrecy.  18 U.S.C. \n§ 1839(3); Cal. Civ. Code § 3426.1(d) .  “Misappropriation” mean s acquisition of a trade secret \nthrough means that the party kne w or should have known were imp roper, such as theft or breach \nof a duty to maintain secr ecy.  18 U.S.C. § 1839(5); Cal. Civ. Code § 3426.1(b).  A party may be \nliable for misappropriation if they knew or had reason to know that a trade secret it uses was \nderived from a person who acquire d it through improper means. 1 8 U.S.C. § 1839(5); Cal. Civ. \nCode § 3426.1(b).     \n1. Reasonable Particularity  \nSection 2019.210 of the California Code of Civil Procedure requ ires plaintiffs to identify \ntheir alleged trade secrets wit h reasonable part icularity “to l imit the permissible scope of discovery \nby distinguishing the trade secret s from matters of general kno wledge in the trade or of special \nknowledge of those persons skilled in the trade.”  Advanced Modular Sputtering, Inc. v. Superior \n                                                 \n3 Damages are discussed in the section on irreparable harm. Case 5:18-cv-07233-EJD   Document 121   Filed 04/01/19   Page 9 of 28 \nCase No.: 5:18-cv-07233-EJD  \nORDER GRANTING IN PART AND DENYING IN PART MOTION FOR PRELIMINA RY \nINJUNCTION \n 10 1 \n2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 \n10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 United States District Court \nNorthern District of Californi a Court , 132 Cal. App. 4th 826, 835 (2005).  The plaintiff “need not s pell out the details” of the \nalleged trade secrets, but instead provide sufficient identific ation so that the court and the \ndefendant may “ascertain at le ast the boundaries within which t he secret lies.”  Space Data Corp ., \n2017 WL 5013363, at *2.   \nWeRide filed its identification of  10 trade secrets concurrentl y with the Motion.  Walter \nEx. B.  The alleged trade secrets are source code for certain of WeRide’s HD mapping, fusion \nsensor-based localiz ation, and state machin es capabilities.  Ac ross the 20-page filing, WeRide \ndescribes the functionality of each trade secret.  Id.  WeRide also names numerous files in its code \nbase, such as  or \n, that reflect the source co de specific to each alleged trade \nsecret.  E.g., Id. at 6, 19.  \nZZX, AllRide and Huang argue that We Ride’s identification is in sufficient.  First, they \nargue that when the alleged trade  secret is source code, the pl aintiff must identify the specific \ncode.  But this argument is wrong on the law.  ZZX and AllRide rely on Integral Dev. Corp. v. \nTolat  for the proposition that “[l ]isting hundred of file names without identifying the trade secret \ninformation [ i.e., source code]  contained within the files is insufficient.” 2015 WL 674425, at  *1 \n(N.D. Cal. Feb. 12, 2015).  But their  reliance is based on reas oning that was expressly refuted by \nthe Ninth Circuit on appeal: “I ntegral has . . . identified specific key aspects of its source code that \nit claims Tolat misappropriated. T hus, Integral sufficiently id entified the information it alleges is a \ntrade secret.”  Integral Dev. Corp. v. Tolat , 675 F. App’x 700, 703 (9th Cir. 2017) (“ Tolat II”).  \nAnother case they cite, Social Apps, LLC v. Zynga, Inc., contradicts thei r position.  2012 WL \n2203063, at *4 (N.D. Cal. June 14, 2012).  In Social Apps , the court ruled that “identifying \nspecific lines of code or file names [was] sufficiently de tailed to identify” the allege d trade secret.  \nId. (emphasis added) .  WeRide is not require d to identify the specific source code to  meet the \nreasonable particularity standard.  See also Citcon USA, LLC v. RiverPay Inc ., 2018 WL 6813211, \nat *4 (N.D. Cal. Dec. 27, 2018).   \nCase 5:18-cv-07233-EJD   Document 121   Filed 04/01/19   Page 10 of 28 \nCase No.: 5:18-cv-07233-EJD  \nORDER GRANTING IN PART AND DENYING IN PART MOTION FOR PRELIMINA RY \nINJUNCTION \n 11 1 \n2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 \n10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 United States District Court \nNorthern District of Californi a ZZX, AllRide and Huang also complai n that WeRide’s identificati on is too generic.  The \nCourt disagrees.  As an example, WeRide identifies its HD mappi ng algorithms as its second trade \nsecret.  WeRide specifies that it is not referring to HD mappin g algorithms gene rally, but to “the \nunique algorithms used by WeRide’s  autonomous vehicles to creat e HD Maps.” Walter Ex. B at 5-\n6.  WeRide then provides the factor s a developer must consider in generating such maps, and \ndescribes the process WeRide uses to create the algorithms.  Th e Court finds that WeRide has \nidentified its alleged trade secr ets with reasonable particular ity.  Because WeRide has met this \nrequirement, the Court does not  consider wheth er section 2019.2 10 applies to claims under the \nDTSA. \n2. The Existence of the Trade Secrets \nTo show that the identified sour ce code meets the definition of  a trade secret, WeRide must \nshow that it derives value  from not being generally known and t hat it took reasonable efforts to \nmaintain its secrecy.  Courts have  found that source code can r eceive trade secret protection.  See, \ne.g., Tolat II , 675 F. App’x at 703; Altavion, Inc. v. Konica Minolta Sys. Lab., Inc ., 226 Cal. App. \n4th 26, 60 (2014).  WeRide represents that many engineers devel oped the source code over 18 \nmonths with investments of over $45 million.  Li Decl. ¶ 11.  T he investment and development \nmake the source code confiden tial and proprieta ry to WeRide, gi ving it an advantage over \ncompetitors.  The source code has value.  Huang asserts during WeRide’s “earlier startup days,” it \nderived much of its source code from open source code, but this  does not mean that the source \ncode allegedly misappropriated a  year later was not confidentia l.  Huang Decl. ¶¶ 5-8.   \nHuang cites several ar ticles that describe the general function ality WeRide references to its \nalleged trade secrets to argue t hat the alleged trade secrets a re readily available in the public.  \nSimilarly, ZZX and AllRide argue t hat third parties have develo ped code that performs the same \nfunction as WeRide’s alleged tra de secrets.  Both arguments mis s the mark.  WeRide is not \nclaiming that the functionalitie s of its code are trade secret,  but that the source code itself \ncomprises its trade secrets.  ZZX and AllRide assert that WeRid e made no effort to show that its Case 5:18-cv-07233-EJD   Document 121   Filed 04/01/19   Page 11 of 28 \nCase No.: 5:18-cv-07233-EJD  \nORDER GRANTING IN PART AND DENYING IN PART MOTION FOR PRELIMINA RY \nINJUNCTION \n 12 1 \n2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 \n10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 United States District Court \nNorthern District of Californi a source code would not be readily ava ilable to others.  But this  argument overlooks that Walter \nopines that WeRide’s specific trade secrets are “are neither co mmon knowledge in the industry, \nnor reflected in publicly available code.”  See, e.g. , Walter Decl. ¶¶ 68, 72.  The fact that the \nalleged trade secrets are not  generally known gives them value because WeRide’s “competitive \nadvantage would evaporate if the public or its competitors coul d easily recreate” them.  Comet \nTechnologies USA, Inc. v. Beuerman , 2018 WL 1990226, at *3 (N.D. Cal. Mar. 15, 2018).    \nWeRide must next show that it ma de reasonable efforts to protec t the secrecy of its source \ncode.  Citcon , 2018 WL 6813211, at *5.  WeRide emp loys various measures to m aintain the \nconfidentiality of its  alleged trade secrets.  WeRide restricts  access to its code base to employees \nwho are either on-site or have l ogged into the WeRide network t hrough a VPN—which requires a \nunique username and password.  Liu  Decl. ¶ 9.  The source code itself is encrypted, and \ndecryption requires a unique  username, password, and token.  Id. ¶¶ 7-8.  Finally, WeRide requires \nall of its employees to sign the  PIIA, which includes provision s protecting WeRide’s confidential \ninformation.  Zhang Ex. B. ¶ 4.  The Court finds that WeRide is  likely to succeed at showing the \nalleged trade secrets meet the d efinition of “trade secrets.” \n3. The Copyright Act \nIn just two sentences, ZZX and AllRide assert with no argument that the federal Copyright \nAct pre-empts the claim under th e CUTSA and refer the Court to its Motion to Dismiss for the \nactual argument.  Their request v iolates the page limitations i mposed on opposition briefs by Civil \nLocal Rule 7-3(a).  Because this  argument is not properly befor e the Court, the Court declines to \nconsider it. \n4. Trade Secret Misappropriation Claims Against Huang \nWeRide has shown that it is li kely to succeed on the merits of its trade secret \nmisappropriation claims against Huang.  To begin, Huang underst ood that he was under a duty to \nmaintain the secrecy of WeRide’ s confidential information.  He signed the PIIA and told Han that \ntaking WeRide’s confidential info rmation would be “unethical.”  Zhang Ex. B; Huang Decl. ¶ 13.

Huang’s original decla ration merely describes his \ncomments to Han.  Huang Decl. ¶ 1 3.  In the declaration to his sur-reply, he sta tes that he did not \nuse the specific confidential i nformation or trade secrets iden tified in Yan Li’s reply declaration, \nand that he did not consider usi ng the ‘566 Device to misapprop riate trade secrets.  Huang Suppl. \nDecl. ¶¶ 2, 7.  He never actuall y denies taking or using WeRide ’s identified trade secrets.   \nSecond, he began downloading increased amounts of data around t he same time that he \nbegan considering other employm ent.  Liu Decl. ¶ 22; Huang Decl . ¶ 11.  During the four months \nprior to May 6, 2018, Huang downloaded more than 400 MB on only  a single day.  Liu Decl. ¶ 22; \nLiu Ex. A.  But in the three mont hs from May to July, he downlo aded more than 400 MB on at \nleast four separate days.  Li u Decl. ¶ 24; Liu Ex. A.  Huang ha d access to WeRide’s source code \nas part of his job and he freely a dmits that he has downloaded WeRide’s source code.  Huang \nDecl. ¶¶ 13, 18.   \nThird, Huang does not dispute that h e copied WeRide’s confident ial information to the \n‘566 Device after he decided to leave WeRide.  Kunkel Decl. ¶ 8 ; Li Reply Decl. ¶¶ 20-27.  Huang \ncontests the value of some of t hese files, and sta tes that to t he best of his recollection he did not \naccess any of the identified files after leaving WeRide.  Huang  Sur-Reply.

But he does not disp ute that the files are con fidential to WeRide  or that he copied \nthem to a personal storage devi ce.  Courts have recognized that  similar behavior can be evidence \nof trade secret misappropriati on supporting inju nctive relief.

Cal. 2012).   \nFinally, on the same day that he c opied the files from the Leno vo laptop to the ‘566 \nDevice, he deleted several file s from the Lenovo laptop, cleare d its web browsing history, and Case 5:18-cv-07233-EJD   Document 121   Filed 04/01/19   Page 13 of 28 \nCase No.: 5:18-cv-07233-EJD  \nORDER GRANTING IN PART AND DENYING IN PART MOTION FOR PRELIMINA RY \nINJUNCTION \n 14 1 \n2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 \n10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 United States District Court \nNorthern District of Californi a erased the hard dive on his WeRi de-issued personal MacBook.  Co urts have found that in similar \ncircumstances, deleting files from the computers allegedly used  to misappropriate trade secrets is \nevidence of the alleged misappropriation.  See, e.g. , Tolat III , 675 F. App’x at 703; Brocade \nCommc’ns Sys., Inc. v. A10 Networks, Inc ., 873 F. Supp. 2d 1192, 1216 (N.D. Cal. 2012), on \nreconsideration in part, 2012 WL 12925716 (N.D. Cal. July 8, 2012).   \nTaken together, these facts show  that WeRide is likely to succe ed on its trade secret \nmisappropriation claims against Huang.  While Huang maintains t hat WeRide has not directly \nshown that he copied and took awa y any of the identified trade secrets, “direct evidence of \nmisappropriation is rare.”  BladeRoom Grp. Ltd. v. Emerson Elec. Co. , 331 F. Supp. 3d 977, 984 \n(N.D. Cal. 2018).  At the prelimin ary injunction stage, WeRide must meet the high standard of \nshowing it is likely to succeed on the merits, but it is not re quired to prove its case.  WeRide has \nmet the first prong of the prelim inary injunction test as to it s trade secret misappropriation claims \nagainst Huang.   \n5. Trade Secret Misappropriation Claims Against ZZX and AllRide \nWeRide has also shown it is likely to succeed on the merits of its trade secret \nmisappropriation claims against ZZX and AllRide.  As an initial  matter, the Court examines the \nrelationship between ZZX and AllRid e.  WeRide contends that the  two companies are closely \nrelated if they are not, in fact , the same company.  Mot. at 7.   ZZX and AllRide do not deny it.  \nHuang has noted that his current  employer is ZZX, not AllRide.  Dkt. 18-1.  But given ZZX’s \nownership of www.allride.ai and the date of AllRide.AI, Inc.’s incorporation, the Court finds that \nfor the purposes of this Motion, WeRide has shown a sufficient nexus between the en tities to treat \nthem as closely related for this motion.   \nFour pieces of evidence taken together show that that WeRide ha s, at least, met the \nsubstantial questions require ment regarding ZZX and AllRide.  F irst, Huang plays a senior role in \nthe development of ZZX and AllRid e’s autonomous vehicle technol ogy.  His title at ZZX is the \nVice President of Technology.  Dkt. No. 18-1 ¶ 1.  At the Octob er 22, 2018 recruiting event, he Case 5:18-cv-07233-EJD   Document 121   Filed 04/01/19   Page 14 of 28 \nCase No.: 5:18-cv-07233-EJD  \nORDER GRANTING IN PART AND DENYING IN PART MOTION FOR PRELIMINA RY \nINJUNCTION \n 15 1 \n2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 \n10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 United States District Court \nNorthern District of Californi a was identified as the “Tech L ead of AllRide’s Silicon Valley Of fice, Self-driving Software & \nHardware Specialist, Architect of  Self-driving Vehicles.”  Zhan g Decl. ¶ 27.   \nSecond, the video shown at that e vent depicts an autonomous car  performing Advanced \nCapabilities, such as detecti ng a pedestrian about to cross the  street at a cross walk and passing a \nslower vehicle.  Walter Decl. ¶  27-62.  Walter opines that it w ould have been impossible to \nindependently develop the techno logy for those cap abilities in the 10 weeks between Huang’s last \nday at WeRide and the recruitment event.  Id. ¶ 20.  The implausibly f ast development of \ntechnology can contribute to f inding misappropriation.  See, e.g. , GTAT Corp. v. Fero , 2017 WL \n7035655, at *1-3 (D. Mont. May 3, 2017); Ajaxo Inc. v. E*Trade Grp. Inc ., 135 Cal. App. 4th 21, \n53 (2005).  ZZX and AllRide contest this point, arguing that We Ride does not know when such \ndevelopment began and that it may have started some 19 weeks prio r to the recruitment event.  \nAllRide and ZZX presumably know when they began developing auto nomous vehicle technology, \nbut they offer no evidence in s upport of their argument.  So, t he Court is not persuaded.  Cota v. \nMaxwell-Jolly , 688 F. Supp. 2d 980, 992 at nn.6, 8 (N.D. Cal. 2010).  They t hen argue that \nWeRide’s website indicates that  it performed driverless testing  just five to six weeks after its \nfounding.  But, WeRide submits evide nce that the testing refere nced on its website was not \ncomparable to the Advanced Cap abilities.  Li Reply Decl. ¶¶ 17- 19.  Huang argues that at ZZX he \njoined an existing team of engi neers who were already working o n the technology.  But, he also \ndoes not provide any further evide nce—such as the number of oth er engineers or how long they \nhad been working on the technology.  M oreover, Walter accounted  for the possibility that Huang \nwas joining a “fully equipped research staff” when he offered t his opinion.  Walter Decl. ¶ 47. \nThird, AllRide and ZZX place the radar component on the front c enter of the roofs of its \nvehicles—just like WeRide.  Wa lter Decl. ¶¶ 4, 115-18; Zhang Ex . J.  Walter opines that this \nplacement is not typical, as most designs for autonomous cars p lace the radar at the front bumper \nand/or the rearview mirror.  Walter Decl. ¶ 115.  Walter notes that that this placement is consistent \nwith the use of WeRide’s source code—WeRide’s perception-relate d code would only be useful if Case 5:18-cv-07233-EJD   Document 121   Filed 04/01/19   Page 15 of 28 \nCase No.: 5:18-cv-07233-EJD  \nORDER GRANTING IN PART AND DENYING IN PART MOTION FOR PRELIMINA RY \nINJUNCTION \n 16 1 \n2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 \n10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 United States District Court \nNorthern District of Californi a the radar component was located in that same location.  Walter Decl. ¶ 117.  Walter further opines \nthat there is nothing inherentl y beneficial about that placemen t of the radar component.  Id. ¶ 116. \nAllRide and ZZX respond by filing a depiction of one of Waymo’s  autonomous vehicles that \nplaces the radar component in the center of the roof.  AllRide RJN Ex. 2 at 3.  But, Waymo does \nnot place its radar co mponent in the same location as WeRide.  Waymo locates its further back \nfrom the front than WeRide.  Walter Reply Decl. ¶¶ 33-36.  AllR ide and ZZX’s placement of the \nradar component in the same location as WeRide is evidence of m isappropriation.  See Waymo, \nLLC v. Uber Technologies, Inc. , 2017 WL 21223560, at *9 (N.D. Cal. May 15, 2017).   \nFinally, Huang’s senior role i n ZZX and AllRide’s technology de velopment and the team \nof engineers predating his start make it likely that WeRide wil l be able to show that ZZX and \nAllRide knew, or had reason to know , that Huang misappropriated  WeRide’s trade secrets.  See \nExtreme Reach, Inc. v. Spotgenie Partners, LLC , 2013 WL 12081182, at *7 (C.D. Cal. Nov. 22, \n2013).  Walter opines that AllRid e and ZZX would not have been able to develop the Advanced \nCapabilities in just 10 weeks (W alter Decl. ¶ 121), so ZZX and AllRide’s other engineers should \nhave realized that Huang ha d brought outside technology with hi m when he started.  Taken \ntogether, this evidence is suffi cient to show that WeRide is li kely to succeed on its trade secret \nmisappropriation claims against ZZX and AllRide. \n6. Trade Secret Misappropriation Claims Against Wang \nThe Court finds that WeRide ha s not shown that it is likely to succeed on the merits of its \ntrade secret misappropriation cla ims against Wang.  WeRide does  not allege that Wang himself \nimproperly took any of the trade sec rets when he left WeRide, s o it must show that he is liable \nthrough some connection to AllR ide and ZZX.  It has not done so .  WeRide contends that Huang \nrecruited a WeRide employee to W ang’s “new company,” that Chine se media have reported Wang \ncontrols AllRide and ZZX, that Wang now runs a venture fund tha t invests in autonomous \nvehicles, and that Wang admits  to advising the founders of ZZX.   Wang, though, denies receiving \nany payment for his consulting w ith ZZX or AllRide (Wang Decl. ¶ 27), denies having anything to Case 5:18-cv-07233-EJD   Document 121   Filed 04/01/19   Page 16 of 28 \nCase No.: 5:18-cv-07233-EJD  \nORDER GRANTING IN PART AND DENYING IN PART MOTION FOR PRELIMINA RY \nINJUNCTION \n 17 1 \n2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 \n10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 United States District Court \nNorthern District of Californi a do ZZX’s product development or technical work ( id. ¶ 29), or denies calls media reports that he \ncontrols ZZX “inaccurate” ( Id. ¶ 37), and he denies encouragi ng Huang to leave WeRide for ZZX  \n(id. ¶ 24).   \nB. Defamation and Intentional Interference with Prospective Econom ic Advantage \nClaims Against Wang \nThe Court declines to find that WeRide is likely to succeed on the merits of its defamation \nclaim against Wang.  Defamation i s “the intentional publication  of a statement of fact which is \nfalse, unprivileged, and has a natu ral tendency to injure or wh ich causes special damage.”  Ringler \nAssocs. Inc. v. Maryland Cas. Co ., 80 Cal. App. 4th 1165, 1179 (2000).  We Ride relies on second  \nor third-hand reports of Wang ma king the allegedly disparaging statements.  Wang, though, denies \nmaking the statements.  Wang Decl . ¶¶ 33-24.  WeRide correctly notes that the Court may rely on \nhearsay at the preliminary i njunction phase, but even so, the C ourt finds that these accounts—\nwithout more—are insufficient to satisfy the first of the Winter factors.   \nTo succeed on a claim for intentional interference with prospec tive economic advantage, a \nplaintiff must show “intentiona l acts on the part of the defend ant designed to disrupt” the \neconomically advantageous rela tionship between the plaintiff an d a third party.  Korea Supply Co. \nv. Lockheed Martin Corp ., 29 Cal. 4th 1134, 1153 (2003).  The Motion bases this claim on the \nsame alleged statements as the defamation claim.  Mot. at 18-19 .  Accordingly, the Court finds \nthat WeRide ride has not carri ed its burden on its intentional interference claim. \nC. Breach of Contract  \nThe elements for breach of contract under California law are (1 ) the existence of a contract, \n(2) the plaintiff’s performan ce, (3) defendant’s breach, and (4 ) damages to plaintiff as a result of \nthe breach.  Buschman v. Anesthesia Bus. Consultants LLC , 42 F. Supp. 3d 1244, 1250 (N.D. Cal. \n2014).   \n1. Breach of Contract Claim Against Wang \nWeRide contends that Wang breached Paragraph 5 of the PIIA, whi ch prohibited him from Case 5:18-cv-07233-EJD   Document 121   Filed 04/01/19   Page 17 of 28 \nCase No.: 5:18-cv-07233-EJD  \nORDER GRANTING IN PART AND DENYING IN PART MOTION FOR PRELIMINA RY \nINJUNCTION \n 24 1 \n2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 \n10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 United States District Court \nNorthern District of Californi a its claims for trade secret m isappropriation, breach of contrac t, and breach of fiduciary duty as to \nHuang, and on to the merits of its trade secret misappropriatio n claims against ZZX and AllRide; \n(2) that WeRide will suffer harm in the absence of an injunctio n; (3) that the balance of hardships \nweighs heavily in WeRide’s favor , and (4) that the public inter est will be served by an injunction.  \nAccordingly, the Court GRANTS t he Motion as to Huang, AllRide, and ZZX (hereinafter \n“Enjoined Defendants”).   \nThe Court further finds that WeRide has shown good cause for ex pedited discovery, so the \nCourt GRANTS limited, expedited discovery as described below.   \nThe Court ORDERS as follows: A.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: In this case, the court granted a preliminary injunction in favor of WEX Inc., preventing HP Inc. from using the \"WEX\" trademark in connection with their new \"Workforce Experience Platform\" software, citing likely trademark infringement. AI and automated systems are involved in the contested software and in WEX Inc.'s services, as both use AI for data insights and analytics, though in different business domains.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether HP's use of the trademark \"WEX\" for its software product infringes on WEX Inc.'s existing trademarks, thereby causing consumer confusion and potential harm to WEX Inc.'s brand.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court held that WEX Inc. is likely to succeed on the merits of its trademark infringement claim. It issued a preliminary injunction restraining HP from using the \"WEX\" trademark, determining that the similarities between the marks could cause consumer confusion and result in irreparable harm to WEX Inc.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine you've got a popular lemonade stand called \"WEX Lemonade,\" which is super well-known in your neighborhood. One day, someone else sets up a new stand just down the street and calls it \"WEX Lemonade\" too, but they sell some fancy gadgets instead. People might think you're selling gadgets now or confuse the two stands, which could hurt your business. The judge says that's not fair and tells the other stand they can't use the same name until we figure out if it’s okay in the end.",

T he plaintiff  asks the c ourt to enjoin the defendant  from using  \nany allegedly infringing mark for the duration of this litigation.  Applying the First \nCircuit’s criteria for assessing likelihood of consumer confusion, the Court determines \nthe plaintiff is likely to succeed on the merits because the  marks at issue are nearly \nidentical, the products are similar, the parties use the same marketing terms to promote the products , the plaintiff’s mark s are  strong, and the plaintiff has put forth \nconvincing evidence of actual confusion.  The c ourt also con cludes the plaintiff would \nsuffer irreparable harm absent an injunction because the defendant’s allegedly \ninfringing product is scheduled to launch before this case can proceed to trial , thereby \nrunning the risk of saturating the market with potential infr ingement  and depriving \nthe plaintiff of control over its brand and goodwill .  As the balance of equities and \npublic interest also favor preliminary injunctive relief, the Court grants the plaintiff’s Case 2:24-cv-00121-JAW   Document 48   Filed 07/09/24   Page 1 of 84    PageID #: <pageID>2 \n motion.

To differentia te between these competing uses of “fleet,” the \nCourt uses “vehicle fleet” and “device fleet” throughout this order.

Id.     \n HP spent approximately nine months considering how to brand HP WEX.  Id.  \n¶ 12.

Should the project be revived, WEX \nwill oppose IBM’s use of “WEx.”   Id. ¶ 47 n.22.  \nIn December 2023, HP filed a trademark application for “WEX” standing alone.  \nSalzman Decl.  ¶ 13; Pl.’s Mot. , Attach. 5, HP Trademark Application for “WEX” .  A \ntrademark examiner has since conducted a search of the U.S. Patent & Trademark \nOffice (USPTO ) database of registered and pending marks, finding no conflicting \nmarks that would prevent registration of HP’s WEX trademark.  Id.   According to \nHP’s counsel at o ral argument,  HP believed its pending trademark application for \n“WEX” would not infringe on WEX’s marks because , in HP’s view, the two companies \noperate in different industries, or “silos.”    \n In response to HP’s attempted registration of “WEX,” WEX filed a letter of \nprotest with the USPTO.

Bond  \n 1. Legal Standard  \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(c) provides:  \nThe court may issue a preliminary injunction or a temporary restraining \norder only if the movant gives security in an amount that the court \nconsiders proper to pay the costs and damages sustained by any part y \nfound to have been wrongfully enjoined or restrained.  The United States, its officers, and its agencies are not required to give security.  \n“The purpose of such a bond is to ensure that the enjoined party may readily be \ncompensated for the costs incurred as a result of the injunction should it later be \ndetermined that it was wrongfully enjoined.”  Axia NetMedia Corp. v. Mass. Tech. \nPark Corp. , 889 F.3d 1, 11 (1st Cir. 2018) ; see also Edgar v. MITE Corp. , 457 U.S. \n624, 649  (1982) (Stevens, J., concurring) (“ Since a preliminary injunction may be \ngranted on a mere probability of success on the merits, generally the moving party \nmust demonstrate confidence in his legal position by posting bond in an amo unt \nsufficient to protect his adversary from loss in the event that future proceedings prove \nthat the injunction issued wrongfully.  The bond, in effect, is the moving party’s \nwarranty that the law will uphold the issuance of the injunction”).   \n Although the First Circuit observed that “there is ample authority for the \nproposition that the provisions of Rule 65(c) are not mandatory and that a district \ncourt retains substantial discretion to dictate the terms of an injunction bond,” Int’l \nAss’n of Machinist s & Aerospace Workers v. E. Airlines, Inc. , 925 F.2d 6, 9 (1st Cir. \n1991), district courts in this circuit, as a general rule, require bond to be posted in \ntrademark infringement cases.  See 7 -Eleven , 60 F. Supp. 3d at 286 (requiring a \n$150,000 bond); Pola r Corp. , 789 F.

MILLER & MARY KAY KANE, FEDERAL \nPRACTICE AND PROCEDURE  § 2954 (3d ed. 2013) ( noting Rule 65(c) “is phrased in \nmandatory terms and the conclusion seems inescapable that once the court decides \nto grant equitable relief under Rule 65 it must require security from the applicant”).   \nEven so, district courts are vested with “wide discretion” to set the amount of \nbond.  Axia NetMedia, 889 F.3d at 11 (internal quotation omitted) ; see also Totem \nForest Prods. v. T & D Timber Prods. , No. 2:17 -cv-00070- JDL, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS \n26062, at *5 (D. Me. Feb. 24, 2017) (“The Court has discretion to determine the \namount of the security”).  In setting the amount of bond, courts typically take into \naccount “the potential incidental and consequential costs as well as [] the losses the unjustly enjoined or re strained party will suffer during the period the party is \nprohibited from engaging in certain activities.”  W\nRIGHT , MILLER & KANE, supra, § \n2954.  With respect to trademark cases in particular, relevant considerations include \nthe cost of rebranding and lost sales.  See Polar Corp. , 789 F. Supp. 2d at 240.   \nIn its opposition, HP asks that WEX be required to deposit a bond in the \namount of $2,500,000 if the Court grants WEX’s motion for preliminary injunction.  \nDefs.’ Opp’n  at 20.  At oral argument, the Court sought to ascertain WEX’s position \non HP’s bond request, which WEX outlined in a written memorandum submit ted on \nJuly 1, 2024, following oral argument.  Pl.’s Suppl. Notice at 1-2.   \nIn its supplemental filing, WEX avers that “HP’s request for a bond in the \namount of $2.5 million is not supported by the evidence (or any citation to authority \nin this Circuit su ggesting such an amount is appropriate in this trademark Case 2:24-cv-00121-JAW   Document 48   Filed 07/09/24   Page 81 of 84    PageID #:\n<pageID>82 \n infringement action). ”  Id. at 1.  In WEX’s view, “HP’s request overstates the potential \nharm” because “no changes to the underlying HP product or its functionality would \nbe necessary to comply with WEX’s proposed injunction.”  Id.   In other words, WEX \nsubmits that “the only cost HP would be required to undertake following an \ninjunction would be selecting a new name .”  Id.   WEX further suggests that HP’s \n“digital advertisements can be easily updated w ith a non- infringing name,” hard -copy \nmaterials “can simply be stored while the case proceeds,” and HP “does not have any \nproduct that would need to be sequestered or destroyed.”  Id.  at 2.  All told, WEX \nsubmits “that a bond in the amount of $50,000 (repr esenting 20% of the total c ost to \nHP of its original branding work) would be a more than generous estimate of the costs HP is likely to incur in selecting and implementing a new, non -infringing name for \nits software, and in making the necessary changes to HP’s digital advertising \nmaterials.”  Id.    \nHP disagrees.  Defs.’ Suppl. Notice at 1-3.  HP “respectfully requests that \nPlaintiff provide security of no less than $2,500,000 due  to the costs and damages HP \nwill incur if it is wrong ly enjoined.”  Id.  at 1.  After citing caselaw in which courts \nhave imposed substantial bond requirements, HP says it has invested $14,000,000 \ninto the HP WEX product.  Id.   HP writes that should the Court  issue a preliminary \ninjunction, HP will not only lose its investment in the “WEX” mark, but also spend at \nleast $500,000 to find and adopt a new brand.  Id.  at 1-2.  After analyzing applicable \nand cited caselaw, HP urges the Court to conclude that it has a right to use the “WEX” \nmark.  Id.  at 2-3.

Discussion  \nApplying First Circuit law, even if the Court has the discretion not to order a \nbond, it is appropriate to impose a bond requirement against WEX since it is apparent \nHP will incur damages as a result of the preliminary injunction.  The record contains \nonly general assertions by HP as to the costs it will incur if it is required to rebrand \nits program.27  The Court discounts as hyperbole HP’s contention that its “investment \nin HP WEX would be was ted” if a preliminary injunction were wrongfully issued .  \nDefs.’ Suppl. Notice at 1.  Although HP’s investment in the name “WEX” would be \nwasted, its $14,000,000 investment in the underlying program, the heart and \nstrength of the new product, will remain u naffected.  Nevertheless, it is inarguable \nthat HP will be required to rebrand its new product in light of the Court’s order, and the only estimate the Court has for the cost of rebranding  is the $500,000 estimate  \nprovided by Dan Salzman, Global Head of HP  Workforce Solutions Marketing.  \nSalzman Decl. ¶ 19.   \nThe Court concludes that the cost of rebranding is the fairest measure of the \nproper amount of bond.  Accordingly, WEX shall be required to post a bond in the \namount of $500,000 within one week of the date of this order.  \n  \n \n27  For example, HP claims it  would need to “spend millions of dollars in affirmative marketing \nand other similar activities to re -brand HP WEX in the minds of potential customers, HP partners, \nmarket analysts, and journalists.”  Salzman Decl.  ¶ 19.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: The court case involves Staton Techiya, LLC, alleging that Harman International Industries, Inc., and Harman-Kardon, Inc., have infringed upon nine of its patents related to ear-worn technology. The court granted Harman's motion to dismiss some of the post-suit claims relating to induced and willful infringement, but denied their dismissal motion against pre-suit claims for certain patents. The case highlights ear-worn technology innovations related to sound processing and personalized sound management that use intelligent data processing, including AI, as part of the patented technologies.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether Harman International willfully and indirectly infringed upon Staton Techiya’s patents related to ear-worn technology, particularly addressing if the claims were sufficient regarding pre-suit and post-suit knowledge of potential infringement.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The Court held that Techiya sufficiently pled pre-suit knowledge of some patents by Harman, allowing for plausible claims of induced and willful infringement. However, the Court dismissed post-suit induced and willful infringement claims due to insufficient pleading of Harman’s knowledge, without prejudice, allowing Techiya the opportunity to amend its complaint.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine you created some super-cool new headphones and got a bunch of official patents that say no one else can make the same headphones without permission. You shared your ideas with another company, but then they make something super similar and don’t pay you. You take them to court, saying they knew about your ideas all along and should pay for using them without asking. The judge said, \"You explained that they knew about your ideas before making their stuff, so you can keep that part of your complaint. But you didn’t clearly say they knew for stuff made after you complained, so you need to clarify that part.\"",

AND HARMAN-KARDON, INC.,   Defendants.  Court No. 1:23-cv-00802-JCG   OPINION AND ORDER  This matter involves patent infringement claims filed by Staton Techiya, LLC (“Plaintiff” or “Techiya”) against Harman International Industries, Inc. and Harman-Kardon, Inc. (collectively, “Defendants” or “Harman”), alleging infringement of nine patents involving ear-worn technology.  For the reasons discussed below, the Court denies in part and grants in part Harman’s motion to dismiss the claims. I. Background Techiya is the exclusive owner by assignment of U.S. Patents Nos. 8,081,780 (“the ’780 Patent”), 8,805,692 (“the ’692 Patent”), 8,150,044 (“the ’044 Patent”), 11,489,966 (“the ’966 Patent”), 11,659,315 (“the ’315 Patent”), 11,683,643 (“the ’643 Patent”), 11,665,493 (“the ’493 Patent”), 11,610,587 (“the Case 1:23-cv-00802-JCG   Document 42   Filed 05/20/24   Page 1 of 47 PageID #: <pageID>Court No. 1:23-cv-00802-JCG   Page 2   \n  ’587 Patent”), and 11,521,632 (“the ’632 Patent”) (collectively, “Asserted Patents”), and holds all rights, title, and interest in them.

The ’780 Patent is titled “Method and Device for Acoustic Management Control of Multiple Microphones,” and was issued by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”) on December 20, 2011.  Id. at Ex. A (“’780 Patent”).  The ’692 Patent is titled “Personal Audio Assistant Device and Method,” and was issued by the USPTO on August 12, 2014.  Id. at Ex. B (“’692 Patent”).  The ’044 Patent is titled “Method and Device Configured for Sound Signature Detection,” and was issued by the USPTO on April 3, 2012.  Id. at Ex. C (“’044 Patent”).  The ’966 Patent is titled “Method and Apparatus for In-Ear Canal Sound Suppression,” and was issued by the USPTO on November 1, 2022.  Id. at Ex. D (“’966 Patent”).  The ’315 Patent is titled “Methods and Mechanisms for Inflation,” and was issued by the USPTO on May 23, 2023.  Id. at Ex. E (“’315 Patent”).  The ’643 Patent is titled “Method and Device for In Ear Canal Echo Suppression,” and was issued by the USPTO on June 20, 2023.  Id. at Ex. F (“’643 Patent”).  The ’493 Patent is titled “Acoustic Sealing Analysis System,” and was issued by the USPTO on May 30, 2023.  Id. at Ex. G (“’493 Patent”).  The ’587 Patent is titled “Personalized Sound Management and Method,” and was issued by the USPTO on March 21, 2023.  Id. at Ex. H (“’587 Patent”).  The ’632 Patent is Case 1:23-cv-00802-JCG   Document 42   Filed 05/20/24   Page 2 of 47 PageID #: <pageID>Court No. 1:23-cv-00802-JCG   Page 3   \n  titled “Personal Audio Assistant Device and Method,” and was issued by the USPTO on December 6, 2022.  Id. at Ex. I (“’632 Patent”).   Techiya owns patents in the field of ear-worn technology.  Id. ¶ 25.   The field of ear-worn technology encompasses sound processing for personal assistance technologies or hearing aids; intelligent systems packaging, including microelectronics and micro-mechanical systems that enable comfort, fit, and performance; and data processing, including artificial intelligence and big data processing.  Id. ¶ 24.  Techiya’s patented technologies include level-dependent ambient awareness, user-controlled passthrough, dosimetry, personal voice activation in high-ambient-noise conditions, and acoustic event detection.  Id. ¶ 26. No later than September 14, 2018, Techiya and Harman met to discuss Techiya’s patented technology, as well as Techiya’s ongoing research and development efforts, and executed a mutual non-disclosure agreement, which was made to protect disclosure of information even to parent entities of Harman.  Id. ¶¶ 29–30.  Techiya initially met with Harman’s Chief Audio Fellow, Dr. Sean Olive.  Id. ¶ 29. Beginning in October 2018, Techiya sent studies, marketing materials, and prototypes to Harman, with some of the information directly related to the Asserted Patents, such as the “talk-to-hear” technology and ambient awareness technology, embodied in at least the ’780 Patent, ’632 Patent, ’692 Patent, ’966 Patent, ’315 Case 1:23-cv-00802-JCG   Document 42   Filed 05/20/24   Page 3 of 47 PageID #: <pageID>Court No. 1:23-cv-00802-JCG   Page 4   \n  Patent, and ’643 Patent.  Id. ¶ 31.  After Harman reviewed the information, Harman’s Senior Principal Engineer of Acoustics, Todd Welti, conducted various tests on the prototypes.  Id. ¶ 32.  Harman subsequently requested additional information and Techiya provided additional prototypes and shared proprietary whitepapers.  Id.  In early 2019, Techiya met with other Harman representatives, presented additional demonstrations of the prototypes, and showed a promotional video that advertised its patented ear-worn technologies and their benefits to consumers.  Id. ¶ 33.  Techiya sent the promotional video to Harman.  Id.  In February 2019, Techiya sent Harman an “Opportunity Overview” slide deck in a follow-up message to a meeting.  Id. ¶ 34.  The deck contained an enumeration of several different advantages offered by Techiya’s ear-worn technology and a description of patents relevant to some of the related fields.  Id.  Several of the Asserted Patents were identified in the deck.  Id. In March 2019, Techiya met with Harman’s Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”) Evelyn Heinbach, who asked questions about Techiya’s intellectual property and whether Techiya could provide demonstrations and technical background on its patented technology.  Id. ¶ 35.   On May 15, 2019, Techiya presented to Harman a comprehensive valuation model of Techiya’s intellectual property arranged in a spreadsheet, which Case 1:23-cv-00802-JCG   Document 42   Filed 05/20/24   Page 4 of 47 PageID #: <pageID>Court No. 1:23-cv-00802-JCG   Page 5   \n  contained hundreds of patents and patent applications categorized by feature and technology.  Id. ¶ 36.  This spreadsheet contained references to the ’780 and ’692 Patents.  Id. No earlier than March of 2020, Harman released the AKG N400NC TWS Headphones (“AKG Accused Product”).   Id. ¶ 37.  No earlier than April of 2020, Harman released the Harman Kardon FLY TWS (the “Harman Kardon Accused Product”).  Id.  On May 4, 2020, Harman’s CFO Evelyn Heinbach confirmed that “Samsung has done a detailed review of [Techiya’s] patent portfolio.” Id. ¶ 38.  She informed Techiya on May 23, 2020 that Harman would not be “looking to pursue further steps at this point.”  Id. ¶ 39.   No earlier than March of 2021, Harman released the other Accused Products, which include the JBL Live 300TWS, Tour Pro+ TWS, Tour Pro 2, Tune Buds, Live Free 2 TWS, Live Pro+ TWS, and Quantum TWS Air Headphones (“JBL Accused Products”).  Id. ¶¶ 20, 40. On July 25, 2023, Techiya filed its Complaint, alleging that Harman directly, indirectly, and willfully infringed the Asserted Patents with the AKG Accused Product, the Harman Kardon Accused Product, and JBL Accused Products (collectively, the “Accused Products”).  Id. ¶ 20.  Plaintiff seeks declaratory judgment, monetary damages, and injunctive relief.  See id. ¶ 174.

Legal Standard  Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a) requires that pleadings contain a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(1).  If pleadings fail to state a claim, in whole or in part, on which a court may grant relief, a defendant may seek to dismiss a complaint under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6).  Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6).  “To survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to Case 1:23-cv-00802-JCG   Document 42   Filed 05/20/24   Page 6 of 47 PageID #: <pageID>Court No. 1:23-cv-00802-JCG   Page 7   \n  ‘state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.’”  Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) (quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007)).  “A claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.”  Id.  Plausibility requires “more than a sheer possibility that a defendant has acted unlawfully.”  Id.  In considering a motion to dismiss, the Court must assume the factual allegations contained in the complaint to be true and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the non-moving party.  Twombly, 550 U.S. 555–56.  However, “[t]hreadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of action, supported by mere conclusory statements, do not suffice” to state a claim.  Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 679.   In patent infringement cases, allegations of infringement are governed by the Iqbal/Twombly pleading standard.  Golden v. Apple Inc., 819 F. App’x 930, 930–31 (Fed. Cir. 2020).  There must be some factual allegations that, when taken as true, articulate why it is plausible that the accused product infringes the patent claim.  Bot M8 LLC v. Sony Corp. (“Bot M8”), 4 F.4th 1342, 1353 (Fed. Cir. 2021). III. Discussion  Harman moves to dismiss partially Counts I, II, III, IV, and IX as to the induced and willful infringement claims.  Defs.’ Moving Br. at 1‒2.

Id.  Harman argues that: (1) the claims for direct infringement should be dismissed for Counts V, VI, VII, and VIII; and (2) the claims for induced and willful infringement should be dismissed for all counts.  See id. at 1‒2, 4–5.  Harman refers to the ’966, ’632, ’587, ’315, ’493, and ‘643 Patents as the “Post-2020 Patents” and the ’044, ’692, and ’780 Patents as the “Pre-2020 Patents” for purposes of dismissing the induced and willful infringement claims.  Id. at 4–5. The “Pre-2020 Patents” involve Techiya’s patents that were issued before May 4, 2020, and the “Post-2020 Patents” involve Techiya’s patents that were issued on or after November 1, 2022, with applications published on or after July 16, 2020.

Induced Infringement   Techiya filed both pre-suit and post-suit1 induced infringement claims for the ’780 Patent, alleging that Harman had notice of its infringement “since receiving the aforementioned slide deck from [Techiya] in February of 2019” or, in the alternative, “at least since the date of the filing of the complaint in this action,” and indirectly infringed and continues to indirectly infringe by actively inducing infringement of the ’780 Patent by others, such as users of the JBL Accused Products within this district.  Compl. ¶¶ 51, 55.   A plaintiff can prevail on claims of induced infringement only if it first establishes direct infringement.  See Limelight Networks, Inc. v. Akamai Techs., Inc., 572 U.S. 915, 921 (2014) (“[I]nducement liability may arise if, but only if, there is direct infringement.”).  Harman does not argue in this Rule 12(b)(6) motion that Techiya failed to state a direct infringement claim for which relief can be granted for the ’780 Patent, so for the purposes of this motion, the Court presumes that Techiya plausibly pled direct infringement of the ’780 Patent.  To plead induced infringement under 35 U.S.C. § 271(b), a complaint must plead facts plausibly showing that the accused infringer specifically intended  1  The Court uses “post-suit” and “post-filing” conduct interchangeably, referring to conduct occurring after the date on which the patentee filed the relevant claim of induced or willful infringement.

Lifetime Indus., Inc. v. Trim-Lok, Inc., 869 F.3d 1372, 1379 (Fed. Cir. 2017); see also 35 U.S.C. § 271(b) (“Whoever actively induces infringement of a patent shall be liable as an infringer.”).  This requires a plaintiff to allege facts supporting a reasonable inference that the defendant had knowledge of the patent-in-suit.  Global-Tech Appliances, Inc. v. SEB S.A., 563 U.S. 754, 764–66 (2011); see also bioMérieux, S.A. v. Hologic, Inc., No. 18-cv-00021-LPS, 2018 WL 4603267, at *5 (D. Del. Sept. 25, 2018).  “[U]nlike direct infringement, the patentee must show that the accused inducer acted affirmatively to encourage infringement with the knowledge that the induced acts constitute patent infringement.”  Microsoft Corp. v. DataTern, Inc., 755 F.3d 899, 904 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (citing Global-Tech, 563 U.S. at 764–66).  Without knowledge of infringement, there is not enough to establish liability for induced infringement.  See Global-Tech, 563 U.S. at 765–66.  If actual knowledge is not adequately pled, a patentee can establish knowledge of patent infringement by showing that the defendant was willfully blind—i.e., by showing that the defendant (1) subjectively believed that there was a high probability that the induced acts constituted infringement and (2) took deliberate actions to avoid learning of that fact.  Id.   Specific intent is a distinct element from the knowing inducement of infringing acts.  “A party asserting a claim of induced infringement must plead Case 1:23-cv-00802-JCG   Document 42   Filed 05/20/24   Page 10 of 47 PageID #: <pageID>Court No. 1:23-cv-00802-JCG   Page 11   \n  facts plausibly demonstrating that there has been direct infringement, and that ‘the alleged inducer knew of the patent, knowingly induced the infringing acts, and possessed a specific intent to encourage another’s infringement of the patent.’”  Tonal Sys., Inc. v. ICON Health & Fitness, Inc., No. 20-cv-01197-LPS, 2021 WL 1785072, at *3 (quoting Vita-Mix Corp. v. Basic Holding, Inc., 581 F.3d 1317, 1328 (Fed. Cir. 2009)). a. Pre-Suit Claim The ’780 Patent was issued before May 4, 2020 and is referred to as one of the “Pre-2020 Patents.”  The Complaint alleges that Harman reviewed Techiya’s patent portfolio and prototypes and had several discussions regarding Techiya’s intellectual property and prototypes beginning no later than September 14, 2018; Techiya sent Harman an “Opportunity Overview” slide deck in February 2019, which listed several of the Asserted Patents, such as the ’780 Patent, ’692 Patent, and ’044 Patent; and Techiya presented to Harman on May 15, 2019 a comprehensive valuation model of Techiya’s intellectual property arranged in a spreadsheet, which contained hundreds of patents and patent applications, categorized by feature and technology, with references to the ’780 and ’692 Patents.  Compl. ¶¶ 29–36.  Based on these allegations, the Complaint plausibly pleads that Harman had knowledge and notice of the ’780 Patent.  The Complaint also adequately pleads that Harman had specific intent to induce infringement by Case 1:23-cv-00802-JCG   Document 42   Filed 05/20/24   Page 11 of 47 PageID #: <pageID>Court No. 1:23-cv-00802-JCG   Page 12   \n  the users of the Accused Products through Harman’s marketing materials of the JBL Accused Products.  See, e.g., Compl. ¶¶ 43–44, 82, 96, 110, 124, 138, 152, 166 (allegations including images of marketing materials for the JBL Live Pro+ TWS Headphones); id. ¶ 68 (allegation including an image of marketing materials for the JBL Tour Pro 2).  Thus, the Complaint provides plausible allegations for pre-suit induced infringement of the ’780 Patent. b. Post-Suit Claim  Even though a claim for pre-suit induced infringement is plausibly pled, the Court will address the post-suit claim for induced infringement.  The Parties dispute whether post-suit knowledge may support claims for induced infringement after the filing of the complaint.  This issue generally arises when an amended complaint is filed, with the dispute over whether the allegations of knowledge and continuing infringement refer, at minimum, to the period between the filing of the original complaint and the filing of the amended complaint.   The Court takes the approach that pre-filing knowledge is not required to state a claim for inducement.  See Clouding IP LLC v. Amazon.com, Inc. (“Clouding IP”), Nos. 12-cv-00641-LPS, 12-cv-00642-LPS, 12-cv-00675-LPS, 2013 WL 2293452, at *3 (D. Del. May 24, 2013); DoDots Licensing Sols. LLC v. Lenovo Holding Co., Inc. (“DoDots”), 2019 WL 3069773, at *3 (D. Del. July 12, 2019) (concluding that induced infringement claims based on post-suit conduct is Case 1:23-cv-00802-JCG   Document 42   Filed 05/20/24   Page 12 of 47 PageID #: <pageID>Court No. 1:23-cv-00802-JCG   Page 13   \n  permissible).  The complaint can be the source of the knowledge required to sustain claims of induced infringement occurring after the filing date and can provide sufficient knowledge of the patents-in-suit for purposes of stating a claim for indirect infringement, after an amended complaint is filed.  See Groove Digital, Inc. v. Jam City, Inc., No. 18-cv-01331-RGA, 2019 WL 351254, at *4 (D. Del. Jan. 29, 2019); Walker Digital, LLC v. Facebook, Inc., 852 F. Supp. 2d 559, 565 (D. Del. 2012) (“In sum, if a complaint sufficiently identifies, for purposes of Rule 8, the patent at issue and the allegedly infringing conduct, a defendant’s receipt of the complaint and decision to continue its conduct despite the knowledge gleaned from the complaint satisfies the requirements of Global-Tech.”); SoftView LLC v. Apple Inc., No. 10-cv-00389-LPS, 2012 WL 3061027 (D. Del. July 26, 2012) (“An accused infringer is on notice of the patent(s)-in-suit once an initial pleading identifies the patents-in-suit, and a patentee that successfully proves the remaining legal elements of indirect infringement is entitled to recover for any post-filing indirect infringement of those patents.”).   The complaint alone cannot operate to establish knowledge, however, without being amended.  See Wrinkl, Inc. v. Facebook, Inc. (“Wrinkl”), No. 20-cv-01345-RGA, 2021 WL 4477022, at *6 (D. Del. Sept. 30, 2021); Helios Streaming, LLC v. Vudu, Inc., No. 19-cv-01792-CFC-SRF, 2020 WL 2332045, at *4–5 (D. Del. May 11, 2020), report and recommendation adopted, 2020 WL 3167641 (D. Case 1:23-cv-00802-JCG   Document 42   Filed 05/20/24   Page 13 of 47 PageID #: <pageID>Court No. 1:23-cv-00802-JCG   Page 14   \n  Del. June 15, 2020) (stating that this district addresses the sufficiency of amended pleadings for post-filing knowledge of inducement and not the original complaint).   Techiya may seek leave to amend the complaint to allege knowledge from the filing of the original complaint.  See Wrinkl, 2021 WL 4477022, at *6 (“For indirect infringement, if the plaintiff were not permitted to amend a complaint, it would be the equivalent of saying that the plaintiff’s failure to give notice of the patents outside of litigation operated as a bar to bringing a suit for indirect infringement”).  Because the Court found sufficient allegations to support a pre-suit induced infringement claim, Techiya may choose to not amend its post-suit claim.  The Court would allow Techiya to amend its complaint to provide sufficient notice for its post-suit induced infringement claim for the ’780 Patent if it chooses.  2. Willful Infringement   Techiya filed both pre-suit and post-suit willful infringement claims for the ’780 Patent, alleging that Harman had notice of its infringement “since receiving the aforementioned slide deck from Techiya in February of 2019” or, in the alternative, “at least since the date of the filing of the complaint in this action,” and willfully infringed and continues to infringe the ’780 Patent.

The U.S. Supreme Court has observed that enhanced damages:  are not to be meted out in a typical infringement case, but are instead designed as a “punitive” or “vindictive” sanction for egregious infringement behavior.  The sort of conduct warranting enhanced damages has been variously described in our cases as willful, wanton, malicious, bad-faith, deliberate, consciously wrongful, flagrant, or—indeed—characteristic of a pirate.  Halo Elecs., Inc. v. Pulse Elecs. Inc. (“Halo”), 579 U.S. 93, 104–05 (2016). For willful infringement claims, “the patentee must allege facts in its pleading plausibly demonstrating that the accused infringer had committed subjective willful infringement as of the date of the filing of the willful infringement claim.”  Välinge Innovation AB v. Halstead New England Corp., No. 16-cv-01082-LPS, 2018 WL 2411218, at *10–12 (D. Del. May 29, 2018), report and recommendation adopted, 2018 WL 11013901 (D. Del. Nov. 6, 2018).  “The subjective willfulness of a patent infringer, intentional or knowing, may warrant enhanced damages, without regard to whether his infringement was objectively reckless.”  Halo, 579 U.S. at 105; see also WBIP, LLC v. Kohler Co., 829 F.3d 1317, 1341 (Fed. Cir. 2016).  Subjective willfulness may be found when “the risk of infringement ‘was either known or so obvious that it should have been known to Case 1:23-cv-00802-JCG   Document 42   Filed 05/20/24   Page 15 of 47 PageID #: <pageID>Court No. 1:23-cv-00802-JCG   Page 16   \n  the accused infringer.’”  Halo, 579 U.S. at 101 (quoting In re Seagate Techs., LLC, 497 F.3d 1360, 1371 (Fed. Cir. 2007)). a. Pre-Suit Claim The Complaint alleges that Harman “knew and should have known that [its] actions would cause direct and induced infringement of the ’780 Patent, and on information and belief, [Harman has] monitored the substantial prior art submissions made prior to issuance of the ’780 [P]atent.”  Compl. ¶ 59.  At the pleading stage, the patentee “must allege facts in its pleading plausibly demonstrating that the accused infringer had committed subjective willful infringement as of the date of the filing of the willful infringement claim.”  Välinge Innovation AB, 2018 WL 2411218, at *10–12.  This standard can be distilled into three elements, that the accused infringer: (1) was aware of the patent, (2) infringed the patent after becoming aware of its existence, and (3) knew or should have known that its conduct amounted to infringement.  See id. at *13. Considering the discussions between Harman and Techiya, which involved Techiya’s sharing of studies, marketing materials, prototypes, a spreadsheet and an “Opportunity Overview” slide deck of its patents, it can be plausibly inferred that Harman had knowledge of the ’780 Patent.  The spreadsheet included a comprehensive valuation model of Techiya’s intellectual property and contained hundreds of patents and patent applications, categorized by feature and technology, Case 1:23-cv-00802-JCG   Document 42   Filed 05/20/24   Page 16 of 47 PageID #: <pageID>Court No. 1:23-cv-00802-JCG   Page 17   \n  also referencing the ’780 and ’692 Patents.  Compl. ¶ 38.  Harman’s CFO also made a “detailed review” of Techiya’s patent portfolio, rejecting the potential licensing agreement between Techiya and Harman on May 4, 2020.  Given the amount of knowledge that Harman had about the Pre-2020 Patents, the alleged facts viewed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party plausibly support the inference that Harman knew that the Accused Products infringed the ’780 Patent.  Because the Complaint adequately states that Harman had pre-suit knowledge and knowingly infringed the ’780 Patent, Techiya’s pre-suit willful infringement of the ’780 Patent is sufficiently pled. b. Post-Suit Claim Even though a pre-suit claim for willful infringement is plausibly pled, the Court will address the post-suit claim for willful infringement. The Parties dispute whether post-suit knowledge may support claims for willful infringement.  Judges in this district have taken different views on whether a plaintiff can sufficiently plead knowledge of a patent-in-suit in an amended complaint by referring back to the notice that the accused infringer received of the patent’s existence via the filing of a prior complaint in the same case for indirect infringement or willful infringement claims.  Compare Cleveland Medical Devices Inc. v. ResMed Inc., No. 22-cv-00794-GBW, 2023 WL 6389628, at *6 (D. Del. Oct. 2, 2023) (Williams, J.) (concluding that the complaint itself cannot serve as the basis for a Case 1:23-cv-00802-JCG   Document 42   Filed 05/20/24   Page 17 of 47 PageID #: <pageID>Court No. 1:23-cv-00802-JCG   Page 43   \n  id.  At least one of the microphones operates to capture ambient sound and generate a microphone signal, and the JBL Live Pro+ includes a speaker configured to emit sound, a memory unit to store instructions, and a processor to execute instructions.  See id.  The Complaint alleges that “[u]pon information and belief when the VoiceAware or Ambient Aware features are activated, the processor receives the microphone signal and detects a sonic signature, such as the user’s voice.  When the user makes a request (such as activating the VoiceAware feature from the Headphones APP), some portion of the data is sent to the speaker.”  Id.   The Court observes that the Parties contest the meaning of “notification,” disagreeing over what serves as an indication that the VoiceAware feature has been activated by a user’s voice and ultimately whether an actual notification (such as notice from the interface application) is necessary or if the sending of the requested data alone is enough to constitute the activation of the feature.  On a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, the Court considers only the sufficiency of the pleadings and does not make factual findings or consider claims on their merits.  Claim construction is not proper at this stage.  In addition, not every single element of a patent claim needs to be pled for a plausible claim.  See Bot M8, 4 F.4th at 1352.  The allegations identify the infringing accused product (the JBL Live Pro+) and the specific functionality that is infringing (by describing how the VoiceAware and Ambient Aware features work, such as through the receipt of a microphone signal and the Case 1:23-cv-00802-JCG   Document 42   Filed 05/20/24   Page 43 of 47 PageID #: <pageID>Court No. 1:23-cv-00802-JCG   Page 44   \n  detection of a sonic signature to activate the feature).  Therefore, the Court holds that the Complaint sufficiently pleads direct infringement of the ’587 Patent.  2. Induced Infringement   Techiya filed a post-suit induced infringement claim, alleging that Harman had notice of its infringement of the ’587 Patent “at least since the date of filing of the complaint in this action” and indirectly infringed, and continues to indirectly infringe, by actively inducing infringement of the ’587 Patent by others, such as users of the JBL Accused Products within this district.  Compl. ¶¶ 149, 153.  Because a claim for direct infringement plausibly exists, the Court turns to the sufficiency of the knowledge and specific intent for an induced infringement claim.  The ’587 Patent was issued after November 1, 2022, and is referred to as one of the “Post-2020 Patents.”  As discussed above, the Complaint is insufficient notice for post-suit induced infringement claims without being amended.  Thus, Techiya failed to adequately plead induced infringement of the ’587 Patent. 3. Willful Infringement   Techiya filed a post-suit willful infringement claim, alleging that Harman had notice of its infringement of the ’587 Patent “at least since the date of filing of the complaint in this action” and willfully infringed, and continues to willfully infringe, the ’587 Patent.  Compl. ¶¶ 149, 158.

Therefore, Count VIII sufficiently states a claim for direct infringement, but fails to plead post-suit claims for induced and willful infringement of the ’587 Patent.  The Court partially dismisses Count VIII without prejudice and Techiya may seek leave to file an amended complaint. I. Infringement of the ’632 Patent (Count IX)   Count IV alleges that Harman directly, indirectly, and willfully infringed, and continues to infringe, at least claim 1 of the ’632 Patent with the JBL Accused Products, including the JBL Tour Pro 2 and similar earphone products.  Compl. ¶¶ 161, 162, 167.  Harman moves to dismiss Count IX as to the induced and willful infringement claims.  See Defs.’ Mot. at 1.  1. Induced Infringement   Techiya filed a post-suit induced infringement claim, alleging that Harman had notice of its infringement of the ’632 Patent “at least since the date of filing of the complaint in this action” and indirectly infringed and continues to indirectly infringe, by actively inducing infringement of the ’632 Patent by others, such as users of the Accused Products within this district.  Compl. ¶¶ 163, 167.   The Court presumes that Techiya plausibly pled direct infringement of the ’632 Patent for purposes of this Rule 12(b)(6) motion because Harman does not Case 1:23-cv-00802-JCG   Document 42   Filed 05/20/24   Page 45 of 47 PageID #: <pageID>Court No. 1:23-cv-00802-JCG   Page 46   \n  challenge this claim.  Defs.’ Mot. at 3; see Defs.’ Moving Br.  Because a claim for direct infringement plausibly exists, the Court turns to the sufficiency of the induced infringement claim.  The ’632 Patent was issued after November 1, 2022, and is referred to as one of the “Post-2020 Patents.”  Because the Complaint is insufficient notice for post-suit induced infringement claims without being amended, Techiya failed to adequately plead induced infringement of the ’632 Patent. 2. Willful Infringement   Techiya brings a post-suit willful infringement claim, alleging that Harman had notice of its infringement of the ’632 Patent “at least since the date of filing of the complaint in this action” and willfully infringed, and continues to willfully infringe, the ’632 Patent.  Compl. ¶¶ 163, 172.  Because the Complaint is insufficient notice for post-suit willful infringement claims without being amended, Techiya failed to adequately plead willful infringement of the ’632 Patent.  Therefore, Count IX sufficiently states a claim for direct infringement, but fails to plead post-suit claims for induced and willful infringement of the ’632 Patent.  The Court partially dismisses Count IX without prejudice and Techiya may seek leave to file an amended complaint.

Conclusion   For the foregoing reasons, the Court denies Harman’s motion to dismiss the pre-suit induced and willful infringement claims for the ’780 Patent (Count I); the ’692 Patent (Count II), and the ’966 Patent (Count III), as well as the direct infringement claims for the ’315 Patent (Count IV), the ’643 Patent (Count V), and the ’587 Patent (Count VIII).   The Court grants the motion to dismiss the post-suit induced infringement and willful infringement claims for the ’780 Patent (Count I), the ’692 Patent (Count II), the ’044 Patent (Count III), the ’966 Patent (Count IV), the ’315 Patent (Count V), the ’643 Patent (Count VI), the ’493 Patent (Count VII), the ’587 Patent (Count VIII), and the ’632 Patent (Count IX), as well as the direct infringement claims for the ’493 Patent (Count VII).

    "summary": "1. **Summary:** \n   Rex Real Estate I, L.P., a Texas-based company, filed a lawsuit against Rex Real Estate Exchange, Inc. alleging trademark infringement. The Fifth Circuit Court affirmed the district court’s decision that Rex Real Estate I, L.P. did not have standing for infringement claims on federally registered trademarks under Section 32(1) of the Lanham Act due to lack of assignment of rights, but reversed and remanded the case to consider claims under Section 43(a) for unregistered trademarks, where automation was relevant as the defendant uses AI to connect buyers with homes.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue:**\n   Whether Rex Real Estate Exchange, Inc.’s use of the name \"Rex\" caused consumer confusion, violating trademark protections under the Lanham Act, and whether the plaintiff had proper standing and protectable interests in the disputed trademarks.\n\n3. **Court's Holding:**\n   The court held that Rex Real Estate I, L.P. lacked standing for claims under Section 32(1) due to failure in proving an assignment of trademark rights from the original owner. However, it found potential merit in claims under Section 43(a) for unregistered trademarks and remanded the case for further proceedings, acknowledging disputes about secondary meaning and actual consumer confusion.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation:**\n   Two real estate companies are fighting over the right to use the name \"Rex\" in their business. One company uses smart technology to help buyers find homes, while the other has been using the name for years and thinks the new company's use of \"Rex\" confuses people. The court said the old company can't sue over the trademark because there's no proof it owns the rights, but it might have a case for confusion that happened before the trademarks were officially registered. So, the court sent part of the case back for more review.",

Factual Background \nPlaintiff is a real estate company founded by Rex and Sherese \nGlendenning that “specializes in th e acquisition and sale of commercial, \ninvestment and development properties, both large and small, in the North \nTexas growth corridor.” Plaintiff only brokers real estate in the state of \nTexas, but it has clients throughout the United States and in other countries. \nMr. and Mrs. Glendenning first entered the Texas real estate business \nin 1987. In February 1987, Mr. Glende nning registered a sole proprietorship \ncalled “Rex Glendenning Real Estate.” Around this time, Mrs. Glendenning \nthought their last name was too long  and began answering the business’s \nphone as “Rex Real Estate .” On July 10, 1990, Mr. Glendenning registered \nanother sole proprietorship called “R ex Real Estate.” On September 16, \n1991, the Glendennings incorporated  Rex Real Estate Inc., naming \nthemselves as the two members of the Board of Directors. Finally, in \nDecember 1998, the Glendennings filed a limited partnership agreement forming Rex Real Estate I, L.P., the Plaint iff in this case. Rex Real Estate, Inc. \nwas named as a general partner with a two percent ownership interest, and \nMr. and Mrs. Glendenning were each na med as limited partners with forty-\nnine percent ownership interests.  \nPlaintiff has used three trademarks throughout its existence: “REX,” \n“REX Real Estate,” and a logo showing a crown alongside the words “REX Real Estate” (“crown mark ”). On January 13, 2015, the U.S. Patent and \nTrademark Office (“ USPTO ”) accepted Plaintiff’ s registration of the \ncrown mark. According to Plaintiff’s submission, the mark’s first use in \ncommerce was January 1, 1987. Plaintiff filed a federal trademark registration \nfor the “REX” mark in June 2018, clai ming its first use in commerce was \nDecember 31, 1987. Finally, it filed a federal trademark registration for the Case: 22-50405      Document: 75-1     Page: 2     Date Filed: 09/06/2023No. 22-50405 \n3 “Rex Real Estate” mark without the cr own in June 2018, claiming its first \nuse in commerce was December 31, 1990. \nAccording to its website, Plaintiff has developed “a diverse portfolio \nof retail, office, industrial and mixed-used properties throughout Texas, [and] REX Real Estate and founder Rex Glendenning have closed hundreds of millions of dollars in investment transactions for private and institutional investors.” Plaintiff has also brokered some residential real estate. At trial, \nMrs. Glendenning identified two instances where the business sold single \nfamily homes. One of those homes was sold to the Glendennings’ daughter and son-in-law, Matthew Kiran, who is also a long-time sales agent for Plaintiff. Plaintiff’s residential listings from 2009 to 2022 include three properties identified as single-family re sidences sold to individual buyers and \nsix properties identified as residences with acreage sold to individual buyers. \nThree of these sales involved parties re lated to Plaintiff or its employees: one \nwas the sale of Mrs. Glendenning’s pare nts’ home, one was a sale to Kiran’s \nson, and the other was the aforementi oned sale to the Glendennings’ \ndaughter and Kiran. The vast majority of Plaintiff’s “residential” listings \nfrom 2009 to 2022 were investment pr operties sold to corporate entities. \nThese transactions averag ed over 238 acres and ov er $6 million per sale.  \n Defendant Rex Exchange offers an online platform for homeowners \nand homebuyers to transact the sale of si ngle-family homes. It uses artificial \nintelligence and other data-based tec hnology to match likely buyers with \nhomes. It started in 2015 in California, and it is now headquartered in Austin, \nTexas. Its business is designed to “help home buyers and sellers avoid \nexcessive costs associated with the tr aditional real estate agent-based \nmodel.” It operates in twenty-five cities in fifteen states, and it first expanded \ninto Austin in 2018. Defendant’s hist orical average sale s price of a home in \nTexas is approximately $365,000, and th e average lot size is 0.38 acres. Case: 22-50405      Document: 75-1     Page: 3     Date Filed: 09/06/2023No. 22-50405 \n4 Defendant’s CEO, Jack Ryan, testifie d that he came up with the name \nRex Exchange in 2012 or 2013 to “mimic” the idea  of the New York Stock \nExchange but make it residential. He fi rst learned of Plaintiff along with other \ncompanies named Rex when his company’ s lawyer performed a search with \nthe USPTO  in June 2014. Defendant’s first website domain name was \nRexchange—“R” for residential real estate and “ex” for exchange. In \nSeptember 2014, Defendant purchased a “REX” trademark from a company \ncalled Azavea that had registered the mark for the following use: “computer \nsoftware for use in search and displaying  real estate information on a global \ncomputer network.” Azavea’s ma rk was registered with the USPTO  in \n2006 with an October 31, 2002 priority date. \nIn Texas, Defendant advertised in print and radio advertisements \nunder the name “Rex.” It promoted its expansion into Dallas using the \nnames “Rex” and “REX Real Estate,” an d it has used a logo with the words \n“REX Real Estate” on its website and promotional materials. \nb. Procedural Background \nPlaintiff sued Defendant for tr ademark infringement, trademark \ndilution, and unfair compet ition under federal and state law. After engaging \nin discovery, the parties cross-moved for summary judgment. The magistrate \njudge issued a report recommending that the district court deny both \nmotions. The magistrate judge noted there were still genuine disputes of material fact as to: (1) whether Plai ntiff’s marks have acquired secondary \nmeaning, (2) whether consumer confus ion was probable, and (3) whether \nDefendant holds priority of use throug h the Rex mark it acquired from \nAzavea. Both parties filed objections, bu t the district court adopted the report \nin full. \nThe jury trial commenced on April 8,  2022. At trial, Plaintiff only \npressed its trademark infringement claims. It called seven witnesses: (1) Case: 22-50405      Document: 75-1     Page: 4     Date Filed: 09/06/2023No. 22-50405 \n5 Sherese Glendenning; (2) Matthew Kiran; (3) Jack Ryan; (4) Robert \nCheetham (by deposition); (5) Danielle  Gervasi; (6) Rex Glendenning; and \n(7) Jeffery Stec. The district court admitted 521 exhibits into evidence. \nWhen Plaintiff rested its case on April 12, 2022, Defendant orally \nmoved for judgment as a matte r of law. Defendant argued that Plaintiff failed \nto meet its burden in three ways: (1) proof of legally protectable trademark \nrights; (2) proof of a like lihood of confusion caused by Defendant’s use of its \n“Rex” trademarks; and (3) proof of actual damages attributable to the alleged \ninfringement of Plaintiff’s marks.  \nThe following day, the district court orally granted Defendant’s Rule \n50 motion. The court then asked for su pplemental briefing on the motion it \nhad granted. After Plai ntiff and Defendant submitted their supplemental \nbriefs, the district court issued a wri tten order granting the motion on May \n18, 2022. It later entered final judgment in favor of Defendant, and Plaintiff \ntimely appealed. Plaintiff only appeals the judgment against its federal infringement claims under the Lanham Act. \nII. Standard of Review \nWe review de novo  a district court’s grant of judgment as a matter of \nlaw, applying the same legal standard it used. Foreman v. Babcock & Wilcox \nCo., 117 F.3d 800, 804 (5th Cir. 1997). Judgment as a matter of law is proper \nwhen “there is no legally sufficient ev identiary basis for a reasonable jury to \nhave found for that party wi th respect to that issue.” Fed. R. Civ. P.  50(a). \nIn evaluating the district court’s gr ant of judgment as a matter of law, we \n“consider all of the evidence (and not just that evidence  which supports the \nnon-mover’s case) in the light most fa vorable to the non-movant, drawing all \nfactual inferences in favor of the non- moving party, and leaving credibility \ndeterminations, the weighing of the ev idence, and the drawing of legitimate \ninferences from the facts to the jury.” Foreman , 117 F.3d at 804. “A mere Case: 22-50405      Document: 75-1     Page: 5     Date Filed: 09/06/2023No. 22-50405 \n6 scintilla of evidence is insufficient to  present a question for the jury.” Id. \n(citation omitted). We can affirm the di strict court if the result is correct, \n“even if our affirmance is upon grou nds not relied upon by the district \ncourt.” Id. \nIII. Discussion \n Plaintiff alleges trademark infringement in violation of Sections 32(1) \nand 43(a) of the Lanham Act, which are codified as 15 U. S.C. § 1114(1) and \n15 U.S.C. § 1125(a), respectively. Sect ion 32(1) creates a cause of action for \ninfringement of registered marks; Sectio n 43(a) creates a cause of action for \ninfringement of unregistered marks. Amazing Spaces, Inc. v. Metro Mini \nStorage , 608 F.3d 225, 236 n.8 (5th Cir.  2010) (“The Lanha m Act provides \nseparate causes of action for infringement of a registered mark and an unregistered mark.”). The same two elements apply to  both causes of action. \nId. To prevail on its claims, Plaintiff must show (1) it possesses a legally \nprotectable trademark and (2) Defendan t’s use of this trademark “creates a \nlikelihood of confusion as to sour ce, affiliation, or sponsorship.” Streamline \nProd. Sys., Inc. v. Streamline Mfg., Inc. , 851 F.3d 440, 450 (5th Cir. 2017) \n(citation omitted). Before addressing these two prongs, we begin with a \nthreshold element: statutory standing.  \na. Statutory Standing \nDefendant first argues we should a ffirm the district court’s judgment \nbecause Plaintiff has failed to show that  it owns the marks. Whether a plaintiff \nhas a sufficient interest in a mark to sue under the Lanham Act is a question \nof statutory standing. “Unlike Article III standing, statutory standing is not \njurisdictional.\n Instead, it asks the merits qu estion of whether or not a \nparticular cause of action authoriz es an injured plaintiff to sue.” Simmons v. \nUBS Fin. Servs., Inc. , 972 F.3d 664, 666 (5th Cir. 2020) (citation and internal \nquotation marks omitted). We apply the same standard of re view to statutory Case: 22-50405      Document: 75-1     Page: 6     Date Filed: 09/06/2023No. 22-50405 \n7 standing as we do to the elements of the cause of action. HCB Fin. Corp. v. \nMcPherson , 8 F.4th 335, 339 (5th Cir. 2021).  \nA claimant has “statutory  standing” if its clai m “fall[s] within the \nzone of interests protected by” the statute. Allen v. Wright , 468 U.S. 737, 751 \n(1984). Section 32(1) protects register ed trademarks and pr ovides a cause of \naction against any person who “use[s] in commerce any . . . imitation of a \nregistered mark . . . likely to cause co nfusion, or to cause mistake, or to \ndeceive.” 15 U.S.C. § 1114(1). This caus e of action is only  available to the \n“registrant” of the trademark at issue, but “registrant” is defined to include \nthe original registrant’s “legal repr esentatives, predecessors, successors and \nassigns.” Id. § 1127. Under the La nham Act, the owner is  the only proper \nparty to apply for regi stration of a mark. Id. § 1051(a)(1) (“The owner of a \ntrademark used in commerce may reques t registration of its trademark.”). \nTherefore, only an owner or a true a ssignee has statutory standing to bring a \nclaim under section 32(1). Neutron Depot, L.L.C. v. Bankrate, Inc. , 798 F. \nApp’x 803, 806 (5th Cir. 2020)1; accord  Fed. Treasury Enter. Sojuzplodoimport \nv. SPI Spirits Ltd. , 726 F.3d 62, 72 (2d Cir. 2013).  \nOn the other hand, Section 43(a) pr otects unregistered trademarks \nand provides a cause of action to “any person who believes that he or she is \nlikely to be damaged by such [infringing] act.” Id. § 1125(a)(1).2 Thus, \n_____________________ \n1 Although an unpublished opin ion issued on or after January 1, 1996 is generally \nnot precedential, it may be considered as persuasive authority. Ballard v. Burton , 444 F.3d \n391, 401 & n.7 (5th Cir. 2006). \n2 The Supreme Court has cautioned that not just any person can sue under Section \n43(a). In a case that involved a false advertising claim under Section 43(a)(1)(B) [15 U.S.C. § 1125(a)(1)(B)], the Court held that a plaint iff must show the following to establish \nstatutory standing: (1) it is wi thin the “zone of interest” prot ected by the statute; and (2) \nproximate causation between its injury and the alleged statutory violation. Lexmark Int’l, \nInc. v. Static Control Components, Inc. , 572 U.S. 118, 131–33 (2014) . Case: 22-50405      Document: 75-1     Page: 7     Date Filed: 09/06/2023No. 22-50405 \n8 Section 43(a) does not require a plaintiff to establish ownership of a \ntrademark as an element of its cause of action. Belmora L.L.C. v. Bayer \nConsumer Care AG , 819 F.3d 697, 706 (4th Cir. 2016) (“Significantly, the \nplain language of § 43(a) does not require that a plaintiff possess or have used a trademark in U.S. co mmerce as an element of the cause of action.”). \nAccordingly, Defendant’s challenge to Plaintiff’s ownership applies only to \nPlaintiff’s infringement claim under Section 32(1).  \n“Rights in a trademark are determined  by the date of the mark’s first \nuse in commerce. The party who first uses  a mark in commerce is said to have \npriority over other users.” Hana Fin., Inc. v. Hana Bank , 574 U.S. 418, 419 \n(2015); Blue Bell, Inc. v. Farah Mfg. Co., Inc. , 508 F.2d 1260, 1264–65 (5th \nCir. 1975) (“Ownership of a mark ‘requires a combination of both appropriation and use in trade.’”). Pl aintiff argues that “the Glendennings \nhave wholly controlled use of the marks from the start—first as sole proprietors, then as sole directors of Rex Real Estate, Inc., and now as 49 \npercent owners each of the limited pa rtnership (with the other 2 percent \nowned by the corporation).” But acco rding to the evidence submitted by \nPlaintiff, Rex Glendenning first used  the three marks in commerce between \n1987 and 1990 as a sole proprietor. Unde r Texas law, a sole proprietorship is \none and the same as the per son who is the proprietor. Ideal Lease Serv., Inc. \nv. Amoco Prod. Co. , 662 S.W.2d 951, 952 (Tex. 1983). Thus, Mr. Glendenning \nbecame the original owner of the mark s when he first used them in commerce \nmany years before Plaintiff was formed. \nPlaintiff claims the Lanham Act permitted it to register the marks \nbecause “an applicant seeking to regist er a trademark may benefit from its \nuse by a related company.” 15 U.S.C. § 1055. A “related company” is defined as “any person whose use of a mark is controlled by the owner of the \nmark with respect to the na ture and quality of the good s or services on or in \nconnection with which the mark is used.” Id. § 1127. The term “person” Case: 22-50405      Document: 75-1     Page: 8     Date Filed: 09/06/2023No. 22-50405 \n9 includes juristic persons and natural persons. Id. While the owner who \nregisters the mark may benefit from the mark’s use by related companies, this does not displace the requirement that only the owner can seek registration. \nId. § 1051(a)(1).  \nUnder the Lanham Act, assignments of marks that have already been \nfederally registered mu st be in writing. Id. § 1060 (“Assignments shall be by \ninstruments in writing duly executed .”). Defendant relies on a Second \nCircuit case to argue that the assignment here must have been in writing, but \nthat case is inapposite because it in volved the transfer of a mark that was \nalready federally registered. SPI Spirits , 726 F.3d at 67. On the other hand, \nPlaintiff argues that no assignment was needed because the marks were not \npreviously federally register ed. In support, it cites Diebold for the proposition \nthat “[i]t is well settled that an assignment in writing is not necessary to pass rights in a trademark.” Diebold, Inc. v. Multra-Guard, Inc. , 189 U.S.P.Q. 119, \n1975 WL 20913, *6 (T.T.A.B. Oct. 2,  1975). However, the Trademark Trial \nand Appeal Board went on to say that “[t]he acquisition of such rights may \nbe established by oral testimony and if such oral testimony is clear and \nuncontradictory testimony it may be accepted to prove the assignment.” Id. \nWhile assignment by writing is not necessary to transfer ownership of a \ntrademark under common law, an  assignment is still necessary. Id.; 3 J. \nThomas McCarthy , McCarthy on Trademarks and Unfair \nCompetition  § 18:4 (5th ed. 2022) (“An assignment in writing is not \nnecessary to pass common law rights in  a trademark.”). As our sister Circuit \nhas explained, “[r]equiring strong ev idence to establish an assignment is \nappropriate both to prevent parties from  using self-serving testimony to gain \nownership of trademarks and to give part ies incentives to identify expressly \nthe ownership of the marks they employ.” TMT N. Am., Inc. v. Magic Touch \nGmbH , 124 F.3d 876, 884 (7th Cir. 1997). Case: 22-50405      Document: 75-1     Page: 9     Date Filed: 09/06/2023No. 22-50405 \n10 At trial, Plaintiff failed to produc e any evidence that Mr. Glendenning \nassigned his rights in the marks to Pl aintiff. In one exchange, Defendant’s \ncounsel asked Mrs. Glendenning, “There ’s never been a time when you and \nyour husband transferred any individual rights you might have had to any trademark to the limited partnership, correct?” to which she responded, “I \ndon’t understand that question.” Af ter some clarification, Defendant’s \ncounsel asked the question again, and Mrs. Glendenning responded, “I \napologize, but I truly do not unders tand the question. Rex and I own the \ntrademarks and Rex Real Estate I is ou r limited partnership.” There was no \nother testimony regarding the assignment of the marks at trial.  \nNo reasonable jury could conclude that these statements amount to \nclear and uncontradictory testimony that Rex Glendenning assigned his \nrights in the marks to Plaintiff. Accord ingly, we affirm the district court’s \njudgment as a matter of law as to Plai ntiff’s Section 32(1) claim for any \nalleged infringement of th e marks after they were  federally registered. \nForeman , 117 F.3d at 804 (Our affirmance  can be upon grounds not relied \nupon by the district court). However, Defendant’s ownership challenge does not apply to Plaintiff’s claim under Section 43(a) for infringement of any \nmarks before they were federally re gistered. We proceed to analyze the \njudgment as to that claim.   \nb. Protectable Marks  \n For the first prong of its claim, Pl aintiff must show that the marks are \nlegally protectable. Streamline , 851 F.3d at 450. Plaintiff makes three \narguments to that effect: (1) the crown logo is incontestable; (2) each of the \nthree marks are inherently distinctive;  and (3) each of the three marks have \ndeveloped secondary meaning. Since we  find a reasonable jury could \nconclude that the marks are inherently distinctive, we pretermit addressing \nthe other two arguments. Case: 22-50405      Document: 75-1     Page: 10     Date Filed: 09/06/2023No. 22-50405 \n11 Based on the evidence su bmitted, the district court concluded that no \nreasonable jury could find that the ma rks are anything other than personal \nname marks. Plaintiff claims this was erro r and that its three marks are at least \nsuggestive because it presented evidence that the marks refer not merely to Rex Glendenning but also to the Lati n translation of “rex” as “king.” \nMarks are classified along a spec trum in order of increasing \ndistinctiveness: (1) generic; (2) descript ive; (3) suggestive; (4) arbitrary; or \n(5) fanciful. Two Pesos, Inc. v. Taco Cabana, Inc. , 505 U.S. 763, 768 (1992). \nWord marks that are suggestive, arbi trary, or fanciful are inherently \ndistinctive. Wal–Mart Stores, Inc. v. Samara Bros., Inc. , 529 U.S. 205, 210–11, \n(2000). A generic term refers to the class of which a good is a member. Xtreme Lashes, L.L.C. v. Xtended Beauty, Inc. , 576 F.3d 221, 227 (5th Cir. \n2009). A descriptive term provides an attribute or quality of a good. Id. A \nsuggestive term suggests, but does not describe, an attribute of the good; it \nrequires the consumer to exercise his or her imagination to apply the \ntrademark to the good. Id. This court prefers to “hav[e] a jury decide the \nissue of the categorization of a mark.” Streamline , 851 F.3d at 453. Although \njudgment as a matter of law “is rarely ap propriate” on the factual question \nof categorization, Xtreme Lashes , 576 F.3d at 232, we may affirm such a \njudgment where the record compels it. Amazing Spaces , 608 F.3d at 234. \nUnder the Lanham Act, a mark that is “primarily merely a surname” \nis not registerable in the absence of secondary meaning. 15 U.S.C. § 1052(e)(4). We also join our sister circuits in recognizing that “[f]or the purpose of trademark analysis, personal names—both surnames and first names—are generally regarded  as descriptive terms which require \nproof of secondary meaning.” 815 Tonawanda St. Corp . v. Fay’s Drug Co. , 842 \nF.2d 643, 648 (2d Cir. 1988); Perini Corp. v. Perini Const., Inc. , 915 F.2d 121, \n125 (4th Cir. 1990); Tana v. Dantanna’s , 611 F.3d 767, 774 (11th Cir. 2010); \nQuiksilver, Inc. v. Kymsta Corp. , 466 F.3d 749, 760 (9th Cir. 2006). A mark Case: 22-50405      Document: 75-1     Page: 11     Date Filed: 09/06/2023No. 22-50405 \n12 can still be inherently distinctive if the public perceives the mark to be \nsomething other than a personal name. 2 J. Thomas McCarthy,  \nMcCarthy on Trademarks & Unfair Competition  § 13:2 (5th \ned. 2022) (“even if a mark  actually consists of an actual personal name, \nsecondary meaning will be required only  if the public perceives the mark to \nbe a personal name.”). However, “the mer e fact that a word has a dictionary \ndefinition does not exclude the possi bility that it is primarily merely a \nsurname.” Lane Cap. Mgmt., Inc. v.  Lane Cap. Mgmt., Inc. , 192 F.3d 337, 346 \n(2d Cir. 1999). The relevant question  is whether the purchasing public \nperceives the mark as a whole as prim arily referring to a personal name. Id.  \nIn concluding that the marks are nothing more than  personal name \nmarks, the district court relied on Mr. Glendenning’s affidavit that Plaintiff \nsubmitted to the USPTO  when it sought to cancel Defendant’s trademarks. \nIn his declaration, he st ated that “[a]mong consu mers in the real estate \nindustry, the name ‘REX’ has beco me synonymous with REX and Rex \nGlendenning as the exclusive source of the REX Real Estate Services, with \nRex Glendenning as an individual bein g uniquely identified and recognized \nby consumers both in Te xas and nationally as th e founder of REX and REX \nReal Estate Services.” At trial, Mr. Glendenning confirmed the statements \nmade in his declaration. But Mr. Glende nning also stated, “I believe in my \ndeposition, I also stated that we also named -- put the crown over Rex because \nof the Latin meaning of king and -- bu t yes I don’t deny that my name’s Rex \nand that it means king in Latin an d we adopted it as -- the name of our \ncompany.” At this point, Defendant’s counsel had Mr. Glendenning turn to \na page in his deposition where th e following exchange occurred:  \nQ. (BY MR. FLYNN) And I’ll -- when you made the decision \nto adopt the name Rex Real Es tate, why did you make that \ndecision?  Case: 22-50405      Document: 75-1     Page: 12     Date Filed: 09/06/2023No. 22-50405 \n13 A. Because I’m Rex, and I’m in the real estate business. And \nit’s my mark and we think it’s an excellent one and we decided \nto run with it the last th ree decades. The real Rex. \nDefendant’s counsel then asked, “When you made th e decision to adopt the \nname Rex Real Estate, you did it becaus e you’re Rex and yo u are in the real \nestate business, correct?” to which Mr. Glendenning responded, “That’s \nwhat it says.” However, there was other evidence at trial supporting Plaintiff’s claim that the public perc eives the marks by their Latin meaning. \nFor instance, Mrs. Glendenning testified that she “came up with the crown because Rex means king and that was th at.” Plaintiff’s counsel also had Mr. \nRyan, Defendant’s CEO, read a portion of Defendant’s response to an interrogatory where it said: “Defenda nt uses its mark Rex alone while \nplaintiff’s mark is Rex Real Estate . Defendant’s mark is most often \naccompanied by a crown, reinforcing the translation of Rex as a king in \nLatin.” Ryan confirmed this statement and clarified that the reference to \nDefendant is a typo because Plaintiff’s mark is most often accompanied by a \ncrown.  \nPlaintiff argues that the district  court erred by relying on Mr. \nGlendenning’s affidavit because it looked  only to what the company intended \nfor the mark, not how consumers perceive it. But Mr. Glendenning’s declaration does not merely speak for himself or the company—he claimed \nthat the name Rex has become synonymous  with him as a person and founder \nof the company to consumers in the real estate industry. Plaintiff did not submit any evidence showing that the relevant consuming public associates \nthe Rex marks with their purported  Latin meaning. Nevertheless, it \nsubmitted evidence that Defendant views its marks by their Latin translation. \nWhile Defendant is not necessarily a member of the “purchasing public,” \nthe fact that some party outside of Plai ntiff recognizes the Latin translation \nsupport its claims that the marks could be inherently distinctive. While there Case: 22-50405      Document: 75-1     Page: 13     Date Filed: 09/06/2023No. 22-50405 \n14 was strong evidence that the marks are perceived by the public as primarily a \npersonal name, the record does  not compel that conclusion. Amazing Spaces , \n608 F.3d at 234. The district court e rred by deciding as a matter of law that \nPlaintiff’s marks are not inherently distinctive. \nc. Likelihood of Confusion  \nThe second prong—“likelihood of co nfusion”—requires Plaintiff to \nshow that Defendants’ us e of the “Rex” marks “create[d] a likelihood of \nconfusion in the minds of potential cons umers as to the source, affiliation, or \nsponsorship.” Springboards To Educ., Inc. v. Houston Indep. Sch. Dist. , 912 \nF.3d 805, 811-12 (5th Cir. 2019) (quoting Elvis Presley Enters., Inc. v. Capece , \n141 F.3d 188, 193 (5th Cir. 1998)). To evaluate whether there is a likelihood of \nconfusion, we use a non-exhaustive lis t of factors known as the “digits of \nconfusion.” Xtreme Lashes , 576 F.3d at 227. The digi ts are: “(1) the type of \ntrademark; (2) mark similarity; (3) product similarity; (4) outlet and \npurchaser identity; (5) advertising media  identity; (6) defendant’s intent; (7) \nactual confusion; and (8) care ex ercised by potential purchasers.” Id. “No \ndigit is dispositive, and the digits may weigh differently from case to case, ‘depending on the particular facts and circumstances involved.’” Id. \n(citation omitted). “In addition to th e digits of confusion, the particular \ncontext in which the mark appear s must receive special emphasis.” Scott \nFetzer Co. v. House of Vacuums Inc. , 381 F.3d 477, 485-8 6 (5th Cir. 2004). \n“While likelihood of confusion is ty pically a question of fact, summary \njudgment is proper if the ‘record compel s the conclusion th at the movant is \nentitled to judgment as a matter of law.’” Xtreme Lashes , 576 F.3d at 227 \n(citation omitted); see also  Springboards , 912 F.3d at 818 (affirming grant of \nsummary judgment because “the great weight of the digits suggests there is no likelihood of confusion.”); Perry v. H. J. Heinz Co. Brands, L.L.C. , 994 \nF.3d 466, 473 (5th Cir. 2021) (affi rming grant of summary judgment on \nlikelihood of confusion). We address each digit in turn. Case: 22-50405      Document: 75-1     Page: 14     Date Filed: 09/06/2023No. 22-50405 \n15 i. The type of trademark. \n“‘Type of trademark’ refers to the strength of the senior mark.” \nXtreme Lashes , 576 F.3d at 227. “We analyze two factors in determining the \nstrength of a mark: (1) the mark’s position along the distinctiveness \nspectrum, and (2) ‘the standing of  the mark in the marketplace.’” \nSpringboards , 912 F.3d at 814 (citation omitted). The first factor refers to the \nfive categories of increasing distinct iveness that marks generally fall into. \nXtreme Lashes , 576 F.3d at 227. As discussed above, Plaintiff has presented \nsufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to conclude that the marks are at least suggestive.  \nThe second factor is “the standing  of the mark in the marketplace.” \nSpringboards , 912 F.3d at 814 (internal quotat ion marks and citation omitted). \nHere, the district court found that th e marks had low standing because many \nother entities in Texas have “Rex” names, and some of those businesses are \ninvolved in real estate. Plaintiff cha llenges the district court’s reliance on \nthird-party usage in other industries, bu t “[a]ll third-party use of a mark, not \njust use in the same indus try as a plaintiff, may be relevant to whether a \nplaintiff’s mark is strong or weak.” Bd. of Supervisors for La. State Univ. Agric. \n& Mech. Coll. v. Smack Apparel Co. , 550 F.3d 465, 479 (5th Cir. 2008). Still, \nthird-party usage is especially relevant  when it falls within the same industry \nor category of services. Springboards , 912 F.3d at 815 (numerous third-party \nliteracy programs using language simila r or nearly identical to plaintiff’s \nmarks “suggests that consumers will not associate the junior mark’s use with \nthe senior mark user”); Sun Banks of Fla., Inc. v. Sun Fed. Sav. & Loan Ass’n , \n651 F.2d 311, 316 (5th Cir. 1981) (A significant number of other Florida financial institutions using “Sun” in their names lessened the standing of the \nmark). “[T]he key is whether the thir d-party use diminishes in the public’s \nmind the association of the mark with the plaintiff.” Smack Apparel , 550 F.3d \nat 479. Case: 22-50405      Document: 75-1     Page: 15     Date Filed: 09/06/2023No. 22-50405 \n16 Defendant claims there are hundreds of entities using “Rex” in their \nbusiness name, including in real estate. It follows this assertion with ranges of citations to over 1000 pages in the re cord on appeal, and it does not specify \nwhich pages in these ranges show other “Rex” entities involved in Texas real \nestate. We have noted that “it is not the function of the Court of Appeals to \ncomb the record for possible error, but ra ther it is counsel’s responsibility to \npoint out distinctly and specifically th e precise matters complained of, with \nappropriate citations to the page or pages in the record where the matters \nappear.” United States v. Martinez-Mercado , 888 F.2d 1484, 1492 (5th Cir. \n1989). The same goes for the Appellee—we will not go on a fishing expedition in search of evidence to  support Defendant’s argument. While \nthere are many other entities named “Rex” in Texas, Defendant has not \nsatisfactorily pointed us to evidence of other Texas businesses using the term “Rex” in real estate. Furthermore, the jury saw proof that only Plaintiff and \nDefendant appear in the first page of resu lts in a Google search for “Rex Real \nEstate Texas.”  Plaintiff also asserts th at the numerous calls it received from \nconfused consumers who heard Defend ant’s advertisements shows that the \nmarks have strong standing  in the marketplace because it could mean that the \ncallers assumed that Plaintiff was the sol e source of the advertising. This is a \nplausible inference for a jury to make. Taken together and in the light most \nfavorable to the Plaintiff, a reasonable ju ry could find that this factor weighs \nin favor of Plaintiff.  \nii. Mark similarity . \nThe degree of similarity between ma rks “is determined by comparing \nthe marks’ appearance , sound, and meaning.” Elvis Presley Enters. , 141 F.3d \nat 201. “Similarity of appearance is dete rmined on the basis of the total effect \nof the designation, rather than on a comparison of individual features,” but \n“courts should give more attention to  the dominant features of a mark.” Case: 22-50405      Document: 75-1     Page: 16     Date Filed: 09/06/2023No. 22-50405 \n17 Xtreme Lashes , 576 F.3d at 228 (internal qu otation marks and citations \nomitted). \nThe district court concluded that the crown logo and one of \nDefendant’s logos are visually distinct because they use different fonts, colors, and design elements. However,  these two logos contain the same \nwords, “Rex Real Estate,” in a similar configuration. Plaintiff also submitted \nevidence that Defendant has advertised itself as “Rex Real Estate” and \n“Rex.” A reasonable jury could find these marks si milar enough to confuse \ntheir origin. Xtreme Lashes , 576 F.3d at 228.  \niii & iv.  Product similarity and identity of purchasers . \n“The greater the similarity betwee n the products and services, the \ngreater the likelihood of confusion.” Exxon Corp. v. Texas Motor Exch. of \nHouston, Inc. , 628 F.2d 500, 505 (5th Cir. 19 80). Likewise, “[d]issimilarities \nbetween the retail outlets for and the predominant consumers of plaintiff’s \nand defendants’ goods lessen the possi bility of confusion, mistake, or \ndeception.” Id. (quotation marks and citation omitted).  “When products or \nservices are noncompeting, the confus ion at issue is one of sponsorship, \naffiliation, or connection.” Elvis Presley Enters. , 141 F.3d at 202. “The danger \nof affiliation or sponsorship confusio n increases when the junior user’s \nservices are in a market that is one in to which the senior user would naturally \nexpand . . . The actual intent of the seni or user to expand is not particularly \nprobative of whether the junior user’s market is one into which the senior \nuser would naturally expand . . . Co nsumer perception is the controlling \nfactor.” Id. “If consumers believe, even thou gh falsely, that the natural \ntendency of producers of the type of good s marketed by the prior user is to \nexpand into the market for the type of goods marketed by  the subsequent \nuser, confusion may be likely.” Id. (citation omitted). Case: 22-50405      Document: 75-1     Page: 17     Date Filed: 09/06/2023No. 22-50405 \n24 trying to reach the defendant. Id. at 1160. There, we distinguished Domino’s \nPizza  and Sun Banks  because the evidence of actu al confusion was “thin” in \nthose cases. Id. Citing an Eleventh Circuit case analyzing Fifth Circuit case \nlaw, we explained that our “precedents give varying weight  to evidence of \nactual confusion, depending on whet her it is short-lived confusion by \nindividuals casually acquainted with a bu siness or lasting confusion by actual \ncustomers.” Id. at n.11 (citing Safeway Stores, Inc. v. Safeway Discount Drugs , \n675 F.2d 1160, 1166–1167 (11th Cir. 1982)). The two companies provided \ndifferent products to different customer s, so there was no possibility that the \nmisdirected phone calls could divert  sales away from the plaintiff. \nNevertheless, we credited this evidence  in affirming the lower court’s finding \nof likelihood of confusion on clear error review. Id. at 1160.  \nIn Elvis Presley Enterprises, we held that  “[i]nfringement can be based \nupon confusion that creates initial consu mer interest, even though no actual \nsale is finally completed as  a result of the confusion.” Elvis Presley Enterprises, \nInc. v. Capece , 141 F.3d 188, 204 (5th Cir. 1998) (citing 3 J. Thomas \nMcCarthy , McCarthy On Trademarks and Unfair \nCompetition  § 23:6 (4th ed. 1997)). Initial confusion, even if it is “later \ndissipated by further inspection of the goods, services, or premises . . . is \nrelevant to a determination of a likelihood of confusion.” Id. (citations \nomitted). Such confusion “gives the ju nior user credibility during the early \nstages of a transaction and can possibly bar the senior user from consideration \nby the consumer once the confusion is dissipated.” Id. In that case, Elvis \nPresley Enterprises (“ EPE ”), the assignee and regist rant of all trademarks, \ncopyrights, and publicity rights belonging to the Elvis Presle y estate, sued the \nowner of a Houston bar ca lled “the Velvet Elvis.” Id. at 191. EPE presented \nthe testimony of various witnesses wh o “initially thought the Defendants’ \nbar was a place that was associated with Elvis Presley and that it might have \nElvis merchandise for sale.” Id. at 204. After entering , each witness had no Case: 22-50405      Document: 75-1     Page: 24     Date Filed: 09/06/2023No. 22-50405 \n25 doubt the bar was not affiliated with Elvis in any way. Id. Concluding that this \nkind of initial interest confusion was still relevant, we observed the following: \nDespite the confusion being dissi pated, this initial-interest \nconfusion is beneficial to the Defendants because it brings patrons in the door; indeed, it brought at least one of EPE’s \nwitnesses into the bar. Once in the door, the confusion has \nsucceeded because some patrons may stay, despite realizing \nthat the bar has no relationship with EPE. This initial-interest \nconfusion is even more significant because the Defendants’ bar sometimes charges a cover charge for entry, which allows the Defendants to benefit from initial-interest confusion before it can be dissipated by entry into the bar. \nId. at 204. Unlike Sun Banks , these instances involved potential customers of \nplaintiff because they were interested in official Elvis merchandise, but they \nwalked in defendant’s door because they  were confused as to affiliation.  \nWith these decisions to guide our anal ysis, we turn to the evidence in \nthis case. Plaintiff points to two in stances of people who inadvertently \ncontacted Defendant while looking to do  business with or contact Plaintiff. \nOn September 13, 2018, one person sent  Defendant a chat message on their \nwebsite stating, “I need REX Glen denning email or phone number.” \nDefendant’s chat agent responded, “W e currently don’t have anyone with \nthat name at this company.” On June 14, 2019, another person sent a chat \nmessage inquiring about a property stat i n g ,  “ Y o u  h a v e  y o u r  s i g n s  u p  i n  \nProsper and areas around there for larg e parcels of land,” but the chat agent \nresponded, “Sorry, we do not sell land and we are not in the Dallas area.” In \nboth of those cases, people intending to contact Plaintiff inadvertently contacted Defendant. In each case, the person inquiring clearly intended to \ncontact or transact business with Plaint iff. Thus, unlike the initial interest \nconfusion in Elvis Presley , this confusion did not present the possibility of \ngarnering the Defendant business befor e or after it was dissipated.  Case: 22-50405      Document: 75-1     Page: 25     Date Filed: 09/06/2023No. 22-50405 \n26  Plaintiff next points to three instances where it received phone calls \nfrom people who had seen or heard Defendant’s advertisements. It also \npresents one instance where a customer of Defendant sent a letter to Plaintiff \ncomplaining about Defendant’s servic es. The district court disregarded \nthese instances because none involved  people who were seeking to do \nbusiness with Plaint iff. However, under Armco , proof that the plaintiff is \nreceiving calls from people who are trying  to do business with the other party \ncan still be relevant even where there is no realistic possibility that business \ncan be diverted. 693 F.2d at 1160. Finally, Plaintiff presents two instances of \nthird parties confusing the companies or their locations. As we have explained, those anecdotes are relevant  because proof of actual confusion is \nnot limited to actual or potential customers. Fuji, 754 F.2d at 597.  \n Plaintiff’s anecdotal proof of co nfusion does not involve swayed \ncustomer purchases or initial interest confusion that can result in swayed \nbusiness. It also does not involve “pot ential customer[s] considering whether \nto transact business with one or the other of the parties.” Sun Banks , 651 F.2d \nat 319. But it has presented instances of potential customers of each respective company mistaken ly contacting the other. Armco , 693 F.2d at \n1160. These instances are re levant, but their weight is  lessened by Plaintiff’s \nand Defendant’s high volume of bu siness and extensive advertising. Sun \nBanks , 651 F.2d at 319. Nevertheless, because Plaintiff has presented some \nrelevant evidence of actual confusion, a reasonable jury could conclude that \nthis digit weighs in its favor.  \nviii.  Degree of care exercised by potential purchasers . \n For the final digit, we determine th e degree of care by looking to both \nthe kind of goods or services offere d and the kind of purchasers. “Where \nitems are relatively inexpensive, a buye r may take less care in selecting the \nitem, thereby increasing the risk of conf usion . . . However, a high price tag Case: 22-50405      Document: 75-1     Page: 26     Date Filed: 09/06/2023No. 22-50405 \n27 alone does not negate other [digits of co nfusion], especially if the goods or \nmarks are similar.”  Streamline , 851 F.3d at 458 (inter nal quotation marks and \ncitations omitted). “[P]rofessional an d institutional” purchasers “are \nvirtually certain to be informed, deliberative buyers.” Oreck Corp. v. U.S. \nFloor Sys., Inc. , 803 F.2d 166, 173 (5th Cir. 1986).  \nPlaintiff relies on the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board’s conclusion \nthat “average homeowners do not use a hi gh degree of care in selecting their \nbroker.” Real Est. One, Inc. v. Real Est. 100 Enterprises Corp. , 212 U.S.P.Q. \n9 5 7 ,  1 9 8 1  W L  4 0 4 7 8 ,  a t  * 3  ( T . T . A . B .  1 9 8 1 ) .  T h a t  c a s e  i n v o l v e d  t w o  r e a l  estate brokerage companies that were “primarily directed to residential \nlistings and sales.” Id. Even if Defendant’s cust omers do not use a high \ndegree of care in selecting their brok er for single-family homes, Plaintiff’s \ncustomers are not average homebuyers  or homeowners—they are by and \nlarge corporate entities and wealthy in dividuals investing in commercial and \nresidential real estate. Such customers are “virtually certain to be informed, \ndeliberative buyers.” Oreck , 803 F.2d at 173; accord  Int’l Council of Shopping \nCenters, Inc. v. RECONCRE, L.L.C. , 2021 WL 148387, at *5 (D.D.C. Jan. 14, \n2021) (“it is hard to deny that commerci al real estate market participants are, \nby and large, sophisticated consumer s.”). Plaintiff’s potential customers \nexercise a high degree of care, so no reas onable jury could find that this digit \nweighs in favor of Plaintiff.  \nix. Weighing the Digits \n Since a reasonable jury could conclude that some of these factors, \nincluding the important factor of actual confusion, weigh in Plaintiff’s favor, \na reasonable jury could also find a “probability of confusion” between \nPlaintiff and Defendant’s marks. Xtreme Lashes , 576 F.3d at 226. The district \ncourt erred by holding that Plainti ff could not establish a likelihood of \nconfusion as a matter of law. Case: 22-50405      Document: 75-1     Page: 27     Date Filed: 09/06/2023No. 22-50405 \n28 d. Damages  \n Plaintiff also challenges the dist rict court’s holding on damages for \ncorrective advertising and reasonable royalties. Si nce we remand for a new \ntrial, we need not address those issues.  \nIV. Conclusion \n No reasonable jury could conclude that Plaintiff owned the marks, so \nwe affirm the district court’s judgmen t as a matter of law as to Plaintiff’s \nSection 32(1) claim for alleged infr ingement of the marks after federal \nregistration. However, taking the evid ence in the light most favorable to \nPlaintiff and “leaving credibility determinations, the weighing of the evidence, and the drawing of legitimate in ferences from the facts to the jury,” \na reasonable jury could find in favor of Plaintiff’s claim under Section 43(a) \nfor infringement of the marks before they were federally registered. We AFFIRM  in part, REVERSE  in part, and REMAND  for further \nproceedings.  Case: 22-50405      Document: 75-1     Page: 28     Date Filed: 09/06/2023",

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: This case involves a trademark dispute between OpenAI, Inc. and Open Artificial Intelligence, Inc., led by Guy Ravine, over the use of the \"OpenAI\" name. The court granted OpenAI, Inc. summary judgment, ruling that Ravine's claims failed to prove a valid trademark due to a lack of secondary meaning and exclusivity, and found that OpenAI, Inc. successfully established secondary meaning of its trademark before Guy Ravine used it in commerce for competing products.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: The key legal issue is whether Guy Ravine’s use of the \"Open AI\" mark constitutes trademark infringement against OpenAI, Inc., focusing on whether either party had a protectible ownership interest in the trademark through valid registration or acquired secondary meaning.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court held that OpenAI, Inc. acquired secondary meaning in the use of its trademark before Ravine offered his similar products commercially. Consequently, the court found in favor of OpenAI, Inc. on all its claims and counterclaims relating to trademark infringement, canceling Ravine’s trademark registration and permanently enjoining him from using the \"Open AI\" mark.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine you and a friend both start selling candy, and you both call your company \"Sweet Treats.\" Your friend copies your exact candy recipes after seeing how popular they are, but they use the same name as you, causing customers to mix up who sells what. The court decides only you can use the name \"Sweet Treats\" because you made candy people know about before your friend started copying you. Your friend has to stop using the name to sell their candies because it's confusing people into thinking they are buying yours.",

The parties also filed motions to strike in \nresponse to the other’s briefing.

BACKGROUND  \n OpenAI was founded nearly a decade ago in December 2015. (Declaration of Greg \nBrockman (“Brockman Decl.”), Dkt. No. 243, ¶ 2  and Ex. A). By all accounts, OpenAI was a  \nleader in  AI research and development from its founding. Prominent publications, including The  \nNew York Times  and The Wall Street Journal   featured the company before it had launched a single \nproduct. (Declaration of Aaron Perahia (“Perahia Decl.”), Dkt. No. 233, Ex. 86.)   Case 4:23-cv-03918-YGR     Document 326     Filed 07/21/25     Page 1 of 19 \n2 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California   Before OpenAI’s founding, a relatively unknown entity  named Open AI was in the works. \nGuy Ravine , Open AI’s founder, hoped to create tools that would allow those interested in artificial \nintelligence to collaborate on new developments. He  purchased the “open.ai” domain name  in \nMarch 2015—months before OpenAI’s founding. (Declaration of Breeanna Brewer (“Brewer \nDecl.”), Dkt. No. 258, Ex. 60.) The day after OpenAI’s founding, Ravine applied to register  the \ntrademark  Open AI with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”) . (Perahia Decl., Ex. 72 \nat 1, 7–8.)  The USPTO rejected  Ravine’s application because the mark was descriptive and Ravine  \nhad not demonstrated  use in commerce, so Ravine filed a substitute specimen —an image of the \nhome screen for Ravine’s product “Hub.” (Declaration of Guy Ravine (“Ravine Decl.”), Dkt. No. \n256, ¶ 29; Perahia Decl., Ex. 72 at 31 .) The USPTO again rejected Ravine’s application  and Ravine \nelected to register  the mark on the Supplemental Register. ( Perahia Decl. , Ex. 72 at 88 .)  \n In the meantime, OpenAI continued to develop commercially. It launched its first product —\nOpenAI Gym —in April 2016. (Brockman Decl., ¶ 13, Ex. B at 6.) OpenAI  continued to research \nand develop successful A I products, including ChatGPT  (a generative AI chatbot)  and Dall -E 2 (an \nimage generator ). (Brockman Decl. ¶  37; Declaration of James Dyett ( “Dyett Dec l.”), Dkt. No. 228, \n¶¶ 16–21.)  OpenAI was also  not able to  register its mark  with the USPTO : one, because the mark  \nwas descriptive and , two, because Ravine  actively opposed. (Brewer Decl., Exs. 19, 25; Declaration \nof Rebecca McCurry, ( “McCurry Decl .”), Dkt. No. 229, ¶¶ 7, 8 and Ex. G.)  \n After the success of OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Dall -E 2, Ravine launched similar chatbot and \nimage generator products on his open.ai domain. (Ravine Decl., ¶¶ 45 –50.)  OpenAI then filed this \naction  in August 2023 to litigate  the parti es’ trademark rights and stop customer confusion.  \n The salient  facts relevant to the resolution of the pending motions are cited in Court’s \nanalysis section of this Order. The Court omits those facts here to expedite this Order  given \nlooming trial deadlines.  \nII. LEGAL FRAMEWORK  \nSummary judgment is appropriate  whe re a “movant shows that there is no genuine dispute \nas to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.”  Fed.  R. Civ. P.  \n56(a) . A fact is “material” if it “might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing Case 4:23-cv-03918-YGR     Document 326     Filed 07/21/25     Page 2 of 19 \n3 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  law.” Anderson v. Liberty  Lobby, Inc. , 477 U.S.  242, 248 (1986) . A dispute is “genuine” if there is \nevidence in the record sufficient for a reasonable trier of fact to decide in favor of the nonmoving \nparty. Id.  “If the evidence is merely colorable, or is not significantly probative, summary judgment \nmay be granted.”  Id. at 249–50.  \nThe Court views the inferences reasonably drawn from the materials in the record in the \nlight most favorable to the nonmoving party and “may not weigh the evidence or make credibility \ndeterminations .” Matsushita Elec.  Indus. Co. v.  Zenith  Radio Corp., 475 U.S.  574, 587–88 (1986)  \nand Freeman  v. Arpaio, 125 F.3d 732, 735 (9th  Cir. 1997) , overruled  on other  grounds  by Shakur  \nv. Schriro, 514 F.3d 878,  884–85 (9th  Cir. 2008) , respectively.  Conclusory, speculative testimony \nin affidavits and moving papers is insufficient to raise genuine issues of fact and defeat summary \njudgment. Thornhill Publ ’g Co., Inc. v. GTE Corp. , 594 F.2d 730, 738 (9th Cir. 1979).  \nBecause of the “intensely factual nature of trademark disputes,” summary judgment is \ngenerally disfavored in trademark cases and should be granted sparingly. Rearden LLC v. Rearden \nCommerce, Inc. , 683 F.3d 1190, 1202 (9th Cir. 2012) . \nIII. ANALYSIS  \nA dozen  claims are in dispute. OpenAI advances five claims against Ravine : (1) federal \ntrademark infringement and unfair competition ( Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1125(a)) ; (2) common \nlaw trademark infringement; (3) fraudulent registration; (4) cancellation —no bona fide use; and (5) \ncancellation —misrepresenting source. Ravine advances seven counterclaims against OpenAI: (1) \nLanham Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1125(a) ; (2) Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1114; (3) common law trademark \ninfringement; (4) declaratory judgment of non- infringement of trademark under the Lanham Act, \n(5) declaratory judgment of non- infringement of common law trademark, (6) declaratory judgment \nof ownership of Open AI mark; and (7) de claratory judgment of trademark invalidity. The Court \nwill group its analysis of those twelve claims into two categories: cancellation and trademark \ninfringement.  \n \n Cancellation of Ravine’s “Open  AI” Mark  (Claims 3, 4, and 5 ; Counterclaim  2) \n A party may seek to cancel a registered trademark that was procured  based on fraud. Robi v. \nFive Platters, Inc., 918 F.2d 1439, 1444 (9th Cir. 1990) . The moving party must prove , by clear and Case 4:23-cv-03918-YGR     Document 326     Filed 07/21/25     Page 3 of 19 \n4 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  convincing evidence, “ a false representation regarding a material fact, the registrant ’s knowledge or \nbelief that the representation is false, the intent to induce reliance upon the misrepresentation and \nreasonable reliance thereon, and damages proximately resulting from the reliance.” Id. ; OTR Wheel \nEngg, Inc. v. W. Worldwide Servs., Inc., 897 F.3d 1008, 1119 (9th Cir. 2018) ; see also I n re Bose \nCorp., 580 F.3d 1240, 1245 (Fed. Cir. 2009) . “[B]ecause direct evidence of deceptive intent is \nrarely available, such intent can be inferred from indirect and circumstantial  evidence.” Bose , 580 \nF.3d at 1245.  \n OpenAI moves to cancel Ravine’s trademark on the Supplemental Register. Ravine argues \nthat genuine disputes  of material fact  exist about whether Ravine submitted false representation s to \nthe USPTO  and whether Ravine intended to deceive the USPTO . He does not dispute that \nplaintiff ’s factual record  satisfies  the remaining elements.  \n False Representation to the USPTO  \nSubmitting a false specimen to the USPTO is a material misrepresentation. Look Cycle Int ’l \nv. Kunshan Qiyue Outdoor Sports Goods Co., 2024 WL 3739358, at *16 (T.T.A.B. Aug. 9, 2024) (“The falsity of the specimens is a material misrepresentation, as they must be accepted by the \nExamining Attorney to demonstrate use in commerce for a Section 1(a) use -based application \nbefore being passed to publication and eventual registration.”).  That includes submitting a \nspecimen  that does not illustrate  actual use in commerce. Dimas v. Matilde , 2015 WL 5768341, at \n*1, *4 (C.D. Cal. Sept. 30, 2015) ( granting summary judgment of mark cancellation where \ndefendant did not rebut that specimens were “fakes” that were “created solely to present to the USPTO .”) Ravine argues that factual disputes remain  because the specimen Ravine submitted to \nthe USPTO was not a “mock -up” and was “online” and “for use by the public.” (Oppo. at 19.) \nThose argument s are irrelevant to the claim before the Court . \nThe following record evidence reflects that Ravine made two misrepresentations to the \nUSPTO: (1) that his product Hub existed in 2015 when he applied for the “Open  AI” trademark; \nand (2) that Hub was used in commerce : \n \n• Plaintiff submitted evidence show ing that Guy Ravine applied for a trademark on \nDecember 11, 2015, the day  OpenAI announced its founding. (Perahia Decl. , Ex. 72 at Case 4:23-cv-03918-YGR     Document 326     Filed 07/21/25     Page 4 of 19 \n5 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  1.) That application dep icted Ravine ’s Open AI  “landing page” found at www. open.ai , \nwhich  stated that an “announcement would be made soon.” ( Id. at 7–8.)  \n \n• On March 29, 2016, the USPTO responded to Ravine’s trademark application. ( Id. at \n12.) The USPTO rejected Ravine’s application “because the specimen does not show the \napplied -for mark in use in commerce  . . . .” ( Id. at 13.)  Six months later,  just before his \nfiling deadline, Ravine submitted a “substitute specimen” which was an image of Hub ’s \nhome screen . (Ravine Decl. , ¶ 29; Perahia Decl. , Ex. 72 at 31–32.) Ravine  admits that \nhe had just released  Hub  to the public , meaning that Hub was not available as of the date \nof Ravine’s initial filing.  (Ravine Decl. , ¶¶ 28–29; Perahia Decl. , Ex. 72 at 34.)  That \nsubstitute filing required Ravine to represent that “[t] he substitute (or new,  or originally \nsubmitted, if appropriate) specimen(s) was/were in use in commerce at least as early as \nthe filing date of the application.” (Perahia Decl. , Ex. 72 at 34.)  \n \n• The hub specimen also included planted comments from Ravine’s employee  Nikita \nGaer, who designed Hub, which does not  demonstrate  actual use in commerce. ( Ravi ne \nDecl. , ¶ 28; McCurry Decl. , Exs. B, C, D, E ; Perahia Decl. , Ex. 16, Deposition of N. \nGaer  (“Gaer Tr.”)  at 226:18- 231:2; 245:20–15.)  Nor does Ravine state  that anyone used \nHub other than the planted post s. Instead , he argues that  Hub was available for use . \n(Ravine Decl. ¶ ¶ 29, 30.)  \n \n• On March 22, 2017, the USPTO rejected Ravine ’s second application because the  Open \nAI mark “merely describes a feature of the applicant’s services.” (Perahia Decl., Ex. 72 \nat 62.) On August 1, 2017, Ravine registered the Open AI mark on the USPTO’s Supplemental Register. (Reg. No. 5,258,002; Perahia Decl. Ex. 72 at 62–63 , 88.)  \nNo genuine dispute of material fact exists relating to Ravine’s actual misrepresentations to \nthe USPTO. Hub was not available in 2015, nor  did the specimen show actual use in commerce.   \n   Knowledge and Intent to Induce Reliance and Mislead the  USPTO  \n In trademark cases, “ because direct evidence of deceptive intent is rarely available, such \nintent can be inferred from indirect and circumstantial evidence.” Bose , 580 F.3d at 1245. District \ncourts in the Ninth Circuit have applied  a “knowledge” standard and have not lowered the bar to \n“reckless disregard.” La Terra Fina USA, LLC v. Reser’s Fine Foods, Inc., 2024 WL 1973468, at \n*3 (N.D. Cal. May 3, 2024). The following record evidence reflects that Ravine acted with knowledge and intent to deceive the USTP O:  \n \n• Ravine submitted the substitute  specimen shortly after Hub was created. ( Perahia Decl. , \nEx. 72 at 33–38, Ex. 10, Deposition of Guy Ravine  (“Ravine Tr.”) , at 228:23- 230:16; \nRavine Decl., ¶ ¶ 28–29.)  Ravine cannot argue in good faith that he did not know  the \ncontent of  what he submitted.  \n Case 4:23-cv-03918-YGR     Document 326     Filed 07/21/25     Page 5 of 19 \n6 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  • Ravine submitted a version of Hub which did not include (or had removed) date stamps. \n(Compare Perahia Decl. , Ex. 72 at 33–38 with  Perahia Decl. , Ex. 84.) Including those \ndates would have shown that the substitute specimen was not available in December 2015.  \nRavine’s arguments that he did not know that his actions  violated the law  are not supported \nby the contemporaneous record. The Court need not credit self-serving declarations given the \nevidence presented. F.T.C. v. Publ’g Clearing House, Inc., 104 F.3d 1168, 1171 (9th Cir.1997) (“A \nconclusory, self-serving affidavit, lacking detailed facts and any supporting evidence, is insufficient \nto create a genuine issue of material fact.”).  Further, deflective arguments that attorneys regularly \nsubmit false information to the USPTO do not persuade. Two wrongs do not make a right. After \nconsidering the evidence, the Court finds that no genuine dispute of material fact exists as to \nOpenAI’s cancellation claim s.  \nThe Court thus G\nRANTS  OpenAI summary judgment as to its affirmative claims (3) \nfraudulent registration; (4) cancellation —no bona fide use; and (5) cancellation—misrepresenting \nsource and Ravine’s corresponding counterclaim  (2) Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1114.1 \n Trademark Infringement Claims  \n To prove a federal or common law  trademark infringement clai m, a party must show (1) a \nprotectible ownership interest in a valid mark, and (2) that defendant’s use of the mark, or a substantially similar mark, is likely to cause consumer confusion. Network Automation Inc. v. \nAdvanced Systems Concepts, Inc., 638 F.3d 1137, 1144 (9th Cir. 2011) ; see also Grupo Gigante SA \nDe CV v. Dallo & Co., 391 F.3d 1088, 1100 (9th Cir. 2004) (“As a general matter, trademark \nclaims under California law are “substantially congruent” with federal claims and thus lend \nthemselves to the same analysis .”) Both parties concede that the two marks  (OpenAI vs. Open AI) \nare likely to, and already have, caused customer confusion. The pending Lanham Act and common law trademark  infringement claims, then, will hinge on whether either O penAI or Ravine has  a \nprotectible ownership interest in a valid mark. The Court will first consider Ravine’s counterclaims \nand then turn to OpenAI’s affirmative infringement claims.  \n \n1 Ravine’s Lanham Act ( Count 2, 15 U.S.C. § 1114) claim cannot succeed without a \nregistered mark. The Court has cancelled that mark.  Case 4:23-cv-03918-YGR     Document 326     Filed 07/21/25     Page 6 of 19 \n7 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  \n Ravine’s Trademark Infringement Counterclaims  (Counterclaims 1, 3, and 6) \nPlaintiff  moves for summary judgment on Ravine’s remaining  counterclaims for trademark \ninfringement under the Lanham Act (counterclaim 1)  and common law (counterclaim 3) , and \ndeclaratory judgment (counterclaim 6). \nTo show a protectible ownership interest under the Lanham Act, the trademark owner must \nhave used the mark in commerce. Sengoku Works Ltd. v. RMC Int’l, Ltd., 96 F.3d 1217, 1219 (9th \nCir. 1996) . “[I]t is not enough to have invented the mark first or even to have registered it first; the \nparty claiming ownership must have been the first to actually use the mark in the sale of goods or services.” Id. When, as here, a trademark is not registered, or found not to have been properly \nregistered, a party may have a valid mark if it is (1) inherently distinctive, or  (2) descriptive but has \nacquired secondary meaning. Two Pesos, Inc. v. Taco Cabana, Inc., 505 U.S. 763, 769 (1992).\n2 \na) Ravine’s Open AI m ark is not inherently distinctive . \nRavine first argues that the Open AI mark is suggestive, not descriptive, and thus is \ninherently distinctive. A descriptive mark describes some aspect or characteristic of a product, \nwhereas a suggestive mark requires imagination or multi-stage reasoning. Lahoti v. VeriCheck, Inc. , \n586 F.3d 1190, 1198 (9th Cir. 2009).  \nThe Court concurs with the USPTO ’s determin ation  that Ravine’s Open AI mark was \n“descriptive” because it “merely describes a feature of the applicant’s services.” (Perahia Decl., Ex. \n72 at 62–63.) While not necessary here, d istrict courts may defer to the USPTO’s classification. \nLahoti , 586 F.3d at  1199 (9th Cir. 2009) (“ Deference to the PTO ’s classification decision is \nsensible because the PTO has special expertise that we lack on this fact -intensive issue .”); OpenAI, \nInc. v. Open A.I., Inc., No. 24-1963, 2024 WL 4763687, at *2 (9th Cir. Nov. 13, 2024) (same); see also Kifle v. YouTube LLC , 2022 WL 326613, at *5 (N.D. Cal. Feb. 3, 2022) ( same). \nRavine did not dispute the USPTO’s classification as a descriptive mark when Ravine \nelected to register his mark on the supplemental register. (Reg. No. 5,258,002; Perahia Decl. Ex. 72 at 69.) Proceeding with the supplemental register is an “admission against interest” that the mark is \n \n2 See also , Ninth Circuit Model Civil Jury Instruction 15.9–Infringement–Elements –\nValidity –Unregistered Marks  and cases cited therein.  Case 4:23-cv-03918-YGR     Document 326     Filed 07/21/25     Page 7 of 19 \n8 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  not distinctive or a protectable trademark. Automated Pet Care Prods., LLC v. PurLife Brands, Inc., \n670 F. Supp. 3d 946, 951 (N.D. Cal. 2023) ; 2 McCarthy on Trademarks and Unfair Competition \n§ 19.43 (5th ed. 2023) (“ An application for registration on the Supplemental Register is an implied \nadmission that the term is not inherently distinctive .”) Moreover, throughout the litigation, Ravine \nhas admitted that the Open AI mark is descriptive. ( See e.g. Dkt. No. 100, Open AI Counterclaim, \n¶ 189 (claiming that OpenAI, Inc. stole Open AI ’s term  “from a literally open AI company that has \nused it to pursue a truly open AI.”); Dkt. No. 138, Second Amended Counterclaim, ¶ 35 (“When \npeople heard the words ‘Open AI,’ they understood what the organization was about.’”) ; Id. ¶ 33 \n(“What Ravine eventually realized is that he could build on the ideology of his open collaboration \nplatform . . . . researchers were actually motivated  by the ideology of open sharing.”)   \nRavine maintains that the Open AI mark’s classification is best left for a jury, citing to an \nexpert report from Dr. Leonard, a linguist, who opined on the meaning of the terms “Open” and “AI.” Dr. Leonard’s report does not create a genuine dispute of material fact. Dr. Leonard opines \nthat the term Open AI does “not describe the products/serv ices provided by [Ravine’s Open AI]” \nbecause the term open conveys many potential specialized meanings. (Leonard Rept., ¶¶ 61–63, 67.) Dr. Leonard misses the point. That there are other  possible meanings of the term “open” that \ndo not describe Open AI’s features, does not detract from the (at least) one meaning that does  \ndescribe Ravine’s product. Lahoti , 586 F.3d at 1 201. The correct inquiry is “whether, when the \nmark is seen on the goods or services, it immediately conveys information about their nature .” Id.  \nDr. Leonard ignores, and otherwise fails to refute, the USPTO’s finding that “open” is descriptive as applied to Ravine’s mark because “it indicates that the applicant’s website allows public or non-\nproprietary information sharing.” (Perahia Decl., Ex. 72 at 63.) Ravine personally attested to \nUSPTO about the nature of his collaboration tools. An expert’s opinion which ignores the evidence \nin the case does not create a genuine dispute of material fact.  \nTaken together, the Court concludes that no reasonable juror could find, based on the \nevidence presented, that Ravine’s Open AI mark is suggestive.\n3  \n \n3 Because the Court finds that the Open AI mark is descriptive, the Court need not resolve \nwhether the market penetration test applies  to inherently distinctive marks . Those common law Case 4:23-cv-03918-YGR     Document 326     Filed 07/21/25     Page 8 of 19 \n9 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  b) Ravine’s descriptive mark has not acquired secondary meaning.   \nA descriptive mark “can receive trademark protection if it has acquired distinctiveness by \nestablishing ‘secondary meaning’ in the marketplace.” Yellow Cab Co. of Sacramento v. Yellow \nCab of Elk Grove, Inc., 419 F.3d 925, 927 (9th Cir. 2005) (citation omitted). Here, “[a] plaintiff \nmust show its mark achieved secondary meaning before a defendant first used the mark.” OpenAI, \nInc., 2024 WL 4763687, at *1 (emphasis supplied) (citing Levi Strauss & Co. v. Blue Bell, Inc., 778 \nF.2d 1352, 1358 (9th Cir. 1985) (“Strauss was required to prove that the tab as used on shirts had \nacquired secondary meaning by 1976, when Blue Bell began using a protruding label on shirts.”) In \nthe Ninth Circuit, courts analyze the following relevant  factors : (1) consumer perception and \nwhether purchasers of the product associate the trademark with the producer; (2) advertising ; (3) \nlength and manner of use; (4) whether the use has been exclusive; (5) copying; and (6) actual confusion. Yellow Cab, 419 F.3d at 930.\n4   \nHere, Ravine cites no evidence to suggest that his Open AI mark acquired secondary \nmeaning at any point in time . Rather, Ravine merely submits the conclusory statement that “ a \nreasonable jury could still conclude that Defendants acquired secondary meaning through their use \nand promotion of the mark.” (Oppo. at 19, n. 5.) Argument alone is insufficient to  withstand a \nmotion for summary judgment. Olivier v. Baca , 913 F.3d 852, 857 (9th Cir. 2019) (Where “the \nopposing party will have the burden of proof at trial, the moving party need only point out that there is an absence of evidence to support the nonmoving party’s case.”) \nNo genuine disputes of material fact remain  about Ravine’s Lanham Act and common law \ntrademark infringement claims. On that basis, the Court G\nRANTS  OpenAI’s motion for summary \n \nbased territorial  and market considerations are intertwined  with  a descriptive mark’s secondary \nmeaning test.  \n4 See also , Ninth Circuit Model Jury Instructions, § 15.11 Infringement—Elements —\nValidity —Distinctiveness —Secondary Meaning and cases cited therein ; P & P Imports LLC v. \nJohnson Enters., LLC , 46 F.4th 953, 961 (9th Cir. 2022) (considering copying and consumer \nconfusion) \n Case 4:23-cv-03918-YGR     Document 326     Filed 07/21/25     Page 9 of 19 \n10 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  judgment as to  counterclaims  (1) Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1125(a), (3) common law trademark \ninfringement, and (6) declaratory judgment that Ravine owns the mark.5 \n \n OpenAI’s Trademark Infringement Claims (Claims 1 and 2, Counterclaims 4, \n5, and 7)  \nOpenAI advances two trademark infringement claims against Ravine: Lanham Act ( 15 \nU.S.C. § 1125(a)) and common law trademark infringement. The Court analyzes whether plaintiff \nhas a protectible interest  in the OpenAI trademark . \nHere, O penAI does not dispute that its mark is descriptive. Based on the law cited above, \nthe Court’s infringement analysis, then, will turn on whether OpenAI acquired  secondary meaning, \nand if so, its  scope and timing. More precisely, the Court must determine whether OpenAI acquired \nsecondary meaning before  Ravine first used the Open AI mark in commerce. OpenAI, Inc., 2024 \nWL 4763687, at *1.  \nOpenAI offers two dates by which it argues that it acquired secondary meaning: first , \nNovember 2022, by which time it submits  that OpenAI acquired nationwide secondary meaning \nand second , January 2017, by which time it asserts secondary meaning amongst AI researchers.  The \nCourt considers the evidence submitted. Because the Court finds that OpenAI acquired nationwide \nsecondary meaning by at least November 2022, it need not address the January 2017 period.  \na) Use of the Mark , Scope, and the Legal Framework. \nRavine argues that he is the first user of the  descriptive mark , and thus, cannot be liable for \ntrademark infringement.   \nThe law, however, “does not protect or permit a ‘first user’s’ expansion beyond its original \nproduct line into an area occupied by an ‘intervening junior user’ who has established its own rights \nin the mark.” RXD Media, LLC v. IP Application Dev. LLC , 986 F.3d 361, 371 (4th Cir. 2021) \n(citing 4 J. McCarthy, McCarthy on Trademarks and Unfair Competition § 24:20 (5th ed. 2020) ; \nFuller Prods. Co. v. Fuller Brush Co., 299 F.2d 772, 775 (7th Cir. 1962) (“[P]rior use of a [descriptive] mark affords no protection for expansion of trade to goods other than those of the \n \n5 The Court notes that the second counterclaim (Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1114) would also \nseparately fail under this analysis .

Said differently, the parties are each limited to  the original product line and  the natural zone \nof expansion. Id . Ravine cites no  law or evidence justif ying an expansion of his  use of the mark to \nthe entire  AI industry.  \nRXD Media v. IP Application Development instructs . There, the Fourth Circuit affirmed the \ndistrict court’s grant of summary judgment where two companies  each  used the “ipad” mark. RXD \nMedia, LLC v. IP Application Dev. LLC , 986 F.3d 361 (4th Cir. 2021) . In 2007, plaintiff RXD \nreleased “ipad.mobi,” which allowed users to make simple, online lists on an internet -based \nnotepad. Id. at 366. Then  in January 2010, defendant Apple released its touch -screen tablet called \nthe “iPad.” Id. A few years later, in October 2016, RXD  launched a “rebranded” website using the \n“ipad” name which  offered “cloud storage” services that allowed users to upload photographs, \nvideos, music, and documents. Id. at 367. RXD filed suit, seeking declaratory judgment that its use \nof the “ipad” mark did not infringe Apple’s rights because RXD’s use of the mark “preceded \nApple’s use and Apple’s establishment of a secondary meani ng in a descriptive mark, precluding \nany possible infringement by RXD.” Id. at 368. The Fourth Circuit sided with Apple, in part because Apple achieved secondary meaning in its descriptive mark before October 2016—the date \nRXD rebranded and offered new services . Id. at 371. The court concluded that RXD’s “wholly \naltered use of the mark on its ‘ipadtoday.com’ website in 2016, on the heels of Apple’s commercial success in releasing the iPad device” was not entitled to trademark protection. Id. Although prior \nusers are generally permitted to “continuing using a mark in the manner that was legal when first \nused” , RXD had expanded “beyond its original product line into an area occupied by an \n‘intervening junior user’ who had established its own rights in the mark.” Id. \nThe evidence  in this case is similar. Initially, OpenAI and Ravine operated in different \nlanes , using their respective marks for different purposes . Ravine admits the same. Although his \nargument vacillates on each party’s “agreed” offerings , he cannot escape his  admi ssion that \nplaintiff’s concurrent use of the Open AI mark was acceptable to him because “both parties would use their respective marks for their respective goods and services.” (Ravine Decl., ¶ 20.)  Case 4:23-cv-03918-YGR     Document 326     Filed 07/21/25     Page 11 of 19 \n12 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  The record evidence shows that Open AI’s initial offerings—the Initial Collaboration Tool, \nHub, Decentralized, and the Evolved Collaboration Tool—were the equivalent of information or \nmessage-sharing platforms , were never a commercial concern , and were limited  to collaboration \nand communication tools for people interested in  talking about AI development. (Ravine Decl.,  \n¶¶ 7, 12, 20, 25, 30–31, 35; Ex. 11.) OpenAI, on the other hand, was developing generative AI tools as an AI research company. (Brockman Decl., ¶¶ 13, 15, 17–37; Ex. B.)  \nThe Court finds that OpenAI and Ravine—while both related to AI—offered different types \nof products (or services) in different segments.  \nb) OpenAI and Secondary Meaning in November 2022. \nIn November 2022, Ravine pivoted away from messaging platforms and launched  “Boom,” \nan AI image generator. (Ravine Decl., ¶ 45.) Several  months prior, OpenAI had launched its own \nAI image generator, Dall -E 2. (Brockman Decl., ¶ 37; Dyett Decl. , ¶ 11.)  \nThe Court finds that even assuming that Ravine was first to use the Open AI mark in \ncommerce (which is highly debatable), when Ravine launched Boom, he launched “a product much different and much more sophisticated” than his previous collaboration tools. RXD Media , 986 F.3d \nat 372. That pivot makes November 2022 the relevant date by which OpenAI must have acquired secondary meaning as the intervening junior user  which had historically used the mark for different \nproducts or services.  \nFor the reasons set forth below, the Court finds that no reasonable juror could conclude that \nOpenAI did not acquire secondary meaning by November 2022. Each factor considered in the \nNinth Circuit\n6 weighs in favor of secondary meaning: \n \n6 Yellow Cab, 419 F.3d at 930 (9th Cir. 2005) (“ To determine whether a descriptive mark \nhas secondary meaning, a finder of fact considers: (1) whether actual purchasers of the product \nbearing the claimed trademark associate the trademark with the producer, (2) the degree and manner of advertising under the claimed trademark, (3) the length and manner of use of the claimed trademark, and (4) whether use of the claimed trademark has been exclusive.”); P & P Imports LLC v. Johnson Enters., LLC , 46 F.4th 953, 961 (9th Cir. 2022) (considering copying and consumer \nconfusion) ; Snap Inc. v. Vidal , 750 F. Supp. 3d 1120, 1156–57 (C.D. Cal. 2024) (same).  Case 4:23-cv-03918-YGR     Document 326     Filed 07/21/25     Page 12 of 19 \n13 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  Factor 1: Consumer Perception . The following facts demonstrate that there are no \ngenuine disputes of material fact as to whether the people who purchase or use OpenAI’s products \nassociate the OpenAI mark with OpenAI:  \n \n• By April 2019, OpenAI’s website averaged over  1 million visitors per month in \nthe preceding six months. ( Dyett Decl. ¶ 26 , Ex. S.)  By September 2022, over 1.5 \nmillion users were creating over 2 million images per day with Dall- E 2. (Id. ¶ 14, \nEx. I.) In November 2022, those numbers increased to 3 million users creating 4 \nmillion images per day. ( Id. ¶ 15.) \n \n• In March 2022, search engines like Google and Bing exclusively associated the term “OpenAI” with plaintiff on the first page of results, featuring information panels about the company and suggesting only OpenAI -related searches. ( Perahia \nDecl., Ex . 63.)  In March 2022, OpenAI was listed among Time’s “100 Most \nInfluential Companies of 2022.” ( Id., Ex. 65.)  \n \n• GitHub data from November 2022 shows that tens of thousands of users ( i.e. other \nAI developers) saved personal copies of OpenAI’s products for their building repository. (Brockman Decl., Exs. D, E.)  OpenAI’s expert, Dr. Lipson, states that \npeople  in the AI industry frequently used OpenAI Gym, and many research papers \nwere written based on the product. ( Declaration of Hod L ipson, ( “Lipson Decl.” ), \nDkt. No. 231, Ex. A at ¶¶ 22–24, 26, 27.)  \n \n• On November 15, 2022, OpenAI announced the release of ChatGPT, which was \nan instant hit . (Dye tt Decl. , ¶¶16–21.)  Tech journals referred to ChatGPT as “one \nof the fastest growing services ever” with over 100 million weekly users and 2 million developers using OpenAI’s API. (Perahia Decl., Ex. 68.) Others described Open AI —since launching ChatGPT —as a “viral sensation ” and “household \nname.” ( Id., Ex. 57.)  \n \nRavine , for his part, attempts to argue  that the following three points in the record create a \ngenuine dispute of material fact . The Court disagrees . \nOne, OpenAI did not commission a consumer survey. True,  but “[c]onsumer survey \nevidence is not required.” Eko Brands, LLC v. Adrian Rivera Maynez Enters., Inc., No. 20- 35369, \n2021 WL 3630225, at *1  (9th Cir. Aug. 17, 2021) . Ravine did not commission a consumer survey \neither.   \nTwo, an internal brand s urvey supposedly shows that OpenAI had low brand awareness in \n2023. (Brewer Decl., ¶ 37.) The survey, however, studied a legally irrelevant population. The Court \nagrees with  OpenAI that the correct inquiry is whether consumers  of OpenAI’s products associate Case 4:23-cv-03918-YGR     Document 326     Filed 07/21/25     Page 13 of 19 \n14 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  the mark with OpenAI , not the opinions of people who have never heard of, or do not use, \nOpenAI’s products  (which the survey included) .  \nThree, Ravine offered an expert  opinion. T hat each side’s experts rendered opinions on the \nabove -mentioned internal survey does not change the fact that the survey  is not relevant in the first \ninstance.  Dr. Chiagouris  opines  that the internal survey shows that OpenAI had not ac quired \nsecondary meaning in 2023. (Chiagouris Decl., Ex 1.) OpenAI’s expert , Dr. Steckel, analyzed the \nunderlying survey data and determined that when a consumer responded that they used  an OpenAI \nproduct (like ChatGPT), rather than having “heard” of the product, concluded that 60% recognized \nOpenAI. Generally, figures over 50% are regarded as clearly sufficient  to satisfy the  test, but \nfigures of 46%, 48%, 39% and 37 percent have also been found sufficient. See 5 McCarthy on \nTrademarks and Unfair Competition § 32:190 (5th ed. 2025).  \nFactor 2: Advertisement. The following facts demonstrate that there are no genuine \ndisputes of material fact as to whether OpenAI advertised under the OpenAI trademark:  \n \n• OpenAI launched popular AI products (Gym, Universe, API, Roboschool, \nBaselines, Gym Retro, Spinning Up, Dota 2, GPT, ChatCPT, DALL -E). Those \nproducts were widely publicized and covered in national media and online. \n(Brockman Decl. , Exs. B, C, D, E, G and J ; Perahia Decl., Ex. 86. ) \n \n• OpenAI participated in, and sponsored, leading AI industry conferences. (Brockman Decl., Exs. M, H.)  \n \n• OpenAI was active on social media, YouTube, its blog, and in publishing industry leading research papers. (Brockman Decl., Exs. F, G, H, J, K.)  \n \nRavine argues that OpenAI did not engage in traditional advertising, but that argument does \nnot create a genuine dispute of material fact, especially in a nascent industry. Ravine cites  no law \nthat indicates that “traditional” advertising is required in all cases.  It is more appropriate to evaluate \nmetrics in the industry at issue.  \nFactor 3: Extent of Use. The following facts demonstrate that there are no genuine disputes \nof material fact that OpenAI  used the OpenAI mark for a sufficient period of time:  \n Case 4:23-cv-03918-YGR     Document 326     Filed 07/21/25     Page 14 of 19 \n15 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  • OpenAI announced its founding in December 2015. (Brockman Decl., Ex. A.) \nOpenAI first used the mark in commerce, by launching its first product OpenAI \nGym , on April 27, 2016. ( Id. ¶ 13, Ex. B at 6.)  \n \n• Since April 2016, Ope nAI has since released over 20 AI products or services. ( Id., \n¶¶ 13 –38.) \n \n• By November 2022, OpenAI had used its mark in continuous commerce for just \nunder seven years . “[S]ubstantial and continuous use of a mark in commerce for \nfive years is prima facie evidence of secondary meaning.” Jason Scott Collection, Inc. v. Trendily Furniture, LLC , 68 F.4th 1203, 1216 (9th Cir. 2023). \nRavine does not dispute that for the 2022 period, length of use weighs in favor of secondary \nmeaning. Ravine merely attacks OpenAI’s evidence by claiming that the use referenced was not \n“prominently displayed.” Ravine cites to no law to indicate that the Court should use this additional \ncharacterization.  Accordingly, the argument does not persuade and in many ways is contrary to the \nrecord cited above.     \nFactor 4: Exclusivity. With respect to this factor, e xclusivity of use means “whether the \ntrademark owner’s use of the mark was substantially  exclusive.” Converse, Inc. v. International \nTrade Commission Skechers USA, Inc., 909 F.3d 1110, 1122 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (emphasis supplied.)  \nAll of OpenAI’s  evidence, cited above, demonstrates that by 2022, OpenAI was using the \nmark in commerce in its field of use.  \nRavine argues that OpenAI’s use was not exclusive because he released several tools (the \nInitial Collaboration, Hub, the Evolved Collaboration Tool, and Decentralized) during the relevant period. An analysis of the evidence, however, demonstrates that few, if any, people actually used those tools.\n7  \n \n \n7 Much of the “use” evidence Ravine cites in support of his opposition comes in the form of \nwitness declarations. Those witnesses are exclusively former employees, friends, or investors in \nRavine’s litigation.  Nikita Gaer, Sergey Belkin, Mattia Iavarone, and Kirk McMurray are former \nRavine employees. (Gaer Decl., ¶ 3; Belkin Decl., ¶¶ 5 –6; Iavarone Decl.,  ¶ 3; McMurray Decl., \n¶ 3.) Deborah Reynolds was Ravine’s “friend” who hosted Ravine on more than 50 occasions and invested $450,000 in Ravine’s company “ We Communicate.” (Declaration of Dylan Scher, (Scher \nDecl., Ex. G) Reynolds Tr. 74:7–76:1; 135:1 –136:10.) Tom Gruber is funding Ravine’s litigation \nagainst OpenAI. (Dkt. No. 177.) Ravi ne does not submit any evidence from genuine third-party \nusers.   Case 4:23-cv-03918-YGR     Document 326     Filed 07/21/25     Page 15 of 19 \n16 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  • Ravine does not dispute that Open AI stopped hosting the Initial Collaboration \nTool in February 2016, meaning Ravine’ s use was not continuous. (Dkt. No. \n279-3, RSUF, Fact 31 ).  \n \n• Ravine has not presented evidence that Hub was used in commerce. Hub was a “discourse- based project” that “included features such as a message board where \nusers could post problems and solutions related to AI.” (Ravine Decl., ¶ 25, Ex. 11.). There is no evidence of genuine third-party users on Hub. ( Declaration of \nLuke Tenery (“ Tenery Decl. ”), Dkt. No. 277, Ex. A at ¶¶ 85 –86; Perahia Decl., \nEx. 14, Deposition of L. Tenery, at 152:3–14.) The only evidence of use proffered consisted of 40 comments, but those comments were from Ravine’s own Open AI employee Nikita Gaer. (Declaration of Seth Nielson , (“Nielson  \nDecl. ”), Dkt. No. 230, Ex A at ¶ 114; (Gaer Decl., ¶ 15 ; Perahia Decl.; Ex. 13 at \n215:20-216:7, 225:1-24; 231:3-231:10, 172:2-11, 257:3-5; McCurry Decl., Exs. B–E.) OpenAI’s expert concludes that Hub was not a functional website accessible to third -party users. (Nielson Decl., Ex A at ¶ 116.) \n \n• Ravine’s expert admits that, despite  that Ravine may have created the Evolved \nCollaboration Tool in 2017, it did not have a registered user until June 19, 2020. (Tenery Decl. , ¶ 94.) At  best, as Ravine admits , the Evolved Collaboration Tool \nhad a mere 37 U.S. users. (RSUF Fact 37.) OpenAI’s expert states that the timing coincides with the launch of OpenAI’s API and  suggests that any users \nlikely  inadvertently visited Ra vine’ s cite . (Nielson Decl., Ex. A ¶ 154.) Further, \nat one point, the Evolved Collaboration Tool redirected to OpenAI’s website. (Perahia Decl. Ex. 10, Ravine Dep. Tr. 185:23–186:10; Gaer Decl. ¶  18.)  \n \n• Ravine’s next tool, Decentralized, was released in October 2017. Ravine’s forensic expert admits that between October 25, 2017 and November 16, 2022, only 10 “unique editors” used Decentralized. (Tenery Decl. Ex. A ¶ 96.) OpenAI’s expert concluded that those “unique editors” included Ravine’s administrators, test accounts, and foreign registrants that appear to be spam, or otherwise fake,  accounts (i.e. mike@mike.com). (Nielson Decl., Ex. A at ¶¶  \n117–143.) \n \nThe Court finds as a matter of law that the minimal use presented does not rise to a level to \nraise a genuine dispute of material fact that OpenAI used the mark exclusively or substantially \nexclusively. \nFactors 5 and 6: Copying and Actual Confusion.\n8 Neither party contests that there was \nactual confusion. \n \n8 OpenAI does not submit evidence of “demonstrated utility” or that OpenAI used the mark \nto increase the sales of its product. The Court finds that this evidence is not necessary in light of the \nother factors.  Case 4:23-cv-03918-YGR     Document 326     Filed 07/21/25     Page 16 of 19 \n17 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California   \n• The record is replete with evidence of , and  admissions that,  OpenAI customers \nwere confused by Ravine’s company. (Perahia Decl., Ex. 12, Deposition \nTranscript of Guy Ravine, at 42:13–15) (“Q: When did you first notice that \nconfusion? A: People started -- well, you know, back in 20- -- 2016, even, there was confusion.”); id., Exs. 2, 41; Ravine Decl., ¶ 58.) \n \n• After OpenAI launched Dall -E 2 and ChatGPT, Ravine launched an image \ngenerator (“Boom”) and a chat bot (“Ava.”) ( Compare Ravine Decl. ¶¶ 45–50 with  \nBrockman Decl. ¶ 37.). Similar products present  direct evidence of copying.  \n  \nAccordingly, the Court finds no genuine disputes of material fact that Ravine’s use of Open AI led \nto actual confusion among customers. Nor is there a genuine dispute of material fact that Ravine \ncopied OpenAI. Because Ravine drifted into OpenAI’s market segment through launching Boom \nand Ava—products OpenAI had offered months prior—Ravine is deemed to have copied the mark.  \nSummary. In sum, even v iewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Ravine, the \nCourt concludes that OpenAI acquir ed secondary meaning by at least November 2022. By using the \nOpen AI mark for Boom and Ava after that point, Ravine infringed OpenAI ’s trademark.  \nAccordingly, the Court G\nRANTS  OpenAI’s motion for summary judgment as to its claims \nfor trademark infringement (claims 1 and 2) and Ravine’s remaining counterclaims (4, 5, and 7).9 \nIV. MOTION TO STRIKE  \n Ravine moved to strike “new” evidence and arguments asserted in OpenAI ’s reply, along \nwith counsel’s evidentiary objections. (Dkt. No. 290.) In response, OpenAI moved to strike \nRavine’s motion to strike as an unauthorized sur-reply. (Dkt. No. 294.) The Court finds that \nOpenAI’s reply evidence was properly submitted in response to Ravine’s  opposition. The Court, \nhowever, will strike OpenAI’s evidentiary objections inasmuch as those objections violate Civil Local Rule 7- 3(a). (“Any evidentiary and procedural objections to the motion must be contained \nwithin the brief or memorandum.”)  The Court will consider OpenAI’s evidentiary objections only \nif those objections were asserted in the parties’ briefing or at oral argument. In any event, the Court \nonly considers admissible evidence. \n \n \n9 In light of the Court’s finding, it need not decide whether secondary meaning was \nestablished among a narrower segment by January 2017. Case 4:23-cv-03918-YGR     Document 326     Filed 07/21/25     Page 17 of 19 \n18 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California   Accordingly, t he Court  GRANTS IN PART Ravine ’s motion to strike, and D ENIES  OpenAI ’s \nmotion to strike.  \nV. CONCLUSION  \n For the reasons set forth above, the Court G RANT S plaintiff’s motion for summary judgment \nin full , GRANTS IN PART defendants’ motion to strike, and  DENIES  plaintiff’s  motion to strike.    \n THE COURT ORDERS AS FOLLOWS :  \n The Court permanently enjoins defendants from using the Open AI mark.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: Parus Holdings, Inc. sued Apple, Inc. for infringing on multiple patents related to voice-enabled internet search and retrieval systems. Apple filed a motion to transfer the case from the Western District of Texas to the Northern District of California, citing the convenience of witnesses and the location of evidence. The court granted Apple's motion primarily due to the significant ties of witnesses, documents, and the relevance of the technology's development in the Northern District of California, alongside the use of Apple’s Siri involving machine learning and AI for speech recognition and natural language processing.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the case should be transferred to the Northern District of California for the convenience of parties and witnesses and in the interest of justice under 28 U.S.C. § 1404(a).\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court granted Apple's motion to transfer the venue to the Northern District of California, finding that it would be clearly more convenient based on various factors, particularly given the concentration of relevant witnesses and documents there. \n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Parus Holdings claimed that Apple copied its patented technology used in voice-controlled devices, like Siri. Apple asked to change the court location from Texas to California, arguing it would be easier for most of its people and papers related to the case because they're mostly in California. The judge agreed with Apple and decided to move the case to California.",

A fter careful consideration \nof the Motion, the Parties’ briefs, and the applicable law, the Court GRANTS  Apple’s Motion to \nTransfer Venue to the N orthern District of California. \nI. BACKGROUND\nParus filed this action against Apple on September 17, 2021, ECF No. 1, and filed a First \nAmended Complaint (“FAC”) on November 12, 2021. ECF No. 18. Apple responded to the FAC  \non December  13, 2021. ECF No. 35. Parus accuses Apple of infringing U.S. Patent Nos. 6,721,705; \n7,516,190; 8,185,402; and 9,769,314. ECF No. 31-1 ¶ 2. The ’705 and ’402 patents both relate to \n“robust and highly reliable” systems for users to search the internet using voice -enabled devices. \nECF No. 31-1 ¶ 16. Parus also states that the ’190 and ’314 patents created methods and systems \nfor secure, reliable retrieval of information over the internet , where the information could be \ndelivered over an audio device, using voice commands that could be personalized for each user. \nECF No. 31-1 ¶ 22. Parus asserts Ap ple infringes through certain Apple products in conjunction Case 6:21-cv-00968-ADA   Document 94   Filed 11/22/22   Page 1 of 242 I\nn its Motion, Apple claims  that:  \n•The majority of individuals  who are knowledgeable about the Accused\nTechnology––and all of Apple’s likely trial witnesses on technical issues ––are\nbased in the NDCA. ECF No. 44 at 3.\n•Apple witnesses knowledgeable about non -technical issues are also based in the\nNDCA. Id.\n•Documents concerning sales and financial information for the accused Apple\nproducts with Siri primarily are on local computers or servers located in or around\nthe NDCA or Mesa, Arizona.

Id.\nOn April 7 , 2022, Apple filed its Motion  to Transfer, citing, among others, those facts \nabove. ECF No. 44. That Motion is now ripe for judgment. \nII.LEGAL STANDARD\nIn patent cases, motions to transfer under 28 U.S.C. § 1404(a)1 are governed by the law of \nthe regional circuit. In re TS Tech USA Corp., 551 F.3d 1315, 1319 (Fed. Cir. 2008).

Case 6:21-cv-00968-ADA   Document 94   Filed 11/22/22   Page 2 of 243 U.S.C. § 1404(a) provides that “[f]or the convenience of parties and witnesses, in the interest of \njustice, a district court may transfer any civil action to any other district or division where it might \nhave been brought or to any district or division to which all parties have consented.” “Section \n1404(a) is intended to place discretion in the district court to adjudicate motions for transfer \naccording to an ‘individualized, case -by-case consideration of convenience and fairness.’” Stewart \nOrg., Inc. v.

Barrack , 376 U.S. 612, \n622 (1964)).  \n“The preliminary question under § 1404( a) is whether a civil action ‘might have been \nbrought’ in the [transfer] destination venue.” In re Volkswagen, Inc., 545 F.3d 304, 312 (5th Cir. \n2008) (“ Volkswagen II”). If the destination venue would have been a proper venue, then “[t]he \ndetermination of ‘convenience’ turns on a number of public and private interest factors, none  of \nwhich can be said to be of dispositive weight.” Action Indus., Inc. v. U.S. Fid. & Guar. Co., 358 \nF.3d 337, 340 (5th Cir. 2004). The private factors include: “(1) the relative ease of access to sources \nof proof; (2) the availability of compulsory proc ess to secure the attendance of witnesses; (3) the \ncost of attendance for willing witnesses; and (4) all other practical problems that make trial of a \ncase easy, expeditious and inexpensive.” In re Volkswagen AG , 371 F.3d 201, 203 (5th Cir. 2004) \n(“Volksw agen I ”) (citing Piper Aircraft Co. v. Reyno, 454 U.S. 235, 241 n.6 (1982)). The public \nfactors include: “(1) the administrative difficulties flowing from court congestion; (2) the local \ninterest in having localized interests decided at home; (3) the familiarity of the forum with the law \nthat will govern the case; and (4) the avoidance of unnecessary problems of conflict of laws of the \napplication of foreign law.” Id . When analyzing these factors, courts may consider facts arising \nafter plaintiff  filed suit unless there is some suggestion that they arose primarily to affect the \ntransfer analysis. See Lynk Labs, Inc. v. Home Depot USA, Inc., No. 6:21- CV-00097- ADA, 2022 Case 6:21-cv-00968-ADA   Document 94   Filed 11/22/22   Page 3 of 244 Court found that Mr. Rollins review ed attorney -selected documents and talk ed to attorney- selected \nwitnesses to form his beliefs , that Mr. Rollins routinely offers information about topics a financial WL 1593366, at *6 (W.D. Tex. May 19, 2022) (explaining how post -complaint facts must be \ndisregarded when considering § 1404( a)’s preliminary question, but not when evaluating \nconvenience). The weight the Court gives to each of these assorted convenience factors will \nnecessarily vary from case to case. See Burbank Int’l, Ltd. v. Gulf Consol. Int’l, Inc., 441 F. Supp. \n819, 821 (N.D. Tex. 1977).  \nThe burden to prove that a case should be transferred for convenience falls squarely on the \nmoving party. In re Vistaprint Ltd., 628 F.3d 1342, 1346 (Fed. Cir. 2010). The burden that a \nmovant must carry is not that the alternative venue is more convenient, but that it is clearly more \nconvenient. Volkswagen II , 545 F.3d at 314 n.10. While “clearly more convenient” is not explicitly \nequivalent to “clear and convincing,” the moving party “must show materially more than a mere \npreponderance of convenience, lest the standard have no real or practical meaning.” Quest NetTech \nCorp. v. Apple, Inc. , No. 2:19- cv-118, 2019 WL 6344267, at *7 (E.D. Tex. Nov. 27, 2019). Yet, \nthe Federal Circuit has clarified that, for a court to hold that a factor favors transfer, the movant \nneed not show that factor clearly favors transfer. In re Apple Inc., 979 F.3d 1332, 1340 (Fed. Cir. \n2020). \nIII. ANALYSIS\nAs an i nitial matter, the  Court addresses Parus’s contentions that Apple’s Venue Declarant, \nMark Rollins, lacks a credible evidentiary basis. See ECF No. 83 at 1. This Court has determined \nbefore that Mark Rollins lacks credibility based on his vague, incomplete,  and generally unreliable \ndeclaration. See Scramoge Tech. Ltd. v. Apple Inc. , No. 6:21- CV-00579- ADA, 2022 WL 1667561, \nat *2 (W.D. Tex. May 25, 2022) . In Scramoge , the Court explained that Mr. Rollins repeatedly \nand frequently submitted unreliable and misleading declarations to this Court. See id. There, the Case 6:21-cv-00968-ADA   Document 94   Filed 11/22/22   Page 4 of 245 manager would typically not know, and that the Rollins Declaration uses language that carefully \nlimits the scope of declared facts to his personal, selectively fed knowledge. See Scramoge , 2022 \nWL 1667561, at *3. \nHere, the Rollins Declaration is  similar. Mr. Rollins acknowledges that at least some \nwitnesses he  names were selected by legal counsel. ECF No. 83- 1 at 87:24-89:12. He makes some \nqualified statements about  location of witnesses and sources of proof. ECF No. 44- 1 ¶¶ 7 -9; 13-\n18; 19. Parus also provides evidence showing that Mr. Rollins did not ask whether, apart from the \nemployees he named in his declaration, other teams at Apple were relevant to this litigation; nor \ndid he review any documents reflecting the locations of employees on the specific teams referenced \nin his declaration. ECF No. 83 at 3 (citing ECF No. 83- 1 at 32:20- 33:9; 51:23- 54:10; 55:2- 10; \n56:9-20).  To be sure, the Court agrees that some of Mr. Rollins’s declaration and testimony are \nproblematic. Even still, if parties believe the opposing party failed to provide discovery that could \nchange the Court’s analysis in resolving a motion to transfer, the parties should timely and \nexplicitly seek appr opriate relief. The Court cannot now weigh the potentially missing information \nin its transfer analysis.  \nThis case also differs from  Scramoge , though, because Apple filed supplemental \ndeclarations to bolster Mr. Rollins’ s declaration. ECF Nos . 55-1; 55- 2; 55-3; 55-4; 55-5; 56; 56- 1; \n56-2. Parus contends that these new declarations fail to strengthen Apple’s case, as they only \nconfirm that Apple engaged in “cherry-picked gamesmanship.” ECF No. 83 at 5. But the Court \nfinds that not all Parus’s contention s have merit. Parus argues that the declarants merely relied on \nMr. Rollins’s word to “parrot the same baseless claims.” ECF No. 83 at 5. But Apple rebuts this \nby explaining that it was, in fact, the other way around,  as Mr. Rollins relied on th e declarants, and \nthe declarants provided the information based on their own personal knowledge. ECF No. 89 at 5. Case 6:21-cv-00968-ADA   Document 94   Filed 11/22/22   Page 5 of 246 B. P\nrivate Interest Factors\n1. Cost of Attendance and Convenience of Willing Witnesses\nThe most important factor in the transfer analysis is the convenience of the witnesses. See \nIn re Genentech, Inc., 566 F.3d 1338, 1343 (Fed. Cir. 2009). The Fifth Circuit has established the Parus  also alleges that the supporting declarations and designees contradict Mr. Rollins’s \ntestimony and declarations. Id.  at 6. But the Court is not pe rsuaded by this broad assertion. Parus \nfurther asserts that Apple limited its investigation and failed to investigate other potentially \nrelevant teams. ECF No. 83 at 7. For example, Parus points to teams in Cambridge, Massachusetts; \nSeattle; and Chicago. E CF No. 83-9 at 17:5-15. Yet Apple counters that Mr. Rollins’s declaration \neither disclosed other members of relevant teams or accounted for t hem. ECF No. 89 at 6.  \nThe supplemental declarants swear  that they have personal knowledge of the  facts averred  \nto in Mr. Rollins declaration, and that everything he attested to is true. See ECF Nos. 73–73- 4. \nAccordingly, the Court finds Mr. Rollins’ s testimony, supported by the supplemental declarations, \ncredible but limited.  \nA. Venue and Ju risdiction  in the Transferee Forum\nTo satisfy § 1404( a)’s preliminary question, the movant must show that venue and \njurisdiction would have been proper in the transferee forum when the plaintiff filed suit. See \nMonolithic Power Sys., Inc. v. Meraki Integrated Cir. (Shenzhen) Tech., Ltd., No. 6:20- CV-00876-\nADA, 2022 WL 958384, at *5 (W.D. Tex. Mar . 25, 2022). The Court finds, and Parus does not \ncontest, that venue would be proper in the NDCA . Apple is a California corporation headquartered \nin Cupertino, CA, which is in the  NDCA. E CF No . 44-1 ¶3. Thus, venue is proper in the NDCA \nbecause t he NDCA ma y exercise personal jurisdiction over Apple. Daimler A G v. Bauman , 571 \nU.S. 117, 137 (2014). Because Parus could have filed this case in the NDCA, the Court must \nconsider the private and public interest factors. Volkswagen II , 545 F .3d at 315. Case 6:21-cv-00968-ADA   Document 94   Filed 11/22/22   Page 6 of 247 “100- mile rule,” providing that “[w]hen the distance between an existing venue for trial of a matter \nand a proposed venue under § 1404(a) is more than 100 m iles, the factor of inconvenience to \nwitnesses increases in direct relationship to the additional distance to be traveled.” Volkswagen I , \n371 F.3d at 204–05. Yet the Federal Circuit has refused to apply the rule “rigidly,” such as where \nit may “result in all identified witnesses having to travel away from their home and work in order \nto testify in Texas, which would ‘produce results divorced from’ the rule’s underlying rationale.” \nIn re Google LLC , No. 2021-170, 2021 WL 4427899, at *5 (Fed. Cir. Sept. 27, 2021) (quoting In \nre TracFone Wireless, Inc. , 852 F. App’x 537, 539 (Fed. Cir. 2021)). This has  led the Federal \nCircuit to disregard distance altogether in favor of considering travel -time statistics. See In re \nGoogle LLC, 2021 WL 4427899, at *12 (“[T]ime i s a more important metric than distance.”). Or \nto simply disregard any difference in convenience between the relevant fora where it is comfortable \nconcluding that a witness would have to travel a significant distance no matter if the action is \ntransferred or not. See In re Apple, 979 F.3d at 1342 (discussing witnesses traveling from New \nYork to either Texas or California venues); In re Genentech, Inc. , 566 F.3d at 1344 (stating that \nthe 100-mile rule should not be “rigidly” applied in the context of foreign witnesses); In re \nPandora Media, LLC , No. 2021-172, 2021 WL 4772805, at *6 (Fed. Cir. Oct. 13, 2021). It has \neven gone as far as opining that  “[t]he comparison between the transferor and transferee forum is \nnot altered by the presence of other witnesses and documents in places outside both forums.” In re \nToyota Motor Corp., 747 F.3d 1338, 1340 (Fed. Cir. 2014); In re Google LLC , No. 2021- 170, \n2021 WL 4427899, at *4 (Fed. Cir. Sept. 27, 2021). \nWitnesses in NDCA. Apple asserts that the majority of the individuals  knowledgeable about \nthe Accused Technology - and all the witnesses it expects to call at trial- are based in the NDCA. \nECF No. 44 at 3, 10. It alleges that most of the engineers involved in the design and development Case 6:21-cv-00968-ADA   Document 94   Filed 11/22/22   Page 7 of 248 •J\namie de Guerre, Manager of Worldwide Product Marketing for Siri and Artificial\nIntelligence .

Id. ¶ 15.of the Accused Technology are based in the NDCA, and that the Apple witnesses with knowledge \nabout the financials, sales, marketing, and licensing of the Accused Technology are based in the \nNDCA. ECF No. 44 at 10. (citing ECF No.44- 1 ¶¶ 11- 17; 7-10). It further asserts that Apple \nwitnesses knowledgeable about non-technical issues are also based in NDCA. Id.  Apple, supported \nby Mr. Rollins’ s declaration, specifically identifies the following Apple personne l in the NDCA \nas having relevant knowledge of the Accused Technology: Case 6:21-cv-00968-ADA   Document 94   Filed 11/22/22   Page 8 of 249 •Eduardo Jimenez is an Engineering Manager in Apple’s Information Intelligence\nGroup and is knowledgeable about Applebot. Id. ¶ 16.\n•Andrew Fandrianto is a Software Engineering Manager in Apple’s InformationIntelligence Group and is knowledgeable about Web Answers. Id. ¶ 17.\nMr. Rollins alleges  that these individuals are in the NDCA and that most, if not all,  of their \nteam members are in the NDCA. ECF No. 44 -1 ¶¶ 7 –17. Parus does not contest the relevancy of \nthese witnesses; instead, it contends that they are “cherry -picked” for purposes of securing transfer. \nECF No. 83 at 3. Parus also points to other Apple employees who “appear to be the more \nappropriate persons to testify” in this case. ECF No. 83 at 7. The Court is satisfied, though that these potential witnesses have “r elevant and material information,” and that is all the Court can \ndemand  at this point. See In re Hulu, LLC , No. 2021- 142, 2021 WL 3278194, at *3 (Fed. Cir. Aug. \n2, 2021); see also In re Toyota Motor Corp., 747 F.3d 1338, 1340 (Fed. Cir. 2014).  \nParus further argues that “regardless of where trial takes place, witnesses living outside of \nboth the NDCA and this District will need to book flights and hotel s and be away from their \nfamilies and places of work.”  ECF No. 83 at 15. Parus does not say specifically which witnesses \nit is referring to here . It does, however, allege  that Mr. Rollins failed to investigate  other Apple \nteams  based in Cambridge, Massachusetts , Seattle,  Dublin, and Cambridge, UK. ECF No. 83 at \n7–8. So the Court is left to assume that Parus may be  referring to potential witnesses in these \nlocations. Regardless , the Court generally finds that witnesses living far from either district are too \nremote to have much effect under this factor. See In re Apple, 979 F.3d at 1342 (citing In re Genentech,  566 F.3d at 1344 (“the 100- mile rule ‘should not be rigidly applied’ where witnesses \n‘will be required to travel a significant distance no matter where they testify’); see also In re Google, LLC , 2021 WL 4427899, at *4 (“Our cases have emphasized that when there are numerous Case 6:21-cv-00968-ADA   Document 94   Filed 11/22/22   Page 9 of 2410 witnesses in the transferee venue and the only other witnesses are far outside the plaintiff's chosen \nforum, the witness-conveni ence factor  favors transfer”).  \nAccordingly, the  Court finds  that Apple names eight specific witnesses who likely have \nrelevant and material knowledge located in the NDCA. Att ending trial in the NDCA would be \nmore convenient for them and most of their team members. Thus, the convenience of these \npotential witnesses favors transfer.  \nWitnesses in the WDTX. Parus argues that 7,000 Apple employees work in this District, \nincluding several members of relevant teams identified in Apple’s Motion and Mr.  Rollins ’s \nDeclaration. ECF No. 83 at 13. Parus asserts that Ms. Korock and her team of grading analysts test \nthe accused functionality and are based out of Apple’s Austin campus. ECF No. 83 at 13. Parus \nsupports this assertion with testimony from Ms. Korock that she works on that team and lives in \nAustin. Id. Apple downplays  the relevancy of the witnesses through Mr. Rollins, who counters that \nMs. Korock and her team have “nothing to do with” the accused “speech recognition side of [Siri].” \nECF No. 89 at 5. Despite the Court finding Mr. Rollins’s testimony limited, Ms. Korock herself \nasserts  her work is limited to looking at transcript s, and the work related to training speech \nrecognition is different from the  work she and her team do. ECF No. 83 -4 at 47:35-48:13. The \nCourt finds that Ms. Korock and her t eam have q uestionable relevance.  \nParus also alleges that a member of Mr. Jimenez’s AppleBot team is based in Austin and \nhas access to the AppleBot source code and relevant documents. ECF No. 83 at 13 (citing ECF \nNo. 83-10 at 27:1- 14). Mr. Jimenez counters that this person never worked on the internal designs . \nECF No. 89 at 4. Given that his team leader asserts that this witness does not possess relevant \nknowledge, it is unclea r whether this Apple employee is truly knowledg eable. ECF 83 -5 at 29:1-\n30:25. That said, even if the Court would agree that  Ms. Korock and the member of Mr. Jimenez’s Case 6:21-cv-00968-ADA   Document 94   Filed 11/22/22   Page 10 of 2411 team are relevant witnesses, the Court is persuaded that the Federal Circuit has already found that \nmore witnesses in the NDCA should ma rk this fa ctor in fa vor of transfer.  \nParus names Alex Kurganov, an inventor of the Asserted Patents, as a willing witness. ECF \nNo. 83 at 16. It also asserts that its CEO, Taj Reneau, is based in Austin and that Parus is looking \nto hire eight more employees in the months to come . ECF No. 83 at 2. But Mr. Kurganov is “in \nthe process of relocating to this District.” Id.  As of the time the lawsuit was filed, he resided in \nNew Hampshire. ECF No. 83-2 at 101:8- 12. Mr. Reneau, similarly, only arranged to move to \nAustin in “summer 2022,”  ECF No. 83 at 2, but he appears to have relocated to this District as of \nJune 1, 2022. ECF No. 83- 2 at 48: 23-49:2. Although somewhat unclear whether Mr. Kurganov is \naffirmatively in this District, the Court will accord some weight to the convenience of these \nwitnesses. See Lynk Labs, Inc. , 2022 WL 1593366, at *6 (explaining how post -complaint facts \nmust be disregarded when considering § 1404(a)’s preliminary question, but not when evaluati ng \nconvenience). The Court, though, accords no weight to Parus’s claim that it was “looking to hire \neight more employees in the coming months ,” as t his is too speculative.  \nConclusion. The Court is satisfied that Apple has identified eight willing witnesses located \nin the NDCA as having relevant and material knowledge. Two Apple employees with questionable \nknowledge  on the  Accused Products are in the WDTX. Parus identified Parus’s CEO and an \ninventor of the Asserte d Patents as willing witnesses in this District, though whether they are \naffirmatively in this District is still somewhat unclear . Accordingly, this factor weighs heavily in \nfavor of t ransfer.  \n2. Relative Ease of  Access t o Source of  Proof\n“In considering the relative ease of access to proof, a court looks to where documentary \nevidence, suc h as documents and physical evidence, is stored.” Fintiv, Inc. v. Apple Inc., No. 6:18-\ncv-00372- ADA, 2019 WL 4743678, at *5 (W.D . Tex. Sept. 10, 2019) . This factor  relates t o theCase 6:21-cv-00968-ADA   Document 94   Filed 11/22/22   Page 11 of 2412 relative —not  absolute —ease of access to non -witness evidence. See In re Radmax , 720 F.3d at \n288; In re Apple , 979 F.3d at 1339. “[T]he movant need not show that all relevant documents are \nlocated in the transferee venue to support a conclusion that the location of relevant documents \nfavors transfer.” In re Apple , 979 F.3d at 1340; In re Juniper Networks, Inc., 14 F.4th 1313, 1321 \n(Fed. Cir. 2021)  (“We have held that the fact that some evidence is stored in places other than \neither the transferor or the transferee forum does not weigh against transfer.”).  \nThe Fifth Circuit has held that, even in the context of electronic documents that can be \nacces sed anywhere on earth, this factor is not superfluous. See Volkswagen II , 545 F.3d at 316; see \nalso In re Dish Network LLC, No. 2021- 182, 2021 WL 4911981, at *6 (Fed. Cir. Oct. 21, 2021). \nThough having consistently characterized that holding as antiquated in the setting of a modern \npatent dispute, this Court will continue to analyze this factor with a focus on the location of: \nphysical documents and other evidence; and the hardware storing the relevant electronic evidence. \nSee Def. Distributed v. Bruck , 30 F.4th 414, 434 & n.25 (5th Cir. 2022) (giving weight to the \nlocation of servers hosting the electronic documents in dispute) . The Federal Circuit has held, \nhowever, that it is error not to also consider: “the location of document custodians and location \nwhere documents are created and maintained, which may bear on the ease of retrieval.” In re \nGoogle LLC, No. 2021- 178, 2021 WL 5292267,  at *2 (Fed. Cir. Nov. 15, 2021);  see also Def. \nDistributed , 30 F.4th at 434 & n.25 (considering, under this factor, where the “research, design, \ndevelopment, manufacturing, and publishing” of the allegedly offending files occurred). Finally, \nevidence located at a party’s office that is not a “place of regular business” may be discounted. See  \nIn re Google LLC , No. 2022-140, 2022 WL 1613192, at *4 (Fed. Cir. May 23, 2022). \nApple a sserts that its sources of proof here are heavily located in the NDCA because the \nmajority of the relevant technical teams responsible for designing and developing the Accused Case 6:21-cv-00968-ADA   Document 94   Filed 11/22/22   Page 12 of 2413 Technology are based in NDC A, and so the bulk of relevant design and development documents \nwere generated there. ECF No. 44 at 7; see also ECF No. 44- 1 ¶¶ 11- 17. It further  claims  the \npersonnel responsible for financials, marketing, and licensing for the Accused Technology, as well \nas their documents, are heavily based in the NDCA. Id;  see also ECF No. 44- 1 ¶¶ 7–10. Apple \ndoes not have any servers in Texas that host relevant source code associated with the Accused \nTechnology. ECF No. 44-1 ¶ 7.  \nParus argues that because Apple can access its documents stored in the cloud from \nanywhere, that means that “for all intents and purposes,” Apple’s documents are in the WDTX. \nECF No. 83 at 10. Apple does not contest that its cloud documents can be accessed from this \nDistrict. ECF No. 89 at 2. Th e Court acknowledge s that due to technological  advances, the idea of \nlooking to the location of documents is becoming antiquated. The  Fifth Circuit also recently \naffirmed that the location of evidence bears much more strongly on the transfer analysis when, as \nin Volkswagen, the evidence is physical  in nature . See In re Planned Parenthood Fed'n of Am., \nInc., 52 F.4th 625 (5th Cir. 2022) (citing In re Volks wagen , 545 F.3d. at 316–17) . All the same, \nthe Federal Circuit has time and again reminded this Court to look to where the custodians of \nrelevant electronic documentation is, as they may bear on the relative ease of access to sources of \nproof. It remains that the custodians of relevant electronic documentation are in the NDCA  and \nnot in this District.  \nParus further asks the Court to recognize Apple’s attempt to “double count” witnesses \nwhen it alleges that relevant documents are generated by, and thus stored in the locations where \nits witnesses reside. ECF No. 83 at 10 . Parus argues this based on e vidence s uggesting that Apple \ncannot determine with specificity the location of all relevant cloud  documents because of the  nature \nof cloud storage . Id. (citing ECF No. 83-12 at 36:17-20; 24:14- 25:16). Apple need not  show that Case 6:21-cv-00968-ADA   Document 94   Filed 11/22/22   Page 13 of 2414 C\nonclusion. Accordingly, this factor weighs heavily in favor of transfer. \n3. Availability of Compulsory Process\nUnder the Federal Rules, a court may subpoena a wi tness to attend trial only (a) “within \n100 miles of where the person resides, is employed, or regularly transacts business in person”; or \n(b) “within the state where the person resides, is employed, or regularly transacts business inall relevant documents are in the transferee ven ue to support a conclusion that the location of \nrelevant documents favors transfer. In re Apple , 979 F.3d at 1340. The Court accords weight to the \nlocation of document custodians and location where documents are created and maintained, as \nwell as where the  “research, design, development, manufacturing, and publishing” of the allegedly \noffending files occurred . See In re Google LLC , 2021 WL 5292267,  at *2;  see also Def. \nDistributed , 30 F.4th at 434 & n.25. Apple provides sufficient evidence showing that this is in the \nNDCA.  \nParus claims  that its documents “are or will be in Austin, TX.” ECF No. 83 at 10. Parus’s \nCEO asserted that Parus began to move its documents to Texas beginning July 1, 2022. E CF No. \n83-2 at 47:11-20.  Parus identifies no specific material in the WDTX, and Mr. Reneau refers \ngenerally to Parus’s “corporate documents” being in Austin, while “5 percent” of the documents \nremained in Illinois while Parus’s Austin office was under construction. ECF No. 80-3 at 47:24-\n48:9. Though unclear whether its relevant  documents are definitively in this District, the Court \nwill accord some weight to the fact that Parus provides evidence indicating it is in the process of \nmoving all documents to this District by the time of trial.  See Lynk Labs, Inc., 2022 WL 1593366, \nat *6. The Court, though, accords Parus’s documents less weight. See In re Genentech , 566 F.3d \nat 1345. (“ In patent infringement cases, the bulk of the relevant evidence usually comes from the \naccused infringer. Consequently, the place where the defendant's documents are kept weighs in \nfavor of transfer to that location.” ). Case 6:21-cv-00968-ADA   Document 94   Filed 11/22/22   Page 14 of 2415 person, if the person . . . is commanded to attend a trial and would not incur substantial expense.” \nFed. R. Civ. P. 45(c)(1)(A), (B)(ii); Gemalto S.A. v. CPI Card Grp. Inc., No. 15- CA-0910, 2015 \nWL 10818740, at *4 (W.D. Tex. Dec. 16, 2015). Under this factor, the Court focuses  on non- party \nwitnesses whose attendance may need to be secured by a court order. Fintiv , 2019 WL 4743678, \nat *14 (citing Volkswagen II, 545 F.3d at 316). This factor “weigh[s] heavily in favor of transfer \nwhen more third -party witnesses reside within the transferee venue than reside in the transferor \nvenue .” In re Apple, Inc., 581 F. App’x 886, 889 (Fed. Cir. 2014). When “there are several \nwitnesses located in the transferee forum and none in the transferor forum,” this factor favors \ntransfer. In re Google , No. 2021-171, 2021 WL 4592280, at  *5 (Fed. Cir. Oct. 6, 2021). Further, \nthis Court cannot “discount” third- party “entities” having pertinent information in the transferee \nvenue “just because individual employees were not identified.” In re Apple Inc ., No. 2021- 181, \n2021 WL 5291804, at *8 (Fed. Cir. Nov. 15, 2021) (quoting In re HP Inc. , 826 F. App’x 899, 903 \n(Fed. Cir. 2020)). \nThe Federal Circuit has held that, under Fifth Circuit law, “when there is no indication that \na non-party witness is willing , the witness is presumed to be unwilling and considered under the \ncompulsory process factor.” In re HP Inc. , No. 2018-149, 2018 WL 4692486, at *3 n.1 (Fed. Cir. \nSept. 25, 2018); see also  In re Hulu, LLC , No. 2021-142, 2021 WL 3278194, at *4 (Fed. Cir. Aug.  \n2, 2021)  (“[W]here . . . the movant has identified multiple third- party witnesses and shown that \nthey are overwhelmingly located within the subpoena power of only the transferee venue, this \nfactor favors transfer even without a showing of unwillingness f or each witness”).  \nApple identifies the Open Agent Architecture (“OAA”) system developed by SRI \nInternational—t he organization that launched Siri Inc.—a s promising system art that Apple will \nassert in this case. ECF No. 44 at 6. Apple attached an article entitled “Multimodal User Interfaces Case 6:21-cv-00968-ADA   Document 94   Filed 11/22/22   Page 15 of 2416 in the Open Agent Architecture,” detailing OAA, authored by Douglas B. Moran, Adam J. Cheyer, \nLuc E. Julia, and David L. Martin. ECF No. 45-16. Apple claims that  all four authors appear to be \nin the NDCA, using L exisNexis Public Records Report to support this claim. See ECF Nos. 45-\n19; 45-20; 45-21; 45- 23. Parus  acknowledges that Apple identifies several third- party prior art \nwitnesses that may possess relevant information. ECF No. 83 at 12. Parus only challenges that the \nCourt should give littl e weight to these witnesses because prior artists rarely appear at trial. Id. The \nCourt acknowledges that it discounts prior art witnesses for that reason, but the Court will not \ncategorically reject prior art witnesses without considering the facts of the  case. In re Hulu, LLC, \n2021 WL 3278194, at *3. Thus, because Parus does not contest the relevancy of these witnesses, \nthe Court will weigh these witnesses in the transfer analysis.  \nApple also states that Parus’s former Chief Technology Officer (“CTO”)  at the time Parus \nfiled its first lawsuit against Apple , Salil Pradhan, is  in the NDCA as well. ECF No. 44 at 6. Parus \ncontends that Apple failed to show that Mr. Pradhan possesses any relevant information or \ndocuments. ECF No. 83 at 13. Parus’s CEO and corpor ate representative confirmed that Mr. \nPradhan only provided part-time consulting services to Parus as CTO. ECF No. 83- 2 at 93: 34-\n94:16. Apple replies that Mr. Pradhan “certainly has recent knowledge regarding Parus’s \ntechnology and operations.” ECF No. 89 at 3. Apple provides no other  evidence or explanation \nlinking Mr. Pradhan to the Accused Technology. The Court is skeptical of Apple’s assertion that \nMr. Pradhan has relevant knowledge, without any more specificity as to what testimony it expects \nto elicit from hi m. Thus, the Court will accord t his witness  only some weight. \nParus identifies three former Parus employees with knowledge of the company and \nsoftware engineering that live in Texas. ECF No. 83 at 14.  Pavel “Paul” Leonovich, a senior Case 6:21-cv-00968-ADA   Document 94   Filed 11/22/22   Page 16 of 2417 2 Parus explains that Parus was originally called “Webley Systems, Inc.” and many of its earliest \nproducts carry that name. ECF No. 68 at 9 n.1. \n3Parus alleges two of the former Parus employees, “will testify in Waco.” See ECF No. 83 at 14. \nParus argues the relevancy of these witnesses under the “compulsory process” factor, so it is \nunclear whether those witnesses are willing or unwilling. See id.  Because Parus claims that t hese \nwitnesses are “located within this District’s subpoena power,” Id. , the Court will evaluate this \nargument under the “compulsory process” factor. That said,  even if these witnesses are willing, \nthe Court is satisfied that it would not change its opinion that the willing witness factor weighs heavily in favor of transfer.  software engi neer familiar with the Webley2 voice application development, resides in the Austin \narea. Id. John Ackelbein, former VP of sales at Webley, possesses knowledge of the features of \nthe Webley personal assistant and was responsible for all business -to-business sales and resides in \nthe Dallas area. Id. Hal Poel, former marketing executive of Webley, possesses relevant knowledge \nrelated to the telecom features of the Webley product and resides in Sugar Land.3 Id. Parus also \nidentifies six prior artists within the Dallas -Fort Worth Metroplex. Id.  \nYet Parus cites only to LinkedIn to connect the named third- party witnesses with the \nAccused Products. See  ECF Nos. 84-3; 84-4; 84- 6; 84-8; 84-9; 84- 10; 84- 11; 84-12; 84- 13. It \nprovides no basis for its assertions that the Webley former employees or the potential prior art \nwitnesses are relevant. See id.  This is generally not enough to show that these witnesses possess \nknowledge relevant to the alleged infringement.  In re G oogle LLC , 2021 WL 4427899, at *7 \n(allocating no weight to a potential witness that the plaintiff  found on LinkedIn because plaintiff \n“was not at all specific about what testimony it expected to elicit from [that witness], or even if he \npossesses knowledge  of the facts relevant to this infringement action”); see also Logantree LP v. \nApple Inc., No. 6:21- CV-00397- ADA, 2022 WL 1491097, at *20 (W.D. Tex. May 11, 2022) \n(explaining that gauging and articulating the relevance of a party’s personnel to a particular case  \nbased only on vague LinkedIn profiles is a challenge”).  Case 6:21-cv-00968-ADA   Document 94   Filed 11/22/22   Page 17 of 2420 average time to trial means more efficient and economical resolutions of the claims at issue. That \nsaid, “[a] court’s general ability to set a f ast-paced schedule is not particularly relevant to this \nfactor.”  In re Apple , 979 F.3d at 1344. Moreover, when other relevant factors weigh in favor of  \ntransfer or are neutral, “then the speed of the transferee district court should not alone outweigh \nall of  those other factors.” In re Genentech , 566 F.3d at 1347. \nThe Federal Circuit has held that a difference in the number of pending cases between the \ntransferor and transferee forums is “too tenuously related to any differences in speed by which \nthese districts can bring cases to trial.” Id. In another case, it has  opined that  a “proper” analysis \n“looks to the number of cases per judgeship and the actual average time to trial.” In re Juniper \nNetworks, 14 F.4th at 1321. It has further ruled that, if time-to-trial statistics favor one district over \nanother, the court  must “point to any reason that a more rapid disposition of the case that might be \navailable in Texas is worthy of important weight.” Id.  1322;  In re Samsung Elecs. Co., 2 F.4th \n1371, 1380–81 (Fed. Cir. 2021). \nApple argues that this Court currently has 874 pending patent cases, and by contrast, \nNDCA has 217 patent cases in the entire district. ECF No. 44 at 13. It acknowledges, though, that \nthis Court  provides a faster time to trial. Id. Parus also asserts that this Court’s average time to trial \nis faster tha n the NDCA. ECF No. 83 at 17. Apple argues this factor should at most be neutral \nbecause the faster time to trial should not outweigh other factors that favor transfer.  \nConclusion.  The Federal Circuit has concluded that the speed of the transferee distri ct \nshould not alone outweigh all other factors. Thus, the Court finds  that this factor weighs only \nslightly against transfer.  \n2. Local I nterest\nUnder thi s factor, the  Court must evaluate w hether the re is a loc al interest in de ciding  local \nissues at home. Vol kswagen II, 545 F .3d at 317. Local interests in a patent case “are not a fiction.” Case 6:21-cv-00968-ADA   Document 94   Filed 11/22/22   Page 20 of 2421 In re Samsung, 2 F.4th at 1380. “This factor most notably regards not merely the parties’ \nsignificant connections to each forum writ large, but rather the ‘significant conne ctions between a \nparticular venue and the events that gave rise to a suit .’” In re Apple , 979 F.3d at 1344 (quoting In \nre Acer Am. Corp. , 626 F.3d 1252, 1256 (Fed. Cir. 2010)) (emphasis in original). The Federal \nCircuit has accorded significant weight under this factor to the location where the accused product \nor functionality was “designed, developed, and tested.” In re Apple , 979 F.3d at 1345. It has \naccorded no weight to the location of the sale of an accused product where that product is offered \nnationwide. In re Hoffmann-La Roche Inc., 587 F.3d 1333, 1338 (Fed. Cir. 2009). Courts should \nnot heavily weigh a party’s general presence in the forum. In re Apple , 979 F.3d at 1345. For \nexample, the Federal Circuit recently attributed error to this Court for granting even some  weight \nto Apple’s significant general presence in this District. In re Apple Inc., No. 2022-137, 2022 WL \n1676400, at *2 (Fed. Cir. May 26, 2022) (“The court’s reliance on [the defendant’s Austin] offices, \nwhich lack such a connection to the locus of the events giving rise to the dispute, amounts to a \nclear abuse of discretion”). \n“Important considerations include the location of the injury, witnesses, and the [p]laintiff’s \nresidence.” Def. Distributed , 30 F.4th at 435. Yet the Federal Circuit has instructed that plaintiff’s \nresidence in the transferor forum is owed no weight if it is “recent and ephemeral.” In re Juniper \nNetworks , 14 F.4th at 1320 (quoting In re Microsoft Corp., 630 F.3d  1361, 1365 (Fed. Cir. 2011)). \nThe Federal Circuit has also clarified that a plaintiff’s residence is owed zero weight if it lies \nbeyond the transferor judicial district, even if just so. See In re Apple , 2022 WL 1676400, at *2 \n(granting little to no weigh t to the design, development, and testing of the claimed invention \noccurring just over 100 miles from the transferor court); In re Google , 2021 WL 4592280, at *6 Case 6:21-cv-00968-ADA   Document 94   Filed 11/22/22   Page 21 of 2422 (finding error with district court’s reliance on plaintiff’s office in Texas, where the office was \nlocated out side this District). \nApple is headquartered in Cupertino, in the NDCA and the Accused Technology was \nprimarily designed and developed there, and so it contends the NDCA has a stronger local interest \nin deciding the issues in this case. ECF No. 44 at 13; ECF No. 44-1 ¶¶ 3, 11-17. Y et Parus asserts \nthat this District has a significant local interest in this case because Parus is in the midst of \ntransferring all operations here and because Apple has a 7,000 -employee campus here. ECF No. \n83 at 18.  \nIn regard to Parus’s move to Austin, the Federal Circuit has already instructed that the \nplaintiff’s residence in the transferor forum is owed no weight if it is “recent and ephemeral.” I n \nre Juniper Networks , 14 F.4th at 1320 (quoting In re Microsoft Corp., 630 F.3d 1361, 1365 (Fed. \nCir. 2011)). Thus, this Court attributes no weight to the fact that Parus is in the midst of transferring \nall operations to the Austin area. The Court also agrees, and Apple does not contest, that Apple \nhas a significant general presence in this District. ECF No. 83 at 18–19; ECF No. 89 at 8–9. But \nthis factor does not focus on a parties’ general presence; instead, it focuses on the ‘significant \nconnections between a particular venue and the events that gave rise to a suit .’” In re Apple , 979 \nF.3d at 1344 (quoting In re Acer Am. Corp., 626 F.3d 1252, 1256 (Fed. Cir. 2010)) (emphasis in \noriginal). Parus contends that the Apple witne sses it identified in this District have connection to \nthe Accused Functionality, and thus  a local interest exists here. ECF No. 83 at 18. But the Court \nhas already discussed that the relevancy of those witnesses to the Accused Technology is \nquestionable. See supra III. B. 1.  \nConclusi on. The Court finds that the NDCA likely has a stronger local interest in deciding \nthe issues in t his case given that Apple is h eadquartered t here, and the Accused Technology was Case 6:21-cv-00968-ADA   Document 94   Filed 11/22/22   Page 22 of 2423 primarily designed and developed there. Apple’s  general presence in this District is not sufficiently \ntethered  to the facts of this case. Thus, this factor weighs heavily  in favor of transfer.  \n3.The Other Public Interest Factors are Neutral.\nThe other public interest factors are neutral.5 This Court and the NDCA are both familiar \nwith patent law. And to the extent any conflicts of law arise, both courts are equally capable of \naddressing them.  \nIV. CONCLUSION\nHaving considered the private and public interest factors, the Court’s conclusions for  each \nfactor is summarized in the following table: \nFactor  The Court’s Finding  \nCost of attendance for willing witnesses Weighs heavily in favor of  transfer  \nRelative ease of access to sources of proof  Weighs heavily in favor of transfer  \nAvailability of compulsory process to secure the \nattendance of witnesses  Weighs in favor of  transfer  \nAll other practical problems that make trial of a \ncase easy, expeditious and inexpensive  Neutral  \nAdministrative difficulties flowing from court \ncongesti on Weighs slightly against transfer  \nLocal interest Weighs heavily in favor of  transfer  \nFamiliarity of the forum with law that will govern \ncase Neutral  \nProblems associated with conflict of law  Neutral  \nT\nhe Court gives the “practical problems” factor less weight because the Federal Circuit has \nheld that judicial economic considerations from related cases cannot “negate[] the significance of \n5Apple concedes that both the remaining factors - “familiarity of f orum with governing l aw” and \n“conflict of l aws”- are neutral. ECF No. 44 at 15. Parus concedes tha t the “c onflict of l aws” factor \nis not relevant. ECF No. 83 at 20. But Parus argues under the “ familiarity of the f orum with \ngoverning law” factor, that this Court should consider the pendency of Parus’s related cases. ECF \nNo. 83 at 19. Parus also states  that “Federal patent law will apply regardless of where this case is \nlitigated.” Id. The Court does not interpret Parus’s argument about  co-pendency of related cases \nas a claim that  either forum  is not familiar with the relevant law.  Case 6:21-cv-00968-ADA   Document 94   Filed 11/22/22   Page 23 of 2424 S\nIGNED this 29th day of November, 2022. \nhaving trial close to where most of the identified witnesses reside and where the other convenience \nfactor s clearly favor. ” In re Zimmer Holdings, Inc., 609 F.3d 1378, 1382 (Fed. Cir. 2010) . Any \njudicial economy considerations would be insufficient to outweigh the clear benefits of transfer \ngiven the imbalance in the parties’ presentations on the other private -interest and public -interest \nfactors. See In re: NetScout Sys., Inc ., 2021 WL 4771756, at *5. \nThe Federal Circuit has also consistently told the Court to diminish the weight given to the \ndocket- congestion factor. Apple  has more sources of proof and willing witnesses in the NDCA. \nThe N DCA  likely has a stronger localized interest because of Apple’s h eadquarters there coupled \nwith significant development  and design there. Apple shows  that the NDCA is a clearly more \nconvenient venue. \nIT IS ORDERED that Defendants’ Motion to Transfer Venue to the Northern District of \nCalifornia  (ECF No. 44) is GRANTED. The Court’s Clerk is directed to transfer this Action to \nthe U.S. District Court for t he Northern District of California. Case 6:21-cv-00968-ADA   Document 94   Filed 11/22/22   Page 24 of 24",

Pritchard alleged that Harman Connected Services and its representatives misappropriated his patented dashcam design with AI capabilities by inducing him to disclose trade secrets under the guise of needing details for a Non-Disclosure Agreement. The court recommended dismissing the case, citing lack of personal jurisdiction over the defendants and preemption of Pritchard’s state law claims by the Tennessee Uniform Trade Secrets Act (TUTSA).\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the court has personal jurisdiction over Harman Connected Services and Aaron Thompson, and whether Pritchard's claims are preempted by TUTSA.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court held that it lacked personal jurisdiction over the defendants because they did not purposefully avail themselves of conducting activities in Tennessee. The court also held that most of Pritchard’s claims are preempted by TUTSA, as they rely on allegations of trade secret misappropriation.\n\n4. **ELI5 explanation**: Chris, an inventor, claimed that a company took his invention ideas and used them without permission. He shared these ideas thinking he was working on a secret agreement to protect them. When he found products similar to his ideas on the company's website, he sued them. However, the court said Chris's case couldn't move forward here because the company didn't have enough dealings in Tennessee to be sued there, and his other claims didn't stand on their own without the main claim of trade secret theft.",

(ECF Nos. 32, 33.)   \n For the reasons below, it is recommended that the Motion to \nDismiss be granted .  \nI.  PROPOSED FINDINGS OF FACT  \n  The following factual allegations are taken primarily from \nthe amended complaint and accepted as true for purposes of deciding \nthe Motion to Dismiss. Chris Pritchard is an inventor who resides \nin Germantown, Tennessee. (ECF No. 18 at PageID 64.) He holds \ndesign patent US D 904,256 S, issued on December 8, 202 0, and \nutility patent US 11,558,584 B2, issued on January 17, 2023, for \na dashcam with artificial intelligence (“AI”) capabilities. ( Id. \nat PageID 65.)  \nIn 2021, Pritchard sought to contract with an engineering \nfirm in order to manufacture his product. ( Id. at PageID 66.) To \naccomplish this, he reached out via email to Aaron Thompson, the \nSenior Platform Director at Harman  and a resident of Brighton , \nMichigan . (Id.; ECF No. 32 at PageID 264. ) Harman is a wholly -\nowned subsidiary of Samsung Electronics Co., L td. (“Samsung”), a \nSouth Korean entity based in Seoul, South Korea. ( ECF No. 18  at \nPageID 65.) Harman is a Delaware corporation headquartered in \nMountain View, California  that supplies services to the automotive \nand consumer products industries . (ECF No.  20 at PageID 99;  20-1 \nat PageID 102.)  In his initial contact, Pritchard informed  Thompson Case 2:22-cv-02838-JPM-tmp   Document 34   Filed 08/03/23   Page 2 of 30    PageID\n<pageID>- 3 - \n that he had a dashcam prototype for which he held the design patent \nand utility patent -pending, and that he would like to contract \nwith Harman to build the product. (ECF No. 18 at PageID 66.) \nThompson sent Pritchard a calendar invitation for a ph one call via \nemail. ( Id.)  \nOn December 3, 2021, Pritchard and Thompson spoke on the phone \nfor twenty -six minutes  and discussed Pritchard’s prototype. ( Id. \nat PageID 66 , 71.) Thompson told Pritchard that “the correct way \nto go about sharing information and getting started on a future \ncollaborative effort, would be to work up a Non -Disclosure \nAgreement (NDA) .” (Id.) Thompson offered to draft the agreement  \nbut told Pritchard that “the proper wording for the NDA would need \nto include word specific content relat ed to the product .” (Id.) As \na result of this representation, Pritchard  shared “very specific \nproprietary design, technical and AI operations of the product not \nrevealed in the patent(s) so that the NDA . . . would encompass \nall the necessary details for protection of all parties involved.” \n(Id.) Thompson said he would provid e the NDA to Pritchard within \nforty-eight hours. ( Id.)  \nAfter not hearing from Thompson for two weeks,  Pritchard \ncontacted him again. ( Id. at PageID 67.) Thompson responded that \nhe was on vacation , but that the NDA was being drafted by Harman’s \nlegal depar tment. ( Id.) Pritchard heard nothing more during the \nremainder of December 2021 or January 2022. ( Id.) On February 9, Case 2:22-cv-02838-JPM-tmp   Document 34   Filed 08/03/23   Page 3 of 30    PageID\n<pageID>- 4 - \n 2022, he emailed Harman’s Global Director of New Business \nDevelopment, who said he would attempt to help Pritchard. ( Id.) \nPritchard also c ontacted Harman’s customer service phone line. \n(Id.) On April 6, 2022, Pritchard received a phone call from \nHarman’s Client Director, who said he would work on the matter. \n(Id. at PageID 68.) The Client Director emailed Pritchard to tell \nhim that Thompson would be back in contact “when the timing was \nright for a business opportunity.” ( Id.) He later emailed Pritchard \nagain to tell him that he had encouraged Thompson to contact \nPritchard once more. ( Id.) Pritchard was not contacted by any \nHarman emp loyees after this  email. (Id.)  \nIn June of 2022, Pritchard visited Harman’s website and \ndiscovered “an exact replica of Plaintiff’s product” that was \n“complete with literally every item discussed on the phone calls \nin December 2021, and mimicked every AI o peration listed in the \npatent pending page on the USPTO website.” ( Id. at PageI D 68-69.) \nAccording to Pritchard, this web posting was proof that “he was \nduped into divulging trade secrets and protected IP information \nunder the guise of information needing to be disclosed for the \nproper wording of a Non -Disclosure agreement.” ( Id. at PageID 69.)  \nPritchard filed suit  in this district court  on December 9, \n2022. (ECF No. 1.) He filed an amended complaint on January 23, \n2023. (ECF No. 18.) In his amended compla int, Pritchard brings \neleven counts: 1) trade secret misappropriation; 2) infringement Case 2:22-cv-02838-JPM-tmp   Document 34   Filed 08/03/23   Page 4 of 30    PageID\n<pageID>- 5 - \n of U.S. Patent No. US 11,558,584 B2; 3) infringement of U.S. Patent \nNo. D904,258 S; 4) breach of implied duty of good faith and fair \ndealing; 5) declaratory judgment; 6)  fraud – intentional \nmisrepresentation; 7) fraud – concealment; 8) promissory fraud; 9) \nnegligent misrepresentation; 10) breach of contract;  and 11) tort \nof another.  (Id.)     \nHarman and Thompson filed the present Motion to Dismiss on \nFebruary 6, 2023.3 (ECF No. 20.) The defendants argue that this \ncourt lacks personal jurisdiction and is not the proper venue for \nthese claims. ( Id.) They further assert that Pritchard has failed \nto state a claim upon which relief can be granted. ( Id.) Pritchard \nresponded on April 5, 2023, arguing that because Harman has a \nregistered agent in Tennessee, it is subject to the court’s \njurisdiction here. (ECF No. 28.) In his supplemental brief, \nPritchard also  contends that  because Harman formerly  had an \nautomotive plant i n West Tennessee , venue for the patent claims is \nproper in this district. (ECF No. 33 at PageID 272.)  Pritchard \nalleges that the plant in question, which  shut down operations in \n \n3Samsung is also a named defendant in this suit , but is not a party \nto this motion. I t appears that Samsung  has not yet  been served . \n(ECF No. 20 -1 at PageID 97.) Pritchard mist akenly served a \ndifferent entity on December 29, 2022. (ECF No. 9.) He informed \nThompson and Harman that he intend ed to serve Samsung under the \nHague Service Convention . (ECF No. 20 -1 at PageID 97.) In his \nsupplemental brief, Pritchard claims that “Samsung  has been duly \nserved but has ignored service.” (ECF No. 33 at PageID 271.) \nHowever, t here is presently no indication on the docket that \nSamsung has been properly served.  Case 2:22-cv-02838-JPM-tmp   Document 34   Filed 08/03/23   Page 5 of 30    PageID\n<pageID>- 6 - \n the year 2000, is “permanently bound in perpetuity by an \nEnvironmental covenant regulated by the EPA.” (Id. at PageID 275.)  \nII. PROPOSED CONCLUSIONS OF LAW  \nA.  Legal Standard  \n 1.  Rule 12(b)(2)  \n A defendant may move under Rule 12(b)(2)  to dismiss a \ncomplaint for lack of personal jurisdiction. Fed R. Civ. P. \n12(b)(2). “Personal jurisdiction is ‘[a]n essential element of the \njurisdiction of a district . . . court’ and without personal \njurisdiction the court is ‘powerless to proceed to an \nadjudication.’”  Mgmt. Registry,  Inc. v. Cloud Consulting  Partners,  \nInc., No. 3:19-CV-00340-JHM, 2019 WL 4478860,  at *3 (W.D. Ky. Sept. \n18, 2019) (quoting  Emp'rs Reinsurance  Corp. v. Bryant, 299 U.S. \n374, 382 (1937)). In order to defeat a motion to dismiss under \nRule 12(b)(2), the plaintiff must make a  prima facie case that the \ncourt has personal jurisdiction.  Conn v. Zakharov , 667 F.3d 705, \n711 (6th Cir. 2012). The court must consider the pleadings in the \nlight most favorable to the plaintiff, but also must consider any \nundisputed factual assertions by the defendant.  Id. \n2.  Rule 12(b)(3)  \n Pursuant to  Federal Rule of Civil Procedure  12(b)(3) , a \ndefendant may also move to dismiss the plaintiff's complaint for \nimproper venue. On a Rule 12(b)(3) motion to dismiss, the plaintiff \nbears the burden of proving that venue is proper. Brown v. Desoto Case 2:22-cv-02838-JPM-tmp   Document 34   Filed 08/03/23   Page 6 of 30    PageID\n<pageID>- 7 - \n Cty. Schs., No. 14 -cv-02174-SHM/tmp, 2014 WL 3952835, at *1 (W.D. \nTenn. Jun.  12, 2014). The court may examine facts outside of the \ncomplaint , but must draw reasonable inferences and resolve factual \nconflicts in favor of the plaintiff.  Roberts v. Paulin , No. 07 -\nCV-13207, 2007 WL 3203969, at *2 (E.D. Mich. Oct. 31, 2007). If \nthe court finds that venue is improper, it has the discretion to \neither dismiss  the case or transfer  it to the district in which it \ncould have been brought.  Id.; 28 U.S.C. § 1406(a). \n3.  Rule 12(b)(6) \nIn deciding a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss for failure to \nstate a claim upon which relief can be granted, the court views \nthe plaintiff’s allegations in the light most favorable to them \nand accepts all well -pleaded factual allegations as true. Ashcroft \nv. Iqbal , 556 U.S. 662, 678 –79 (2009). Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 8(a)(2) requires only “a short and plain statement of \nthe claim.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2). However, “[t]he factual \nallegations in the complaint need to be sufficient to give notice \nto the defendant as to what claims are alleged, and the plaintiff \nmust plead ‘sufficient factual matter’ to render the legal claim \nplausible, i.e., more than merely possible.” Fritz v. Charter Twp. \nof Comstock , 592 F.3d 718, 722 (6th Cir. 2010) (quoting Iqbal, 556 \nU.S. at 677). “The plausibility standard is not akin to a \n‘probability requirement,’ but it asks for more than a sheer \npossibility that a defendant has acted unlawfully.” Iqbal, 556 Case 2:22-cv-02838-JPM-tmp   Document 34   Filed 08/03/23   Page 7 of 30    PageID\n<pageID>- 8 - \n U.S. at 678 (quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly , 550 U.S. 544, 557 \n(2007)). To satisfy this requirement, the plaintiff must plead \nmore than “labels and conclusions,” “a formulaic recitation of the \nelements of a cause of action,” or “naked assertions devoid of \nfurther factual enhancement.” Id. (alteration omitted) (quoting \nTwombly, 550 U.S. at 555, 557). “A claim has facial plausibility \nwhen the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to \ndraw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the \nmisconduct alleged.” Id.  \nB.  Personal Jurisdiction  \nPritchard has asserted both patent and non -patent claims \nagainst Harman but has only asserted non -patent claims against \nThompson. (ECF No. 18.) When determining whether personal \njurisdiction exists over a patent claim, the court must rely on \nthe law of the Fede ral Circuit. Zinganything, LLC v. Wish.com , No. \n5:16CV20, 2016 WL 5232982, at *2 (N.D. Ohio Sept. 22, 2016) (citing \nImaging, Inc. v. Coyle , 340 F.3d 1344, 1348 (Fed. Cir. 2003)). \nFederal Circuit law also governs the personal jurisdiction of non -\npatent claims if “‘the resolution of the patent infringement issue \nwill be a significant factor’ in determining liability under the \nnon-patent claims .” Breckenridge Pharm., Inc. v. Metabolite Labs., \nInc., 444 F.3d 1356, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (quoting CD Sys., Inc. \nv. Aarotech Labs., Inc. , 160 F.3d 1373, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 1998)). In \nthis case, the undersigned finds that the resolution of Pritchard’s Case 2:22-cv-02838-JPM-tmp   Document 34   Filed 08/03/23   Page 8 of 30    PageID\n<pageID>- 9 - \n patent claims against Harman will be a significant factor in \ndetermining whether Harman is liable under Pritchard’s  non-patent \nclaims. Federal Circuit law therefore applies to all of his claims \nagainst Harman. However, because Pritchard has only asserted non -\npatent claims against Thompson, Sixth Circuit law governs whether \nthis court has jurisdiction over him.   \nIn both Circuits, to determine whether personal jurisdiction \nover an out -of-state defendant exists, a federal court makes two \ndeterminations: “whether a  forum state's long -arm statute permits \nservice of process, and whether the assertion of personal \njurisdiction would violate due process.” Avocent Huntsville Corp. \nv. Aten Int'l Co. , 552 F.3d 1324, 1329 (Fed. Cir. 2008); see \nBrunner v. Hampson , 441 F.3d 45 7, 463 (6th Cir. 2006). Jurisdiction \nmust comply with both the state ’s long-arm statute and federal \nconstitutional law in order to be properly exercised.  Radio Sys. \nCorp. v. Accession, Inc. , 638 F.3d 785, 789 (Fed. Cir. 2011) \n(citing Avocent, 552 F.3d at 1 329); Brunner, 441 F.3d at 463.  In \nTennessee, nonresidents are subject to the jurisdiction of the \ncourts of the state “as to any action or claim for relief arising \nfrom: (1) The transaction of any business within this state; (2) \nAny tortious act or omissio n within the state; . . . (6) Any basis \nnot inconsistent with the constitution of this state or of the \nUnited States[.]”  Tenn. Code Ann. § 20-2-214. Because Tennessee’s \nlong-arm statute allows the exercise of personal jurisdiction to Case 2:22-cv-02838-JPM-tmp   Document 34   Filed 08/03/23   Page 9 of 30    PageID\n<pageID>- 10 - \n the full extent permissible under the federal constitution, the \nanalysis of both questions is the same. Maxchief Invs. Ltd. v. Wok \n& Pan, Ind., Inc. , 909 F.3d 1134, 1137 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (cit ing \nFirst Cmty. Bank, N.A. v. First Tenn. Bank, N.A. , 489 S.W.3d 369, \n383–84 (Tenn. 2015)); see Smith v. Home Depot USA, Inc. , 294 F. \nApp'x 186, 189 (6th Cir. 2008).  \nThe federal constitutional requirement of due process is \nsatisfied when the plaintiff sho ws that the defendant has \n“sufficient ‘minimum contacts’ with the forum state such that the \nsuit not offend ‘traditional notions of fair play and substantial \njustice.’” Maxchief Invs. , 909 F.3d at 1137 (quoting Bristol-Myers \nSquibb Co. v. Superior Ct. of C alifornia , 582 U.S. 255, 271 \n(2017)). Federal courts may exercise two varieties of personal \njurisdiction: general jurisdiction or specific jurisdiction. \nNexLearn, LLC v. Allen Interactions, Inc. , 859 F.3d 1371, 1375 \n(Fed. Cir. 2017); see S. Concrete Prod.,  Inc. v. Liberty Holdings, \nL.P., No. 1:19 -cv-01105-STA-jay, 2021 WL 5099601, at *2 (W.D. Tenn. \nNov. 2, 2021) (quoting Int'l Shoe Co. v. State of Wash., Off. of \nUnemployment Comp. & Placement , 326 U.S. 310, 316 (1945)).  \n 1.  Specific Jurisdiction  \n The law governing specific jurisdiction is the same in both \nthe Sixth Circuit and the Federal Circuit. Specific jurisdiction \nis based on the relationship between “the defendant, the forum, \nand the litigation.” NexLearn , 859 F.3d at 1375 (citing Walden v. Case 2:22-cv-02838-JPM-tmp   Document 34   Filed 08/03/23   Page 10 of 30    PageID\n<pageID>- 11 - \n Fiore, 571 U.S. 277, 284 (2014)). In order for specific \njurisdiction to exist, the court must determine that: “(1) the \ndefendant purposefully directed its activities at residents of the \nforum, (2) the claim arises out of or relates to those activities, \nand (3) assertion of personal jurisdiction is reasonable and fair.” \nAvocent, 552 F.3d at 1332 (citing Breckenridge Pharm. , 444 F.3d at \n1362); see Beydoun v. Wataniya Rest s. Holding, Q.S.C. , 768 F.3d \n499, 505 (6th Cir. 2014).  In order for the first prong of this \ntest to be satisfied, the defendants must have taken “‘some act by \nwhich [they] purposefully avail[ed] [themselves] of the privilege \nof conducting activities within the forum State.’” Trimble Inc. v. \nPerDiemCo LLC , 997 F.3d 1147, 1153 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (quoting Int'l \nShoe Co. , 326 U.S. at 316–17); see Beydoun, 768 F.3d at 505 -06 \n(citing Neogen Corp. v. Neo Gen Screening, Inc. , 282 F.3d 883, 889 \n(6th Cir. 2002) and Fortis Corporate Ins. v. Viken Ship Mgmt. , 450 \nF.3d 214, 218 (6th Cir. 2006)) (“In the Sixth Circuit, the emphasis \nin the purposeful availment inquiry is whether the defendant has \nengaged in some overt actions connecting the defendant with the \nforum state.”).  \nThe undersigned finds that Pritchard has not made this showing  \nfor either defendant . In his complaint, Pritchard acknowledges \nthat he initiated contact with Thompson. (ECF No. 18 at PageID 66; \nNo. 20-2 at PageID 121.) When the two spoke on the phone, Thompson \nwas not aware Pritchard was calling him from Ten nessee. (ECF No. Case 2:22-cv-02838-JPM-tmp   Document 34   Filed 08/03/23   Page 11 of 30    PageID\n<pageID>- 12 - \n 20-2 at PageID 121.) After the phone call, neither Thompson nor \nany other employee at Harman continued to pursue a business \nrelationship  with Pritchard. (ECF No. 18 at PageID 66.) To the \nextent that there were further interactions between Pritchard and \nthe defendants , they were brought about by Pritchard. (ECF No. 18 \nat PageID 66 -68.) It is clear from these facts that there were no \npurposeful a ctions taken by the defendants to engage in business \nin Tennessee. Because there was no purposeful availment, the \nundersigned finds that this court lacks specific jurisdiction over \neither defendant .  \n2.  General Jurisdiction   \n The law of general jurisdicti on varies depending on  whether \na defendant is an individual or a corporation. It is undisputed \nthat an individual, such as Thompson, is subject to general \njurisdiction where they are domiciled. Ford Motor Co. v. Montana \nEighth Jud. Dist. Ct. , 141 S. Ct. 10 17, 1024 (2021) (citing Daimler \nAG v. Bauman , 571 U.S. 117, 137 (2014)). Thompson is domiciled in \nMichigan. (ECF No. 20 -2 at PageID 119.) This court therefore lacks \ngeneral jurisdiction over Thompson. For this reason, the \nundersigned recommends that the Motion to Dismiss for lack of \npersonal jurisdiction be granted for all claims against Thompson.  \nWhether general jurisdiction exists over a corporate entity \nlike Harman is more complicated.  The modern iteration of g eneral \njurisdiction in the corporate cont ext was first described in Case 2:22-cv-02838-JPM-tmp   Document 34   Filed 08/03/23   Page 12 of 30    PageID\n<pageID>- 13 - \n International Shoe , which held that general jurisdiction exists \nwhere a corporation’s “continuous corporate operations within a \nstate [are] so substantial and of such a nature as to justify suit \nagainst it on causes of action ari sing from dealings entirely \ndistinct from those activities.” 326 U.S.  at 318. General \njurisdiction can thus be exercised when a corporation’s \naffiliations with a state are “ so ‘continuous and systematic’ as \nto render them essentially at home in the forum S tate.” Daimler, \n571 U.S. at 127 (citing Goodyear Dunlop Tires Operations, S.A. v. \nBrown, 564 U.S. 915, 919 (2011)). In the “paradigm” case, a \ncorporation is subject to general jurisdiction in its state of \nincorporation and the state where it is headquarter ed. Ford Motor \nCo., 141 S. Ct. at 1024 (citing Daimler, 571 U.S. at 137).  \n The primary issue in the present case is whether this court \nmay exercise general jurisdiction over Harman on a different basis: \nbecause Harman has consented to the general jurisdiction of \nTennessee by complying with the state’s registration statute for \nforeign corporations. (ECF No. 28 at PageID 227 -28.) In addition \nto the jurisdictional princip les set forth above, a defendant is \nsubject to personal jurisdiction in a state where it has consented \nto that jurisdiction. See Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz , 471 U.S. \n462, 472 n.14 (1985). Historically, one means of consenting to \npersonal jurisdiction in a state was compliance with that state’s  \nforeign corporation  law by designating an agent for receipt of Case 2:22-cv-02838-JPM-tmp   Document 34   Filed 08/03/23   Page 13 of 30    PageID\n<pageID>- 14 - \n process. See Penn. Fire Ins. Co. of Philadelphia v. Gold Is sue \nMin. & Mill. Co. , 243 U.S. 93, 96 (1917). However, the ruling in \nInternational Shoe  “cast doubt on the idea, once pursued by many \nstate courts, that a company ‘consents’ to suit when it is forced \nto incorporate or designate an agent for receipt of proc ess in a \njurisdiction other than its home State.” Ford Motor Co. , 141 S. \nCt. at 1037 (Gorsuch, J., concurring). This is because \nInternational Shoe  and its progeny - the decisions that serve as \nthe basis for the “essentially at home” rule - were specific to  \ncases of “general jurisdiction appropriately exercised over a \nforeign corporation that has not consented  to suit in the forum.” \nDaimler, 571 U.S. at 137  (emphasis added) ; Int’l Shoe , 326 U.S. at \n317. For that reason, in 2021, the Supreme Court noted that “[i]t \nis unclear what remains of the old ‘consent’ theory after \nInternational Shoe’s  criticism. Some courts read International \nShoe and the cases that follow as effectively foreclosing it, while \nothers insist it remains viable.” Ford Motor Co. , 141 S. Ct. at \n1037 n.3 (Gorsuch, J., concurring).  \nThis confusion  has led Circuits to take different  approaches \nto the consent question. The Sixth Circuit, for example, analyzed \nthe Supreme Court’s general jurisdiction precedent and concluded \nthat “the m ere designation of an agent in compliance with the \nservice-of-process statute does not automatically eliminate the \nrequirement of minimum contacts to establish personal Case 2:22-cv-02838-JPM-tmp   Document 34   Filed 08/03/23   Page 14 of 30    PageID\n<pageID>- 15 - \n jurisdiction.” Pittock v. Otis Elevator Co. , 8 F.3d 325, 329 (6th \nCir. 1993); see Relyant Glob., LLC v. Gibraltar -Caddell, No. 3:22 -\nCV-183, 2023 WL 3267757, at *3 (E.D. Tenn. Mar. 31, 2023) (holding \nthat “the weight of authority and binding Sixth Circuit precedent \nrequire the Court to find that standing alone, the designation of \nan agent for  service of process [in Tennessee] is not enough to \nconfer personal jurisdiction on the Court.”) . Meanwhile, the \nFederal Circuit, which governs jurisdictional questions in patent \ncases, to date has not taken a position  on this issue . In Acorda \nTherapeutics  Inc. v. Mylan Pharma., Inc. , 817 F.3d 755 (Fed. Cir. \n2016), Judge  Kathleen  O’Malley discussed the matter at length in \na concurrence, where she stated that “Daimler did not overrule the \nline of Supreme Court authority establishing that a corporation \nmay consent to jurisdiction over its person by choosing to comply \nwith a state's registration statute.” Id. at 767. According to the \nconcurrence, the court should have re sted its holding on the \ndefendant’s “voluntary, express consent” to the jurisdiction of \nDelaware via compliance with the state’s registration statute. Id. \nat 770. However, t he reasoning set forth in Judge O’Malley’s Acorda \nconcurrence has not been adopted by the Federal Circuit.  \nOn June 27, 2023, the Supreme Court answered the question \ndirectly: the Court’s “rule for consent -based jurisdiction has not \nbeen overruled. International Shoe  governs where a defendant has \nnot consented to exercise of jurisdiction. ” Mallory v. Norfolk S. Case 2:22-cv-02838-JPM-tmp   Document 34   Filed 08/03/23   Page 15 of 30    PageID\n<pageID>- 16 - \n Ry. Co., No. 21 -1168, 2023 WL 4187749, at *12  n.11 (U.S. June 27, \n2023) (internal citations omitted) . In Mallory, the plaintiff \nargued that Norfolk Southern Railway was subject to personal \njurisdiction in Pennsylvania because it had  complied with the \nstate’s registration statute for foreign corporations. Id. at *3. \nThe statute in question “is explicit that ‘qualification as a \nforeign corporation’ shall permit state courts to ‘exercise \ngeneral personal jurisdiction’ over a registered foreign \ncorporation.” Id. at *7 (quoting 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. \n§ 5301(a)(2)(i)). Norfolk Southern contended that exercise of \ngeneral jurisdiction based on its compliance with the registration \nstatute violated the Due Process clause. Id. at *2. The Supreme \nCourt disagreed and held that general jurisdiction was properly \nexercised. Id. at *12. The idea that corporations can consent to \ngeneral jurisdiction by complying with a state’s registration \nstatute remains good law because “ all International Shoe  did was \nstake out an additional  road to jurisdiction over out -of-state \ncorporations.” Id. at *8 (emphasis in original) . “Consistent with \nall this, our precedents applying International Shoe  have long \nspoken of the decision as asking whether a s tate court may exercise \njurisdiction over a corporate defendant that has not consented  to \nsuit in the forum.” Id. (citing Goodyear , 564 U. S. at 927 –928) \n(emphasis in original) . However, the International Shoe  test is \nnot the only means through which a sta te can exercise jurisdiction Case 2:22-cv-02838-JPM-tmp   Document 34   Filed 08/03/23   Page 16 of 30    PageID\n<pageID>- 17 - \n because “an out -of-state corporation that has consented to in -\nstate suits in order to do business in the forum ” is similarly  \n“susceptible to suit there.” Id. According to Mallory, compliance \nwith Pennsylvania’s registration statute is one means of \nexpressing  this consent.  Id. at *7.  \nMallory is not conclusive  on the question of whether the \nFederal Circuit permits this court to exercise personal \njurisdiction over Harman. Unlike the Pennsylvania registration \nstatute, Tennessee’s analogous law contains no language expressly \naffirming the corporation’s consent to general jurisdiction. See \nTenn. Code Ann. §§ 48 –25–101(a), 107 (2002). Thus, the issue of \nwhether a corporation consents to jurisdiction by complying with \nthis statute remains open to debate.  \nGiven the lack of explicit language in the Tennessee statute \nstating that registration of a foreign corporation constitutes \nconsent to the exercise general personal jurisdiction, the \nundersigned finds that this case is distinguishable from Mallory. \nUnlike a corporation registering to do business in Pennsylvania, \nHarman did not expressly consent to the general personal \njurisdiction of Tennessee merely by complying  with Tennessee’s \nstatute. Because there has been no consen t, the International Shoe  \nframework applies. Mallory, 2023 WL 4187749 , at *8. Under \nInternational Shoe, a court sitting in Tennessee  may exercise \ngeneral personal jurisdiction over a corporation that is Case 2:22-cv-02838-JPM-tmp   Document 34   Filed 08/03/23   Page 17 of 30    PageID\n<pageID>- 26 - \n formation  of a contract.  To establish a claim for breach of \ncontract  under Tennessee law , a plaintiff must plausibly allege : \n(1) the exis tence of an enforceable contract; (2) non -performance \namounting to a breach of that contract; and (3) damages caused by \nthe breach.  Person v. Roach , No. 14 -cv-2788-JDT-tmp, 2015 WL \n3606595, at *5 (W.D. Tenn. May 11, 2015) (citing C & W Asset \nAcquisition,  LLC v. Oggs, 230 S.W.3d 671, 676–77 (Tenn. Ct. App. \n2007)). A contract, either written or oral, “must result from a \nmeeting of the minds of the parties in mutual assent to the terms, \nmust be based upon a sufficient consideration, free from fraud or \nundue influence, not against public policy and sufficiently \ndefinite to be enforced.” Gatlin v. Scott , No. M2018 -02293-COA-\nR3-CV, 2019 WL 4567497, at *2 (Tenn. Ct. App. Sept. 20, 2019) \n(citing Higgins v. Oil, Chem. and Atomic Workers Int'l Union, 811 \nS.W.2d 875, 879 (Tenn. 1991)). “The legal mechanism by which \nparties sho w their assent to be bound is through offer and \nacceptance.” Id. (quoting Moody Realty Co., Inc. v. Huestis, 237 \nS.W.3d 666, 675, n.8 (Tenn. Ct. App.  2007)). \n Pritchard alleges in his amended complaint that an “oral \ncontract was entered on December 3, 2021, at 1:59 p.m., when \nPlaintiff and Mr. Thompson engaged in a confidential call upon \nwhich Plaintiff sought the correct way to go about sharing \ninformation and getting started on a possible, future, \ncollaborative effort regarding Plaintiff’s invention.” (ECF No. 18 Case 2:22-cv-02838-JPM-tmp   Document 34   Filed 08/03/23   Page 26 of 30    PageID\n<pageID>- 27 - \n at PageID 82.)  This allegation is not sufficient to plausibly \nestablish the existence of a contract. There are no facts that \ndetail an offer, acceptan ce, and consideration , nor is it clear \nwhat was promised by each party under the terms of this alleged \noral contract.  Thus, the undersigned recommends that  the motion as \nto Pritchard’s breach of contract claim be  granted on this \nadditional ground .  \n Pritchard also claims that  Harman breached its implied duty \nof good faith and fair dealing. (ECF No. 18 at PageID 75.) However, \n“without a contract, [Pritchard]  cannot sustain a claim for breach \nof the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing .” Cadence Bank, \nN.A. v. The Alpha Trust , 473 S.W.3d 756, 774 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2015 ). \nBecause the undersigned finds that  Pritchard has not alleged the \nexistence of a contract , the undersigned recommends that the motion \nas to this claim be granted for this additional reason .   \n 3. Remaining State Law Claims  \n Harman argues that Pritchard’s remaining state law claims  for \nfraud and negligent misrepresentation  (Counts 6, 7, 8, and 9) are \npreempted by  TUTSA. TUTSA by its terms “displaces conflicting tort, \nrestitutionary, and other [Tennessee] law . . . providing civil \nremedies for misappropriation of a trade secret.” Tenn. Code Ann. \n§ 47–25–1708(a). The Tennessee Supreme Court has not yet \ninterpreted the scope  of TUTSA's displacement, but other state and \nfederal courts have applied the “same proof” standard, under which Case 2:22-cv-02838-JPM-tmp   Document 34   Filed 08/03/23   Page 27 of 30    PageID\n<pageID>- 28 - \n “a claim will be preempted when it necessarily rises or falls based \non whether the defendant is found to have ‘misappropriated’ a \n‘trade secret ’ as those two terms are defined in the [T]UTSA.” PGT \nTrucking, Inc. v. Jones , No. 15 -1032, 2015 WL 4094265, at *4 (W.D. \nTenn. July 7, 2015) ( collecting cases). Stated differently, “if \nproof of a non -[T]UTSA claim would also simultaneously establish \na claim for misappropriation of trade secrets, it is preempted \nirrespective of whatever surplus elements or proof were necessary \nto establish it.”  Id. (quoting  Hauck Mfg. Co. v. Astec Indus., \nInc., 375 F. Supp. 2d 649, 658 (E.D. Tenn. 2004)). “[P]laintiffs \nalleging theft or misuse of their ideas, data, or other \ncommercially valuable information are confined to the single cause \nof action provided by the [T]UTSA.” PGT Trucking , 2015 WL 4094265, \nat *5 (quoting Hauck, 375 F. Supp. 2d 649 at 659).  \n The facts supporting count six  (fraud - intentional \nmisrepresentation) , eight (promissory fraud), and nine  (negligent \nmisrepresentation)  are largely identical . Pritchard alleges that \nThompson made misrepresentations that he would draft a n NDA in \norder to trick Pritchard into divulging his trade secrets. These \nclaims “ necessarily rise[] or fall[] based on whether the defendant \nis found to have ‘misappropriated’ a ‘trade secret ,’” and thus are \npreempted by TUTSA.  Thus, the undersigned recommends that counts Case 2:22-cv-02838-JPM-tmp   Document 34   Filed 08/03/23   Page 28 of 30    PageID\n<pageID>- 29 - \n six, eight, and nine  be dismissed  on this additional ground .6 \nHauck, 375 F. Supp. 2d 649 at 657.  \n Count Seven in Pritchard’s complaint is a claim of “fraud – \nconcealment.” (ECF No. 18 at PageID 78.) In support of this claim, \nPritchard alleges that when he followed up with Harman employees \nregarding the NDA, they did not give him a clear answer and instead  \n“acted oblivious of the goings -on.” (Id.) Pritchard claims that if \nhe had known earlier that “Thompson had already disclose d the trade \nsecrets to the Defendants, he would have made diligent efforts to \nprevent the Defendants from appropriating the trade secrets and \npatent(s) into their product.” (Id.) Again, this claim  is preempted \nby TUTSA because it  depends on whether Harman is found to have \nmisappropriated trade secrets.  The undersigned recommends count \nseven be dismissed  for this additional reason .7  \nIII. RECOMMENDATION  \n For the above reasons, it is recommended that the defendants’ \nMotion to Dismiss be granted.   \n Respectfully submitted,   \ns/ Tu M. Pham       \n \n6The undersigned has recommended that Pritchard’s TUTSA claim be \ndismissed. Preemption under TUTSA applies even if  a plaintiff fails \nto plead the existence of a trade secret . Hauck, 375 F. Supp. 2d \n649 at 657. \n \n7In addition to the claims discussed above, Pritchard brings two \nother counts : count five (declaratory judgment) and count eleven \n(tort of another). These “counts” involve forms of relief  or are \notherwise preempted by TUTSA.   Case 2:22-cv-02838-JPM-tmp   Document 34   Filed 08/03/23   Page 29 of 30    PageID\n<pageID>- 30 - \n TU M.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: The case involves eight music publishers suing Anthropic PBC, an AI company, for allegedly using their copyrighted song lyrics to train its AI model, Claude, without permission. The court dismissed the case for lack of personal jurisdiction and improper venue, and transferred it to the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. The case highlights how AI can be involved in copyright infringement disputes when models use copyrighted material to enhance AI capabilities.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the Middle District of Tennessee has personal jurisdiction over Anthropic PBC given the company's limited connections to Tennessee.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court held that it lacked personal jurisdiction over Anthropic PBC because the company’s activities in Tennessee were insufficient to establish the necessary minimum contacts. Consequently, the court decided to transfer the case to a jurisdiction where Anthropic has its principal place of business – the Northern District of California.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine you have a special robot that learns a lot from reading books. One day, a group of authors say the robot read their books without asking and started talking about them. They wanted to take this complaint to a court in Nashville.

(Doc. No. 54).  This  matter has \nbeen fully briefed and is ripe for review.  ( See Doc. Nos. 55, 79, 89).  For the following re asons, \nAnthropic ’s Motion will be granted in part, and this case will be transferred to the United States \nDistrict Court for the Northern District of California.  \nI. BACKGROUND1 \nA. Case Overview  \nPlaintiffs2 are eight music publishers who allege that Anthropic, an artificial intelligence \n(“AI”) “safety and research company, ” improperly used their copyrighted song lyrics to train its \nsignature product —a series of generative AI conversational interface  models r eferred to as \n“Claude. ”  Claude is a large language model that is “ trained ” with “vast amounts of text copied \n \n1 The Court draws the following facts from the Complaint (Doc. No. 1)  as well as the \nuncontroverted assertions contained in the  exhibits and declarations to the parties ’ briefs  (see \nDoc. Nos. 55- 1; 80–85).  See Anwar  v. Dow Chem . Co., 876 F.3d 841, 847 (6th Cir.  2017) .  \n \n2 Concord Music Group, Inc.; Capitol CMG, Inc.; Universal Music Corp.; Songs of Universal, \nInc.; Universal Music -  MGB NA LLC; Polygram Publishing, Inc.; Universal Music -  Z Tunes \nLLC; and ABKCO Music, Inc.  \nCase 3:23-cv-01092     Document 123     Filed 06/24/24     Page 1 of 24 PageID #: <pageID>2 from the internet, totaling billions or trillions of words, ” known as its “ training corpus.”   (Doc. \nNo. 1 ¶¶ 50, 62; see also  Doc. No. 55- 1 ¶ 17).  Claude does not simply regurgitate this \ninformation when prompted; rather, it applies  complex reasoning and creativity to its training \ncorpus in a way that approximates human cognition.  ( See Doc. No. 55- 1 ¶¶ 11, 13).  As a result, \nusers can have open -ended text conversations with Claude, and Claude is “able to provide text -\nbased responses to user queries in a seemingly intelligent, human- like manner. ”  (Id.).   \nPlaintiffs allege Anthropic used their copyrighted song lyrics to “train” Claude.  ( Doc. \nNo. 1 ¶ 6; see also  Doc. No. 63 at 5).  Thus, when a user prompts Claude to provide lyrics to \nPlaintiffs ’ copyrighted songs, Claude outputs  identical or nearly identical copies of those lyrics.  \n(Doc. No. 1  ¶ 8).  Plaintiffs argue that by “ copying and exploiting [their] lyrics in this manner —\nboth as the input it uses to train its AI models and as the output those AI models generate —\nAnthropic directly infringes their exclusive rights as copyright holders.”   (Id. ¶¶ 11, 111 –18). \nPlaintiffs further contend that Anthropic is secondarily liable for the infringing acts of its users, \nand for unlawfully removing or altering copyright management information from their musical compositions.  ( Id. ¶¶ 11, 119–53).  Anthropic maintains that its inclusion of copyrighted song \nlyrics in the training corpus for Claude constitutes “ fair use ” under 17 U.S.C. § 107, and, \ntherefore, Anthropic is not required to pay for licenses over those  lyrics.  ( See Doc. No. 63 at 5).  \nOn October 18, 2023, Plainti ffs filed this lawsuit  in the United States District Court for \nthe Middle District of Tennessee, raising four causes of action under the federal Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. § 101, et seq. : (1) direct copyright infringement; (2) contributory infringement; (3) \nvicarious infringement; and (4) removal or alteration of copyright management information.3   \n \n3 Plaintiffs have also moved for a preliminary inj unction under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \n65.  ( See Doc. No. 40).  \nCase 3:23-cv-01092     Document 123     Filed 06/24/24     Page 2 of 24 PageID #: <pageID>3 B. Jurisdictional Facts and Allegations  \nAnthropic is a  Delaware company with its principal place of business in San Francisco, \nCalifornia.   (Doc. No. 1  ¶¶ 7, 33).   Plaintiffs are mostly California, Delaware, or New York \ncompanies with their principal place of business in California, except for Concord Music Group, \nInc. (a Delaware company with its principal place of business in Tennessee) and ABKCO Music, Inc. (a New  York company with its principal place of business in New York).  ( Id. ¶¶ 21 –33).  \nClaude was created, trained, and developed in California, the computers and data used to \ntrain Claude are hosted in Virginia, the servers that host Claude are based in Iowa, and Claude ’s \nsource code is located remotely with a Delaware company, Github, whose headquarters are in California.  (Doc. No. 55 -1 ¶¶ 20–22).  Moreover, Anthropic ’s offices in the United States are all \nlocated in California , with the  vast majority of Anthropic ’s 261 employees living in and working  \nfrom California .   (Id. ¶¶ 5, 7).  M ost engineers who work on and train Claude on a day- to-day \nbasis are in  California, though there are a few engineers in  London, New York, and Seattle .  (Id. \n¶¶ 9). There are  a total of  three Anthropic employees who live in Tennessee and work remotely \nout of their Tennessee homes for California offices.  ( Id.).  Those three employees ’ job titles are: \n(1) Head of Product and Head of Business Operations; (2) Recruiter; and (3) Research Engineer.  (Id.).  Anthropic permits, but does not require, these three employees to work remotely from \nTennessee.  ( Id. ¶ 8).   \nClaude ’s expansive traini ng corpus of “more than a trillion ” units of data  includes some \ninformation  related  to Tennessee .  (See Doc. No. 80- 6; Doc. No. 55- 1 ¶¶ 17, 20).  For example, \nAnthropic ’s California -based engineers  “taught ” Claude how to respond to Tennessee -focused \nqueries like: “ What are good places to visit in Nashville? ” and “How do you make Nashville hot \nchicken? ”  (See Doc. No. 80- 6 at 5).  With that training input , Claude can also generate outputs  \nregarding Tennessee- specific information . \nCase 3:23-cv-01092     Document 123     Filed 06/24/24     Page 3 of 24 PageID #: <pageID>4 Anthropic provides access to its Claude AI models in two ways.  First, Anthropic ’s \nwebsite allows users to “Talk to Claude ” through a chatbox, which is available as a limited free \nversion or a s a more robust  paid version.  ( Doc. No. 1 ¶ 52).  Anthropic ’s website  (located at \nhttps://www.anthropic.com/ product) and the  Claude  chatbox  (located at https://claude.ai) are \navailable to users globally and throughout the United States, including to users in Tennessee.   \n(Doc. Nos. 80- 3, 80- 4; see also  Doc. No. 55- 1 ¶ 24).  To access and “ talk” to Claude, a user  must \nfirst create an account on Anthropic ’s website by providing their email address, full name, phone \nnumber, and a login code that Anthropic emails them.4  (Doc. No. 80- 4).  The second way \nAnthropic makes Claude available is by selling or licensing a commercial Application \nProgramming Interface ( “API”) that allows businesses  to incorporate Claude into  their own \nsoftware.  ( Doc. No. 1 ¶ 52; Doc. No. 80- 15).  Anthropic allegedly sold API access and licensed \nClaude to three Tennessee companies.   (See Doc. No. 79 at 4–5, 8).  Both “Anthropic ’s Claude \nwebsite and API are maintained by employees based in California.”   (Doc. No. 55- 1 ¶ 23).  \nBased on these facts, Anthropic filed the instant motion to dismiss for lack of personal \njurisdiction and improper venue.  ( See Doc. No. 54).  \nII. MOTION TO DISMISS FOR LACK OF PERSONAL JURISDICTION \nAnthropic moves to dismiss the Complaint for “ lack of persona l jurisdiction ” under \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(2).   The Court may decide a 12(b)(2) “ motion on the basis \nof affidavits alone; or it may permit discovery in aid of the motion; or it may conduct an \nevidentiary hearing on the merits of the motion.”   Malone v. Stanley Black & Decker, Inc. , 965 \nF.3d 499, 505 (6th Cir. 2020) (citation omitted).  Where, as here, the Court rules on written \nsubmissions alone, the plaintiff  bears the “relatively slight”  burden of making a prima facie \n \n4 Users must also agree to Anthropic’s Terms of Service, which require, among other things, that \nthe user agree to “submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of courts in California.”  \n(Doc. No. 55- 1 ¶ 25).   \nCase 3:23-cv-01092     Document 123     Filed 06/24/24     Page 4 of 24 PageID #: <pageID>5 showing that persona l jurisdiction exists.  See id.  In considering whether the plaintiff has \nsatisfied its  prima facie burden, the Court may accept as true  the: (1) allegations in the Complaint \nthat “are uncontroverted by the defendant -movant,”  (2) “averments in the plaintiff ’s declarations \n(even if contradicted), ” and (3) “ defendant ’s undisputed factual assertions.”   See Ncontracts \nLLC. v. Holmberg, 2022 WL 17724148, at *3  (M.D. Tenn. Dec. 15, 2022)  (summarizing \napplicable standards  of review ).  The Court must view the above -referenced “pleadings and \naffidavits in a light most favorable to the plaintiff and not weigh the controverting assertions of \nthe party seeking dismissal.”   Peters  Broad. Eng’g, Inc. v. 24 Cap., LLC , 40 F.4th 432, 437 (6th \nCir. 2022)  (citation  and internal  quotation marks  omitted).   Dismissal  is appropriate only if these  \nfacts collectively fail to state a prima facie case for jurisdiction .  See  CompuServe, Inc. v. \nPatterson , 89 F.3d 1257, 1262 (6th Cir. 1996) .    \nHere, because the “court’s subject -matter jurisdiction is based on a federal question, the \ncourt ’s exercise of personal jurisdiction must be both authorized by the for um State ’s long- arm \nstatute and in accordance with the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.”   \nAlixP artners, LLP v. Brewington, 836 F.3d 543, 549–50 (6th Cir. 2016) (citing Bird v. Parsons , \n289 F.3d 865, 871 (6th Cir. 2002)).  Tennessee ’s long- arm statute, Tenn. Code Ann. § 20- 2-214, \nextends its jurisdiction to the limits of the Due Process Clause, so the Court need only determine \nwhether exercising personal jurisdiction would violate Anthropic ’s due process rights.  See Intera \nCorp. v. Henderson, 428 F.3d 605, 616 (6th Cir. 2005) (citing Aristech Chem. Int ’l v. Acrylic \nFabricators , 138 F.3d 624, 627 (6th Cir. 1998)).   \nDue Process requires the defendant  to have sufficient  “minimum contacts with [the forum \nState ] such that the maintenance of the suit does not offend traditional notions of fair play and \nsubstantial justice. ”  International Shoe  Co. v. Washington, 326 U.S. 310, 316 (1945) (citations \nCase 3:23-cv-01092     Document 123     Filed 06/24/24     Page 5 of 24 PageID #: <pageID>6 and internal quotation marks omitted).  “Minimum contacts ” exist when the nonresident ’s \n“conduct and connection with the forum State are such that he should reasonably anticipate being \nhaled into court there.”   World -Wide V olkswagen Corp. v. Woodson, 444 U.S. 286, 297 (1980); \nsee also  Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz , 471 U.S. 462, 475–76 (1985) .  “Personal jurisdiction \nmay be found either generally or specifically ,” Miller v. AXA Winterthur Ins. Co., 694 F.3d 675, \n678 (6th Cir. 2012) , but only specific personal jurisdiction is relevant  here.  ( See Doc. No. 79 at \n6 n.2 ( “Publishers do not assert general jurisdiction. ”)).  \nSpecific, or limited, jurisdiction exists  “only to the extent that a claim arises out of or \nrelates to a defendant ’s contacts in the forum state. ”  Miller , 694 F.3d at 679 (citing Kerry Steel, \nInc. v. Paragon Indus., Inc., 106 F.3d 147, 149 (6th Cir. 1997)).  In Southern Machine Co. v. \nMohasco Indus., Inc., the  Sixth Circuit identified a three- part test to determine whether due \nprocess requirements have been met for specific jurisdiction :    \nFirst, the defendant must purposefull y avail himself of the privilege of acting in \nthe forum state or causing a consequence in the forum state. Second, the cause of \naction must arise from the defendant ’s activities there. Finally, the acts of the \ndefendant or consequences caused by the defendant must have a substantial \nenough connection with the forum state to make the exercise of jurisdiction over \nthe defendant reasonable.  \n401 F.2d 374, 381 (6th Cir. 1968).  “ If any of the three requirements is not met, personal \njurisdiction may not be invoked.”   Miller , 694 F.3d at 680.  That is, each Mohasco  criterion \n“represents an independent requirement, and failure to meet any one of the three means that \npersonal jurisdiction”  does not exist.  LAK Inc. v. Deer  Creek  Enters. , 885 F.2d 1293, 1303 (6th \nCir. 1989) . \nWith these standards in mind, the Court now turns to the three Mohasco  criteria and \nwhether Plaintiffs  have  met their burden to establish that this Court has specific personal \njurisdiction over Anthropic.  \nCase 3:23-cv-01092     Document 123     Filed 06/24/24     Page 6 of 24 PageID #: <pageID>7 A. Purposeful Availment  and the Effects Test  \nBefore a nonresident defendant may be sued in federal court , the defendant must have \npurposefully availed itself of the “ privilege of conducting activities within the forum state, thus \ninvoking the benefits and protections of its laws.”   Burge r King , 471 U.S. at 475.  Purposeful \navailment is “ something akin to a deliberate undertaking”  and exists “when the defendant ’s \ncontacts with the forum state proximately result from actions by the defendant himself that create \na substantial connection with the forum state, and when the defendant ’s conduct and connection \nwith the forum are such that he should reasonably anticipate  being haled into court there. ”  \nBridgeport Music, Inc. v. Still N The Water Pub., 327 F.3d 472, 478 (6th Cir. 2003)  (citation and \ninternal quotation marks omitted).   This requirement  “ensures that a defendant will not be haled \ninto a jurisdiction solely a s a result of random, fortuitous, or attenuated contacts, or of the \nunilateral activity of another party or a third person.”   Burger King, 471 U.S. at 475.  \nWhen the case involves an intentional tort (here , copyright infringement) , “the focus of \nthe purposeful availment analysis shifts to consider whether the defendant ’s conduct was \n‘purposefully directed’  or ‘expressly aimed ’ at the forum state. ”  Devnani v. DKM Solutions , \nInc., 2017 WL 4682273, at *6 (E.D. Mich. Oct. 18, 2017) ; see also  Bucklew v. H awkins, Ash, \nBaptie & Co., LLP , 329 F.3d 923, 931 (7th Cir. 2003)  (“Copyright infringement . . . is an \nintentional tort. ”).  Thus, copyright infringement claims “ are analyzed under an ‘updated’ version \nof the ‘effects test’ first enunciated in Calder v. Jones , 465 U.S. 783 (1984), which considers \nwhether the defendant (1) committed an intentional act, (2) expressly aimed at the forum state, \n(3) causing harm that the defendant knows is likely to be suffered in the forum state. ”  Devnani , \n2017 WL 4682273, at *6; see also  Scotts Co. v. Aventis S.A., 145 F. App’ x 109, 113 (6th Cir. \n2005).  The Court will assume, without deciding, that  Plaintiffs have made  a prima facie showing \nthat Anthropic  committed an intentional act and caused harm to Concord (the only Tennessee \nCase 3:23-cv-01092     Document 123     Filed 06/24/24     Page 7 of 24 PageID #: <pageID>8 Plaintiff ) in Tennessee.  See Pearl Records, Inc. v. Conner , 2023 WL 351203 (M.D. Tenn. Jan. \n20, 2023) (quoting Yellow Pages Photos, Inc. v. Z iplocal, LP , 2012 WL 2952452, at *5 (M.D. \nFla. 2012) ) (“The situs of the injury in copyright infringement for purposes of personal \njurisdiction, has generally been held to be the state where the copyright owner resides.”).  The \nCourt will therefore focus o n the second element —whether Anthropic expressly aimed its \nconduct at Tennessee—because it is dispositive of the analysis.5  See Walden v. Fiore , 571 U.S. \n277, 290 (2014) (“The proper question is not where the plaintiff experienced a particular injury \nor effect but whether the defendant’s conduct connects him to the forum in a meaningful way.”).  \nPlaintiffs argue that Anthropic purposefully directed or expressly aimed its conduct at  \nTennessee because it : (1) conducts business through Tennessee -based employees, (2) maintains \ncontractual relationships with Tennessee businesses, (3) reaches Tennessee users through its \nhighly interactive website, and (4) infringes Plaintiffs ’ copyrighted works in Tennessee.  ( See \nDoc. No. 79 at 7–14).  As explained be low, Plaintiffs have failed to make a prima facie showing  \nof purposeful availment  because none of these alleged contacts satisf ies the “expressly aimed” \nprong of the effects test .   \n1. Remote Employees  Working from Tennessee  \nPlaintiffs claim  that Anthropic purposefully availed itself of this District because it \nmaintains three full- time “key” employees in Tennessee.  (Doc. No. 79 at 1, 3–4, 7–8).  Those \nemployees include Thomas Pain e (Anthropic ’s Head of Product and Head of Business \nOperation s), Brian Kustera  (a Recruiter ), and an unidentified R esearch Engineer.  (Doc. No s. 55-\n \n5 The parties  mention the effects test  in their briefs ( see Doc. Nos.  55 at 9–10; 79 at 11) , but they \ndo not acknowledge that this test guides the Court’s analysis.  As such, the parties sometimes \nconflate the “purposeful availment” standard for contract -based claims and the “effects test” \nstandard for intentional tort claims.  To avoid confusion and unfair prejudice , the Court will \nliberally construe the parties’ arguments as though made within the appropriate  framework . \nCase 3:23-cv-01092     Document 123     Filed 06/24/24     Page 8 of 24 PageID #: <pageID>9 1 ¶ 7; 80-7; 80-13).  In response, Anthropic submitted a declaration from its co- founder and \nChief Science Officer, Jared Kaplan, stating that out of Anthropic’s  “261 em ployees, only [these] \nthree live in Tennessee, working their California -based jobs remotely with California -based \nteams. ”  (Doc. No. 55 at 3–4 ( citing Doc. No. 55- 1 ¶ 7); Doc. No. 89 at 1– 2).  Anthropic further \nrepresents that these three employees  “have no responsibility for the training, development, or \nsales and marketing of Claude or the model ’s decision -making,”  and they voluntarily work from \ntheir homes rather than “an office paid for or established by Anthropic.”   (See Doc. No s. 55 at 4; \n89 at 1–2).   \nNeither party has cited, and the Court is not aware of, any Supreme Court or Sixth Circuit \ndecision addressing “ the question of personal jurisdiction over a nonresident employer of a fully-\nremote employee. ”  See Carpenter v. S. Airways E xpress , 2021 WL 5937749, at *5 (S.D. Ohio \nDec. 16, 2021).  “ [A]s remote work has become more common, recent [district court] decisions \nhave looked for additional conduct from employers beyond the mere hiring of a remote \nemployee to establish they expressly aimed their activities at the forum.”   See Wiseman v. Ravyn \nGrp., Inc., 2023 WL 8472806, at *3 n.6 (Dec. 7, 2023) (citations omitted).  To this end, the Court \nfinds instructive the multi- factor approach adopted by several sister courts , in which the Court \nconsiders “whether (1) the defendant solicited the employment of the plaintiff in the forum state; \n(2) the plaintiff worked predominantly from within the forum state; (3) the plaintiff was a high -\nlevel employee in the defendant ’s business ; (4) the plaintiff  signed the employment contract in \nthe forum state; (5) the defendant had knowledge of, and ‘facilitated, ’ the plaintiff ’s remote \nemployment; and (6) the work the plaintiff performed in the forum state advanced the \ndefendant ’s busines s interests in the forum state. ”  Hall v. Rag -O-Rama, LLC , 359 F. Supp. 3d \n499, 511 (E.D. Ky. 2019)  (collecting cases) .  While these nonexhaustive factors  focus on \nCase 3:23-cv-01092     Document 123     Filed 06/24/24     Page 9 of 24 PageID #: <pageID>10 circumstances involving the plaintiff  (rather than the defendant’s nonparty  employees , as is the \ncase here),  the Court nevertheless finds them helpful to determine w hether Anthropic  \npurposefully availed itself of Tennessee through its remote employees.  \nAnalyzing similar  considerations  here, the Court concludes that  Plaintiffs have not met \ntheir burden to show Anthropic  expressly aimed its activities at Tennessee by allowing three \nemployees to work remotely from their Tennessee homes .  To be sure, the Court may reasonably \ninfer that these thre e employees “worked predominantly from within” Tennessee, and that \nAnthropic “ had knowledge of ” their remote employment.  See id. at 511.  But, unlike in other \ncases finding purposeful availment, t here are no allegations that Anthropic affirmatively \nrecrui ted these allegedly “key” employees  to work in Tennessee, requested or required them to \nwork in Tennessee  after hiring them , came to Tennessee to meet with them, or e xpressly tasked \nthem with establishing or extending Anthropic ’s business in Tennessee.  See  Carpenter , 2021 WL \n5937749, at *6; see also  Senne v. Kan. City Royals Baseball Corp., 105 F. Supp. 3d 981, 1023 \n(N.D. Cal. 2015) .  Moreover, there are no allegations regarding where  these employees signed \ntheir employment agreements.  Anthropic merely permitted these employees to work  from home , \nand “[a]n agent ’s decision to work from home in the forum state generally does not bind an \nentity to personal jurisdiction in that state whe re the purpose of the arrangement is merely for the \nagent ’s personal convenience. ”  See Lucachick v. NDS Americas, Inc. , 169 F. Supp. 2d 1103, \n1107 (D. Minn. 2001).  \nPlaintiffs similarly lack support for their contention that Anthropic used Paine and \nKustera ’s physical location to attract employees and advance Anthropic’s  business in Tennessee.  \n(Doc. No. 79 at 7) .  For example, P laintiffs include as an exhibit one of Paine’ s social media \nposts , in which he  states that “Anthropic is hiring”  and encourages interested individuals to  \nCase 3:23-cv-01092     Document 123     Filed 06/24/24     Page 10 of 24 PageID #:\n<pageID>11 “apply directly”  on Anthropic ’s website.  (Doc. No. 80- 12).  Plaintiffs  also cite to several social \nmedia posts on LinkedIn and the X platform where Paine discusses Claude and its features, \nincluding a post stating he is “ [e]xcited and proud to share what the team @AnthropicAI has \nbeen working on.”   (See Doc. No. 79 at 3–4; see also  Doc. Nos. 80-8; 80- 9; 80- 10; 80- 11).  And \nPlaintiffs cite to a LinkedIn post by an individual (whose location is unknown)  asking whether \n“anyone in my  network [is] able to help me contact folks at Anthropic so I can get API access to \nClaude ,” to which Paine responds : “Invite sent! ”  (Doc. No. 80- 11 at 2).   \nThe Court infers that Paine , as the “Interim Head of Product and Head of Business \nOperations,”  made these social media posts in his capacity as a high- level employee .  But the \nCourt does not find Plaintiffs met their burden to show purposeful availment  merely  because one \nhigh- level Anthropic employee happens to work remotely from Tennessee .  Critically, none of \nPaine’s social media posts  mention Tennessee , and there is nothi ng to suggest that Paine’ s \nmessages were expressly aimed at Tennessee residents.  ( See id.).  Even if some of Paine’s social \nmedia connections were in Tennessee and saw these posts, that still would not be enough to \nconstitute purposeful availment  under Sixth Circuit law .  See Blessing v. Chandrasekhar , 988 \nF.3d 889, 905 (6th Cir. 2021) (holding that defendant ’s “tweets ‘did not create sufficient contacts ’ \nwith Kentucky ‘simply because ’ the plaintiffs have Kentucky connections ”).  Thus, the Court \ncannot conclude, consistent with due process, that Anthropic expressly aimed its con duct at  \nTennessee merely because a remote (albeit, high- level) employee talked about Claude on social \nmedia and sent an “[i]nvite ” in response to a general inquiry on LinkedIn.   \n2. Contracts  with Tennessee Businesses  \nNext, Plaintiffs assert that  Anthropic expressly aimed its conduct at  Tennessee because it \nhas at least three long- term agreements to provide and license its AI services to Tennessee \nCase 3:23-cv-01092     Document 123     Filed 06/24/24     Page 11 of 24 PageID #:\n<pageID>12 businesses.  (Doc. No. 79 at 1, 4–5, 8).  Plaintiffs ’ primary support for this argument is the Sixth \nCircuit’ s 1998 decision in Cole v. Mileti, 133 F.3d 433 (6th Cir. 1998), which involved an appeal \nfrom a Northern District of Ohio order denying defendant ’s motion to dismiss for lack of \npersonal jurisdiction.  The defendant in Cole  was a former Ohio resident and longtime business \npartner of the O hio plaintiff, and the parties negotiated a surety agreement by means of repeated \nmail and wire communications.  Id.  at 435.  The final contract was also executed in Ohio.  Id.   In \naffirming the district court’ s judgment, the divided Cole  panel held that i f “a nonresident \ndefendant transacts business by negotiating and executing a contract via telephone calls and \nletters to an Ohio resident, then the defendant has purposefully availed himself of the forum by creating a continuing obligation in Ohio.”   Id. at 436.  In other words, Ohio could exercise \npersonal jurisdiction over the nonresident defendant because the parties ’ business relationship \narose directly out of the defendant ’s contacts with Ohio.  Id.; see also  Kobill Airways Ltd. v. \nNat’l Flight Servs., Inc., 92 F. Supp. 2d 689, 693 (N.D. Ohio 2000).   \nPlaintiffs ’ reliance on Cole  is misplaced for several reasons.  To begin with, this is a \ncopyright infringement case, not a breach of contract case.  Moreover,  “courts analyzing personal \njurisdiction in th e context of a contractual relationship have often distinguished Cole , or \ncautioned that its holding should not be read outside of the factual context in which it was \nwritten. ”  See McMunigal v. Bloch, 2010 WL 2106186, at *9 (N.D. Ohio May 25, 2010) \n(colle cting cases) ; see also  Baker v. Bensalz Prods., Inc., 480 F. Supp. 3d 792, 804 (S.D. Ohio \n2020)  (noting that “ the Sixth Circuit has walked back any such broad reading of Cole ”).  These \ncourts repeatedly highlight that Cole  was a breach of contract action arising out of the parties ’ \nextensive ongoing business relationship in Ohio, and it was that unique pre-existing  business \nrelationship that  permitted Ohio to exercise personal jurisdiction over the defendant.  See, e.g., \nCase 3:23-cv-01092     Document 123     Filed 06/24/24     Page 12 of 24 PageID #:\n<pageID>13 id.; Condon v. Flying Puck, LLC , 35 F. App’ x 173, 174 (6th Cir. 2002); Shaker Const. Grp., LLC \nv. Schilling , 2008 WL 4346777, at *6 (S.D. Ohio Sept. 18, 2008); Matrix Essentials, Inc. v. \nHarmon Stores, Inc., 205 F. Supp. 2d 779, 789 (N.D. Ohio 2001) .  Here, u nlike with the  \ndefendant in Cole , there  is no indication that Anthropic previously resided in Tennessee or had \nany sort of pre -existing business relationships with any Tennessee businesses that now license \nClaude.   \nThe Court is more persuaded by the re asoning in Calphalon Corp. v. Rowlette , 228 F.3d \n718 (6th Cir. 2000) , which “ held that the mere fact that a defendant has a contract with a resident \nof the forum state is insufficient in itself to demonstrate purposeful availment. ”  Oaks v. Largo \nBioscience, Inc. , 2022 WL 765506, at *7 (M.D. Tenn. Mar. 11, 2022) (citing Calphalon, 228 F.3d \nat 722–23) ; see also  Baker , 480 F. Supp. 3d at 804 (holding that it is “well settled that the mere \nexistence of a contract with a citizen of a foreign state is not enough to show purposeful \navailment ”).  In Calphalon , the nonresident defendant agreed to be  the Ohio plaintiff ’s \nmanufacturer representative in Minnesota, Iowa, South Dakota, North Dakota, and Nebraska .  \nCalphalon, 228 F.3d at 723.  The Sixth Circuit found that the parties ’ contractual relationship was \ninsufficient to confer personal jurisdiction in Ohio because the  defendant ’s contacts with Ohio \nexisted solely because the plaintiff  happened to be headquartered there, “ not because [the \ndefendant] sought to further its business and create ‘ continuous and substantial ’ consequences ” \nin Ohio.  Id.   Because the defendant arguably “ would have served as [plaintiff ’s] representative \nin the designated states, regardless of [plaintiff ’s] base of operation”  in Ohio, the defendant ’s \n“contacts were precisely the type of random, fortuitous, and attenuated contacts that the \npurposeful availment requirement is meant to prevent from causing jurisdiction.”   Id. (internal \nquotation marks om itted).  \nCase 3:23-cv-01092     Document 123     Filed 06/24/24     Page 13 of 24 PageID #:\n<pageID>14 Calphalon and other cases post-dating Cole  make clear  that “there is no per se rule that a \ncontractual relationship with an in -state citizen, coupled with interstate communications related \nto that contract, automatically suffice [s] to render an out -of-state defendant subject to personal \njurisdiction where the plaintiff resides. ”  Baker , 480 F. Supp. 3d at 804 (citing McMunigal , 2010 \nWL 2106186, at *9.  Instead, “a court must undertake a holistic analysis of the totality of the \ncircu mstances surrounding the prior negotiations and contemplated future consequences, the \nterms of the contract, and the parties ’ actual course of dealing [.]”  Id. (citing Nationwide Mut. \nIns. Co. v. Tryg Intern. Ins. Co., Ltd., 91 F.3d 790, 795 (6th Cir. 1996) ).  Rather than offering \nevidence for each of these considerations, Plaintiffs rely solely on their allegation that Anthropic \ncontracted with three  Tennessee business es to license the Claude API, and that Anthropic \nmentioned in a  public  online press statement that one of those businesses was an Anthropic \ncustomer.  (Doc. No. 79 at 4–5; Doc. No. 80- 19 at 4).  But there is nothing to suggest that \nAnthropic provided Claude API access to these Tennessee businesses because  they were in \nTennessee.  Indeed, as Plaintiffs recognize in their opposition, Anthropic “ accept[s] applications ” \nfrom any business that  wants to incorporate Claude in their products regardless of where those \nbusinesses  are located  in the United States .  (Doc. No. 79 at 4 (citing Doc. No. 80- 14)).  That \nAnthropic has contracts with some  businesses  located in Tennessee is a “ fortuitous ” contact that \ndoes not give rise to purposeful availment  under these circumstances .  Baker , 480 F. Supp. 3d at \n804 (internal quotation marks omitted) (citing Calphalon, 228 F.3d at 722) .   \nAccordingly, the Court finds that Anthropic did not expressly aim its conduct at \nTennessee or purposefully avail itself of the privilege of acting in Tennessee merely by having \ncontracts with three Tennessee companies.  \nCase 3:23-cv-01092     Document 123     Filed 06/24/24     Page 14 of 24 PageID #:\n<pageID>15 3. Anthropic ’s Website  \nPlaintiffs next a rgue that Anthropic purposefully availed itself of Tennessee because it \noffers its Claude AI models to Tennessee users through its “ highly interactive ” website.  (Doc. \nNo. 79 at 1).  A website operator  “purposefully avails itself of the privilege of acting in a state \nthrough its website if the website is interactive to a degree that reveals specifically intended \ninteraction  with residents of the state. ”  Neogen Corp. v. Neo Gen Screening, Inc., 282 F.3d 883, \n887 (6th Cir. 2002)  (emphases added) ; Bird, 289 F .3d at 874.  However, courts in this Circuit \nhave routinely held that “the mere maintenance of an interactive, commercial website, accessible \nfrom anywhere, without more, cannot constitute purposeful  availment. ”  Cap . Confirmation, Inc. \nv. Auditconfirmations, LLC , 2009 WL 2823613, at *7  (M.D. Tenn. Aug. 28, 2009)  (collecting \ncases); see also  Impulsaria, LLC v. United Distrib. Grp., LLC , 2012 WL 4341058, at *3 (W.D. \nMich. Sept. 20, 2012) .  \n“[T]o determine whether an operator of a website purposefully availed [itself] of the \nforum state, the Court looks at the website ’s level of  interactivity. ”  See, Inc. v. Imago Eyewear \nPty, Ltd., 167 F. App’ x 518, 522 (6th Cir. 2006) (citation omitted).  The Court evaluates  a \nwebsite ’s level of interactivity based on a “sliding scale ” (often referred to as the Zippo  sliding \nscale),  which ranges from purely passive sites that only offer information for the user to access, \nin which case jurisdiction is not proper, to highly interactive sites where a defendant clearly \ntransacts business or forms contracts with users, in which case jurisdiction is proper .  Id. at 522 \n(citing Zippo Mfg. Co. v. Zippo Dot Com, Inc., 952 F. Supp. 1119, 1124 (W.D. Pa. 1997)); One \nMedia IP Ltd. v . S.A.A.R. SrL , 122 F. Supp. 3d 705, 717–18 (M.D. Tenn. 2015).  In the middle \nof these extremes are “ hybrid or interactive sites that allow users to ‘exchange information with \nthe host computer.’”   Imago Eyewear , 167 F. App’ x at 522 (quoting Zippo, 952 F. Supp. at \nCase 3:23-cv-01092     Document 123     Filed 06/24/24     Page 15 of 24 PageID #:\n<pageID>16 1124)).  “ In these cases, the exercise of jurisdiction is determined by examining the level  of \ninteractivity and the commercial nature of the exchange of information that occurs on the \n[website]. ”  Zippo, 952 F. Supp. at 1124. \nBased on the current record, the  Court finds that Anthropic ’s website is neither  “passive ” \nnor “highly interactive ” under the Zippo sliding scale.   It is not “ passive ” because users interact \nwith Claude directly to ask it questions and receive AI -generated replies.   (Doc. No. 55 at 4; Doc. \nNo. 1 ¶¶ 18, 52, 65, 96, 123).  And although the Claude AI models on the website “ engage in \nsophisticated, human- like conversations with Tennessee users, ” (see Doc. No. 79 at 1), the \nwebsite does not appear to be  highly interactive or transaction -oriented because there is no \nallegation that Tennessee residents  could download and enter into contracts  on the site .  Pride \nDistribs., Inc. v. Nuzzolo, 2007 WL 1098286, at *3 (E.D. Mich. Apr. 10, 2007); see also  Lift \nHolding Co., Inc. v. Prendiville , 768 F. Supp. 2d 929, 934 (E.D. Mich. 2011) (citing \nCompuServe , 89 F.3d at  1264) .  Because Anthropic ’s website  likely  falls somewhere in the \nmiddle , the Court “ must engage in a fact -specific inquiry to determine whether [the] website ’s \ninteractive features support a conclusion that [ Anthropic]  intended contact with [Tennessee] \nresidents.”   Noco Co. v. Jasper Indus. Supply, Inc., 2023 WL 8600503, at *5 (N.D. Ohio Dec. 12, \n2023); see also  Zippo, 952 F. Supp. at 1124.   \nPlaintiffs do not dispute that the computers and data used to train Claude , Claude’s source \ncode, and Claude’s host servers  are located outside of Tennessee.  ( See Doc. No. 55- 1 ¶ 22).  Nor \ndo they dispute that Anthropic ’s website is maintained  solely  by employees in California.  ( See \nid. ¶ 23).  Plaintiffs  instead  highlight  two “interactive ” features of A nthropic ’s website that \nallegedly reveal  specifically intended contact with Tennessee residents.  ( See Doc. No. 79 at 9).  \nFirst, the website invites Tennessee users to “ Talk to Claude ” through a chatbox interface on the \nCase 3:23-cv-01092     Document 123     Filed 06/24/24     Page 16 of 24 PageID #:\n<pageID>17 website itself, and “ Claude”  can ou tput information specific to Tennessee.  ( Id.; see also  Doc. \nNo. 1 ¶ 18; Doc . No. 80- 6).  Second, users who access  Claude on Anthropic ’s website must  first \ncomplete a “ multistep process, ” which requires them  to provide an email address, input a \nverification code, confirm their name and age, accept the website’ s Terms of Service, and \nprovide a cell phone number .  (Doc. No . 79 at 9–10).  Viewing these facts in the light most \nfavorable to Plaintiffs, the Court c annot conclude that Anthropic, through its website, \npurposefully availed itself of the privilege of doing business in Tennessee.  \nAlthough Anthropic ’s website is available in Tennessee and Claude can output content \nrelated to Tennessee (if the user specifically requests it), that alone does not amount to \npurposeful availment .  To “support a finding of jurisdiction,”  Plaintiffs “must also show that the \nwebsite interactivity actually generated business with residents of the forum state. ”  Silent \nEvents, Inc. v . Quiet Events, Inc., 2016 WL 4466657, at *3 (M.D. Tenn. Aug. 24, 2016).  Indeed, \ndistrict courts in this Circuit have emphasized that  “the most important factor for purposeful \navailment is whether forum residents actually ordered products from the defenda nt, and whether \nthe defendant actually sold products to forum residents through its website.”   See Noco , 2023 \nWL 8600503, at *4 (citing Zoya Co. v. Julep Nail Parlor Co., 2011 WL 5975054, at *3 (N.D. \nOhio Nov. 29, 2011)); Stewart v. M & M Headgear, Inc. , 2015 WL 1423560, at *4 (N.D. Ohio \nMar. 27, 2015) ; see also  Mosure v. Southwest Airlines, Co., 2023 WL 6199762, at *6 n.6 (N.D. \nOhio Sept. 22, 2023) ( “Under Sixth Circuit law, even a highly interactive website must target \nresidents of that s tate to confer specific jurisdiction. ”).  Notably absent from Plaintiffs ’ \nopposition, however, is a ny evidence that Anthropic made any sales through its website to \nCase 3:23-cv-01092     Document 123     Filed 06/24/24     Page 17 of 24 PageID #:\n<pageID>20 that “when potential customers from Michigan have contacted NGS to purchase  its services, \nNGS has welcomed their individual business on a regular basis ” and “reasonably expects to \nconduct a given level of business in Michigan year after year.”   Id. (emphasis add ed).   \nHere, even if the Court accepts that Anthropic provided API access to three businesses \nthat just happen to be in Tennessee, s ee Section II.A.2 supra , there is no allegation  that Tennessee \nresidents used Anthropic ’s website to purchase  services on a regular  basis or that Anthropi c \nreasonably expects a given level of business in Tennessee.   Ultimately, “when district courts in \nthis Circuit have exercised personal jurisdiction in [the Internet] context, they have done so \nbecause, in additi on to a generally accessible website, the plaintiff showed that the defendant \nmade other, purposeful and significant contacts with the forum.”   Cap . Confirmation , 2009 WL \n2823613, at *8 (citations omitted).   Because Anthropic did not take an additional ste p of \ntargeting Tennessee residents for the oppor tunity to do business  there, the Court concludes that \nAnthropic ’s website is insufficient to establish purposeful availment in accordance with due \nprocess.    \n4. Allegedly Infringing Outputs in Tennessee  \nPlaintiffs ’ final argument is that Anthropic purposefully availed itself of Tennessee “ by \nunlawfully reproducing, distributing, and displaying infringing copies of [their] works to users in \nTennessee. ”  (Doc. No. 79 at 12).  This is simply another way of s aying users can access \nAnthropic’s Claude AI models while in Tennessee.   For the same reasons mentioned above  in \nthe context of Anthropic’s website , the Court does not find that Anthropic  purposefully availed \nitself  of Tennessee merely  because users can access Claude in Tennessee and Claude can output \ncontent related to Tennessee upon request .  \nCase 3:23-cv-01092     Document 123     Filed 06/24/24     Page 20 of 24 PageID #:\n<pageID>21 B. Cause of Action Arising Out of In -State Activities  and Reasonableness  \nGiven that Plaintiffs failed to make a prima facie showing of purposeful availment , the \nCourt concludes that exercising personal jurisdiction over Anthropic would offend due process  \nregardless of whether Plaintiffs satisfy the second and third prongs of the Mohasco  test.  See  \nLAK Inc., 885 F.2d at 1303.  As such, the Court need not analyze whether Plaintiffs ’ causes of \naction “arise from ” Anthropic ’s in-state activities , or whether exercising personal jurisdiction \nover Anthropic would be fair and reasonable.  See Oaks , 2022 WL 765506, at *8 (citations \nomitted) ( “Because purposeful availment is ‘ the sine qua non of in personam  jurisdiction, ’ the \ncourt will grant the defendant ’s motion without reaching the other factors relevant to the exercise \nof personal jurisdiction” ); see also  Devnani , 2017 WL 4692273, at *12 (c ollecting cases).   \nIII. MOTION TO DISMISS FOR IMPROPER VENUE  OR, IN THE ALTERNATIVE, \nTO TRANSFER \nWhere, as here, the Court determines that it lacks personal jurisdiction over the \ndefendant, the Court must either dismiss the action without prejudice  or transfer  it to a court that \nhas personal jurisdiction.  See Stanifer v. Brannan, 564 F.3d 455, 456–57 (6th Cir. 2009) .  \nBecause this  analysis remains the same  regardless of whether venue is proper , the Court will \ndeny as moot Anthropic ’s alternative  request  to dismiss  this case under Rule 12(b)(3) for \nimproper venue .  See Richardson v. Cnty . of Wayne , 2009 WL 2777671, at *6 (E.D. Mich. Aug. \n27, 2009) ( “Because the Cour t has determined that it lacks personal jurisdiction over [the] \nDefendants, the motion to dismiss or transfer because of improper venue is moot.” ).  \nThere are  three federal statutes that provide the Court with authority to transfer a case to \nanother district : 28 U.S.C.  §§ 1404(a) , 1406(a),  and 1631.   See  In re RealPage,  Inc., Rental  \nSoftware  Antitrust Litig. , 2024 WL 993302,  at *4 (M.D.  Tenn. Mar. 7, 2024).  The parties ’ briefs  \nfocus  exclusively  on whether  the Court  should transfer  this case under  § 1404(a), with Anthropic  \nCase 3:23-cv-01092     Document 123     Filed 06/24/24     Page 21 of 24 PageID #:\n<pageID>22 inviting  a transfer  and Plaintiffs  resisting.   (See Doc. No. 55 at 14 –24; Doc. No. 79 at 17–25).  \nThe problem with these arguments is that § 1404 (a) does not apply here because  the Court  does \nnot have  personal  jurisdiction  over Anthropic.   See  Pittock  v. Otis Elevator  Co., 8 F.3d 325, 329 \n(6th Cir. 1993)  (“[A] transf er under  section  1404(a ) may not be granted  when  the district court  \ndoes not have personal  jurisdiction  over the defendants.” ).  And although  the parties  have not \nindicated  a preference for transfer  or dismissal  in the event  the Court  found it lacked  personal  \njurisdiction  over Anthropic , the Court  may infer  that Plaintiffs  would prefer  a transfer  rather  than \ndismissal  under  these circumstances.     \nAlthough neither  party  mentions  §§ 1406(a)  or 1631 in their briefs,  the Court  has the \npower  to transfer  this action  sua sponte  under  either  provision.  See Woodward v. Dignity  Health  \nRehabilitation  Hosp., 2021 WL  3860554, at *3 (N.D.  Ohio  Aug. 30, 2021).  Section  1406(a)  may \napply here because  it allows  the Court  to transfer  an action  filed in the wrong venue.   But \nbecause this Court  does not have  personal  jurisdiction  over Anthropic , and because the Court  did \nnot separately  consider  whether  venue  is proper, the most  appropriate  vehicle for transf er is \n§ 1631.  Section  1631 provides  that if the Court lacks jurisdiction in a civil action, it “ shall , if it \nis in the interest of justice, transfer such action . . . to any other such court in which the action . . . \ncould have been brought at the time it  was filed or noticed.”   28 U.S.C. § 1631 (emphasis added).  \nThus, the Court must determine whether this action “ could have been brought ” in another forum , \nand whether transfer is “ in the interest of justice. ”  Id. \nFirst, the Court agrees with Anthropic  that this action  “could have been brought ” in the \nNorthern District of California .  “[A]n action might have been brought in another forum if, at the \ntime the action was originally filed, the transferee court would have had subject matter \njurisdic tion and personal jurisdiction over the defendants, and if venue would have been proper \nCase 3:23-cv-01092     Document 123     Filed 06/24/24     Page 22 of 24 PageID #:\n<pageID>23 in the transferee court. ”  E.g., Posven, C.A. v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., No. 02 Civ. 0623(PKL), \n2004 WL 63497, at *7 (S.D.N.Y . Jan. 12, 2004).  There is no dispute that t he Northern District of \nCalifornia would have federal -question subject matter jurisdiction  over Plaintiffs ’ copyright \nclaims , see 28 U.S.C. § 1331, a nd both personal jurisdiction and venue would be proper because \nAnthropic ’s principal place of business is in San Francisco , see 28 U.S.C. §§ 1391(b), 1400(a).  \nThus, the “ could have been brought ” requirement for transfer is easily satisfied here.  \nSecond, the Court has “broad discretion”  to determine whether transfer to another district \nis in the interest of justice.  See  Stanifer , 564 F.3d at  456–57.  Given Plaintiffs ’ pending and fully \nbriefed Motion for Preliminary Injunction (Doc. No. 40), and the time -sensitive nature of the \nrequest  (see Doc. No. 119 at 2), the Courts find that it is in the interests of justice to transfer the \ncase to a court where jurisdiction and venue are not disputed. \nLast, the Court acknowledges that Plaintiffs  seek “expedited disposition”  of their Motion \nfor a Preliminary Injunction, and that transferring this case will create additional unanticipated \ndelays.  As a recent cas e from this district explained:  \nThe Court is aware of the lapse of time between the filing of the motion for a \nTRO and the filing of this memorandum opinion and order, and it understands \nthat this is far from ideal.  But the lapse was occasioned by the need for the Court \nto consider, and ultimately resolve conclusively—and explain thoroughly its view \nregarding—the crucial challenge to the existence of personal jurisdiction in this \nCourt.  The best way for a plaintiff to avoid a delay in the consideration of a \nmotion for TRO pending resolution of a serious challenge to personal jurisdiction \nis to play it safe by filing in a forum that clearly has personal jurisdiction.  That is \nto say, there can be natural tradeoff for a plaintiff between filing in its preferred \njurisdiction and filing in a jurisdiction that is not preferred but which will not \nfoster a colorable personal -jurisdiction challenge.   Here, even if one reasonably \ncould disagree with the Court ’s conclusion that it lacks personal jurisdiction over \nDefendant, one could not reasonably dispute that Defendant could make a very \ncolorable personal jurisdiction challenge  in this Court.  Plaintiff made a choice to \nfile in the jurisdiction that it preferred, not the jurisdiction that was safer from a \npersonal -jurisdiction standpoint.  That is not [to] say that this was a bad choice, \nCase 3:23-cv-01092     Document 123     Filed 06/24/24     Page 23 of 24 PageID #:\n<pageID>24 but it is to say that it was a choice tha t imperiled the promptness of the ruling on \nthe motion for TRO. \nNcontracts , 2022 WL 17724148, at *10 n.16.  Here, too, Plaintiffs made a strategic decision to \nsue a California -based company  in the Middle District of Tennessee, and in doing so ran the risk \nof encountering a jurisdictional hurdle  too high to climb.  Once that hurdle is pushed to the side \nand this case is  transferred to the Northern District of California, Plaintiffs will be fr ee to run  \ntheir case to the finish line on the merits.   \nIV. CONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, Anthropic ’s Motion to Dismiss for Lack of Personal \nJurisdiction and Improper Venue or, in the Alternative, to Transfer Venue (Doc. No. 54)  will be \ngranted in par t and denied in part , and this case will be transferred to the United States District \nCourt for the Northern District of California.  \nAn appropriate order will enter.  \n \n____________________________________ \nWA VERLY D.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**:\n   In the case of La Canada Ventures, Inc. v. MDalgorithms, Inc., the plaintiff claims trademark infringement and false advertising against the defendant, focusing on the use of the \"MDacne\" mark. The court granted partial summary judgment in favor of MDalgorithms, finding insufficient evidence of consumer confusion and false advertising. Although the case involved the use of AI technology by MDalgorithms to customize skincare products, the court noted that this did not contribute to confusion between the products. Additionally, the expert report offered by the plaintiff was excluded due to the lack of reliable methodology.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: \n   The key legal issues were whether MDalgorithms' use of the \"MDacne\" mark infringed on La Canada Ventures' trademarks by causing consumer confusion, and whether MDalgorithms engaged in false advertising under federal and California law.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**:\n   The court held in favor of MDalgorithms, granting partial summary judgment on counts of trademark infringement and false advertising. The court found no material factual dispute regarding the likelihood of consumer confusion or the inaccuracy of MDalgorithms' advertising claims. Consequently, the trademark cancellation claim tied to \"MDacne\" failed as well.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**:\n   Imagine two companies: one sells beauty products, and the other offers a service that uses computers to make custom acne treatments. They both have products with \"MD\" in the name, and the beauty company thinks customers might mix them up. The court looked at the similarities and decided that customers probably wouldn't be confused since there wasn't much evidence showing they were. Also, the beauty company's expert's report was dismissed because he didn’t explain how he got his results properly. So, the acne-company didn't do anything wrong in the court's view, and they won this part of the lawsuit.",

INTRODUCTION  \nPlaintiff La Canada  Ventures, Inc., is a health and beauty retailer offering cosmetic products . \nDefendant MDalgorithms is a company that offers computer software and app technology  for \neducation and advice about the treatment of acne . Both parties create  and market skin and haircare \nproducts with the root mark “MD.” Plaintiff brought this action against Defendant , advanc ing \nseveral claims related to trademark infringement and false advertising in the operative Second \nAmended Complaint (“SAC”) . Defendant now moves for partial summary judgment on several of \nPlaintiff’s claims, specifically,  Counts I (federal trademark infringement  under the Lanham Act ) \nand II (unfair competition)  as to Defendant’s  “MDacne” mark , as well as Counts V and VI (false \nadvertising in violation of federal and California law). Defendant  also moves  to strike and exclude \nthe report  and associated testimony of  Plaintiff ’s expert, Richard Kostick , pursuant to Federal Rule \nof Ev idence 702 and Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc. , 509 U.S. 579 (1993). For the \nreasons  discussed  below,  Defendant’s  motion for partial summary judgment and its Daubert  \nmotion are granted . Case 3:22-cv-07197-RS     Document 98     Filed 08/02/24     Page 1 of 17 \nORDER ON DEFENDANT ’S MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT , MOTION TO STRIKE  \nCASE NO.  22-cv-07197 -RS \n2 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  II. BACKGROUND  \nThe factual background of this case has been thoroughly described in previous orders. In \nshort , Plaintiff  owns seven trademarks .1 Defendant creates and sells MDacne and MDhair , which \nare customizable skincare and haircare product  kits. Plaintiff  does not sell a product called \nMDacne but does have an acne skincare product that displays the mark “MD” on the packaging. \nPlaintiff avers that its customers nonetheless confuse  the source of MDalgorithm’s products as \ncoming from Plaintiff. Where a customer confuses the source of the junior user’s product as the \nsenior user, that  is known as “forward confusion.” Other types of confusion actionable under the \nLanham Act include “reverse confusion,” which occurs when consumers approach the senior user, \nmistakenly believi ng they are dealing with the junior user, as well as the newly minted “initial \ninterest confusion,” which occurs when customers  are drawn to one party’s brand during their \nsearch  for its competitor’s products, and the former “capitalizes on the goodwill as sociated with \n[the latter’s] mark.”  Porta -Fab Corp. v. Allied Modular Bldg. Sys ., No. 8:20 -cv-01778 -JLS-JDE, \n2022 WL 4596646 at *3  (C.D. Ca. Jul. 24, 2022) ; see Ironhawk Tech., Inc. v. Dropbox, Inc ., 2 \nF.4th 1150, 11 59-60 (9th Cir. 2021 ).  \nIn its motion, Defendant  argues that Plaintiff has presented no evidence that its “MDacne” \nmark infringes on any of Plaintiff’s trademarks, warranting judgment on Counts I and II in the \nSAC for that mark . If judgment is granted for it on those claims, Defe ndant  further  contends that \nsummary judgment should also be granted as to Count III in the SAC, which seeks to cancel the \ntrademark registration for “MDacne.” Separately, Defendant moves for judgment as to Plaintiff’s \nfalse advertising claims, brought unde r federal and California law , because Plaintiff has produce d \nno evidence that Defendant’s statements about its own products violate Section 43 of the Lanham \nAct or California’s False Advertising Law (“FAL”), California Business & Professions Code § \n17500 et seq. Therefore, Defendant posits, these claims fail as a matter of law.  \n \n1 MD FACTOR (Reg. No. 6,309,386); MD  BY SUSAN F. LIN M.D. (Reg. No. 5,860,508); MD \nWELLNESS BY SUSAN F. LIN  M.D. (Reg.

In his \nreport, Kostick  opines that (1) Plaintiff consistently followed best practice for effectiv e digital \nmarketing and (2) the sales and revenue generated by Plaintiff do not reflect the expected return \nfrom its digital marketing investment . Defendant challenges Kostick’s research methodologies as \ndeficient and self -serving.  \nIII. MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMM ARY JUDGMENT  \nA. Legal Standard  \nA motion for summary judgment may be granted if the pleadings, discovery, and affidavits \nshow “that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to \njudgment as a matter of law.” Fed. R. Civ. Pro . 56(a). A genuine issue of material fact is one that \ncould “affect the outcome of the suit.” Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc ., 477 U.S. 242, 248 (1986). \nEvidence must be viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party and all justifiable \ninferenc es must be drawn in its favor. See Anderson , 477 U.S. at 255. The court need not  scour the \nrecord in search of a genuine issue of triable fact.  Keenan  v. Allan , 91 F.3d 1275, 1279 (9th Cir. \n1996) (citation omitted). The moving party bears the burden of proof to “make a showing \nsufficient to establish…the existence of an element essential to that party’s case.” Celotex Corp. v. \nCatrett , 477 U.S. 317 (1986). If the movant succeeds in demonstrating the absence of a genui ne \nissue of material fact, the burden then shifts to the nonmoving party to “set forth specific facts \nshowing that there is a genuine issue for trial.” Id. at 322 n.3; see also  Fed. R. Civ. Proc. \n56(c)(1)(B). The non -moving party has the burden of identify ing, with reasonable particularity, the \nevidence that precludes summary judgment.  Keenan , 91 F.3d at 1279 . If the nonmoving party fails \nto make this showing, “the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.”  Celotex , 477 \nU.S. at 322.  \nB. Federal  Trademark Infringement , Unfair Competition  – “MDacne”  \n“To prevail on a claim of trademark infringement under the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. § \n1114, a party must prove: (1) that it has a protectible ownership interest in the mark; and (2) that \nthe defendant's u se of the mark is likely to cause consumer confusion.”  Network Automation, Inc. Case 3:22-cv-07197-RS     Document 98     Filed 08/02/24     Page 3 of 17 \nORDER ON DEFENDANT ’S MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT , MOTION TO STRIKE  \nCASE NO.  22-cv-07197 -RS \n4 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  v. Advanced Systems Concepts, Inc ., 638 F.3d 1137 (9th Cir. 2011) (internal citation omitted). \nSummary judgment on the likelihood of confusion is generally disfavored, but it m ay be granted \nin a trademark case where there is no genuine issue of material fact. Surfvivor Media, Inc. v. \nSurvivor Prods. , 406 F.3d 625, 630 (9th Cir. 2005).  In this motion, Defendant does not challenge \nPlaintiff’s ownership interest in the latter’s marks. Instead, it insists that its own use of “MDacne” \nis unlikely to cause customer confusion in the market.2  \nDefendant insists that Plaintiff averred only forward confusion in its SAC, thereby waiving \nall its arguments as to reverse or initia l interest confusion. See Surfvivor Media , 406 F.3d  at 631 \n(declining to determine whether the plaintiff raised a material issue of fact on the forward \nconfusion claim because he failed to reference it in his complaint). However, the Ninth Circuit has \nimposed no str ict pleading requirement to state a claim for trademark infringement under a \nparticular theory of confusion. Marketquest Grp., Inc. v. BIC Corp ., 862 F.3d 927, 932 -33 (9th \nCir. 2017)  (“[W] hen reverse confusion is compatible with the theory of infringement alleged in the \ncomplaint, a plaintiff need not specifically plead it ”). In the SAC, Plaintiff avers:  \nShortly after MDalgorithms began using its MD -based marks for \nproducts  that directly compete with those offered by La Canada, La \nCanada began receiving  complaints about products, e.g., “MD Hair,” \noffered by MDalgorithms.   \nSAC ¶ 25. Plaintiff indicates that customers are confused about the source of Defendant’s products \nand makes no mention of customer confusion as to the source of its own produc ts. Without such \nspecific facts  in the SAC , Plaintiff cannot now raise arguments regarding reverse confusion. \nHowever , because Plaintiff has averred  in the SAC  that Defendant seeks to erode its goodwill in \nthe SAC, Plaintiff’s arguments regarding initial interest confusion  remain actice .  \ni. Likelihood of confusion as to “MDacne”  \n“The sine qua non  of trademark infringement under the Lanham Act is customer \n \n2 While the SAC consists of averments regarding Defendant’s use of both the “MDacne” and \n“MDhair” marks, Defendant only references the “MDacne” mark in the instant motion. It does not \nmove for summary judgment on Counts I and II for the “MDhair” mark, so regardless of the \noutcome of the motion, those claims are live as to Defendant’s “MDhair” mark.  Case 3:22-cv-07197-RS     Document 98     Filed 08/02/24     Page 4 of 17 \nORDER ON DEFENDANT ’S MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT , MOTION TO STRIKE  \nCASE NO.  22-cv-07197 -RS \n5 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  confusion.” Network Automatio n, 638 F.3d at 1149. In AMF Inc. v. Sleekcraft Boats  \n(“Sleekcraft ”), the Ninth Circuit developed a flexible, non -exhaustive eight -factor test to guide the \nanalysis of the likelihood of consumer confusion. 599 F.2d 341 (9th Cir.  1979) . These factors are \n(1) strength of the mark; (2) proximity of the goo ds; (3) similarity of the marks;  (4) evidence of \nactual confusion; (5) marketing channels used; (6) type of goods and the degree of  care likely to \nbe exercised by the purchaser; (7) the defendant’s intent in selecting the mark; and (8)  likelihood \nof expans ion of the product lines.  Sleekcraft , 599 F.2d at 348.  For either party to prevail, it need \nnot satisfy all factors, and summary judgment may be granted “provided that strong showings are \nmade with respect to some of [the factors].” Surfvivor Media, Inc. , 406 F.3d at 631. \n1. Evidence of actual confusion  \nThe absence of evidence of actual confusion “need not create an inference that there is no \nlikelihood of confusion.” E. & J. Gallo Winery v. Gallo Cattle Co. , 967 F.2d 1280, 1292 (9th Cir. \n1992). However, wher e “there is scant evidence of actual confusion in the record[,]” this factor \nfavors a defendant. Surfvivor Media , 406 F.3d at 633.  \nDefendant argues that Plaintiff has failed to present any evidence of actual confusion \nbetween its products and those of Plaintiff, and the “peaceful coexistence” of Defendant’s \nMDacne and Plaintiff’s products in the market establishes no likelihood of con fusion between the \ntwo. See Brookfield  Commc’ns, Inc. v. West Coast Ent. Corp. , 174 F.3d  1036,  1050  (9th Cir. \n1999)  (“We cannot think of more persuasive evidence that there  is no likelihood  of confusion \nbetween these two marks than the fact that they have been  simultaneously used for five years \nwithout causing any  consumers to be confused as to who makes  what ”). In support, Defendant \ncharges Plaintiff with failing to conduct a customer survey with results showing customer \nconfusion between MDacne and Plaintiff’s products, insisting that such a failure should \npresum ptively indicate that the results would be unfavorable for Plaintiff. See Cairns v. Franklin \nMint Co. , 24 F. Supp. 2d 1013, 1041  (C.D. Cal. 1998). The Ninth Circuit has not limited \nlikelihood of confusion evidence to surveys, however, and has provided that  “[t]here are at least \nthree types of proof of likelihood of confusion: (1) survey evidence; (2) evidence of actual \nconfusion; and (3) an argument based on an inference arising from a judicial comparison of the Case 3:22-cv-07197-RS     Document 98     Filed 08/02/24     Page 5 of 17 \nORDER ON DEFENDANT ’S MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT , MOTION TO STRIKE  \nCASE NO.  22-cv-07197 -RS \n6 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  conflicting marks themselves and the context of their use in the marketplace. In a close case \namounting to a tie, doubts are resolved in favor of the senior user .” Dr. Seuss Enterprises, L.P. v. \nPenguin Books, USA, Inc. , 109 F.3d 1394,  1404 n.14 (9th Cir. 1997). Nonetheless, a plaintiff’s \nfailure to offer  any proof indicating actual confusion  despite years of coexistence  tends to show \nthat this factor weighs in favor of the defendant. Here, Plaintiff’s proffered proo f, which is a \nsurvey conducted by  Defendant  showing confusion pertaining to Defendant’s  “MDhair” product, \nhas no relevance. The product at issue in the instant motion is Defendant’s “MDacne” product, \nwhich is intended to treat a distinct cosmetic matter and is marketed towards different customers \n(i.e., customers likely to purchase acne trea tments rather than hair -loss products). For this reason, \nPlaintiff’s contention that the survey yielded results establishing  that the common element “MD” \ncaused some initial interest confusion  is irrelevant . Even accepting the survey’s  application here, \nevidence of this purported  confusion  is exceedingly minimal such that no triable issue of fact is \ncreated, as consumer inquiries for MDhair represented not even 1% of Defendant’s total U.S. \nsales. Further , while Plaintiff asserts that Defendant advertises a nd promotes the two products \ntogether, this does not serve as a basis to extrapolate  the survey results of the “MDhair” product to \n“MDacne.”  Accordingly, this factor weighs in Defendant’s favor.  \n2. Strength of the mark  \nThe strength of a mark is determined in  two ways: first, its conceptual strength, i.e., how \ninherently distinctive it is, and second, its commercial strength, or how recognizable it is in the \nmarket. Conceptual strength classifies a mark along a spectrum of “generally increasing inherent \ndistin ctiveness as generic, descriptive, suggestive, arbitrary, or fanciful .” Network Automation , \n638 F.3d at 1149.  Commercial strength of a mark is based on “actual marketplace recognition.” \nBrookfield , 174 F.3d at 1058 . The more distinct ive a mark, the more it  warrants trademark \nprotection. “A suggestive mark conveys an impression of a good but requires the exercise of some \nimagination and perception to reach a conclusion as to the product ’s nature .” Id. at 1058 n.19. The \nNinth Circuit has held that a suggestive mark is presumptively weak. Id. at 1058.  \nPlaintiff insists that its family of marks, including the “MD” root mark, are presumptively \ndistinct because four of those marks  are incontestable , that is, they have been used in commerce Case 3:22-cv-07197-RS     Document 98     Filed 08/02/24     Page 6 of 17 \nORDER ON DEFENDANT ’S MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT , MOTION TO STRIKE  \nCASE NO.  22-cv-07197 -RS \n7 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  for five consecutive years and are still in such use . 15 U.S.C. § 1115(b). However, “the \nincontestable status of [a plaintiff’s] mark does not require a finding that the mark is strong.” \nEntrepreneur Media, Inc. v. Smith , 279 F.3d 1135, 11 42 n.3 (9th Cir. 2002).  \nPlaintiff next argues that the “MD” mark is suggestive because “ some level of imagination \nor perception is necessary to equate ‘MD’ with doctor of medicine .” In support, Plaintiff invokes \nthe MDhair survey, where participants ident ified Plaintiff as the source of MDhair because the \nproduct says “MD” on the packaging. However, while that evidence might tend to show whether \nparticipants were confused about the source of MDhair, it does not support Plaintiff’s argument \nthat MDhair is a strong mark.  Plaintiff has proffered no evidence to suggest that it would require \nsome imaginative leap to associate “MD” with doctor  (and, in fact, admits the converse in its \nSAC: “ 'MD’ is commonly understood to mean ‘Doctor of Medicine.’” SAC ¶ 22). The crowded \nfield of cosmetic products , including 50 other skincare product lines sporting the MD root mark , \nindicates otherwise .3 Indeed, “[u] se of similar marks by third -party companies in the relevant \nindustry weakens the mark at issue. ” M2 Software, I nc. v. Madacy Ent ., 421 F.3d 1073, 1088 ( 9th \nCir. 2005) . Furthermore, as  already explained in the order denying Plaintiff’s motion for partial \nsummary judgment as to MDhair, the USPTO also recognized the weakness of Plaintiff’s MD -\nformative marks when reje cting Plaintiff’s application to register “MD BEAUTY.” Even if \nPlaintiff were to establish that its marks were suggestive, the Ninth Circuit has held that a \nsuggestive mark is generally considered a weak mark barring some other determinant of the \nmark’s st rength, for example, actual marketplace recognition. Brookfield , 174 F.3d at 1058.  \nTurning, the n, to the commercial strength of Plaintiff’s mark , the analysis here measures \nthe degree of recognition of the market for the relevant consumer.  Plaintiff points to evidence of \n \n3 Plaintiff insists that Defendant’s “crowded field” argument constit utes inadmissible attorney \nargument because what constitutes the relevant “field” is a triable issue of fact and because \nDefendant has purportedly produced no evidence showing the field is crowded with other products \nwith the “MD” mark . Plaintiff has not explained why the relevant field ( skincare and haircare  \nproducts) is appropriately defined for purposes of its claims  of infringement  but not so to measure \nwhether it is crowded . Nonetheless , Defendant has produced evidence of 107 other current \nregistr ations for MD -formative marks and 50 other skincare product lines currently featuring MD -\nformative marks. Exh. M.  Case 3:22-cv-07197-RS     Document 98     Filed 08/02/24     Page 7 of 17 \nORDER ON DEFENDANT ’S MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT , MOTION TO STRIKE  \nCASE NO.  22-cv-07197 -RS \n8 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  its long and continued use of the “MD” mark on a variety of its products. However, that use was \nnon-exclusive, as evidenced by the many products consisting of MD -formative marks in the \nrelevant field. Nor has Plaintiff provi ded evidence of advertising expenditures or other indicators \nto transform its marks into a strong mark. See id. This factor, too, weighs against a likelihood of \nconfusion.  \n3. Similarity of the goods  \nThis factor is neutral. “ Related goods are generally more li kely than unrelated goods to \nconfuse the public as to the producers of the goods .” Brookfield , 174 F.3d at 1055. While the \nparties’ acne products are close in proximity  as both are skincare products intended to treat acne,  \nDefendant argues that its produc t is distinct because it uses artificial intelligence to customize \nformulation . The Ninth Circuit has provided that a court should “apply a sliding scale approach as \nto the weight that relatedness will carry  dependent upon the strength of the trademark hol der’s \nmark .” Here, the mark is relatively weak, so it is possible that consumers may well recognize the \nMD mark as representing a medical doctor, “not because of an association with [Plaintiff’s \nproducts].” Entrepreneur Media, Inc. , 279 F.3d at 1145. Howev er, the similar function of the \nproducts, notwithstanding Defendant’s purported use of AI to customize its formula, renders this \nfactor neutral.  \n4. Defendant’s intent  \n“When the alleged infringer knowingly adopts a mark similar to another's, reviewing \ncourts presume that the defendant can accomplish his purpose: that is, that the public will be \ndeceived. ” Sleekcraft , 599 F.2d at 354. Plaintiff has proffered no evidence in support of the \nargument that Defendant or its principals knew of Plaintiff’s marks when it adopted “MDacne” in \n2017. Plaintiff instead insists  that Defendant knew of Plaintiff’s “MD” mark early as J une 24, \n2021 , when Defendant cited Plaintiff’s “MD” mark in its office action response. However, the \nmark was adopted in 2017, and Plaintiff has proffered no evidence showing that Defendant \nadopted the mark to deceive the public. This factor thus weighs ag ainst a finding of confusion.  \n5. Similarity of the marks  \n“In analyzing the similarity of the marks, the court is to view the marks as a whole, as they Case 3:22-cv-07197-RS     Document 98     Filed 08/02/24     Page 8 of 17 \nORDER ON DEFENDANT ’S MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT , MOTION TO STRIKE  \nCASE NO.  22-cv-07197 -RS \n9 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  appear in the marketplace. ” E. & J. Gallo Winery v. Gallo Cattle Co. , 967 F.2d 1280, 1291 (9th \nCir. 1992). This factor weighs in Plaintiff’s favor as s imilarities in marks “weigh more heavily \nthan differences.” Alpha Indus., Inc. v. Alpha Steel Tube & Shapes, Inc. , 616 F.2d 440, 444 (9th \nCir. 1980). Plaintiff and Defendant’s products utilize the common prefix “ MD” followed by \nanother term. The common use of this “dominant element ” tends to show similarity in the parties’ \nmarks. Id.  \n6. Degree of care exercised by purchasers  \nCustomers of skincare and fragrance products often exercise  a high degree of care and \nprecisio n in their purchase. See Glow Indus. v. Lopez , 252 F.  Supp.  2d 962, 1001 (C.D.  Cal. 2002) . \nPlaintiff’s expert testimony supports this idea by acknowledging that consumers’ decision -making \nin this area tends to be highly involved. The goods here are special ty skincare products intended to \ntreat sensitive skin issues, and consumers are likely to be sophisticated purchasers exercising \nsignificant care in selecting their products. This factor also weighs against a finding of confusion.  \n7. Marketing channels  \n“Conve rgent marketing channels increase the likelihood of confusion.” Nutri/Sys., Inc. v. \nCon-Stan Indus.,  Inc., 809 F.2d 601, 606 (9th Cir. 1987).  The parties sell and market their \nproducts through websites and online platforms, but the Ninth Circuit has cautio ned that, today, “ it \nwould be the rare commercial retailer that did not advertise online, and the shared use of a \nubiquitous marketing channel does not shed much light on the likelihood of consumer confusion .” \nNetwork Automation , 638 F.3d at 1151. Consequently, this factor is neutral.  \n8. Expansion of product lines  \n“[A] ‘strong possibility’ that either party may expand his business to compete with the \nother will weigh in favor of finding that the present use is infringing. ” Sleekcraft , 599 F.2 d at 354. \nFurther, “[w] hen goods are closely related, any expansion is likely to result in direct competition .” \nId. Plaintiff p oints out that Defendant uses “four marks” – two of which are the subject of this \naction – in the MD family and plans on expanding its  business. However, the parties already \ncompete in this area, thus already exist in one another’s “submarket.” Id. This factor is accordingly \nneutral.

Victoria's Secret Stores Brand Management, \nInc., 744 F.3d 595, 599 (9th Cir. 2014) . Section 37 states that “ cancellation may only be sought if \nthere is already an ongoing action that involves a registered mark; it does not indicate that a \ncancellation claim is available as an independent cause of action. ” Id.  \nC. False Advertising under Federal and State law  \nTo state a claim under California’s False Advertising Law (“FAL”) , which prohibits  untrue \nor misleading advertising,  “it is necessary only to show that members of the public are likely to be \ndeceived”  as judged by a “reasonable consumer.”  In re Tobacco II Cases , 46 Cal. 4th 298, 312 \n(2009) (internal quotati on omitted) ; Shaeffer v. Calif ia Farms, LLC, 44 Cal. App. 5th 1125, 1136 \n(2020); Cal. Bus. & Prof.  Code, § 17 500 et seq . A plaintiff advancing a claim for false advertising \nunder  Section 43(a) of the Lanham Act  must show  (1) a false statement of fact by the defendant in \na commercial advertisement about its own or another ’s product;  (2) the statement actually \ndeceived or has the tendency to deceive a substantial segment of its audience;  (3) the deception is \nmaterial, in that it is likely to influence the purchasing decision;  (4) the defendant caused its false \nstatement to enter interstate commerce; and  (5) the plaintiff has been or is likely to be injured as a \nresult of the false statement, either by direct diversion of sales from itself to a defendant or by a \nlessening of the goodwill associated with its products.  Skydive Arizona, Inc. v. Quattrocchi , 673 \nF.3d 1105, 1110 (9th Cir. 2012) (citing 15 U.S.C. § 1125(a)(1)(B)) .  \ni. Misleading or Literally False statements    \n“To demonstrate falsity within the meaning of the Lanham Act, a plaintiff may show that \nthe statement was literally false, either on its face or by necessary implication, or that the Case 3:22-cv-07197-RS     Document 98     Filed 08/02/24     Page 10 of 17 \nORDER ON DEFENDANT ’S MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT , MOTION TO STRIKE  \nCASE NO.  22-cv-07197 -RS \n11 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  statement was literally true but likely to mislead or confuse consumers. ” Kwan Softwarre \nEngineering, Inc. v. Foray Technologies, Inc., 2014 WL 572290  at *3 (N.D. Cal. Feb. 11, 2014) \n(citing to Southland Sod Farms v. Stover Seed Co ., 108 F.3d 1134, 1139 (9th Cir.1997) ). \nSimilarly, u nder California’s FAL, a statement does not have to be literally false to be unlawful if \nit is “likely to mislead the public.” Fitzhenry -Russsell v. Keurig Dr. Pepper Inc. , 345 F. Supp. 3d \n1111, 1115 (N.D. Cal. 2018). Plaintiff bases its false advertisemen t claims on four grounds: first, \nDefendant’s MDacne and MDhair products  are not individually customized; second, Defendant \ndoes not offer “unlimited dermatologist support;” third, Defendant’s products are not FDA \napproved; and fourth, Defendant’s return po licy states its products cannot be returned because they \nare medical products. Plaintiff has offered no evidence in support of the notion that these \nstatements are literally false  or misleading in any regard.   \nFirst, Defendant’s skin and haircare kits are customized based on a customer’s skin and \nhaircare needs . Plaintiff’s insistence that Defendant is falsely advertising its products because the \nindividual  chemical formulations of th e products within th ose customized kits consist of over -the-\ncounter formul ations is unavailing.  Plaintiff has proffered no evidence to support this restricted \nview of the term “customized.”   \nSecond, Plaintiff insists that Defendant falsely advertises its promise of “unlimited \ndermatologist support” because Defendant only has on e dermatologist, who is not allowed to \npractice in the U.S., that can offer support to its customers. This argument also falls short of \nindicating deceit . Defendant provides evidence  that the reference to the plural “dermatologists” \nwas made mistakenly onl y once on its website, and the typo has since been fixed. Elsewhere on \nDefendant’s website it notes that customers may receive “dermatologist support” – a statement \nthat is not literally false  or misleading . The fact that the  dermatologist in question is u nable to \npractice in the U.S. is inapposite – Dr. Harth is licensed to practice in Israel and is a dermatologist.  \nThird, Plaintiff claims that Defendant’s products are not FDA -approved, invoking a slide -\ndeck prepared by Defendant and disseminated to invest ors that was never distributed publicly. \nNotwithstanding that Defendant’s  products contain benzol peroxide, salicylic acid, and sulfur  – Case 3:22-cv-07197-RS     Document 98     Filed 08/02/24     Page 11 of 17ORDER ON DEFENDANT ’S MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT , MOTION TO STRIKE  \nCASE NO.  22-cv-07197 -RS \n12 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  ingredients cleared by the FDA to treat acne – Plaintiff has proffered no evidence disseminated to \nconsumers that indic ate Defendant’s products are FDA approved. Rather, Defendant’s website \nstates clearly that its products consist of “clinically proven and FDA cleared topical anti -acne \ningredients.” This statement is consistent with the formulation s of Defendant’s pro ducts and is \nalso not literally false  or misleading . \nFinally, Plaintiff argues that Defendant refuses to permit customer to return products \nbecause they are “medical products.” However, Defendant’s terms of service actually state  that the \nproducts “cannot  be reused if returned” because they are medical products that another customer  \nmay not reuse. Plaintiff seems to be objecting to Defendant’s use of the term “medical products” \nbecause it is not selling “prescription products, only recommended combinations  of over -the-\ncounter products.” Plaintiff has provided no evidentiary support for the argument that “medical” is \nlimited to a prescribed product . This statement, too, is neither misleading nor  literally false. \nii. Damages\nEven accepting that Plaintiff has averred that one of Defendant’s statements is literally \nfalse  or misleading , it has failed to show that it suffered damage as a result of Defendant’s \npurported false advertising. “I n a suit for  damages under section 43(a) [of the Lanham Act], actual \nevidence of some injury resulting from  the deception is an essential element of the plaintiff’s \ncase.” Harper House, Inc. v. Thomas Nelson, Inc ., 889 F.2d 197, 210 (9th Cir. 1989) . Plaintiff has \nfailed to identify specific damages arising from Defendant’s false statements, arguing instead that \nits damages expert was right in calculating damages for trademark infringement and false \nadvertising identically, because “the tests are identical.” Plaintiff has offered no basis to explain \nwhy damages it suffered as  a result of Defendant’s alleged infringement of Plaintiff’s trademarks \nare identical to those resulting from  Defendant’s alleged false statements. That Plaintiff has the \nsame damage theory as to its trademark infringement and false advertising claims – disgorgement \nof Defendant’s profits – does not necessarily lead to the conclusion that the injury or misconduct \nunder both theories are identical . Damages must be tethered to the alleged misconduct, and a \ntrademark infringement is a distinct violation from f alse advertising . Case 3:22-cv-07197-RS     Document 98     Filed 08/02/24     Page 12 of 17 \nORDER ON DEFENDANT ’S MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT , MOTION TO STRIKE  \nCASE NO.  22-cv-07197 -RS \n13 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  IV. MOTION TO STRIKE EXPERT REPORT AND TESTIMONY  \nA. Legal Standard  \n Federal Rule of Evidence 702 requires that a witness proffered as an expert by a party be \nqualified by “knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education.” Even if a witness  is qualified \nas an expert in a particular field, any scientific, technical, or specialized testimony is admissible \nonly if it (a) “will help the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue,” \n(b) “is based upon sufficient facts  or data,” (c) “is the product of reliable principles and methods,” \nand (d) “the expert has reliably applied the principles and methods to the facts of the case.” Id. \nIrrelevant or unreliable testimony is prohibited under Rule 702. Daubert v. Merrell Dow P harm., \nInc., 509 U.S. 579, 589 (1993). Expert opinion testimony is reliable if such knowledge has a \n“basis in the knowledge and experience of [the relevant] discipline.” Daubert , 509 U.S. at 592. \nUnder Daubert , courts should consider the following factors when evaluating whether an expert ’s \nproposed testimony is reliable: (1) “whether a theory or technique . . . can be (and has been) \ntested,” (2) “whether the theory or technique has been subjected to peer review and publication[,]” \n(3) the known or potentia l error rate of the particular scientific theory or technique, and (4) the \ndegree to which the scientific technique or theory is accepted in a relevant scientific community. \nId. at 593 –94. This list is not exhaustive, however, and the standard is flexible.  Kumho Tire Co. v. \nCarmichael , 526 U.S. 137, 151 (1999). The Daubert  inquiry “applies not only to testimony based \non ‘scientific’ knowledge, but also to testimony based on ‘technical’ and ‘other specialized’ \nknowledge.” Id. at 141.  \nThe court ’s task is not to “decid[e] whether the expert is right or wrong, just whether his \ntestimony has substance such that it would be helpful to a jury.” Alaska Rent -A-Car, Inc. v. Avis \nBudget Grp., Inc. , 738 F.3d 960, 969 –70 (9th Cir. 2013). Courts may not excl ude testimony \nsimply because it is impeachable. Id. at 969. “Vigorous cross -examination, presentation of \ncontrary evidence, and careful instruction on the burden of proof are the traditional and \nappropriate means of attacking shaky but admissible evidence. ” Daubert , 509 U.S. at 596. The \nfocus of the inquiry is thus on the principles and methodology employed, not the conclusions Case 3:22-cv-07197-RS     Document 98     Filed 08/02/24     Page 13 of 17 \nORDER ON DEFENDANT ’S MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT , MOTION TO STRIKE  \nCASE NO.  22-cv-07197 -RS \n14 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  reached by the expert. See id.  at 595. Ultimately, the purpose of the assessment is to exclude \nspeculative or unreliable testimony to ensure accurate, unbiased decision -making by the trier of \nfact. \nThere are several reasons why an expert’s proposed testimony may be excluded, including \nthe expert’s lack of qualification, the inapplicability of the proposed testimony, and the \nunreliability of the proposed testimony. Defendant primarily contends that Ko stick’s report and \nany associated testimony should be excluded because it is unreliable.  \nB. Kostick’s opinion that  Plaintiff engaged in best practices for digital marketing  \nWhether Kostick’s methodology is sound is unknowable because he does not state his \nmethodology with sufficient specificity to satisfy even the very liberal standard under Daubert . \nKostick describes the steps of his analysis in only the most general of terms. For example, he \nstates in only four lines of text that he conducted a “website aud it” using three tools: Google \nSearch Console, Google Optimize, and GTMetrix. Left unstated is what Kostick actually did with \nthese tools. Further, while Kostick states that the audit provided “valuable insights” and “potential \nareas for improvement,” he do es not elaborate as to either. None of the other four analytical steps4 \nenumerated in Kostick’s report provide any greater insight into his actual methods, making it \nimpossible to test his results.  \nPlaintiff argues that Kostick’s methodology is adequately  stated and that cross -\nexamination, not exclusion, is the appropriate way for Defendant to attack his opinions. Although \n“vigorous cross -examination, presentation of contrary evidence, and careful instruction on the \nburden of proof are the traditional and appropriate means of attacking shaky but admissible \nevidence,” Daubert , 509 U.S. at 596, Defendant rightly points out that Kostick’s report is so vague \nas to his methodology that it precludes effective cross -examination. Courts are “ supposed to \nscreen the jury from unreliable nonsense opinions, but not exclude opinions merely because they \n \n4 Kostick’s report states that his analysis included the following steps: (1) Website Audit, (2) \nKeyword Research, (3) Competitive Analysis, (4) Content Analysis, and (5) Link Profile Analysis. \nKostick does not describe any step in more than four lines of text.  Case 3:22-cv-07197-RS     Document 98     Filed 08/02/24     Page 14 of 17 \nORDER ON DEFENDANT ’S MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT , MOTION TO STRIKE  \nCASE NO.  22-cv-07197 -RS \n15 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  are impeachabl e.” Alaska Rent -A-Car, 738 F.3d at 969. Here, however, Defendant cannot impeach \nan unknowable method that was not properly documented.  \nKostick’s methodology  is excludable for another reason: he did not record his work. If the \nvagueness of Kostick’s report could be cured by complete contemporaneous notes and \ndocumentation, it might be admissible on the grounds that Defendant could use that \ndocumentation effectively to cross -examine him. However, for at least several key steps in \nKostick’s analysis, no such documentation exists. Kostick’s report simply states that he used \nGTMetrix to conduct his website audit. When asked at his deposition if he took any notes du ring \nthat process, Kostick replied that he could not recall and that he provided Plaintiff with any notes \nhe did write, but Plaintiff has not produced any notes regarding GTMetrix. Similarly, Kostick’s \nreport states that he used Ubbersuggest to conduct key word research, but he does not recall \nwhether he preserved any results or data from his use of that program and no such documents have \nbeen produced by Plaintiff. Basic documentation of an expert’s analytical process is not, as \nPlaintiff argues, merely add itional information that Defendant would like to see, but rather an \nessential part of an expert report that cuts to the heart of whether the method “ can be or has been \ntested.” City of Pomona , 750 F.3d at 1046 . \nPlaintiff relies on Surgical Instrument Service Company, Inc. v. Intuitive Surgical, Inc. , \nwhere a court in this district rejected a motion to exclude the testimony of several experts. No. 21 -\nCV-03496 -AMO, 2024 WL 1975456  (N.D. Cal. Mar. 31, 2024) . That case is easily distinguished. \nThere, the moving party’s challenges were rooted in nuanced issues with qualifications or \nmethods, such as an expert’s failure to consider certain evidence during their analysis. Id. At *6. \nRegardless, the reports and testimony of multiple experts, although  potentially flawed, could not \nbe excluded on reliability grounds. Conversely, here Defendant is challenging Kostick’s failure to \ndocument and disclose his methods in the first place. Although the court in Surgical Instruments  \nrightly held that “flaws in a  proffered expert’s analysis typically go to the weight, rather than the \nadmissibility, of the expert’s testimony,”  id. at 2, where analysis is not adequately documented, a \ndistrict court must fulfill its gatekeeper function and exclude the testimony.  Case 3:22-cv-07197-RS     Document 98     Filed 08/02/24     Page 15 of 17 \nORDER ON DEFENDANT ’S MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT , MOTION TO STRIKE  \nCASE NO.  22-cv-07197 -RS \n16 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  Kost ick’s report further runs afoul of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(a)(2)(B)(ii), \nwhich requires that an expert’s report contain “ the facts or data considered by the witness in \nforming” their opinions. “A testifying expert must disclose and therefore ret ain whatever materials \nare given him to review in preparing his testimony . . . because such materials often contain \neffective ammunition for cross -examination.” Fid. Nat. Title Ins. Co. of New York v. Intercounty \nNat. Title Ins. Co. , 412 F.3d 745, 751 (7t h Cir. 2005) (discussing Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \n26). Because Kostick did not document his analytical process and cannot confirm which materials \nhe relied upon in forming his opinions, his report and associated testimony also run afoul of \nFederal R ule of Civil Procedure 26 and are unreliable.  \nC. Kostick’s opinion that Plaintiff did not achieve the expected return from its digital \nmarketing investment  \nDefendant moves to strike an additional opinion in Kostick’s report; that is, that “a solid \ninvestment in digital marketing should result in a return of 2 -5 times during the short term and \nmore in life time value of the customer.” However, the report provides no additional information \nabout this claim or its basis. When asked during his deposition about the  claim, Kostick confirmed \nthat he did not cite a source and could not identify a potential source supporting this claim despite \nit being supposed common knowledge. “N othing in either Daubert  or the Federal Rules of \nEvidence requires a district court to adm it opinion evidence that is connected to existing data only \nby the ipse dixit  of the expert. ” Gen. Elec. Co. v. Joiner , 522 U.S. 136, 146 (1997) . Kostick’s \nclaim regarding a reasonably expected return for a digital marketing investment is fundamental to \nhis analysis and must have some basis in order to be reliable under Daubert . \n The ten blog posts and articles listed by Kostick as “authoritative sources” to shed light on \nthe potential returns from the kinds of marketing investments employed by Plaintiff add nothing to \nsupport his report’s reliability. Because he did not provide ci tations for any of these ten sources, \nKostick fails to make clear exactly what articles he is relying on. However, even a cursory search \nfor these ten sources makes clear that they are not from reliable peer -reviewed publications. \nRather, Kostick is appare ntly citing to industry magazines and blogs run by technology companies Case 3:22-cv-07197-RS     Document 98     Filed 08/02/24     Page 16 of 17 \nORDER ON DEFENDANT ’S MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT , MOTION TO STRIKE  \nCASE NO.  22-cv-07197 -RS \n17 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  who are likely writing with incentives irrelevant here. See Daubert , 509 U.S. at 593–94 (whether a \ntheory has been subjected to peer review is relevant to its reliability). Moreover, b y Kostick’s own \naccount, each of these sources consist of generic discussions of digital marketing and are not \nclearly connected to his analysis. Kostick does not himself connect these sources to his analysis \nwhatsoever, instead merely listing them and sum marizing their main points in a few words. Thus, \nthose ten referenced sources add nothing. Kostick’s opinion is mere ipse dixit  and therefore \nexcludable.  \nV. CONCLUSION  \nFor the reasons explained herein, Defendant’s motion for partial summary judgment and \nmotio n to strike are granted. Judgment is granted for Defendant on Counts I, II, and III in \nPlaintiff’s SAC as to the “MDacne” mark. Count s I and II  remain as to Defendant’s “MDhair” \nmark. Further, judgment is granted for Defendant as to Counts V and VI in the SAC .

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: The court case involves disputes between Findability Sciences, Inc. and Soft10, Inc. over software agreements and claims of copyright infringement and contract violations. The main dispute is whether Findability Sciences unlawfully used and sublicensed Soft10’s software, Dr. Mo, contrary to their agreements. This case involves AI as Findability Sciences is an AI company, and the subject of dispute involves AI-related software. The court granted partial summary judgment, ruling in favor of Findability on some but not all counterclaims, notably denying summary judgment on claims related to copyright infringement and breach of contract.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: The key legal issues are whether Findability Sciences breached multiple software agreements and infringed on Soft10's copyright by using and sublicensing its Dr. Mo software without proper authorization or payment, and whether Soft10's claims for various other causes of action, including promissory estoppel and unjust enrichment, are valid.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court denied Findability Sciences' motion for summary judgment on claims of copyright infringement, breach of contract, violation of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, violation under Massachusetts General Law Chapter 93A, and misappropriation of trade secrets, citing the existence of genuine disputes of material facts that necessitate a trial. However, the court granted summary judgment in favor of Findability Sciences on Soft10’s counterclaims related to promissory estoppel, unjust enrichment, rescission, and conversion due to lack of applicable evidence or because they preempted by existing contracts or federal copyright law.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine two tech companies that made a deal to share some cool software tools. One company says the other broke their promises by not following the rules and not paying for the software like they agreed. They also shared the software with others without permission. A judge looked at both sides and said, \"Some of these issues need more evidence and should be decided in a trial, but for now, the part about making a new promise and the claims that overlap with an existing deal are not strong enough to go forward. Let's focus on the main problems like the software sharing and payments.\"",

March 15, 2023 \n I. Introduction \n  Plaintiff Findability Sciences, Inc. (“Findability Sciences”) has filed this lawsuit against \nDefendant Soft10, Inc. (“Soft10”) seeking decl aratory judgment as to  non-infringement of \ncopyright (Count I) and non-breach of a software licensing agre ement (Count II) and alleging \nbreach of contract (Count III), breach of the impli ed covenant of good faith and fair dealing (Count \nIV) and violation of Mass. Gen. L. c. 93A (Count V).  D. 38.  Soft10 s eeks declaratory judgment \nas to breach of contract and misappropriation of trade secr ets and intellectual property \n(Counterclaim Count VII) and has asserted counterclaims against Findability  Sciences for breach \nof contract (Counterclaim Count I), promissory estoppel (Counter claim Count II), violation of \nMass. Gen. L. c. 93A (Counterclai m Count III), misappropriation of trade secrets an d intellectual \nproperty (Counterclaim Count IV), breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing \n(Counterclaim Count V), unjust enrichment (Co unterclaim Count VI), recission (Counterclaim \nCount VIII), conversion (Counter claim Count IX) and copyright  infringement (Counterclaim \nCount X).  D. 39.  Findability Sciences now moves fo r summary judgment as to its declaratory Case 1:20-cv-12236-DJC   Document 83   Filed 03/15/23   Page 1 of 232 \n judgment claims, Counts I and II, and all of Soft 10’s counterclaims (Counterclaims I through X).  \nD. 60.  The Court ALLOWS the motion as to So ft10's counterclaims for promissory estoppel, \nunjust enrichment, recission and conversion (C ounterclaim Counts II, VI, VIII and IX), but \notherwise DENIES the motion.   \nII. Standard of Review \nA court grants summary judgment where there is no genuine dis pute as to any material fact \nand the undisputed facts demonstrat e that the moving party is entitl ed to judgment as a matter of \nlaw.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a).  “An i ssue is genuine if ‘it may reasonably be resolved in favor of either \nparty’ at trial, and material if it ‘possess[es] the capacity to sway the outcome of the litigation \nunder the applicable law.’”  Iv erson v. City of Boston, 452 F.3d 94, 98 (1st Cir. 2006) (alteration \nin original) (citation omitted).  The movant “bears the burden of  demonstrating the absence of a \ngenuine issue of material fact.”  Rosciti v. Ins. Co. of Pa., 659 F.3d 92, 96 (1st Cir. 2011) (quoting \nCarmona v. Toledo, 215 F.3d 124, 132 (1st Cir. 2000)).  If the movant  meets its burden, the \nnonmovant “must, with respect to each issue on which she would bear  the burden of proof at trial, \ndemonstrate that a trier of fact could reasonably re solve that issue in her favor.”  Borges ex rel. \nS.M.B.W. v. Serrano–Isern, 605 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 2010).  “As a general rule, that requires the \nproduction of evidence that is ‘sig nificant[ly] probative.’”  Id. (a lteration in or iginal) (quoting \nAnderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 249 (1986)). \nIII. Factual Background  The following facts are undisputed unless othe rwise noted and are drawn from Findability \nSciences’ statement of material f acts, D. 62, Soft10’s statement of ma terial facts, D. 72, Findability \nSciences’ response to Soft10’s statement of mate rial facts, D. 77, and accompanying documents.\n1   \n \n1 Although Findability Sciences corr ectly points out that Soft10’s selective response to its \nstatement of undisputed facts doe s not comply with Local Rule  56.1 (providing that a “party Case 1:20-cv-12236-DJC   Document 83   Filed 03/15/23   Page 2 of 233 \n Findability Sciences is an ente rprise artificial intelligence (“AI”) company that combines \nmachine learning, computer vision and natural language processing technologies to develop and \nimplement AI solutions for businesses.  D. 62 ¶¶ 1–2.  Findability Scienc es’ software platform \nincludes the FP-Predict+ module, which provides pr ediction capabilities.  D. 62 ¶ 4.  Soft10 is a \nsoftware company that developed Dr. Mo, an automa tic statistical analysis and predictive analytics \nsoftware product.  D. 64-1 at 2.  \nOn December 28, 2015, Findability Sciences a nd Soft10 entered into an Alliance \nAgreement (“the Alliance Agreement”).  D. 62 ¶ 23; see D. 64-1.  Under the Alliance Agreement, \nthe parties agreed to “promote & deliver each other’s products, solutions and software consulting \nservices to various business organi zations.”  D. 64-1 at 2.  The parties also agreed to share fifty \npercent of the net revenue generate d by the other party’s software serv ices if sold together or by \nthe other party.  Id. at 3.      \nOn July 27, 2017, Findability Sciences and Soft10 amended and restated the Alliance \nAgreement (“the Amended Alliance Agreement”), D. 62 ¶ 27; see D. 64-2, and entered into a \n \nopposing the [summary judgment] mo tion shall include a concise statement of the material facts \nof record as to which it is cont ended that there exists a genuine issue to be tried, with page \nreferences to affidavits, deposit ions and other documentation”), it s own summary j udgment papers \nwere not a model of clarity in one respect.  Despite having moved for summary judgment as to the \nentirety of Counts I and II and Counterclaim Coun ts I through X, D. 60, Findability Sciences’ reply \nbrief then took the position that there were at least disputed issues of material facts as to three of \nthe bases for those claims (namely, those relating to Ajinomoto Health & Nutrition North America \nInc. (“Ajinomoto”), SoftBank Telecom America Co rp. (“Softbank”) and Findability Sciences, k.k. \n(“FSKK”), D. 78 at 4).  Moreover, the disputed issu es of fact that Soft10 did raise as to Ajinomoto, \nD. 72 at 5–7, are sufficient to raise a disputed issue of fact.  Nonetheless since Soft10 does not \nrespond to all material facts of record set forth in  Findability Sciences’ statement of facts, D. 62, \nthe Court deems admitted all material facts set fo rth in Findability Sciences’ motion which Soft10 \nhas not controverted.  See Cochran v. Quest Software, Inc., 328 F.3d 1, 12 (1st Cir. 2003) (quoting \nD. Mass. L. R. 56.1).  As Findability Sciences  points out, Soft10 accordingly has only raised \ndisputed issues of material fa cts as to Ajinomoto, SoftBank and FSKK, D. 78 at 2–4, as discussed \nat further length below. Case 1:20-cv-12236-DJC   Document 83   Filed 03/15/23   Page 3 of 234 \n Corporate Partnering Software De velopment License Agreement (“th e License Agreement”).  D. \n62 ¶ 29; see D. 64-3.  Under the Amended Alliance Agreement, Findability Sciences agreed “to \nactively promote, recommend & sell Soft10’s software solutions either integrated with [Findability \nSciences’] solutions or on a stand- alone basis” and Soft10 agreed to  grant to Findability Sciences \n“a nonexclusive, nonsublicensa ble, nontransferable, license to use and access [Dr. Mo].”  D. 64-2 \nat 2.  Under the License Agreement, Findability Sciences agreed, except as expressly allowed, not \nto “use, copy, distribute or subli cense [Dr. Mo].”  D. 64-3 at 5. \nOn August 20, 2018, Findability Sciences and So ft10 entered into an Application Specific \nLicense Software Agreement (“the ASL Software  Agreement”), which superseded the Amended \nAlliance Agreement and the License Agreement.  D.  62 ¶ 36; see D. 64-7.  Under the ASL Software \nAgreement, Soft10 granted Findability Sciences and its affiliates “one perpetual, irrevocable, \nworldwide, non-exclusive, non-transf erable, and royalty-fre e license to [Dr. Mo ] to reproduce, use, \nmodify and prepare the Findability Platform fo r the purposes of using [Dr. Mo] to develop \nintegration or interfaces between [D r. Mo] and the [Findability Platform] . . .”  D. 64 ¶ 32; D. 64-\n7 at 6–7.  Further, Soft10 agreed “to license [Dr. Mo] to [Findability Sciences] for $4,000 per server license per month for ongoing projec ts.”  D. 64 ¶ 33; D. 64-7 at 10.   \nFindability Sciences had access to Dr. Mo and the capability of generating license keys for \nsuch software without the involvement of Soft10.  D. 72 ¶ 1; D. 77 ¶ 1.  Dr. Mo was implemented \nand utilized as part of Findability  Sciences’ project with Ajinomoto.\n2  D. 72 ¶ 2; D. 77 ¶ 2.  Between \n \n2 Anand Mahurkar’s deposition testimony on this poi nt, the basis for this  fact, is open to \ndifferent interpretations as to how exactly Dr. Mo was implemented in relation to Findability \nSciences’ project with Ajinomoto.  See D. 71-1 at 13.  Soft10 cla ims that Dr. Mo was \n“implemented as a component of the Findability Plat form.”  D. 72 ¶ 2.  Findability Sciences claims \nthat “components of the Findabil ity Platform were implemented along with Dr. Mo [separately] \non Ajinomoto premises.”  D. 77 ¶ 2. Case 1:20-cv-12236-DJC   Document 83   Filed 03/15/23   Page 4 of 235 \n November 2018 and May 2019, Findability Sciences paid Soft10 the required license fee for Dr. \nMo.  D. 72 ¶ 5; D. 77 ¶ 5.  In June 2019, Finda bility Sciences stopped pa ying Soft10 license fees \nfor Dr. Mo.  D. 72 ¶ 6; D. 77 ¶ 6.  Findability Sc iences continued to charge Ajinomoto the same \nmonthly amount for the FP-Predict+ license betw een June 2019 and August 2020 as it did between \nNovember 2018 and May 2019.  D. 72 ¶¶ 3, 7; D. 77 ¶¶ 3, 7; see D. 71-5.   \nFP-Predict+ is a separate program from Dr. Mo that Findability Sciences created using \ninternally developed algorithms, open-source code and third-part y APIs.  D. 62 ¶¶ 8, 15.  FP-\nPredict+ employs three distinct kinds of predicti on or forecasting methodol ogies: (1) classification, \n(2) prediction for continuous target variables an d (3) time series forecasting.  D. 62 ¶¶ 5–6.  Of \nthese methodologies, FP-Predict+ used Dr. Mo on ly for classification problems.  See D. 62 ¶¶ 9–\n10.  Prior to developing its own AI software, Fi ndability Sciences’ business model was to offer \nDr. Mo along with the Findability Platform as part of its AI option.  See D. 71-2 at 9.  When Dr. \nMo was being used for one of its customers, Findability Sciences w ould utilize an in stance of Dr. \nMo that had been licensed for that specific cust omer.  D. 62 ¶ 11.  By contrast, FP-Predict+’s \nprediction for continuous target variables functiona lity, available as early as June 2019, and its \ntime series forecasting functionali ty, available as early as Fe bruary 2020, both use programming \nlanguage and algorithms  that are different from Dr. Mo.  See D. 62 ¶¶ 13–22; D. 65 ¶¶ 16, 18, \n102–105. IV. Procedural History  \n  \n Findability Sciences commenced this ac tion on December 17, 2020, D. 1, and later filed \nan amended complaint, D. 38.  Findability Scien ces now moves for summary judgment as to its \ndeclaratory judgment claims, C ounts I and II, and all of Soft 10’s counterclaims, Counterclaim Case 1:20-cv-12236-DJC   Document 83   Filed 03/15/23   Page 5 of 236 \n Counts I through X.  D. 60.  The Court heard the parties on the pending motion and took this matter \nunder advisement.  D. 82.  \nV. Discussion  \n \nA. Findability Sciences’ Claim for Declar atory Judgment of No Copyright \nInfringement (Count I) and Soft10’s Counterclaim of Copyright Infringement \n(Counterclaim Count X) \n \nSoft10 alleges that portions of FP Predict+ ar e copied from the Dr. Mo software and that \nFindability Sciences has reproduced , copied and/or distri buted Dr. Mo to thir d parties without the \nvalid legal authority to do so.  D.  39 at 45.  Findability Sciences argues that Soft10 has no evidence \nthat it copied or distributed Dr. Mo without Soft10’s author ization.  See D. 61 at 16–17.   \nTo establish copyright infringeme nt, a plaintiff must “prove two elements:  (1) ownership \nof a valid copyright, and (2 ) copying of constituent el ements of the work that are original.”  Soc’y \nof Holy Transfiguration Monastery, Inc. v. Gregory, 689 F.3d 29, 39 (1st Cir. 2012) (internal \ncitation and quotation marks omitted).  “To esta blish actionable copying for the purposes of \ncopyright infringement, the plainti ff must prove both:  (a) that the defendant actually copied the \nwork as a factual matter, and (b) that the defendant’s c opying of the copyright ed material was so \nextensive that it rendered the infringing and copyrighted works substantially similar.”  Airframe \nSys., Inc. v. L-3 Commc’ns Corp., 658 F.3d 100, 105 (1st Cir. 2011) (internal citation and  \nquotation marks omitted).  “In the absence of direct  evidence of copying . . . one of the ways to \nindirectly establish that the defe ndant copied the plaintiff’s work is to provide evidence that (1) \nthe defendant ‘enjoyed access to the copyrighted work,’ and so had the opportunity to copy the \nwork, and (2) ‘a sufficient de gree of similarity exists between  the copyrighted work and the \nallegedly infringing work to give rise to an inference of act ual copying.’”  T-Peg, Inc. v. Vermont \nTimber Works, Inc., 459 F.3d 97, 111 (1st Ci r. 2006) (quoting Johnson v. Gordon, 409 F.3d 12, Case 1:20-cv-12236-DJC   Document 83   Filed 03/15/23   Page 6 of 237 \n 18 (1st Cir. 2005)).  “The similari ty inquiry used to indirectly es tablish copying is referred to as \n‘probative similarity’ and is ‘som ewhat akin to, but different tha n, the requirement of substantial \nsimilarity’ that must be shown to prove copyright infringement.” Id.; see Lotus Dev. Corp. v. \nBorland Int’l, Inc., 49 F.3d 807, 813 (1st Cir.  1995), aff’d, 516 U.S. 233 (1996) (describing \n“probative similarity” as when “t he offending and copyrighted work s are so similar that the court \nmay infer that there was factual c opying”) (citations omitted).   \nIt is undisputed that Soft10 owns a valid copyri ght for Dr. Mo.  See D. 62 ¶ 3; D. 64-2 at \n4; 64-3 at 5; 64-7 at 5.  The only remaining inquiry, therefore, is whether Soft10 has established \nactionable copying under the Copyright Act. \n1. Whether Soft10 Has Established That  Findability Sciences Enjoyed Access \nto Dr. Mo and Had the Opportunity to Copy the Work \n \nTo establish that Findability Sciences copied Dr. Mo, Soft10 must provide evidence that \nFindability Sciences “enjoyed ac cess to the copyrighted work, a nd so had the opportunity to copy \nthe work.”  See T-Peg, 459 F.3d at 111.  It is undisputed that Findability Sciences had access to \nDr. Mo and the capability of generating license keys  for such software without the involvement of \nSoft10.  D. 72 ¶ 1; D. 77 ¶ 1.  It is also undisput ed that Dr. Mo was imple mented and utilized as \npart of Findability Sciences’ project with at leas t one entity, Ajinomoto.  D. 72 ¶ 2; D. 77 ¶ 2.  \nAccordingly, Soft10 has established that Findabi lity Sciences enjoyed access to Dr. Mo and had \nthe opportunity to copy the work. \n2. Whether Soft10 Has Established Probative Similarity \n \nCircumstantial evidence that a defendant ran a copyrighted software program outside the \nscope of its license is sufficient to establish probative sim ilarity under the Copyright Act.  See \nICONICS, Inc. v. Massaro, 192 F. Supp. 3d 254, 265 (D. Mass. 2016) and cases cited.  Here, \nSoft10 has established probative simi larity because there is a genuine  factual dispute as to whether Case 1:20-cv-12236-DJC   Document 83   Filed 03/15/23   Page 7 of 238 \n Findability Sciences ran a copy of the Dr. Mo soft ware outside the scope of  its license, namely to \ncertain, enumerated entities, incl uding Ajinomoto.  See D. 71 at 2–11; D. 78 at 3–4.  Since an act \nof copying sufficient to violate th e Copyright Act occurs each time copyrighted software is run, \nid., Soft10 has produced sufficien t evidence to satisfy the prob ative similar ity inquiry.  \nBecause Soft10 has produced sufficient, if disputed, evidence as to the elements of its \ncopyright infringement claim, th e Court denies Findability Scie nces’ motion as to Count I and \nCounterclaim Count X. \nB. Findability Sciences’ Claim for Declarat ory Judgment of No Breach of the \nASL Software Agreement (Count II) and So ft10’s Counterclaims of Breach of \nContract and Declaratory Judgment (Counterclaim Counts I and VII) \n \nTo succeed on its breach of contract claim, Soft10 “must show (1) the existence of a valid \ncontract; (2) that it has performed  its obligations under the contract; and (3) a breach of the contract \nthat causes damages.”  Lombard Med. Techs., Inc. v. Johannessen, 729 F. Supp. 2d 432, 438 (D. \nMass. 2010).  Soft10 alleges that  Findability Sciences breached the terms of the Alliance \nAgreement, D. 64-1, the Amended Alliance Agreem ent, D. 64-2, the License Agreement, D. 64-\n3, and the ASL Software Agreement, D. 64-7 (co llectively, “the Agreements”), by failing to pay \nSoft10 its share of revenue sales that featured th e Dr. Mo program and by a llowing third parties to \nuse Dr. Mo without a valid license.  D. 39 at 38, 42; D. 71 at 11–14.     \n1. Whether Findability Sciences Subl icensed Dr. Mo to SoftBank and \nAjinomoto \n \nThere is at least a genuine dispute of fact as  to whether Findability Sciences breached the \nAmended Alliance Agreement, D. 64-2 at 2, and th e License Agreement, 64-3 at 5, by sublicensing \nthe Findability Platform contai ning Dr. Mo to its third-party customers SoftBank and Ajinomoto \nin a September 2017 Statement of Work, see D. 71-2  at 2–3, where Findability  Sciences agreed to \nperform AI-driven prediction services for Ajinomoto.  See D. 71 at 11–14.  There is also evidence Case 1:20-cv-12236-DJC   Document 83   Filed 03/15/23   Page 8 of 239 \n that Findability Sciences breached the ASL Softwa re Agreement, D. 64-7 at 9, by using Dr. Mo in \nconnection with Ajinomoto between June 20 19 and August 2020 without paying Soft10 the \nrequired license fee.  D. 71 at 6–11.  \nUnder the Amended Alliance Agreement, Soft10 granted Findability Sciences “a \nnonexclusive, nonsublicensable, nontransferable, li cense to use and access [Dr. Mo] and related \nsupport implementations of [Dr. Mo ] for the purposes of complyi ng with [Findability Sciences’] \nobligations under this Agreement.”  D. 64-2 at 2.  The License Agreement further provided that \n“[e]xcept to the extent expressly allowed in this Agreement, [Findability Sciences] shall not use, \ncopy, distribute or sublicense [Dr. Mo].”  D. 64- 3 at 5.  The relevant clauses of the September \n2017 Statement of Work between Fi ndability Sciences, SoftBank and Ajinomoto read as follows: \nSubject to the terms and conditions of this SOW, [Findability Sciences] hereby \ngrants to SoftBank under all of [Findability Sc iences’] intellectual property rights \nin and to the Findability Platform®, in the United States, sub-licensable, non-\nexclusive, non-transferable right to license  a right to use the Findability Platform® \nto AJINA. \n \nSubject to the terms and conditions of th is SOW, SoftBank hereby grants to AJINA \nunder all of [Findability Sciences’] in tellectual property rights in and to the \nFindability Platform®, in the United States, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use the implemented features of  Findability Platform® to \nAJINA. \n D. 71-2 at 2.   \nFindability Sciences both sublicensed its Fi ndability Platform to SoftBank and Ajinomoto \nand agreed to perform AI-driven prediction services for Ajinomoto.   See id.  The Statement of \nWork indicates that Findability Sciences’ busin ess model was to offer Dr. Mo along with the \nFindability Platform as part of its  AI “option.”  D. 71-2 at 9.  Ther e is no evidence that Findability \nSciences offered AI services without Dr. Mo  until June 2019.  See D. 62 ¶¶ 9, 11, 18, 21.  Since \nFindability Sciences was prohibite d at this time from sublicensi ng Dr. Mo under both the Amended Case 1:20-cv-12236-DJC   Document 83   Filed 03/15/23   Page 9 of 2310 \n Alliance Agreement and the License Agreement, see D.  64-2 at 2; D. 64-3 at 5, there is at least a \ngenuine factual dispute as to whet her Findability Sciences’ sublicen se of its Findability Platform \nto SoftBank and Ajinomoto was an unau thorized sublicense of Dr. Mo.  \nFurthermore, under the ASL Soft ware Agreement, Soft10 agreed  “to license [Dr. Mo] to \n[Findability Sciences] for $4,000 pe r server license per month for ongoing projects.”  D. 64 ¶ 33; \nD. 64-7 at 10.  As discussed above, Findability Sciences had access to Dr. Mo and the capability \nof generating license keys for such software without the involvement of Soft10.  D. 72 ¶ 1; D. 77 \n¶ 1.  Between November 2018 and May 2019, during wh ich time Dr. Mo was integrated with FP-\nPredict+, Findability Sciences issued mont hly invoices to Ajinom oto for $9,900 for an “FP-\nPredict+ License.”  D. 72 ¶ 3; D. 77 ¶ 3.  During this timeframe, Findability Sciences paid the required license fee for Dr. Mo.  D. 72 ¶ 5; D. 77 ¶ 5.  It stopped doing so in June 2019.  D. 72 ¶ 6; D. 77 ¶ 6.  Nevertheless, between June 2019 and August 2020, Findability Sciences continued \nto issue monthly invoices to Ajinomoto for $9,900 for the FP-Predict+ License despite purportedly \ndisabling Dr. Mo’s functionality.  D. 72 ¶ 7; D. 77 ¶ 7.  As Soft10 argues, a reasonable jury could \nfind that Dr. Mo’s functionality  was not actually removed since it would have been unreasonable \nfor Ajinomoto to have continued paying the sa me fee for the FP-Predict+ License had it known \nthat Dr. Mo’s functionality had actually been removed.  D. 71 at 10.  On such a finding, it follows that Findability Sciences breached the ASL Software Agreement, D. 64-7, by using Dr. Mo in connection with Ajinomoto for over a year without paying Soft 10 the required license fee. \n2. Whether Findability Sciences Sublicensed Dr. Mo to FSKK \n  \nSimilarly, there is a genuine dispute of f act as to whether Findability Sciences \nimpermissibly sublicensed Dr. Mo to its jointly owned subsidiary, FSKK.  Findability Sciences \nentered into a Distri bution Agreement with FSKK on Oct ober 1, 2017, granting FSKK “on an Case 1:20-cv-12236-DJC   Document 83   Filed 03/15/23   Page 10 of 2311 \n exclusive basis in Japan . . . the right to promote, mark et, sell and distribu te [the Findability \nPlatform] and Product Bundles.”  D. 71-8 at 1.  As  discussed above, Findability Sciences’ business \nmodel was to offer Dr. Mo along with  the Findability Platform as part  of its AI “option” and there \nis no evidence that Findability Sciences offered AI services without Dr. Mo until June 2019.  See \nD. 71-2 at 9; D. 62 ¶¶ 9, 11, 18, 21.  Under the License Agreement in effect at the time, Soft10 \nhad only granted Findability Sciences “and its Affiliat es one . . . license to [Dr. Mo] to reproduce, \nuse, modify and otherwise prepar e Derivative Works for the purposes  of using [Dr. Mo] to develop \nintegration or interfaces between [Dr. Mo] and [the Findability Platform] . . . and to otherwise \ndevelop, test and evaluate Combin ed Products.”  D. 64-3 at 4.  As Soft10 argues, even if FSKK is \nan “Affiliate” of Findability Sciences, the scop e of this license was limited to developing \nintegration or interfaces between Dr. Mo and the Findability Platform or  otherwise developing, \ntesting and evaluating the two products.  D. 71 at  12–14; see D. 64-3 at 4.  The License Agreement \ndid not grant Findability Sciences’ “Affiliates” the right to market, advertise, promote or sell Dr. \nMo in Japan.  Compare D. 64-3 at 4 with D. 71- 8 at 1.  Soft10 had granted that right only to \nFindability Sciences and per the terms of the Amended Alliance Agreement, it was \n“nonsublicensable” and “nontransferabl e.”  D. 64-2 at 2.  There, therefore, is a genuine factual \ndispute as to whether Findability Sciences brea ched the Amended Alliance Agreement and the \nLicense Agreement by sublicensing th e Findability Platform to FSKK. \nAccordingly, Findability Sciences’ motion is  denied as to Count II and Counterclaim \nCounts I and VII. \nC. Soft10’s Counterclaim of Breach of the Implied Covenant of Good Faith and \nFair Dealing (Counterclaim Count V) \n \nSoft10 also brings a counterclaim for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair \ndealing.  D. 39 at 41.  \"The cove nant of good faith and fa ir dealing is implie d in every contract, Case 1:20-cv-12236-DJC   Document 83   Filed 03/15/23   Page 11 of 2312 \n including contracts between sophisticated business people.  The implied covenant provides that \nneither party shall do anything which will have the e ffect of destroying or injuring the right of the \nother party to receive the fruits of the contract and exists so that the objectives of the contract may \nbe realized.\"  Weiler v. PortfolioScope, Inc ., 469 Mass. 75, 82 (2014) (internal citations and \nquotation marks omitted) (omissions in original); see, e.g., FabriClear , LLC v. Harvest Direct, \nLLC, 481 F. Supp. 3d 27, 36 (D. Mass. 2020).  (holding that the devel oper sufficiently alleged that \nthe licensee took actions with the effect of injuring the develope r’s rights under their agreement to \nreceive the “fruits of the contra ct” for stating a claim for breach of the imp lied covenant of good \nfaith and fair dealing unde r Massachusetts law.  I d. at 36 (citation omitted). \nHere, like in Fabriclear, there is sufficient evidence to support Soft10’s breach of the \nimplied covenant of good faith and fair dealing counterclaim.  As discussed above, Soft10 and \nFindability Sciences, over several years and acro ss multiple contracts, had an arrangement by \nwhich Findability Sciences paid Soft10 a fee in exchange for nonsublicensable access to Dr. Mo.  \nD. 64-2 at 2; D. 64-3 at 5; D. 64-7 at 9.  Consid ering the parties’ “manner of performance,” Soft10 \nhad “reasonable expectations,” Weiler, 469 Mass. at 82, that Findability Sciences would pay for \nits use of Dr. Mo and that it would not sublicense  Dr. Mo without Soft10’s authorization.  On this \nrecord, a reasonable jury could find that Findability Sciences “injured the right” of Soft10 to receive the “fruits of the contr act,” see FabriClear, 481 F. Supp. 3d at 36, had it sublicensed Dr. \nMo to Ajinomoto, SoftBank and FSKK and used Dr. Mo in connection w ith its project with \nAjinomoto from June 2019 to August 2020 without paying the license fee.  See D. 71-2 at 2; D. \n71-8 at 1; D. 72 ¶¶ 1–6; D. 77 ¶¶ 1–6.  \nAccordingly, Findability Sciences’ motion is  denied as to Counterclaim Count V.  \n Case 1:20-cv-12236-DJC   Document 83   Filed 03/15/23   Page 12 of 2313 \n D. Soft10’s Counterclaim for Promissory Estoppel (Counterclaim Count II) \n \nSoft10 alleges that Findability Sciences represented that it would pay Soft10 a share of the \nproceeds of its sales that featured  the Dr. Mo software, that it reas onably relied on this promise \nand that it was harmed in this reliance.  D. 39 at 38–39.  Findability Scie nces argues that Soft10 \nhas no evidence of Findability Sciences failing to  pay for Dr. Mo as required by the parties’ \nagreements.  D. 61 at 17. \nTo succeed on a claim for promissory estoppel, “the plaintiff must establish that (1) a \npromisor makes a promise which he  should reasonably expect to induce action or forbearance of \na definite and substantial character on the part of the promisee, (2) the promise does induce such \naction or forbearance, and (3) in justice can be avoided only by enforcement of the promise.”  \nAdamson v. Mortg. Elec. Registration Sys ., Inc., No. CIV.A. 11-0693-H, 2011 WL 4985490, at \n*4 (Mass. Super. Oct. 19, 2011) (citing Loranger Constr. Corp. v. E.F. Hauserman Co., 6 Mass. \nApp. Ct. 152, 154, aff’d, 376 Mass. 757 (1978)).  Promi ssory estoppel is “an equitable doctrine” \nthat “implies a contract in law where there is  proof of an unambiguous  promise coupled with \ndetrimental reliance by the promis e.”  Malden Police Patrolman’s Ass’n v. Malden, 92 Mass. App. \nCt. 53, 60 (2017) (citations omitted).  “When an enforceable c ontract exists, however, a claim for \npromissory estoppel will not lie.”  Id. at 61 (citations omitted).  Given that there was a contract \n(actually, several that the partie s do not dispute were enforceable here) between the parties, this \nequitable doctrine does not apply and the Cour t dismisses this count erclaim on this ground.  \nAccordingly, Findability Sciences’ motion is allowed as to C ounterclaim Count II. \nE. Soft10’s Counterclaim Under G.L. c. 93A (Counterclaim Count III) \n \nSoft10 alleges that Findability Sciences acted  unfairly and deceptively, in violation of \nMass. Gen. L. c. 93A (“Chapter 93A”), by fail ing to pay Soft10 revenue for the purpose of Case 1:20-cv-12236-DJC   Document 83   Filed 03/15/23   Page 13 of 2314 \n extracting more favorable contra ct terms and to purposefully ha rm Soft10 for it s own benefit, \nintentionally misappropriating Soft10’s intellectua l property and trade secr ets, forcing Soft10 to \npursue litigation in order to enforce its contract ual rights and knowingly and willfully misleading \nSoft10 for its own benefit.  D. 39 at 39.  Findability Sciences argues that Soft10 has no evidence \nto support this cla im.  D. 61 at 17–18. \nIt is well settled that a simple, or even in tentional, breach [of contract] is insufficient \nin itself to constitute an unfair or deceptive trade practice under Chapter 93A.  In \norder to transform a breach of contract into a Chapter 93A claim, the breach must be both knowing and intended to secure unba rgained-for benefits to the detriment \nof the other party. . . .   Massachusetts courts have consistently held that conduct in disregard of known \ncontractual arrangemen ts and intended to secure be nefits for the breaching party \nconstitutes an unfair act or pr actice for c. 93A purposes.”   \n \nCrosby Legacy Co., LLC v. TechnipFMC PLC, No. 18-CV-10814-MLW, 2019 WL 5588993, at \n*13 (D. Mass. Sept. 13, 2019) (alteration in original) (citing City of Revere v. Bos./Logan Airport \nAssocs., LLC, 416 F. Supp. 2d 200, 208 (D. Mass. 2005) ; Mass. Employers Insur. Exchange v. \nPropac-Mass, Inc., 420 Mass. 39, 43 (1995); Arthur D. Little, In c. v. Dooyang Corp., 147 F.3d 47, \n55 (1st Cir. 1998)). \nIn Crosby, the court found that a consultant stated a plausible Chapter 93A claim where a \ndefendant client, upon a merger and while still usi ng licensed and trademarked materials, promised \nthat the new entity would enter into a new agreement while it had no intention of doing so and \nwhile also sharing the materials with its merger  partner.  Id.; see Wang Lab’ys, Inc. v. Bus. \nIncentives, Inc., 398 Mass. 854, 856-57 (1986). \nHere, analogous facts are alleged.  In reading the record in the light most favorable to \nSoft10, a reasonable jury could find that Findability Sciences “disre gard[ed] . . . known contractual \narrangements” regarding Dr. Mo an d “intended to secure  benefits for” itsel f by violating those Case 1:20-cv-12236-DJC   Document 83   Filed 03/15/23   Page 14 of 2315 \n contractual arrangemen ts.  See Crosby, 2019 WL 5588993, at *13.  Like the defendant in Crosby, \na jury could find that Findability Sciences inten tionally shared licensed and trademarked materials \nwith a third-party with no intention of abiding by  its contract with Soft10.  See id.  Similarly, a \njury also could find that Findability Sciences stopped making payments on its contract with Soft10, \ndespite continuing to use Dr. Mo, “constitut[ing] a willful act calculated to obtain the benefits of \n[Soft10’s] contract for [Findability Sciences] without cost and in disregar d of known contractual \narrangements.”  See Wang, 398 Mass. at 857.  Such conduct  “constitutes an unfair act or practice \nfor c. 93A purposes.”  Crosby, 2019 WL 5588993, at *13. \nAccordingly, Findability Sciences’ motion is  denied as to Counterclaim Count III.  \nF. Soft10’s Counterclaim of Misappropriation of Trade Secrets and Intellectual \nProperty Under 18 U.S.C. § 1836 (Counterclaim Count IV) \n \nSoft10 asserts a counterclaim of  misappropriation of trade secr ets under federal law.  D. 39 \nat 39–41.  Soft10 alleges that Find ability Sciences misappropria ted Soft10’s trade secrets by \nknowingly possessing, accessing and/or  using Soft10’s products obtaine d without authorization or \nvalid license, in violation of the several software  licensing agreements between the parties, which \ncontinued even after explicit prohibition from Soft10.  Id.  Findability Sciences argues that Soft10 \nhas no evidence to support this claim.  D. 61 at 18–19.   \n“To prevail on a claim of misa ppropriation of trade secret s under Massachusetts law, a \ncounter-claimant must establish that 1) the information at issue constitute s a trade secret, 2) the \ncounter-claimant took reasonable measures to secure  the confidentiality of the information and 3) \nthe counter-defendant obtained the trade secret  through improper means.”  Sensitech, Inc. v. \nLimeStone FZE, 581 F. Supp. 3d 342, 349 (D . Mass. 2022) (citations omitted).  A plaintiff may \nalso bring a claim under the fede ral  Defend Trade Secrets Act (“ the DTSA”) for misappropriation \nof a trade secret “if it is related to a product or service used in or  intended to be used in interstate Case 1:20-cv-12236-DJC   Document 83   Filed 03/15/23   Page 15 of 2316 \n or foreign commerce.”  Id. (citing 18 U.S.C. § 1836(b)(1)).  “The standard for misappropriation \nunder the DTSA is substantially similar to that under Massachusetts law.”  Id. (citing 18 U.S.C. § \n1839(5)-(6)); see Dichard v. Morgan, No. 17-CV-00338-AJ, 2017 WL 5634110, at *3 n.4 (D.N.H. \nNov. 22, 2017). \nHere, Soft10 has produced sufficient evid ence to support all three prongs of its \nmisappropriation of trade secrets claim.   \n1. Whether Dr. Mo Is a Trade Secret \n“A trade secret may consist of ‘any formula,  pattern, device or compilation of information \nwhich is used in one’s business, and which [provides] an opportunity to ob tain an advantage over \ncompetitors who do not know or us e it.’”  TouchPoint Sols., Inc.  v. Eastman Kodak Co., 345 F. \nSupp. 2d 23, 27 (D. Mass. 2004) (quoting Burten v. Milton Br adley Co., 763 F.2d 461, 463 (1st \nCir. 1985)).  “A trade secret need not have the nove lty that is requisite fo r a patent, it must only \nconfer a competitive advantage on its possessor.”  Id. at 29; see, e.g., Data Gen. Corp. v. Grumman \nSys. Support Corp., 825 F. Supp. 340, 358–59 (D. Mass. 1993) (ruling that evidence supported \njury finding that diagnostic software program was trade secr et where software was unique, \neffective, conferred competitive advantage to it s owner and not a matter of public knowledge); \nPicker Int’l Corp. v. Imaging Equip. Servs., Inc., 931 F. Supp. 18, 35–37 (D. Mass. 1995) \n(concluding that diagnostic software and rela ted documentation were “classic trade secrets” \nbecause they were developed by servicer as a resu lt of investment of years of effort and great \nexpense, were of great competitive value and were protected by confidentiality agreements signed \nby employees and others aut horized to use software). \nHere, the record sufficiently suppo rts a finding that Dr. Mo is a trade secret.  It is undisputed \nthat Dr. Mo was copyrighted, pr otected by confidentiali ty agreements and re quired a license key Case 1:20-cv-12236-DJC   Document 83   Filed 03/15/23   Page 16 of 2317 \n to be accessed.  See D. 62 ¶ 3; D. 64-1 at 4; D. 64-2 at 4–5; 64-3 at 5–6; 64-7 at 5, 9; D. 72 ¶ 1; D. \n77 ¶ 1.  It is also undisputed that Dr. Mo, at minimum, was a forecasting technology capable of \nsolving classification problems.  See D. 62 ¶¶ 9–10; D. 65 ¶¶ 85, 91, 105.  Findability Sciences \nsaw enough value in Dr. Mo such that, at least prior to developing its own AI software, its business model was to license Dr. Mo and offer it along with  the Findability Platform as part of its AI \noffering.  See D. 71-2 at 9.  There is, therefore,  evidence that Dr. Mo conferred a competitive \nadvantage upon those who had access to it.  See Pickler, 931 F. Supp. at 35–37.   Accordingly, a \nreasonable jury could find that Dr . Mo is a trade secret.    \n2. Whether Soft10 Took Reasonable Steps to Preserve the Secrecy of Dr. Mo \nSoft10 “must also show that it has taken reasonable measures to protect [Dr. Mo’s] \nsecrecy.”  TouchPoint, 345 F. Supp. 2d at 29 (citati on omitted).  “Courts c onsider several factors \nin examining that prong, including : 1) the existence or absence of a [Confidential Disclosure \nAgreement], 2) the nature and extent of precautions taken, 3) the circumstances under which the \ninformation was disclosed and 4) the degree to which the informati on has been placed in the public \ndomain or rendered readily ascertainable.”  Id. (ruling that software developer met this prong \nwhere defendant customer had explicitly agreed th at all information concerning system was to be \nconfidential and developer had re peatedly made oral assertions of confidentiality) (citation \nomitted); Optos, Inc. v. Topcon Med. Sys ., Inc., 777 F. Supp. 2d 217, 240 (D. Mass. 2011) \n(concluding that plaintiff’s precautio ns to protect its customer lists met the reasonableness standard \nwhere it had all of its employees sign confidenti ality agreements, where it  limited internal access \nto the protected information and where the inform ation was only disclosed pursuant to a breach of \ncontract). Case 1:20-cv-12236-DJC   Document 83   Filed 03/15/23   Page 17 of 2319 \n for the use of Dr. Mo as contractually agreed an d that Soft10 has no evidence showing otherwise.  \nD. 61 at 9, 19. \n  “[T]o recover for unjust enrichment, a plai ntiff must prove that (1) [it] conferred a \nmeasurable benefit upon the de fendant; (2) [it] reasonably expected compensation from the \ndefendant; and (3) the defendant ac cepted the benefit with the know ledge, actual or chargeable, of \nthe plaintiff's reasonable expectation.”  Tedesc hi-Freij v. Percy L. Grp., P.C., 99 Mass. App. Ct. \n772, 780 (2021) (internal citation an d quotation marks omitted).  A lthough a plaintif f may “plead \nalternative and even inconsistent legal theories, such as breach of  contract and unjust enrichment, \n. . . [it] only can recover under one of these theories.”  Vieira v. First Amer. Title Ins. Co., 668 F. \nSupp. 2d 282, 295 (D. Mass. 2009).  “[T] his case is no longer at the pleading stage” and the parties \ndo not dispute the enforcement of their Agreements  and although they dispute whether Findability \nSciences has breached those Agreements in an y way, they do not appear  to dispute that the \nAgreements govern its use of Dr. Mo.  SiOnyx, LLC v. Hamamatsu Photonics K.K., 332 F. Supp. \n3d 446, 473 (D. Mass. 2018) (allowing defendant’s motion for summary judgment as to unjust \nenrichment claim where breach of  contract claim was proceeding).  Accordingly, given that the \nbreach of contract claim (and related breach of th e implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing \nclaim) survive to trial, the Court dismisses the alternative claim for unjust enrichment.   \nAccordingly, Findability Sciences’ motion is  allowed as to Count erclaim Count VI.  \nH. Soft10’s Counterclaim for Recission (Counterclaim Count VIII) \n \nSoft10 brings a counterclaim for rescission, alle ging that Findability Sciences made false \nrepresentations to extract more favorable contra ct terms, in circumstances where Soft10 executed \nagreements under duress, there by amounting to an abrogation of  the Agreements between the \nparties.  D. 39 at 43.  Soft10 seeks rescission of all such contracts so that Soft10’s damages are not Case 1:20-cv-12236-DJC   Document 83   Filed 03/15/23   Page 19 of 2320 \n limited to the terms of the contr acts but instead reflect the value of Dr. Mo to the customers who \nused it.  Id.  Findability Sciences argues that Soft10 received the payments to which it was entitled \nto under the parties’ Agreements and that Soft10 has no evidence of  fraud or abrogation of any of \nthe parties’ Agreements.  D. 61 at 20. \n“Rescission is an equitable remedy that is av ailable when a contract has been entered into \nthrough fraud, accident, mistake or some type of grossly inequitable conduct which renders the \ncontract void ab initio .”  In re Formatech, Inc., 496 B.R. 26, 36 (Bankr. D. Mass. 2013) (citing \nP.L.A.Y., Inc. v. NIKE, Inc., 1 F. Supp. 2d 60, 65 (D. Mass. 1998)) (int ernal quotation marks \nomitted).  It has been noted that: \n[t]here is ample authority for refusing re scission where there has been only a breach \nof contract rather than an utter failure of considerati on or a repudiation by the party \nin breach.  In the absence of fraud, nothing less than conduct that amounts to an \nabrogation of the contract, or that goes to  the essence of it, or takes away its \nfoundation, can be made a ground for re scission of it by the other party.  \n  \nWorcester Heritage Soc., Inc. v.  Trussell, 31 Mass. App. Ct. 343, 345 (1991) (inter nal citation and \nquotation marks omitted).    \nHere, Soft10 has not produced evidence that it entered any of the Agreements due to “fraud, \naccident, mistake or some type of grossly ineq uitable conduct” which rendered the Agreements \nvoid ab initio .  See In re Formatech, Inc., 496 B.R. at 36.   As discussed above, Soft10 has produced \nsufficient evidence for a jury to conclude that Findability Sciences sublicensed Dr. Mo to three \nentities without its permission and that it failed to  pay for the use of Dr. Mo in connection with \nAjinomoto.  See D. 71-2 at  2; D. 71-8 at 1; D. 72 ¶¶ 1–6; D. 77 ¶¶ 1–6.  While these facts create a \ntriable issue as to whether Findability Sciences breached the Agreements, they do not support a \njury finding of “an utter failure of consideratio n or a repudiation” by Findability Sciences.  See \nWorcester Heritage, 31 Mass. A pp. Ct. at 346; cf. Abrams v. B d. of Selectmen of Sudbury, No. Case 1:20-cv-12236-DJC   Document 83   Filed 03/15/23   Page 20 of 2321 \n 09-P-1226, 2010 WL 1740435, at *2 (Mass. App. Ct. May 3, 2010) (holding that failure of \nconsideration warranted rescission of settlement agreement).  For example, there is no evidence \nthat any of the Agreements lacked consideration.   Soft10 admits that from at least November 2018 \nto May 2019, “Findability Sciences  paid Soft10 the required license  fee for Dr. Mo.”  D. 72 ¶¶ 3, \n5.  Hence, for at least six months, Findability Sciences had access to Dr. Mo and Soft10 received \npayment in exchange, as bargained for under the Ag reements.  See generally D. 64-1; D. 64-2; D. \n64-3; D. 64-7.  And unlike Abrams, the clear intent  of the Agreements, that Soft10 grant Findability \nSciences access to Dr. Mo in exchange for payment,  had been achieved for at  least several months.  \nSee 2010 WL 1740435 at *2; D. 72 ¶¶ 3, 5; D. 77 ¶¶ 3, 5.   \nAccordingly, Findability Sciences’ motion is al lowed as to Counterclaim Count VIII.     \nI. Soft10’s Counterclaim of Conversion (Counterclaim Count IX) \n \nSoft10 argues that Findability Sciences wrongf ully converted Soft10’s Dr. Mo software by \nusing and distributing it in a manne r inconsistent with the agreements between the parties.  See D. \n39 at 43–44.  Findability Sciences responds that Soft10 has no eviden ce that it used Dr. Mo in an \nunauthorized manner.  D. 61 at 20–21. \n“The tort of conversion require s an intentional or wrongful ex ercise of dominion or control \nover personal property of another by one with no right to immediate possession.”  In re Blast \nFitness Grp., LLC, 602 B.R. 208, 229 (Bankr. D.  Mass. 2019) (quoting Kelley v. LaForce, 288 \nF.3d 1, 11–12 (1st Cir. 2002)).  The Copyright Act preempts a conversion claim where (1) the \nsubject of the conversion claim constitutes a work protected under the Copyright Act, and (2) the \nconversion claim provides a right equivalent to those provided by the Copyright Act.  See, e.g., \nHassett v. Hasselbeck, 177 F. Supp. 3d 626, 629 (D. Mass. 2016) (holding conversion claim \npreempted where claim was base d on defendant’s unauthorized copying of an author’s book); Case 1:20-cv-12236-DJC   Document 83   Filed 03/15/23   Page 21 of 2322 \n Jalbert v. Grautski, 554 F. S upp. 2d 57, 75 (D. Mass. 2008) (holding  conversion claim preempted \nwhere conduct at issue consisted of defendant’s alleged distributi on of copies of graphic print \nwithout authorization and without  payment to plaintiff); Henry v. Nat’l Geographic Soc’y, 147 F. \nSupp. 2d 16, 20–21 (D. Mass. 2001) (holding conversion claim preempted where claim was based \non defendant’s purportedly unauthorized re production of plain tiff’s photographs). \nHere, both elements are met.  There is no di spute that Dr. Mo, as a copyrighted work of \nSoft10, falls within the “s ubject matter of c opyright.”  See ILOG, Inc. v. Bell Logic, LLC, 181 F. \nSupp. 2d 3, 6 (D. Mass. 2002) (stating that “[s]oftwar e, in general, is amenable to copyright \nprotection”) (citing Lotu s Dev. Corp., 49 F.3d at 813 n.5 (1st Ci r. 1995)); 17 U.S.C. §§ 101, 102).  \nAs to the second element, Soft10 ’s complaint is that Findability Sciences copied Dr. Mo without \nauthorization.  In essence, Soft 10 seeks to enforce its own right to reproduce—a right equivalent \nto one protected by the Copyri ght Act.  See Hassett, 177 F. Supp. 3d at 629.  Consequently, \nSoft10’s conversion claim is preempted  by the Copyright Act.  See id.  \nAccordingly, Findability Sciences’ motion is allowed as to C ounterclaim Count IX. \nVI. Conclusion \n \nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court ALLOWS  Findability Sciences’ motion for summary \njudgment, D. 60, as to Counterclaim Counts II (promi ssory estoppel), VI (unjust enrichment), VIII \n(recission) and IX (conversion) and DENIES the motion as to Counts I and II (declaratory \njudgment claims) and Counterclaim Counts I (breach of contract), III (violation of Mass. Gen. L. \nc. 93A), IV (misappropriation of trade secrets and intellectual prope rty), V (breach of the covenant \nof good faith and fair dealing), VII (declaratory judgment c ounterclaim) and X (copyright \ninfringement).  \n Case 1:20-cv-12236-DJC   Document 83   Filed 03/15/23   Page 22 of 2323 \n  So Ordered. \n         / s /  D e n i s e  J .

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: The case involves a breach of contract dispute between VoterLabs, Inc. and Ethos Group Consulting Services, LLC. The key issue revolves around Ethos not making an engagement payment leading to alleged malicious conduct by Ethos. VoterLabs claims that Ethos attempted to use this payment as leverage for concessions from VoterLabs, with subsequent motions leading to denial of Ethos' request to dismiss VoterLabs' malicious breach of contract claim and granting Ethos' request to file an amended counterclaim alleging fraud and negligent misrepresentation. AI and machine learning are part of the dispute, as VoterLabs claimed to work on a machine learning solution seemingly related to separate projects that Ethos alleged were funded under the guise of work for Ethos.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether Ethos maliciously breached the contract by withholding an engagement payment, using it as leverage, and whether VoterLabs fraudulently represented the intended use of the investment and software development in their engagement.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court denied Ethos' motion to dismiss VoterLabs' claim of malicious breach of contract and granted Ethos' motion to amend its counterclaim to include claims of fraud and negligent misrepresentation.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: VoterLabs and Ethos had a deal where VoterLabs would make software for Ethos. Ethos didn't make some payments on time; VoterLabs said this was done to unfairly get extra rights or advantages. Ethos wanted to fight one of VoterLabs' claims but lost that, though the court said Ethos could add a claim that VoterLabs lied to get the contract. Part of the disagreement involved what each company was doing with the money, including some mysterious AI software VoterLabs said they were secretly working on.",

(“VoterLabs”)  initiated this action by filing \na complaint (the “original complaint”) against Ethos, alleging two counts of  breach of contract \nfor fail ing to re mit an engagement payment and a termination payment and one count of \nmalicious conduct in aid of an oppressive scheme .  (D.I. 2  at ¶¶ 123–30)  On April 8, 2019, \nEthos filed a motion to dismiss VoterLabs’ original complaint  for failure to state a claim .  (D.I. \n10)  On November 18, 2019, the court granted- in-part and denied -in-part Ethos’ motion.  (D.I. \n22; D.I. 27)   The court granted Ethos’ motion with respect to VoterLabs’ claim of malicious \nconduct in aid of an oppressive scheme  and dismissed the claim without prejudice.  VoterLabs, \nInc. v. Ethos Grp. Consulting Servs., LLC , C.A. No. 19- 524-RGA, 2019 WL 6120449, at *7 (D. \nDel. Oct. 16, 2019), report and recommendation adopted, 2019 WL 6118014 (D. Del. Nov. 18, \n2019).  The court denied Ethos’ motion with respect to V oterLabs’ two breach of contract \nclaims.  Id.  at *4 –7.   \nOn December 2, 2019, Ethos filed an answer to VoterLabs ’ original complaint, asserting \naffirmative defenses and a counterclaim for breach of contract.  (D.I. 28)  VoterLabs filed an \namended complaint  on April 27, 2020.  (D.I. 52)   The amended complaint alleges two breach of \ncontract claims and a malicious breach of contract claim.  ( Id. at ¶¶ 154–61)  On May 7, 2020, \nEthos filed the partial  motion to dismiss with prejudice  the malicious breach of cont ract claim in \nthe amended complaint. (D.I. 59)  \nOn June 8, 2020, Ethos filed a  motion for leave to file a first amended counterclaim , \nalleging fraud and negligent misrepresentation.  (D.I. 68 at 1 n.1)  On July 16, 2020, the court \nentered an oral order  granting- in-part Ethos’ motion for continuance of the trial date, discovery Case 1:19-cv-00524-MAK   Document 103   Filed 10/19/20   Page 2 of 22 PageID #: <pageID>3 \n deadlines, and pre -trial deadlines (D.I. 49) , finding that good cause exist ed to amend the \nscheduling order  (D.I. 32) due to the current health emergency .  The parties were ordered to meet \nand confer on a joint proposed amended scheduling order due on or before  July 24, 2020.  The \ncourt granted the joint proposed amended scheduling order on August 17, 2020, which extended \nthe discovery deadlines but not the original dead line to amend pleadings.  (D.I. 90)   \nb. Facts4 \ni. VoterLabs’ Amended Complaint  \nOn December 18, 2017, VoterLabs and Ethos executed a Services  Agreement (“the \nServices  Agreement”) and a Statement of Work (“the SOW”), according to which VoterLabs \nwas to develop software for Ethos.5  (D.I. 52 at ¶ 38)  The Services  Agreement contained the \nfollowing relevant language:  \n10.3 Limitation of Liability.  Except for Violations of [Voter Labs’] \nindemnification obligations described in Section 10.1 with respect to w illful \nmisconduct, in no event shall [VoterLabs’] or [Ethos ’] liability , whether based in \ncontract, tort, negligence, strict liability or otherwise, with respect to this \nAgreement, the Services, and other similar services, exceed the available \nproceeds of such insurance policies as may be required to be maintained by \n[VoterLab s] hereunder.  Additionally, in no event shall: (a) [VoterLabs] be liable \nto [Ethos] for special, indirect, incidental or consequential damages, or any \ndamages arising from the loss of use, data or profits, whether based i n contract, \ntort, negligence, stri ct liability or otherwise, even if [VoterLabs] knew of the \npossibility thereof; and (b) [Ethos] be liable to [VoterLabs] for special, indirect, \nincidental or consequential damages, or any damages arising from the loss of \nuse, data or profits, whether based in contract, tort, negligence, strict liability or \notherwise, even if [Ethos] knew of the possibility thereof.  \n \n4 The facts in this section are based upon allegat ions in VoterLabs’ amended complaint, which \nthe court accepts as true for the purposes of the pending motion to dismiss.  See Umland v. \nPlanco Fin. Servs., Inc., 542 F.3d 59, 64 (3d Cir. 2008).  In its earlier Report and \nRecommendation, the court detailed t he relevant background facts of this case, which have not \nsubstantially changed, and which are hereby  incorporated.  See VoterLabs, Inc. v. Ethos Grp. \nConsulting Servs., LLC , C.A. No. 19- 524-RGA, 2019 WL 6120449, at *1– 4 (D. Del. Oct. 16, \n2019), report and recommendation adopted, 2019 WL 6118014 (D. Del. Nov. 18, 2019). \n5 The Services Agreement and the SOW were incorporated by reference in the complaint.  (D.I. \n52; D.I. 60, Ex. A  & Ex. B)  Case 1:19-cv-00524-MAK   Document 103   Filed 10/19/20   Page 3 of 22 PageID #: <pageID>4 \n . . . \n \n11.3 Except for a breach of Section 7, all rights and remedies provided in this \nAgreement are cumulative and not exclusive, and the exerc ise by either Party of \nany right or remedy does not preclude the exercise of any other rights or \nremedies that may now or subsequently be available at law, in equity, by statute, \nin any other agreement between the Parties, or otherwise.  Despite the previo us \nsentence, the Parties intend that [VoterLabs’] exclusive remedy for [Ethos’] \npayment breach shall be its rights to damages equal to its earned but unpaid fees.  \n \n(D.I. 60, Ex. A at §§ 10.3, 11.3)   The parties also agreed to an “Engagement Payment” schedu le, \nwhereby Ethos would pay VoterLabs fixed payments in 90- day intervals.  ( Id. at ¶¶ 42 –46)  On \nor about March 9, 2018, Engagement Payment No. 4, for $228,700, be came due.  ( Id. at ¶ 75)  \nEthos remitted Engagement Payment No. 4 on April 26, 2018, over a m onth late.  ( Id. at ¶¶ 89 –\n90)   \nOn May 21, 2018, Ethos delivered a notice of termination of the Services  Agreement via \nemail and overnight mail to VoterLabs.  ( Id. at ¶ 96)  The notice of termination cited, inter alia , \n§ 8.2 of the Services  Agreement, whic h allowed Ethos to terminate the Services  Agreement \nwithout cause sixty days after providing notice —July 20, 2020, in this case .   (Id. at ¶¶ 97 –98) \n On May 30, 2018, representatives of the parties met to discuss  the next steps .  (Id. at ¶¶ \n102–05)  VoterLabs pointed out that Engagement Payment No. 5 would become payable before \nthe July 20, 2020 termination date and that Ethos’ termination without cause triggered Ethos’ \nobligation to make a termination payment to VoterLabs.  ( Id. at ¶ 104)  On June 7, 2018, \nEngagement Payment No. 5 became payable in the amount of $195,450.  ( Id. at ¶ 111)  Ethos \nrefused to make Engagement Payment No. 5 based on the following rationale : Under the \nEngagement Payment schedule, Engagement Payment No. 5 became due 90 days a fter \nVoterLabs’ receipt of Engagement Payment No. 4.  Ethos paid Engagement Payment No. 4 on \nApril 26, 2018.  As a result, Engagement Payment No. 5 became payable on July 25, 2018, Case 1:19-cv-00524-MAK   Document 103   Filed 10/19/20   Page 4 of 22 PageID #: <pageID>5 \n which is 90 days after April 26, 2018 and after the effective termination date of Jul y 20, 2018.  \nTherefore, Ethos had no obligation to make Engagement Payment No. 5 because it be came due \nafter the effective termination date.  ( Id. at ¶¶ 134 –49)  VoterLabs alleges that Ethos devised this \nrationale , withholding Engagement Payment No. 5  as leverage to (1) procure a release f rom its \nobligation to make a termination payment and (2)  obtain complete  ownership of VoterLabs’  \nintellectual property rights in the software developed pursuant to the Services  Agreement and \nSOW up until the term ination.  ( Id. at ¶ 130)  \ni. Ethos’ First Amended Counter claim6  \nAs the parties negotiated the Services  Agreement and SOW, VoterLabs represented in a \n“Project Overview” to Ethos that it intended use a revenue model based on licensing payments \nrather than markups on the cost of development.  (D.I. 68- 1 at ¶ 23)  Although VoterLabs \nrepresented that it would de velop software for Ethos “at cost,” VoterLabs planned to generate \nrevenue by charging Ethos more than the cost of paying software developers.  ( Id. at ¶¶ 25, 37)  \nIn addition, despite promising to “hibernate” —refrain from pursuing other projects while \ndeve loping software for Ethos —VoterLabs used money it received from Ethos  pursuant to the \nServices  Agreement and SOW to pay a data scientist to work on projects for other customers.  \n(Id. at ¶¶ 48 –51)  On November 1, 2018, months after Ethos had terminated the  agreement \nbetween the parties, VoterLabs provided Ethos the work product it had developed pursuant to the  \nServices  Agreement and SOW—software called “NeosInsight.”  (D.I. 68- 1 at ¶¶ 7 –8)  On \n \n6 This facts in this section are based on the allegations in Ethos ’ proposed first amended \ncounterclaims, which the court accepts as true for the purposes of the pending motion for leave \nto amend.  See Winer Family Trust v. Queen , 503 F.3d 319, 331 (3d Cir. 2007); Wright v. City of \nWilmington , C.A. No. 13- 1966- SLR-SRF, 2016 WL 356023, at *2 n.3, *8 (D. Del. Jan. 28, \n2016).   All paragraph citations to the proposed first amended counterclaim at D.I. 68- 1 refer to \nthe numbered paragraphs beginning on page 23 under the heading, “Counterclaim.”   Case 1:19-cv-00524-MAK   Document 103   Filed 10/19/20   Page 5 of 22 PageID #: <pageID>6 \n January 6, 2019, someone  then -unknown to Ethos7 reserved a website for “Axilient.”  ( Id. at ¶ 9)  \nOn October 6, 2019, VoterLabs announced the launch of Axilient, an “artificial intelligence \n[and] machine learning solution,” which “mark[ed] the culmination of several years of stealth \ndevelopment .”  (Id. at ¶ 10)  \nIII. LEGAL STANDARDS  \na. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6)  \nRule 12(b)(6) permits a party to move to dismiss a complaint for failure to state a claim \nupon which relief can be granted.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6).  When considering a Rule \n12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, the court must accept as true all well pleaded f actual allegations in \nthe complaint and construe all reasonable inferences in favor of the plaintiff.  See Umland v. \nPlanco Fin. Servs. Inc., 542 F.3d 59, 64 (3d Cir. 2008). \nTo state a claim upon which relief can be granted pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), a com plaint \nmust contain a “short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to \nrelief.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2).  Although detailed factual allegations are not required, the \ncomplaint must set forth sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to “state a claim to relief that \nis plausible on its face.”  Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly , 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007); s ee also Ashcroft \nv. Iqbal , 556 U.S. 662, 663 (2009).  A claim is facially plausible when the factual allegations \nallow the court  to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct \nalleged.  See Iqbal , 556 U.S. at 663; Twombly , 550 U.S. at 555- 56. \nThe court’s determination is not whether the non- moving party “will ultimately prevail,” \nbut whether that party is “entitled to offer evidence to support the claims.”  United States ex rel. \nWilkins v. United Health Grp., Inc., 659 F.3d 295, 302 (3d Cir. 2011).  This “does not impose a \n \n7 VoterLabs acknowledges that it registered the Axilient name in January 2019.  (D.I. 75 at 6)  Case 1:19-cv-00524-MAK   Document 103   Filed 10/19/20   Page 6 of 22 PageID #: <pageID>7 \n probability requirement at the pleading stage,” but instead “simply calls for  enough facts to raise \na reasonable expectation that discovery will reveal evidence of [the necessary element].”  \nPhillips v. Cty. of Allegheny , 515 F.3d 224, 234 (3d Cir. 2008) (quoting Twombly , 550 U.S. at \n556).  The court’s analysis is a context -specifi c task requiring the court “to draw on its judicial \nexperience and common sense.”  Iqbal , 556 U.S. at 679. \nb. Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 15  and 16 \nRule 15(a)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides that after a responsive \npleading has been f iled, a party may amend its pleading “only with the opposing party’s written \nconsent or the court’s leave,” and “[t]he court should freely give leave when justice so requires.” \nFed. R. Civ. P. 15(a)(2).  The decision to grant or deny leave to amend lies wi thin the discretion \nof the court.  See Foman v. Davis , 371 U.S. 178, 182 (1962); In re Burlington Coat Factory Secs. \nLitig. , 114 F.3d 1410, 1434 (3d Cir. 1997).  The Third Circuit has adopted a liberal approach to \nthe amendment of pleadings. See Dole v. Ar co Chem. Co., 921 F.2d 484, 487 (3d Cir. 1990).  In \nthe absence of undue delay, bad faith, or dilatory motives on the part of the moving party, the \namendment should be freely granted, unless it is futile or unfairly prejudicial to the non- moving \nparty.  Se e Foman , 371 U.S. at 182; In re Burlington, 114 F.3d at 1434.   \nIf a party seeks leave to amend after a deadline imposed by the scheduling order, the \ncourt must apply Rule 16 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  See WebXchange Inc. v. Dell \nInc., C.A. No.08- 132-JJF, 2010 WL 256547, at *2 (D. Del. Jan. 20, 2010).  A court -ordered \nschedule “may be modified only for good cause and with the judge’s consent.”   Fed. R. Civ. P. \n16(b)(4).  “The good cause element requires the movant to demonstrate that, despit e diligence, \nthe proposed claims could not have been reasonably sought in a timely manner.”  Venetec Int’l , \nInc. v. Nexus Med. , LLC , 541 F. Supp. 2d 612, 618 (D. Del. 2008).  The focus of the “good Case 1:19-cv-00524-MAK   Document 103   Filed 10/19/20   Page 7 of 22 PageID #: <pageID>8 \n cause” inquiry is, therefore, on diligence of the moving party, rather than on prejudice, futility, \nbad faith, or any of the other Rule 15 factors.  See Glaxosmithkline LLC v. Glenma rk Pharms. \nInc., C.A. No. 14- 877-LPS-CJB, 2016 WL 7319670, at *1 (D. Del. Dec. 15, 2016).  Only after \nhaving found the requisite showing of good cause will the court consider whether the proposed \namended pleading meets the Rule 15(a) standard.  See E. Minerals & Chems. Co. v. Mahan, 225 \nF.3d 330, 340 (3d Cir. 2000).   \nIV. DISCUSSION  \na. Partial m otion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6)  \ni. Well pleaded factual allegations  \nEthos  argues that the court should dismiss VoterLabs ’ malicious breach of contract claim \nbecause VoterLabs failed to plead  Ethos’ willful or malicious conduct .  (D.I. 60 at 5, 9–12)   Both \nparties cite  Ripsom v. Beaver Blacktop, Inc. , 1988 WL 32071 (Del. Super. Ct. Apr. 26, 1988), \naff’d  567 A.2d 418 (Del. 1989) to articulate the contours of malicious breach of contract.  (D.I. \n60 at 9–12; D.I. 63 at 6– 10; D.I. 66 at 2)  Ripsom provides a standard that a plaintiff must meet \nto reco ver punitive damages in a breach of contract action.  See id.  at *18.  “ [T]o recover \npunitive damages in a breach of contract action , the plaintiff must show that the defendant acted \nmaliciously and without probabl [e] cause for the purpose of injuring the other party by depriving \nhim of the benefits of the contract.”   Id.; see also Gillenardo v. Connor Broad. Del. Co., 2002 \nWL 991110, at *11 (Del. Super. Ct. Apr. 30, 2002) (articulating the proper legal standard for a \npunitive damage award in a breach of contract action).   \nIn the original complaint, VoterLabs styled Count III as an intentional tort claim for \n“Malicious Conduct in Aid of an Oppressive Scheme.”  (D.I. 2 at ¶¶ 129–30)  The court \ndismissed  the claim because “no such cause of action exists” and because the origin al complaint Case 1:19-cv-00524-MAK   Document 103   Filed 10/19/20   Page 8 of 22 PageID #: <pageID>9 \n did not contain “any factual allegations of [Ethos’]  willful or malicious conduct.”  VoterLabs , \n2019 WL 6120449, at *7, report and recommendation adopted, 2019 WL 6118014.  Count III of \nthe amended complaint is re styled “Malicious Breach of Co ntract.”  (D.I. 52 at ¶¶ 160–61)  \nUnlike the original complaint, the amended complaint  at Count III  contains approximately fifty \nparagraphs of detailed factual allegations , which are incorporated by reference , (D.I. 52 at ¶¶ \n107–53), describing the way in which Ethos “acted maliciously and without probabl[e] cause for \nthe purpose of injuring [VoterLabs]  by depriving [it] of the benefits of the contract.” 8  Ripsom , \n1988 WL 32071, at *18.  \nIn relevant part, the amended complaint alleges that o n May 21, 2018, Ethos delivered a \nnotice of termination to VoterLabs, and, under § 8.2 of the Services Agreement, the parties’ \ncontract formally terminated on July 20, 2020.  ( Id. at ¶¶ 96 –98)  Between the notice of \ntermination  date and actual termination date, Engagement Payment No. 5 be came due o n June 7, \n2018.  ( Id. at ¶ 111)  On May 30, 2018, an Ethos employee met with VoterLabs’ CEO to request \nthat, by the end of June 2018, VoterLabs reconfigure the software developed for Ethos such that \nit would be a standalone product, no longer reliant on VoterLabs’ data inputs.  ( Id. at ¶¶ 107 –08)  \nIn the subsequent weeks , VoterLabs  repeatedly  requested Ethos’ position on Engagement \nPayment No. 5.  ( Id. at ¶¶ 109–13)  The due date for Engagement Payment No. 5 eventually \npassed, but Ethos did not make any payment or make any other offer to pay VoterLabs.  ( Id. at ¶ \n111)  On June 25, 2018, VoterLabs delivered the standalone code Ethos  had requested.  ( Id. at ¶ \n \n8 Delaware courts recognize “prudential limitations” with respect to punitive damage awards for \nbreach of contract.  Ripsom v. Beaver Blacktop, Inc., 1988 WL 32071, at *17 (Del. Super. Ct. \nApr. 26, 1988) (quoting Reiver v. Murdoch & Walsh, P.A., 625 F. Supp. 998, 1015 (D. Del. \n1985)).  Punitive damages are not available: (1) “for breach[es] of contract involving mere \nnegligence,” (2) “when the breaching party reasonably believes that a meritorious defense exists \nfor its non- performance,” or (3) “when a breac h of contract, though intentional, is not similar in \ncharacter to an intentional tort.”  See id.  Case 1:19-cv-00524-MAK   Document 103   Filed 10/19/20   Page 9 of 22 PageID #: <pageID>10 \n 113)  On or about June 25, 2018, Ethos told VoterLabs ’ CEO that it would not accept the \nstandalone software because  of Ethos’ “change in focus.”  ( Id. at ¶ 115)  The parties began \ndiscussing the termination payment due to VoterLabs and reviewed  the negotiation history of the \ntermination  payment provision.  ( Id. at ¶¶ 117–20 )   \nOn July 13, 2018, the parties held a telephone call to discuss  their status.  ( Id. at ¶¶ 118, \n131–32)  Around that same time, Ethos proposed a “Release Agreement” and a “Patent License.”  \n(Id. at ¶ 126)  Under Ethos’ proposal, VoterLabs would release all past, present, and future \nclaims against Ethos and grant Ethos a perpetual, irrevocable , and royalty- free license to use \nVoterLabs’ patents.  ( Id.)  In exchange, VoterLabs would receive one  payment of $200,000, \nroughly the same amount E thos was already obligated to pay VoterLabs for Engagement \nPayment No. 5.  ( Id. at ¶¶ 126, 131)           \nThe amended complaint further alleges that when VoterLabs disagreed with Ethos’ \nposition on the call, Ethos proffered a meritless rationale for withholding Engagement Payment \nNo. 5 as follows : Under the Engagement Payment schedule, Engagement Payment No. 5 became \ndue 90 days after VoterLabs’ receipt of Engagement Payment No. 4.  Ethos paid Engagement \nPayment No. 4 on April 26, 2018, which was over a month late .  As a result, Engagement \nPayment No. 5 became payable on July 25, 2018, which is 90 days after April 26, 2018, and after \nthe effective termination date of July 20, 2018.  Therefore, Ethos  argued, it  had no obligation to \nmake Engagement Payment No. 5 because the payment  became due after the effective \ntermination date.  ( Id. at ¶¶ 134–49)   Ethos repeated this rationale in a meeting between the \nparties on August 22, 2018.  ( Id. at ¶¶ 14 1–44 ) \nDespite knowing this rationale was  legally meritless  and a  pretext  to exploit VoterLabs’ \nvulnerable position, Ethos  never gave an alternative basis for withholding Engagement Payment Case 1:19-cv-00524-MAK   Document 103   Filed 10/19/20   Page 10 of 22 PageID #: <pageID>11 \n No. 5.  ( Id. at ¶¶ 137–38, 150)   The amended complaint alleges that Ethos  withheld Engagement \nPayment No. 5 for a “phony reason”  as leverage to force VoterLabs to (1) release Ethos from the \ntermination payment obligation , a lawful  benefit of the contract due to VoterLabs, and (2) grant \nEthos a free license to u se VoterLabs’ intellectual property .  (Id. at ¶¶ 121 –26)  The amended \ncomplaint specifically states that Ethos knew withholding Engagement Payment No. 5 placed \nVoterLabs’ survival in jeopardy.  ( Id. at ¶¶ 110, 123)   Accepted as true, the se allegations state \nthat Ethos  “acted maliciously and without probabl [e] cause” to exploit VoterLabs’ vulnerab le \nposition “for the purpose of injuring” VoterLabs by “depriving [it] of the benefits of the \ncontract.”  See Ripsom , 1988 WL 32071, at *18.  \nEthos  argues the allegations describing Ethos’ malice relate to events that occurred after \nEthos provided notice of termination on May 21, 2018, and after June 7, 2018, when VoterLabs \ncontends Engagement Payment No. 5 was due.  (D.I. 60 at 10–11)  On May 25, 2018, in \nreference to upcoming negotiations with VoterLabs, Ethos employees exchanged an email that \nsaid “I’ll be ready” next to a picture of a character from the television show  The Walking Dead  \nwho is  shown holding a baseball bat  over his shoulder .  (D.I. 52 at ¶ ¶ 129–30)  Although the \nemail was sent soon aft er Ethos provided the notice of termination, the email was sent befor e \nEngagement Payment No. 5 be came due and while the parties were still discussing the \ntermination payment.  ( Id. at ¶¶ 96 –129)   Construing all reasonable inferences in VoterLabs’ \nfavor , which the court must do at the pleading stage, the email  demonstrate s Ethos’ “ill- will, \nhatred or intent to cause injury” to VoterLabs.  See Ripsom , 1988 WL 32071, at *16; see also \nUmland , 542 F.3d a t 64.   \nEthos’ arguments challenge the facts underlying the allegations in the amended \ncomplaint , which is not appropriate on a motion to dismiss.  See Umland, 542 F.3d at 64.  Ethos Case 1:19-cv-00524-MAK   Document 103   Filed 10/19/20   Page 11 of 22 PageID #: <pageID>12 \n argues the factual allegations in the amended complaint “do not rise to t he level of malice.”  (D.I. \n60 at 10)  For example, Ethos characterizes its communication that a termination would be \nforthcoming unless VoterLabs agreed to amend their contract as a “common sense” attempt to \n“[s]top[] the economic bleeding,” not malice.  (D.I. 66 at 3)   Ethos also argues the factual \nallegations related to malicious breach in the amended complaint are “all conclusory.”   (D.I. 60 \nat 10)  Ethos’ argument fails because the amended complaint pleads factual allegations sufficient \nto state a caus e of action for malicious breach of contract .  (D.I. 52 at ¶¶ 107–53)   \nii. Contractual limitation on damages  \nEthos  further argues  that the court should dismiss VoterLabs’ malicious breach of \ncontract claim because the agreements at issue bar  VoterLabs from recovering punitive damages.  \n(D.I. 60 at 12 –14)  Section 11.3 of the Services  Agreement states that “[VoterLabs’] exclusive \nremedy f or [Ethos’] payment breach shall be its rights to damages equal to its earned but unpaid \nfees,” which, Ethos argues, prevents  VoterLabs  from recovering punitive damages resulting from \nEthos’ alleged payment breach.   (D.I. 60 at 12–13; D.I. 60, Ex. A at § 11.3)  In addition, Ethos \ncites § 10.3 of the Services  Agreement , a limitation of liability clause, which states that Ethos \ncannot  be liable to VoterLabs for “ special, indirect, incidental or consequential damages, or any \ndamages arising from the loss of us e, data or profits , whether based in contract, tort, negligence, \nstrict liability or otherwise, even if [Ethos] knew of the possibility thereof. ”  (D.I. 60 at 13; D.I. \n60, Ex. A at § 10.3)    In response, VoterLabs argues § 10.3 and § 11.3 cannot be enforced against \na claim for malicious breach of contract because such a claim is “akin to an intentional tort.”  \n(D.I. 63 at 10–13)  VoterLabs argues Ethos’ interpretation of the Services  Agreement is  \nunenforceable as a matter of public policy.  ( Id. at 12) Case 1:19-cv-00524-MAK   Document 103   Filed 10/19/20   Page 12 of 22 PageID #: <pageID>13 \n At the pleadings stage, the court cannot determine the nature and extent of damages \nallegedly recoverable under the contract.  See Winfield v. Eloxx Pharms., Inc., C.A. No. 19- 447-\nRGA, 2020 WL 1333008 , at *1  (D. Del. Mar. 23, 2020) (“[I] ssues of contra ct interpretation \nraised by Defendants cannot be resolved against Plaintiff on a motion to dismiss .”).  Factual \ndisputes exist regarding the parties ’ interpretation of contractual provisions relating to damages.  \nSee Universal American Corp. v. Partners He althcare Sols. Holdings, L.P., C.A.

The \npleadings are sufficien t to allege a malicious breach of contract.  Whether the contract bars \npunitive damages is not before the court.  Moreover , several of the authorities Ethos relies on \nrelate to post -trial rulings, not the sufficiency of a pleading.  See, e.g., Enzo Life Sc is., Inc. v. \nAdipogen Corp., C.A. No. 11- 088-RGA, 82 F. Supp. 3d 568, 606–07 (D.

Therefore, the court recommends denying Ethos’ partial motion to dismiss.  \nb. Motion for leave to file an amended counterclaim under Rules 15 & 16  \nEthos moves to amend its counterclaim for breach of the contract for software \ndevelopment.  (D.I. 68)  The motion was filed on June 8, 2020, after the April 27, 2020 deadline \nfor amending pleadings.  ( Cf. D.I. 32 at ¶ 2; D.I. 68; D.I. 90 at ¶ 14)  Ethos di d not seek an \nextension of the deadline for amendment of the pleadings, despite its motion for continuance of \nother deadlines in the case schedule, which was granted by the court.  (D.I. 49;  07/16/20 Oral \nOrder;  D.I. 90)  Case 1:19-cv-00524-MAK   Document 103   Filed 10/19/20   Page 13 of 22 PageID #: <pageID>14 \n The proposed amendment seeks to add two counts based upon fraud and/or fraudulent \ninducement and negligent misrepresentation, in addition to the original counterclaim based upon \nbreach of contract.   (D.I. 68 -1 at ¶¶ 101 –15)  The amended counts detail an alleged fraud \nperpetrated by Voter Labs to secure a software development contract with Ethos so that \nVoter Labs would have the means to fund its own project known as “Axil ient” instead of \ndeveloping the software, known as “Neos Insight” for Ethos’ business.   ( Id. at ¶¶ 5 –11)  Neither \nthe Services  Agreement nor the SOW allowed VoterLabs to use money it received from Ethos \nfor projects other than Ethos’ projects.  ( Id. at ¶ 72)  Nevertheless, the amended counterclaim \nalleges VoterLabs did not dedicate a team to work  on Ethos’ project and siphoned Ethos’ money \naway for other projects.  ( Id. at ¶¶ 72 –73) \ni. Good Cause  \nThe amendment is necessitated by discovery that Ethos argues was not produced by \nVoter Labs until after deadlines in the case schedule expired for amending p leadings and \nconducting fact discovery.   (D.I. 32; D.I. 68)   Ethos highlights that it was “misled” by Voter Labs \nprior to commencement of the litigation and continuing afterwards when it was stymied in its \nefforts to obtain the correct code repository for t he source code representing Voter Labs’ work \nproduct on Ethos’ software.  (D.I. 68 at 2)  Namely, on November 1, 2018, Voter Labs provided \nEthos with a hard drive (the “November Hard Drive”) and represented that it contained the work \nproduct on Ethos’ softwa re.  (Id. at 3)  On Feb 21, 2020, Ethos served written discovery requests \non Voter Labs requesting, inter alia , information on how the hard drive was created.  ( Id. at 3–4)  \nImportantly, Ethos wanted to access the metadata to confirm its suspicions about when and how \nVoter Labs created the November Hard Drive  to allegedly conceal the deficiencies in its work on \nthe Ethos project.  ( Id. at 4)   On April 16, 2020, VoterLabs finally agreed to produce the Case 1:19-cv-00524-MAK   Document 103   Filed 10/19/20   Page 14 of 22 PageID #: <pageID>15 \n “GitHub”9 repository so that Ethos’ expert, Isaac  Pflaum  (“Mr. Pflaum”), could review the \nsource code in native format.   (Id.)  The delay allegedly necessitated the extension of discovery \ndeadlines in the case schedule, but no action was taken to extend the deadline for amendment of \npleadings , which expired on April 27, 2020.  ( Id.)   \nEthos submitted Mr. Pflaum’s declaration in support of and at the same time as its motion \nfor leave to amend.  (D.I. 68, Ex. D)  Mr. Pflaum declared that he received access to a GitHub \nrepository from Vot erLabs on May 1, 2020.  ( Id. at ¶ 20)  However, Mr. Pflaum averred that the \nGitHub repository produced did not include the code on the November Hard Drive .  (Id. at ¶¶ \n20–24)  Mr. Pflaum confirmed that “VoterLabs has not produced the repository wherein the  code \nin the November Hard Drive was created and undoubtedly altered.”  ( Id. at ¶ 21)  Mr. Pflaum \nopined that “VoterLabs created a separate repository at some unknown time in which to \nmanipulate the code provided on the November Hard Drive.”  ( Id. at ¶ 22)   According to \nVoterLabs, Ethos had not shared Mr. Pflaum’s declaration with VoterLabs before filing the \nmotion for leave to amend.  (D.I. 75 at 2)  On June 18, 2020, Ethos submitted a letter to the court \nwith a supplemental declaration by Mr. Pflaum.  (D. I. 69)  Mr. Pflaum’s supplemental \ndeclaration admits that he “was able to locate a version of the GitHub Code that matches the \ncode on the November Hard Drive . . . by reviewing emails produced by VoterLabs in this \nlitigation, performing a detailed review of the GitHub Code metadata, and performing multiple \ncomparisons of versions of the GitHub Code to the code on the November Hard Drive.”  (D.I. \n69, Ex. A at ¶ 5)  Mr. Pflaum’s supplemental declaration also indicates that he was aided in \ndiscovering the mat ching code by discussing the matter with a  VoterLabs  representative on June \n12, 2020.  ( Id. at ¶ 7)   Mr. Pflaum’s supplemental declaration claims that the manner in which \n \n9 GitHub is a “popular version control system used to track and store code.”  (D.I. 75 at 2)  Case 1:19-cv-00524-MAK   Document 103   Filed 10/19/20   Page 15 of 22 PageID #: <pageID>16 \n VoterLabs’ produced the GitHub repository “unnecessarily delayed and complicated an \notherwise simple exercise of identifying the delivered code in the [GitHub] repository.”  ( Id. at ¶ \n15)  VoterLabs disagree d with Mr. Pflaum’s initial declaration and continues to dispute the \nrevised assertions in Mr. Pflaum’s supplemental declaration.  (D.I. 75 at 2)  \nBetween May  8, 2020 and May 19, 2020, Voter Labs produced approximately 6,900 \ndocuments to Ethos.  (D.I. 68 at 5)  From that production, Mr. Pflaum located an email that \nsuggested a reference to source code that did not exist  in the GitHub repository.  ( D.I. 68 at 5)   \nFact discovery closed on June 1, 2020.  ( Id.; D.I. 32  at ¶ 3(a))  On June 15, 2020, VoterLabs \nproduced a thumb drive with the code Mr. Pflaum considered missing from earlier productions , \nan apparent discovery dispute  that was seemingly resolved when  the parties ’ respective experts \nmet and conferred after this motion was filed.  ( D.I. 69 at 2; D.I. 69, Ex. A  at ¶ 19)   Ethos also \nargues that Voter Labs withheld production of messages on “Slack” containing its internal \ncommunications during development of the software.  ( D.I. 68 at 6 –7)  In summary, Ethos \nargues that Voter Labs’ discovery deficiencies  made it “needlessly difficult” for Ethos ’ to access  \nsource code in a native format  accurately reflect ing Voter Labs’ development of the code \npurportedly captured by its previously produced “crawling tools .”  (D.I. 69 at 1; D.I. 68 at 7)   \nIn its answering brief  (D.I. 75) , however,  Voter Labs fail ed to addres s the standard for \ngood cause.10  See vMedex, Inc. v.

Good cause exists  for Ethos to amend its counterclaim to add \ncounts based upon fraud and negligent misrepresentation because it promptly sought leave to file \n \n10 The failure to address good cause demonstrates to the court that  the instant dispute would have \nbenefitted from a more effective met and confer process.

July 20, 2010) ( granting leave to amend where the defendant had filed \nits motion for leave within weeks of learning the information it sought to add to its plea dings ).   \nHaving found good cause exists for Ethos to amend its counterclaim, the court considers \nwhether the motion for leave to amend satisfies the requirements of Rule 15.  See Mahan, 225 \nF.3d at 340.  \nii. Undue Delay and Prejudice  \nEthos argues that granting its motion for leave to amend will not result in undue delay or \nprejudice because Ethos’ additional claims involve discovery that has already occurred and \ninformation  VoterLabs has possesse d since this litigation began .  (D.I. 68 at 10–12)   In response, \nVoterLabs argues Ethos’ motion for leave to amend amounts to one of many of the dilatory \nlitigation tactics Ethos has used to increase VoterLabs’ costs.  (D.I. 75 at 14 –15) \nPrejudice to the non- moving party occurs when “allowing the amended pleading would \n(1) require the non- moving party to expend significant additional resources to conduct discovery \nand prepare for trial, (2) significantly delay the resolution of the dispute , or (3) prevent [a party] \nfrom bringing a timely action in another jurisdiction.”  Intellectual Ventures I LLC v.

Delay alone is an insufficient reason to deny leave to \namend ; delay  must be coupled with undue prejudice to the non- moving party resulting from \ngranting a motion for leave to amend.  See Cureton v. Nat’l Collegiate Athletic Ass’n, 252 F.3d \n267, 273 (3d Cir. 2001)  (citing  Cornell & Co., Inc. v. Occupational Safety & Health Review \nComm'n. , 573 F.2d 820, 823 (3d Cir.1978) ).

Bechtel v. Robinson, 886 F.2d 644, 652 (3d Cir. 1989)  \n(internal quotations and citations omitted) .   \nVoterLabs fails to demonstrate that it will be “unfairly disadvantaged or deprived of the \nopport unity to present facts or evidence” if leave to amend is granted .  Id.  Since Ethos filed its \nmotion for leave to amend, the scheduling order has been amended, and the discovery cut off \ndate is now November 13, 2020.  (D.I. 90 at ¶ 3(a))  Ethos avers, and VoterLabs does not \ndispute, that no depositions had occurred before Ethos’ filed its motion for leave to amend.  (D.I. \n68 at 11)  Therefore, allowing Ethos’ amendment will not “result in additional  discovery, cost, \nand preparation to defend against new facts or new theories .”  See Cureton , 252 F.3d at 273 \n(emphasis added).   \niii. Futility11 \nFutility is the only basis upon which VoterLabs opposes Ethos’ motion for leave to \namend .  (D.I. 75 at 3–14)  The standard for assessing futility of amendment under Fed. R.  Civ. P. \n15(a) is the same standard of legal sufficiency applicable under Fed.  R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6).  Shane \nv. Fauver , 213 F.3d 113, 115 (3d Cir.2000).  Specifically, the am ended pleading must fail to \nstate a claim upon which relief could be granted even after the district court “tak[es] all pleaded \n \n11 As VoterLabs notes, Ethos’ proposed amended counterclaim states that “Ethos Consulting \nreceived and relied upon these representations in the State of Texas, and Ethos Consulting’s \nharm was felt in the State of Texas.”  (D.I. 68 -1 at ¶ 102 n.27)  VoterLabs argues Delaware law \napplies despite Ethos’ allegation that it had relied upon and felt the harm of VoterLabs’ \nrepresentations in Texas because the Services Agreement  contains a Delaware choice of law \nprovision.  (D.I. 75 at 6)  In its reply brief, Ethos does not dispute that Delaware law applies or \naffirmatively argue that Texas law applies.  (D.I. 81)  In addition, § 21 of the Services \nAgreement states: “This Agreement . . . and all matters arising out of or relating to this \nAgreement, whether sounding in contract, tort, or statute are governed by, and construed in \naccordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware.”  (D.I. 60, Ex. A at § 21)  However, choice \nof law d isputes, if any, are not ripe for decision by the court on this motion.

Anti -reliance clause in the NDA12 \nVoterLabs argues Ethos’ proposed amendment is futile because an anti -reliance clause in \nthe Confidentiality and Non- Disclosure Agreement (the “NDA”), which was incorporated into \nthe Services Agreement at issue in this litigation, bars Ethos’ fraud and negl igent \nmisrepresentation claims.  (D.I. 75 at 6–12)  In response, Ethos argues  that the Services \nAgreement does not incorporate the NDA and, in the alternative, that even if incorporated  into \nthe Services Agreement , the N DA does not bar the proposed amended counterclaims.  (D.I. 81 at \n5–8)  This is a purely factual dispute regarding contract interpretation.  See Winfield , 2020 WL \n1333008, at *1 (“[I] ssues of contract interpretation raised by Defendants cannot be resolved \nagainst Plaintiff on a motion to dismiss.”); Universal American , 61 F.Supp.3d at 400 \n(“[Q]uestions involv[ing]  disputed issues of fact and contract interpretation [are] not suitable to \nresolution on a motion to dismiss .”).  The well pleaded amended counterclaim is accepted as \ntrue.  See Winer  Family Trust , 503 F.3d at  331.  Whether Ethos will prevail on its claims upon its \ninterpretation of the various agreements remains to be litigated.  Voter Labs’ challenge to the \nproposed amended counterclaim’s factual averments and its interpretation of th e anti -reliance \nprovision contained in an earlier Confidentiality and Non- Disclosure Agreement , which \n \n12 The anti -reliance clause in the NDA states: “Each Party further agrees that it is not entitled to \nrely on the accuracy or completeness of the Confidential Information, and that it will only be \nentitled to rely on such representations and warranties as may be included in any definitive \nagreement with respect to any prospective business transaction, arrangement, and/or relationship, \nsubject to such limitations and restrictions as may be contained therein.”  (D.I. 76, Ex.

See Winfield , 2020 WL 1333008, at *1; \nUniversal American , 61 F.Supp.3d at 400. \n2. Alleged Bootstrapping  \nVoterLabs  also argues Ethos impermissibly “bootstrapped” fraud and negligent \nmisrepresentation counte rclaims to a  breach of contract counterclaim  and failed to allege distinct \ndamages resulting from VoterLabs’ fraud and negligent misrepresentation .  (D.I. 75 at 12–14)   \nDelaware law does “not permit a plaintiff to ‘ bootstrap’  a breach of contract claim int o a tort \nclaim merely by intoning the prima facie  elements of the tort while telling the story of the \ndefendant ’s failure to perform under the contract.”  Cornell Glasgow LLC v. La Grange Props. \nLLC, 2012 WL 2106945, at *8 (Del. Super. Ct. June 6, 2012)  (emphasis in original) (internal \ncitations omitted).  “ To be viable, the tort claim must involve violation of a duty which arises by \noperation of law and not by the mere agreement of the parties.”   Id. (internal  quotations and \ncitations omitted).  “[T]o successfully plead a fraud claim, the allegedly defrauded plaintiff must \nhave sustained damages as a result of a defendant ’s actions.”   Id. (internal citations omitted).  \n“And the damages allegations may not simply ‘ rehash ’ the damages allegedly caused by the \nbreach of contract. ”  Id.   \nHowever, “ the anti -bootstrapping rule does not apply where a plaintiff has made \nparticularized allegations that a seller knew contractual representations were false or lied \nregarding the contractual representation.”13  Swipe Acquisition Corp. v. Krauss , 2020 WL \n \n13 VoterLabs did not cite  Swipe Acquisition Corp. v. Krauss , 2020 WL 5015863, at *11 (Del. Ch. \nAug. 25, 2020) or any other authority stating the multiple ways, aside from the standard set forth  \nin Cornell Glasgow , by which a party may allege a cause of action for fraud alongside breach of \ncontract without violating the rule against bootstrapping.  (D.I. 75 at 12–14 )  Ethos’ reply brief \ndistinguishes Cornell Glasgow  without presenting more recent  authorities, like Swipe Case 1:19-cv-00524-MAK   Document 103   Filed 10/19/20   Page 20 of 22 PageID #: <pageID>21 \n 5015863, at *11 (Del.

(quoting Prairie Capital III, L.P. \nv. Double E Holding Corp., 132 A.3d 35, 62 (Del. Ch. 2015)).  The amended counterclaim  \ncontains several particularized allegations that VoterLabs lied about contractual representations  it \nknew were false.  (D.I. 68 -1 at ¶¶ 17–64)  For example, the amended counterclaim alleges that \nVoterLabs pitched Ethos on the idea that it woul d develop software for Ethos “at cost.”  ( Id. at ¶ \n25)  Despite this representation, VoterLabs charged Ethos $17,500 per month for a senior  \ndeveloper while knowing that a such a developer would cost  VoterLabs  only $6,000 per month.  \n(Id. at ¶ 25)   Accordin gly, Ethos’ proposed fraud counterclaim is  not impermissibly bootstrapped \nto its breach of contract counterclaim, and Ethos’ amended counterclaims are not futile.  \nTherefore, Ethos’ motion for leave to file an amended counterclaim is granted.   \nV. CONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons:  \n(1) The court recommends that Ethos’  motion to dismiss Count III of the amended \ncomplaint for failure to state a claim pursuant to  Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \n12(b)(6) be DENIED  (D.I. 59) .

June 29, 2022 \n I. Introduction \nPlaintiff Nuance Communications, Inc. (“Nuance”)  has filed this lawsuit against Defendant \nKathryn Kovalenko (“Kovalenko”), a former Nuan ce employee, for breach of contract arising \nfrom Kovalenko’s alleged violation of an em ployment agreement containing non-competition, \nnon-solicitation and confidentiality obligations to Nuance.  D. 1.  Nuance has now moved for a \ntemporary restraining order, D. 2, and a prelimin ary injunction, D. 29.  For the reasons stated \nbelow, the Court ALLOWS Nuance’s motion for a preliminary injunction, D. 29, and DENIES as \nmoot Nuance’s motion for a tempor ary restraining order, D. 2. \nII. Standard of Review \nAs to Nuance’s motion for preliminary inj unction, the Court must consider:  “[1] the \nmovant’s likelihood of success on the merits of its  claims; [2] whether and to what extent the \nmovant will suffer irreparable harm if the injuncti on is withheld; [3] the balance of hardships as \nbetween the parties; and [4] the effect, if any, that an injunction (or the withholding of one) may \nhave on the public interest .”  Corp. Techs., Inc. v. Harnett, 731 F.3d 6, 9 (1st Cir. 2013) (citing Case 1:22-cv-10656-DJC   Document 45   Filed 06/29/22   Page 1 of 222 Ross-Simons of Warwick, Inc. v. Baccarat, Inc., 102 F.3d 12, 15 (1st Cir. 1996)).  “Likelihood of \nsuccess [on the merits] is the main  bearing wall of [this] fram ework.”  Ross-Simons, 102 F.3d at \n16; Coquico, Inc. v. Rodríguez-Miranda, 562 F.3d 62, 66 (1st Cir. 2009) (sta ting that whether the \nmovant’s claim likely will succeed on the merits “normally weighs heaviest in the decisional \nscales”).   Irreparable harm, on the othe r hand, is measured “on a sliding scale, working in \nconjunction with a moving party’s likelihood of success on the merits, such that the strength of the \nshowing necessary on irreparable harm depends in part on the degree of likelihood of success \nshown.”  Gedeon v. City of Springfield, No. 16-cv-30054-MGM, 2017 WL 4212334, at *8 (D. \nMass. Feb. 24, 2017) (quoting Brai ntree Labs., Inc. v. Citigroup Global Mkts., Inc., 622 F.3d 36, \n42–43 (1st Cir. 2010)).   \nPreliminary injunctive relief is an “extraordina ry and drastic remedy.”  Voice of the Arab \nWorld, Inc. v. MDTV Med. News Now, Inc., 645 F.3d 26, 32 (1st Cir. 2011) (quoting Munaf v. \nGeren, 553 U.S. 674, 689–90 (2008)).  The plaintiff “bears the burde n of establishing that these \nfour factors weigh in its favor.”   Esso Standard Oil Co. (P.R.)  v. Monroig-Zayas, 445 F.3d 13, 18 \n(1st Cir. 2006) (cit ation omitted).   \nIII. Factual Background  \nThe following facts are drawn from Nuance’s comp laint, D. 1, the affidavits submitted in \nsupport of the motion for a temporary restraining or der, D. 4; D. 5; D. 6; D. 37; D. 41, the \ndeclarations submitted in support of Kova lenko’s opposition, D. 21; D. 22; D. 44, and \naccompanying exhibits.  \nA. Applications in the Radiology Field \nVirtually all radiologist s use five primary type s of radiology inform ation technology (“IT”) \napplications:  worklist, diagnostic viewer, repo rter, picture archiving communications systems, Case 1:22-cv-10656-DJC   Document 45   Filed 06/29/22   Page 2 of 223 and patient data portal.  D. 22 ¶ 4.  Relevant here, a “worklist” ap plication lists the images (e.g., \nX-rays, CT scans or MRIs) to be selected, revi ewed and interpreted by a radiologist during the \nworkday.  Id. ¶ 5.  A “diagnostic vi ewer” application is the interface used to display and review a \nparticular image.  Id.  A “reporter” application typically uses speech-to-text technology to convert \na radiologist’s oral findings made  during review of an image to a text report for the patient.  Id.  \nB. Nuance’s Business \nNuance is a worldwide leader in speech and ima ging solutions that offers several industry-\nleading products and services in  the healthcare industry, including in  the radiology field, such as \ndiagnostic imaging and workflow so lutions.  D. 1 ¶¶ 12–14; D. 4 ¶¶ 3–5.   \nNuance’s key products include the “Precisi on Imaging Network” (“PIN”), a radiology \ncloud platform powered by artificial  intelligence (“AI”) that uses AI  algorithms to deliver patient-\nspecific data and insights from diagnostic imag ing into existing clini cal and administrative \nworkflows across the healthcare ecosystem.  D. 1 ¶ 13; D. 4 ¶ 4.  PIN uses other parties’ algorithms \nand “resells” them, as opposed to  using algorithms developed by Nuan ce itself.  D. 21 ¶ 18; D. 22 \n¶¶ 15, 18.  PIN was previously known as “AI Marketplace.”  D. 1 ¶ 13; D. 4 ¶ 4.   \nNuance also offers a suite of products under the name “PowerScribe,” a radiology \nworkflow, reporting and communications platform th at allows radiologists to capture diagnostic \ninterpretations and share actionable information with  patient care teams.  D. 1 ¶ 14; D. 4 ¶ 5.  As \nKovalenko declares, PowerScribe is, “at its co re,” a “reporter.”  D. 21 ¶ 21 (describing \nPowerScribe as a “speech-to-t ext documentation product”). \nNuance’s business success depends in substa ntial part upon its deve lopment and ownership \nof certain trade secrets and confidential info rmation, including confidential sales strategies, \nexisting and prospective customer informati on, product information, strategies for product Case 1:22-cv-10656-DJC   Document 45   Filed 06/29/22   Page 3 of 224 integration, project management protocols and pro cesses, revenue forecasting processes, customer \nneeds, services histories and preferences, and pric ing and profit margin information.  D. 1 ¶ 18; \nD. 4 ¶ 9.  Nuance has spent years developing strategi es to market itself to key customers, including \ncompiling targeted, non-public, conf idential information, such as in formation regarding specific \ncustomer contacts and key stakeholders at eac h customer, pressures experienced by certain \ncustomers or prospects, and which competitors are vying for business.  D. 1 ¶ 19; D. 4 ¶ 10.  Nuance has also invested significant resour ces to developing, acquiring, maintaining and \nprotecting its confidential information, including  by restricting access to such information and \nrequiring employees to sign confidentiality agreements and other restrictive covenants.  D. 1 ¶ 20; D. 4 ¶ 11.   \nC. Sirona’s Business \nSirona Medical, Inc. (“Sirona”), Kovalenko’ s new employer, is a development-stage \ncompany that develops products and services intended to stream line radiology workflows using a \ncloud-based platform.  D. 1 ¶ 71;  D. 4 ¶ 17; D. 22 ¶¶ 4, 6.  Like Nuance, Sirona’s radiology \noperating system (“RadOS”) aims to “address[] the needs of toda y’s radiology practices with a \nnovel cloud-based platform that unifies radi ology IT applications—worklist, viewer and \nreporter—onto a single, streamlined Workspace. ”  D. 1 ¶¶ 71–72 (quoting Sirona’s website, which \nstates that RadOS provides radiol ogists with “AI-powered solutions that simplify their workflow \nand amplify their work product”); D. 4 ¶¶ 17–18 (same); see D. 22 ¶ 7.  RadOS purports to \n“unify[]” all the disparate systems into one seam less experience, resulti ng in radiology workflows \nthat are “streamlined and simplified.”  D. 1 ¶ 72; D. 4 ¶ 18.  Sirona claims that, “[w]ith a \nradiologist-centric user interface design, Sirona Wo rkspace combines [three ] disparate modules in \none:  a zero-footprint view er, a universal worklist, and a voice recognition reporter.”  D. 1 ¶ 72; Case 1:22-cv-10656-DJC   Document 45   Filed 06/29/22   Page 4 of 225 D. 4 ¶ 18.  Although Kovalenko does not identify Si rona as a competitor of Nuance, see D. 21 \n¶ 20, CB Insights, a third-party anal yst, lists Nuance as one of Si rona’s “top competitors,” D. 1 \n¶ 70; D. 4 ¶ 15.   \nAs Cameron Andrews (“Andrews”), Sirona’s fo under and chief executive officer, declares, \nSirona does not develop its  own reporter software but rather li censes such application from a third \nparty.  D. 22 ¶ 13.  For example, Sirona has a pproached Nuance about us ing its reporter technology \nas the speech-to-text foundation of Sirona’s produc t.  Id.  Andrews declar es that “Sirona has no \nintention of competing with Nuance’s speech-to-te xt product” as its “focus  is on an entirely new \nsoftware architecture for integrating commonly used  radiology IT applications.”  Id. ¶ 14 (stating \nthat “[a]t no time has Sirona ever  sold (or priced) reporting or wo rklist capabilities separately”). \nIn addition to developing a vi ewer, Sirona is developing it s own AI-powered algorithms \nfor integration into radiology workflows.  I d. ¶ 16.  In November 2021, Sirona announced a \npartnership with RevealDX, a software develope r focused on improving lung cancer outcomes.  \nD. 1 ¶ 74; D. 4 ¶ 20.  The partnership seeks to en able Sirona to integrat e RevealDX’s AI algorithm \ninto Sirona’s unified radiology pr ogram and allow radiologists mo re easily to imp lement the AI \nmodel into practice.  D. 1 ¶ 74; D. 4 ¶ 20.  In  February 2022, Sirona announced its acquisition of \nthe AI capabilities of a company called Nines, in cluding Nines’ clinical data pipeline, machine \nlearning engines, AI-powered radiology workflow management and analytics tools.  D. 1 ¶ 75; \nD. 4 ¶ 21.  Sirona also acquired two of Nines’ FDA-cleared medical devices:  “NinesMeasure, a \nlung nodule algorithm that leverages AI  to accelerate the diagnoses of certain respiratory diseases, \nand NinesAI Emergent Triage, a set of AI-powered algorithms that triages time-critical, life-\nthreatening indications of intr acranial hemorrhage a nd mass effect.”  D. 1 ¶ 75; D. 4 ¶ 21.  \nFollowing the Nines acquisition, Sir ona’s founder and CEO, Camer on Andrews, shared a post on Case 1:22-cv-10656-DJC   Document 45   Filed 06/29/22   Page 5 of 226 LinkedIn describing Sirona’s stra tegy of seeking “to solve the fragmented workflow challenge” \nby “integrating new AI algorithms,” i.e., “making it possible for all AI to be embedded deeply into \nthe clinical workflow for the very first time.”  D. 1 ¶ 76–77; D. 4 ¶ 22–23.   \nD. Kovalenko’s Employment at Nuance \nIn 2014, Nuance hired Kovalenko as a “Senior Pr oduct Analyst (Product Manager).”  D. 1 \n¶ 25; D. 4 ¶ 31; D. 5 ¶ 3.  In that role, she became Nuance’s leading expert on PowerScribe and \nwas responsible for executing PowerScribe’s st rategic direction.  See D. 1 ¶¶ 25–28; D. 4 ¶¶ 31–\n34; D. 21-1 at 2 (describing Kova lenko’s role in an internal an nouncement email as being “focused \non translating strategic roadmap dire ction for the PowerScribe . . . pl atform into a set of actionable \nuser stories and compelling feature requirements for engineering and other inte rnal stakeholders”).  \nKovalenko, for instance, led the deve lopment of the next-generation cl oud version of PowerScribe.  \nD. 1 ¶ 26; D. 4 ¶ 33.  Nuance later promoted Kovalenko several times within Nuance’s reporting line of business during her tenure with the company.  D. 21 ¶ 31. \nUntil mid-2021, Nuance’s teams responsible for PIN and the other diagnostic products, \nincluding PowerScribe, operated as  a single group under one set of leaders.  D. 4 ¶ 7.  In mid-2021, \nNuance split its PIN and PowerScribe teams an d moved Kovalenko from the integrated team \nworking with both product lines to the PIN team as “Director of Product Strategy, AI \nMarketplace.”  D. 1 ¶ 30; D. 4 ¶ 35; D. 5 ¶¶ 4– 6.  In that role, Kovalenko was responsible for \noverall product strategy for PIN, as well as for th e teams that oversaw the Nuance software that \nmanages the integration of imaging AI into Nuan ce’s PowerScribe products, i.e., how AI results \nwould get sent into workflow solutions.  D. 1 ¶¶ 30–33; D. 4 ¶¶ 35–37.  Kovalenko’s role exposed \nher to substantial confidentia l information, including Nuance’s marketing plans for products, \ninsights into customer needs and customer feed back, confidential product  roadmaps and pricing Case 1:22-cv-10656-DJC   Document 45   Filed 06/29/22   Page 6 of 227 data.  D. 1 ¶ 34; D. 4 ¶ 38; see D. 1-1 § 2 (d efining “Confidential Business Information” as \n“confidential, trade secret and/ or proprietary information of Nuance and/or its current and \nproposed customers and business pa rtners”).  Kovalenko’s role also  involved substantial customer \ninteraction and required that she m eet with customers, most often ra diologists, better to understand \nhow Nuance could translate customer needs into im proved products and services.  D. 1 ¶ 35; D. 4 \n¶ 39.  As part of these responsib ilities, Kovalenko led Nuance’s “voice of the customer” program \nto learn from customers and shape product improve ments.  D. 1 ¶ 36; D. 4 ¶ 40.  Kovalenko was \nrequired to understand technical aspects of ho w Nuance’s products affected its customers’ \nbusiness, as well as Nuance’s product roadmap in diagnostics.  D. 1 ¶ 38; D. 4 ¶ 42.  Kovalenko \ncontinued to work with the PowerScribe team an d interact with Nuance’s radiologist customers \nafter her formal tran sition to the PIN team.  D.  1 ¶ 39; D. 4 ¶ 43.  As Director of Product Strategy, \nAI Marketplace, Kovalenko’s salary was over $200,000.  D. 1 ¶ 29; D. 5 ¶ 6; D. 21 ¶ 32. \nE. The Agreement \nOn November 3, 2014, as a condition of her employment at Nuance , Kovalenko signed a \nConfidential Information, Inventions and Noncom petition Agreement (the “Agreement”).  D. 1 \n¶ 42; D. 5 ¶ 7; see D. 1-1.  Kovalenko acknowledged that she w ould “have access to, be entrusted \nor become acquainted with” confidential informati on relating to Nuance’s business and agreed to \nuse such information only “in the performance of [h er] duties for Nuance”  a nd not to disclose it.  \nD. 1 ¶¶ 44–45; D. 1-1 § 2.   \nKovalenko also acknowledged that agreeing not to  use or disclose Nuance’s confidential \ninformation after termination of her employment “would be inadequa te, standing alone, to protect \nNuance’s legitimate business interests” and that  “some activities . . . would, by their nature, \ncompromise such [confidential information] as well as [Nuance’s] goodwill and customer Case 1:22-cv-10656-DJC   Document 45   Filed 06/29/22   Page 7 of 228 relationships.”  D. 1 ¶ 47; D. 1-1 § 7.  Kovale nko, therefore, agreed to certain post-termination \nobligations.  See D. 1 ¶ 47; D. 1-1 § 7.  Specifi cally, in Section 7(a), Kovalenko agreed for one \nyear following termination of he r employment with Nuance (“Restricted Period”) not to “provide \nservices to a Competitor in any role or posi tion . . . that would invol ve Conflicting Business \nActivities.”   D. 1 ¶ 48; D. 1-1 § 7(a).  The Agreement defines “Competitor” as “an individual, \ncorporation, other business entity or  separately operated business un it of an entity that engages in \na Competing Line of Business,” and defines “Com peting Line of Business”  as “a business that \ninvolves a product or service offered or under devel opment . . . that would re place or compete with \nany product or service offered, to be offere d, or under development by Nuance with which \n[Kovalenko] had involvement while employed by Nu ance (unless Nuance is no longer engaged in \nor planning to engage in that line of business).”  D. 1 ¶ 49; D. 1-1 § 7(e).  The Agreement defines \n“Conflicting Business Activities” as “job duties or other business-related activities in the United \nStates or in any other country where Nuance does business, if such job duties or business-related \nactivities (i) are the same as or similar to the job duties or busin ess-related activities in which \n[Kovalenko] participate[s] while employed by Nu ance or (ii) otherwise could put Nuance’s \nConfidential Business Info rmation at risk.”  D. 1 ¶ 50; D. 1-1 § 7(e).   \nIn Section 7(b), Kovalenko agr eed that during the Restricted  Period she would not “(in \nperson or through assistance to others) knowingly participate in soliciting or communicating with \nany customer of Nuance in pursuit  of a Competing Line of Business if [she] either had business[-\n]related contact with that custom er or received Confidential Bu siness Information about that \ncustomer in the last two years of [her] employment at Nuance.”  D. 1 ¶ 51; D. 1-1 § 7(b).  \nKovalenko also agreed, in Section 7(c) and (d), that during the Restricted Period she would not \n“(in person or through assistance to others) kno wingly participate in so liciting or communicating Case 1:22-cv-10656-DJC   Document 45   Filed 06/29/22   Page 8 of 229 with” Nuance employees, partners , or suppliers for the purposes of persuading or helping those \nparties to end or reduce their relationship with Nuance.  D.  1 ¶ 52; D. 1-1 § 7(c)–(d). \nF. Kovalenko’s Resignation from Nuance \nIn late November 2021, Kovalenko announced he r resignation from Nuance.  D. 1 ¶ 62; \nD. 4 ¶ 50.  At the time, Kovalenko planned to join a company called IQVIA.  D. 1 ¶ 62; D. 4 ¶ 50; \nD. 21 ¶ 43; D. 21-4 at 2.  Nuance did not consider IQVIA to be a direct competitor and so did not \nseek to prevent Kovalenko from accepting her ne w role.  D. 1 ¶ 64; D. 4 ¶ 52.  Instead, Nuance \nasked Kovalenko to remain at Nuance for several w eeks as a transition period to which she agreed.  \nD. 1 ¶ 65; D. 4 ¶ 53.  Kovalenko’s last day with  Nuance was January 14, 2022.  D. 1 ¶ 67; D. 4 \n¶ 55; D. 5 ¶ 13.  In late Marc h, Nuance discovered that Kovalenko had begun working for Sirona, \nwhich Nuance alleges to be a competitor.  D. 1 ¶ 68; D. 4 ¶ 56; see D. 3 at 4–6, 17.  \nIV. Procedural History \nNuance commenced this action on May 2, 20 22, D. 1, and has moved for a temporary \nrestraining order, D. 2, and a preliminary inju nction, D. 29.  The Court heard the parties on May \n26, 2022, D. 42, on the pending motions and took the matters under advi sement.  D. 38.  The Court \nallowed post-hearing su pplemental filings, D. 40, which have  now been filed, D. 41, 44, and the \nCourt has considered them along w ith the parties’ other filings. \nV. Discussion \nA. Likelihood of Success on the Merits \n1. Massachusetts Law Applies \n \nAs a preliminary matter, Kova lenko disputes that Massachuse tts law applies here despite \nthe provision in the Agreement stating that it does.  See D.  20 at 19.  As a general rule, \nMassachusetts courts reviewing a breach of contra ct claim will give effect to a choice-of-law Case 1:22-cv-10656-DJC   Document 45   Filed 06/29/22   Page 9 of 2210 clause included in the contract.  Morris v. Wa tsco, Inc., 385 Mass. 672, 674 (1982).  Section 13 of \nthe Agreement provides that Massachusetts law governs.  D. 1 ¶ 59; D. 1-1 § 13.  Although \nKovalenko argues that she never lived in Massac husetts during her years- long tenure at Nuance, \nD. 20 at 19, such is insufficient to show that a pplication of Massachusetts  law here would violate \npublic policy of a state with a “materially greate r interest” than Massac husetts and which would \n“be the state of the applicable law in the absence of an effective choice of  law by the parties,” as \nshe must to defeat the Agr eement’s choice-of-law provision.1  See Shipley Co. v. Clark, 728 F. \nSupp. 818, 825 (D. Mass. 1990) (quoting Rest. (Second) of Conflict of Laws § 187(2)(b) (1971)).  \nAccordingly, Massachuse tts law governs here. \n2. The Agreement is Valid and Enforceable \n \nUnder Massachusetts law, “a restrictive covenant  is only reasonable, and thus enforceable, \nif it is (1) necessary to protect a legitimate bus iness interest, (2) reasonably limited in time and \nspace, and (3) consonant with the public intere st.”  Automile Holdings, LLC v. McGovern, 483 \nMass. 797, 808 (2020).   \na) Necessary to Protect a Leg itimate Business Interest \n \nIn the employment context, legitimate bus iness interests that may be protected by \nrestrictive covenants incl ude trade secrets, confidential in formation and good wi ll.  Id. at 810.  \nHere, Nuance argues the Agreement is necessary to protect all these interest s.  D. 3 at 14–15; see \nD. 1 ¶ 18–20 (describing how Nuance’s busines s success relies upon significant investment in \ndeveloping, owning and maintaini ng trade secrets and other conf idential informa tion, including \n \n1 Kovalenko’s argument that California law shoul d govern fails.  See D. 20 at 19; D. 36 at \n9–11.  While Kovalenko lived in either Connecticut or New Ha mpshire during her tenure at \nNuance, D. 21 ¶ 27, Nuance is a Massachusetts-based company, D. 1 ¶ 6.  Nothing in the record reflects California having a materially greater interest than Massachusetts in this dispute. Case 1:22-cv-10656-DJC   Document 45   Filed 06/29/22   Page 10 of 2211 strategic plans, product pricing data and revenue forecasts, a nd non-public information about \ncustomers and prospects); D. 4 ¶¶ 9–11 (same) ; see D. 1-1 § 7 (acknowledging that the \nAgreement’s restrictive covenants “are reasonable , necessary and enforceabl e to protect Nuance’s \nConfidential Business Information, . . . good will, and other legitimate bus iness interests”).   \nKovalenko responds that Nuance has filed to identify any purported trade secret with \nspecificity.  D. 20 at 13–16.  Th e cases Kovalenko cites in suppor t of this argument, however, \ninvolve claims of trade secret  misappropriation.  See id.  K ovalenko presents no authority to \nsupport that where, as here, a plaintiff asserts breach  of contract as to a restrictive covenant, as \nopposed to a trade secret misappropr iation claim, it must identify an y purported trade secret with \nspecificity.  Moreover, Nuance has, at minimum, s hown that the restrictive covenants at issue are \ndesigned to protect confidential in formation, which constitutes a legi timate business interest.  The \nAgreement defines “Confidential Business Informati on” more broadly than trade secrets; i.e., \ndefining it as “confidential, trade secret and/or pr oprietary information of Nuance and/or its current \nand proposed customers and business partners.”  D. 1-1 § 2.  As Senior Product Analyst (Product \nManager), Kovalenko was “primarily responsible for executing Nuance’s strategic direction for \nits PowerScribe suite of products, and was consid ered Nuance’s main expe rt on PowerScribe.”  \nD. 4 ¶ 31; see D. 1 ¶¶ 25–28.  In her role as Director of Product Stra tegy, AI Marketplace, \nKovalenko was exposed to “Nuance’s marketing plan s for products, insights into customer needs \nand customer feedback, confidentia l product roadmaps, pricing, and more.”  D. 1 ¶ 34; D. 4 ¶ 38.  \nFor example, Kovalenko’s role required her “to u nderstand the technical aspects of how Nuance’s \nproducts affected [a] customer’s business,” i.e., “performance measur ement, return on investment \ntargets, and financial plan, including revenue for ecasting and attainment.”  D. 1 ¶ 38; D. 4 ¶ 42.  \nAs part of these responsibilities,  Kovalenko led Nuance’s “voice of the customer” program to learn Case 1:22-cv-10656-DJC   Document 45   Filed 06/29/22   Page 11 of 2212 from customers and shape product im provements.  D. 1 ¶ 36; D. 4 ¶ 40.  Such provided her with \n“critical, in-depth knowledge of key Nuance clients’ needs for ne xt-gen reporting solutions, how \nimaging AI should be integrated into the radiolo gy reporting workflow and worklist, and more.”  \nD. 1 ¶ 36; D. 4 ¶ 40.   \nFurther, although Kovalenko argues that she “has been and will be in no position to impact \nany goodwill of Nuance’s in her work at Sirona” b ecause Sirona currently has no “customers” and \nher job is not customer facing, D. 20 at 17, K ovalenko’s mere “associati on with [a] competing \nproduct would be enough to raise doubts in the eyes  of [Nuance’s] customers as to the relative \nvalue of [Nuance’s products],” given Kovalenko’s substantial cu stomer interaction while at \nNuance.  See Marcam Corp. v. Orchard, 885 F.  Supp. 294, 298 (D. Mass. 1995); D. 1 ¶ 35; D. 4 \n¶ 39.   \nAccordingly, Nuance has sufficiently shown th at the restrictive covenants at issue are \nnecessary to protect a legitimate business interest. \nb) Reasonably Limited in Time and Space \n \nA restrictive covenant “must be no more restri ctive than necessary.”  Boulanger v. Dunkin’ \nDonuts Inc., 442 Mass. 635, 643 (2004).  As to durati on, Massachusetts courts  consistently have \nheld that restricted periods of one year are reasonable.  See, e.g., Nat’l Eng’g Serv. Corp. v. \nGrogan, No. 071583, 2008 WL 442349, at *5 (Mass. S uper. Ct. Jan. 29, 2008); Advanced Cable \nTies, Inc. v. Hewes, No. 061995B, 2006 WL 3292810, at *2 (Mass. Super. Ct. Oct. 19, 2006) \n(concluding that one-year period was “well within the umbrella of reasonableness for employment \ncontracts”).  Massachusetts courts have upheld  significantly longer time  restrictions.  See \nBlackwell v. E.M. Helides, Jr.,  Inc., 368 Mass. 225, 229 (1975) ( upholding three-year restriction \non real estate salesman from engaging in real es tate and brokerage busine ss within defined area); Case 1:22-cv-10656-DJC   Document 45   Filed 06/29/22   Page 12 of 2213 All Stainless, Inc. v. Colby, 364 Mass. 773, 779 (1974) (upholding two- year restriction on \nsalesman of stainless-steel fasteners in New England and New York).  Thus, the Agreement’s \nRestricted Period of one year, see D. 1 ¶ 48; D. 1-1 § 7, is reasonable in duration. \nAs to geographic scope, “[a] ge ographic restriction is reasonable  as long as it restricts a \nformer employee from doing business in an area in  which the company itself conducts business.”  \nMarcam Corp., 885 F. Supp. at 299 (citing Kr oeger v. Stop & Shop, 13  Mass. App. Ct. 310, 317 \n(1982)).  Here, while the Agreement does not specify any geographic limitation, Kovalenko’s \nresponsibilities at Nuance were not  geographically limited, see generally  D. 1; D. 4; D. 21; D. 22, \nas Nuance conducts business on a wi de scale.  See D. 1 ¶ 12; see also D. 3 at 16 (stating that \n“Nuance conducts business throughout the United St ates and markets the PowerScribe [s]uite and \nPIN technology around the country”).  Nationwide enforcement of the Agreement is, therefore, \nreasonable.  See Advanced Cable Ties, In c. v. Hewes, No. 061995B, 2006 WL 3292810, at *2 \n(Mass. Super. Ct. Oct. 19, 2006) (concluding that  lack of geographical limitation to future \nemployment did not bar nationwide enforcement of restrictive covena nt by national manufacturer); \nsee also Lombard Med. Techs., Inc. v. Joha nnessen, 729 F. Supp. 2d 432, 439–40 (D. Mass. 2010) \n(concluding that nationwide geographic area was reasonable  where plaintif f did business \nthroughout the United States); Rentex, In c. v. Franco, No. 1884CV01946, 2018 WL 4309330, at \n*4 (Mass. Super. Ct. July 16, 2018) (same); Anaqua, Inc. v.  Bullard, No. SUCV201401491BLS1, \n2014 WL 10542986, at *5 (Mass. Super. Ct. July  24, 2014), aff’d, 88 Mass. App. Ct. 1103 (2015) \n(stating that “[i]n the era of global commerce, a worldwide re striction is not necessarily \nunreasonable” (collecting cases)). \nc) Consonant with the Public Interest \n \n“The public has an interest in the enforcem ent of valid contracts,” Lombard Med. Techs., Case 1:22-cv-10656-DJC   Document 45   Filed 06/29/22   Page 13 of 2214 729 F. Supp. 2d at 443, including re asonable restrictive covenants in employment contracts, see \nBoulanger, 442 Mass. at 646 (rejecting that a covena nt not to compete harmed the public interest \nin liberty of employment); see Corp. Techs., Inc. v. Harnett, 943 F. Supp. 2d 233, 245 (D. Mass. \n2013), aff’d, 731 F.3d 6 (1st Cir. 2013) (noting th at “[a]s a matter of l ong-standing Massachusetts \ncase law, it is ‘beneficia l to the public that contracts for the partial restraint of trade should be \nupheld to a reasonable extent’” (quoting New En gland Tree Expert Co. v. Russell, 306 Mass. 504, \n508–09 (1940)).  Here, the Agreement does not prevent Kovalenko from working but only from \n“provid[ing] services to a Comp etitor . . . that would involve C onflicting Business Activities.”   \nD. 1 ¶ 48; D. 1-1 § 7(a).  Enforcement of such provision is consistent with the public interest. \nd) Material Change in Employment Relationship \n \nKovalenko argues that her employment relations hip with Nuance materially changed such \nthat the Agreement did not remain valid and en forceable by the time of her resignation from \nNuance in January 2022.  D. 20 at 18–19.  “It is well-settled under Massachus etts law that ‘[e]ach \ntime an employee’s employment relationship with the employer changes materially such that they \nhave entered into a new employmen t relationship a new restrictive covenant must be signed.’”  \nIron Mountain Info. Mgmt., Inc. v. Taddeo, 455 F. Supp. 2d 124, 132–33 (E.D.N.Y. 2006) (quoting \nLycos, Inc. v. Jackson, No. 20043009, 2004 WL 2341335, at *3 (Mass. Super. Ct. Aug. 25, 2004)) \n(applying Massachusetts law).  The Supreme Judicial  Court articulated this principle in F. A. \nBartlett Tree Expert Co. v. Ba rrington, 353 Mass. 585 (1968), which concluded that a restrictive \ncovenant was unenforceable becaus e substantial changes to the defendant’s rate of compensation \nand sales area indicated that the parties had “ab andoned their old arrangemen t and had entered into \na new relationship” rendering the previous restrict ive covenant inapplicable.  Id. at 587.  The key \nissue in this regard is “whether the employm ent agreement had been ‘mutually abandoned and Case 1:22-cv-10656-DJC   Document 45   Filed 06/29/22   Page 14 of 2215 rescinded,’” which depends upon the intention of the parties.  Astro-Med, Inc. v. Nihon Kohden \nAm., Inc., 591 F.3d 1, 16 (1st Cir. 2009) (quoting Intertek Testing Se rvs. NA, Inc. v. Curtis-Strauss \nLLC, No. 98903F, 2000 WL 1473126, at *6 (Mass. Supe r. Ct. Aug. 8, 2000)).  In determining \nwhether a material change occurred, courts cons ider whether the parties signed a new agreement \nand, if so, whether the agreement references the ol d agreement, whether there have been material \nchanges in compensation, and wh ether the employee’s job descri ption and dutie s materially \nchanged.   See Iron Mountain, 455 F. Supp. 2d at  133–37; AFC Cable Sys. Inc. v. Clisham, 62 F. \nSupp. 2d 167, 173 (D. Mass. 1999).   \nHere, although Kovalenko’s dut ies and compensation changed over her tenure at Nuance, \nthere is no indication that the parties mutually abandoned and re scinded the Agreement due to \nKovalenko’s promotions, especially  in light of the Agreement’s provision stating that Kovalenko’s \nobligations thereunder would “continue in accord ance with its express terms regardless of any \nchanges in [her] title, position, duties, geographi c location, salary, compen sation or benefits or \nother terms and conditions of empl oyment.”  See D. 1 ¶ 58; D. 1-1 § 11; A.R.S. Servs., Inc. v. \nMorse, No. MICV201300910, 2013 WL 2152181, at *9 (Mass.  Super. Ct. Apr. 5, 2013) (enforcing \nsimilar clause as eviden ce that “the parties understood that the [a]greement was intended to be \nenforceable notwithstanding a potential change in employment responsibili ties”); see also Astro-\nMed, 591 F.3d at 16–17 (concluding that this doctrine did not apply where the employee’s job \nchange did “not reflect a mutu al abandonment and rescission of the non-competition provision,” \nthere was no suggestion that the employer approached the em ployee with a new employment \nagreement, and there was no evidence  of intent on the pa rt of either party to  revoke or superseded \nthe employment agreement).  Accordingly, the ma terial change doctrine does not bar enforcement \nof the Agreement. Case 1:22-cv-10656-DJC   Document 45   Filed 06/29/22   Page 15 of 2216 3. Nuance is Reasonable Likely to Succeed on Claim that Kovalenko \nBreached the Agreement as to the Non-Compete Provision \n \na) Non-Compete Provision \n \nNuance claims that Kovalenko has breached  the Agreement’s non-compete provision, \nD. 1-1 § 7(a), by accepting her employment at Sirona .  See D. 3 at 17.  As noted above, Kovalenko \nagreed for one year following termination of her em ployment with Nuance not  to “provide services \nto a Competitor in any role or pos ition . . . that would involve Conf licting Business Activities.”   \nD. 1 ¶ 48; D. 1-1 § 7(a).  Thus, given the definitions provided under Section 7(e) of the Agreement, \nNuance must make two showings:  first, that Sirona  is a “Competitor,” i.e., that Sirona engages in \na “Competing Line of Business,” na mely, “a business that involves a product or service offered or \nunder development . . . that would replace or compet e with any product or se rvice offered, to be \noffered, or under development by Nuance with which [Kovale nko] had involvement while \nemployed by Nuance”; and, second, that Kova lenko’s work with Sirona would involve \n“Conflicting Business Activities,” i.e., “job duties or other business-related activities” that “(i) are \nthe same as or similar to th e job duties or business-related activities in which [Kovalenko] \nparticipate[d] while employed by Nuance or (ii)  otherwise could put Nuance’s Confidential \nBusiness Information at risk.”  See D. 1 ¶¶ 48–50; D. 1-1 § 7(a), (e).   \nNuance contends that Sirona competes w ith Nuance as to its PIN and PowerScribe \nproducts.  D. 3 at 17.  First, Nu ance argues that Sirona seeks to address the needs of radiologists \nby integrating AI models into wo rkflows “just like Nuance” does wi th PIN.  Id. at 4–6 (arguing \nthat the companies overlap “in products aimed at  reporting solutions, work flow orchestration, and \nintegration of AI into radiology workflow”).  Kovalenko responds that Si rona is developing its \nown AI algorithm, while Nuance’s “PIN” acts as an “AI Marketplace” for “resell[ing]” other \ndevelopers’ algorithms.  D. 20 at 5, 7, 12; see D. 21 ¶ 18; D. 22 ¶ 15.  Moreover, Kovalenko Case 1:22-cv-10656-DJC   Document 45   Filed 06/29/22   Page 16 of 2217 submits that, during her time wo rking on PIN/AI Marketplace—incl uding as Nuance’s Director of \nProduct Strategy, AI Marketplace—Nuance viewed PIN’s largest competitors as AI algorithm \ndevelopers who were—or could become—“platform players,” as well as makers of “neutral AI \nplatforms,” D. 21 ¶ 20 (citing ex amples).  According to Kovalenko, “Sirona was not considered” \nby Nuance to be “competitive in this field.”  Id .  However, whether Nuan ce views Sirona as one \nof its “largest competitors” or even “competitive in this field”  does not settle whether Sirona \nconstitutes a “Competito r” under the Agreement.  Although Nu ance does not develop its own AI \nalgorithms, Nuance and Sirona’s products both seek to  integrate AI models in to radiology practices \nto simplify workflows across the healthcare ecosystem.  See D. 4 ¶¶ 4, 17 see also D. 1 ¶¶ 74–77 \n(describing Sirona’s efforts to expand AI capabilities); D. 4 ¶¶ 20–23 (same).  Thus, to the extent \na customer purchases RadOS, Sirona’s integrat ed radiology operating syst em, such would reduce \nthe customer’s incentive to purchase Nuance’s PIN product—regardless of whether Nuance \ndeveloped the underlying AI algorit hms itself or licensed them from a third party.  See Life Image, \nInc. v. Brown, No. SUCV201103764, 2011 WL 7443924, at *5 (Mass. Super. Ct. Dec. 22, 2011) \n(stating that an alleged competitor “does not need to manufacture iden tical products to be in direct \ncompetition with [plaintiff]; the customer will  purchase either product, but not both” and \nconcluding that former employ ee violated non-compete agreem ent where the firms at issue \n“compete[d] for the same customers”).   \nSecond, Nuance argues that PowerScribe compet es with Sirona becau se Sirona’s “entire \n. . . value proposition is that buying all of the di sparate systems separately . . . from multiple \nvendors is unnecessary and creates a suboptimal wo rkflow.”  D. 4 ¶ 26.  Thus, according to \nNuance, “[i]f a client were to buy a Sirona so lution, they would likely not buy a similar Nuance \nproduct,” since “the client would get similar fu nctionality from Sirona .”  Id. ¶ 25.  Kovalenko Case 1:22-cv-10656-DJC   Document 45   Filed 06/29/22   Page 17 of 2218 submits that Sirona “does not develop its own speech-to-text recognition software as part of its \nproduct” but rather “license s that application from a third party.”  D. 22 ¶ 13 (emphasis in original) \n(stating that “Sirona has on multiple occasions a pproached Nuance to try and use Nuance as the \nspeech-to-text foundation of its product”).  Further, according to Andrews, Sirona “has no intention of competing with Nuance’s speech-to-text  product, or to separate ly sell any particular \nworkflow application used by radiologists” and in stead is focused on deve loping a “new software \narchitecture for integra ting commonly used radiology IT applicat ions.”  Id. ¶ 14.  Such statements \nby Kovalenko and Andrews, however , fail to address Nuance’s core argument that RadOS seeks \nto provide substantial overlapp ing functionality to Nuance’s pr oducts, including PowerScribe.  \nSee, e.g., D. 4 ¶ 25; D. 36 at 3.  As with PIN, to the extent a customer  purchases RadOS, which \nincludes reporting functionality, such would reduce the customer’s incentive to purchase Nuance’s \nPowerScribe product—regardless of whether Sirona developed the reporting functionality itself or \nlicensed it from a third party. \nKovalenko does not deny that RadOS would offe r the same reporting functionality as \nPowerScribe; instead, she offers evidence that diagnostic viewers with reporting capabilities are \nnot thought to be competitive in the speech-to-text space.  See D. 21 ¶ 24 (citing list compiled by \nindependent third-party IT review  organization of best  reporting solutions as not including any \nviewers with reporting capabilitie s); see also id. ¶¶ 21–23 (stating that, according to Kovalenko’s \nunderstanding, Nuance “has something like an 80% market share in this field, even though many \ncurrent viewers in the marketplace  also offer reporting capabilit y,” and that “viewer companies \noften have reporting capability, but radiologists nonethel ess still use PowerScribe as a reporter for \ntheir needs”).  Such ar gument, however, fails to detract fro m Nuance’s allegations supporting that \nSirona’s product constitutes “a product or servic e offered or under development . . . that would Case 1:22-cv-10656-DJC   Document 45   Filed 06/29/22   Page 18 of 2219 replace or compete with any product or service offered, to be offered, or under development by \nNuance with which [Kovalenko] had involvement while employed by Nuance.”  See D. 1 ¶ 49; \nD. 1-1 § 7(e).  In other words, that Nuance enjo ys a dominant market shar e for reporters does not \nmean that RadOS, which incl udes reporting functionality, w ould not compete with Nuance’s \nreporting product. \nAs to whether Kovalenko’s work with Siro na would involve “Conflicting Business \nActivities,” Nuance argues that Kovalenko is “likel y to utilize confidential technical, marketing, \nand customer information in her new job,” given the overlap between  the two companies.  D. 3 at \n17–18.  Considering the above analysis regarding the co mpanies’ overlapping product \nfunctionalities, Nuance has satisfied its burden— for purposes of showing a reasonable likelihood \nof a breach of the non-compete provision—to show  that Kovalenko’s work with Sirona likely \nwould involve “job duties or other business-re lated activities” that “could put Nuance’s \nConfidential Business Information at  risk.”  See D. 1 ¶ 50; D. 1-1 § 7(e); D. 21 ¶ 7 (declaring that \nKovalenko’s current title at Sirona  is “VP, Product”); D. 37 ¶ 16 (stating that, “[b]ased on the \ndeclarations provided by Andrew s and Kovalenko, it appears that [Kovalenko] is responsible for \nleading Sirona’s product development team”).2 \n \n2 Following the motion hearing, D. 38, Nuance s ubmitted a job descript ion for the role of \n“Vice President, Product” at Sirona—the sa me position Kovalenko now holds—that a Nuance \nemployee received from a recruiter on LinkedIn in October 2021.  D.  41.  That document describes \nthe role’s general responsibiliti es as “working collaboratively to develop and ensure the successful \nexecution of Sirona’s product development roadma p,” “lead[ing] the strate gy for existing products \nand identify[ing] new product opportunities for [Sirona ].”  Id. at 7–8.  It also listed specific \nresponsibilities such as “ensurin g effective cross-functional collabo ration and strategy execution \nwith Sales, Marketing, Customer Support, R&D, Qu ality/Regulatory, and Finance.”  Id. at 8.  \nKovalenko and Andrews declare in response that the job descripti on was drafted by the recruiter \nto capture as many qualified candidates as possi ble and, therefore, does not accurately capture \nwhat Kovalenko does in her role at Sirona.  See D. 44-1 at ¶¶ 1, 3; D. 44-3 at ¶ 3.  Further, \naccording to Kovalenko and Andrews, Sirona has reorganized its leadership team since the \ndescription was drafted, such that indivi duals other than Kovalenko handle many of the Case 1:22-cv-10656-DJC   Document 45   Filed 06/29/22   Page 19 of 2220 Accordingly, Nuance has shown a likelihood of  success on the merits on its breach of \ncontract claim as to the non-compete provision.3 \nB. Irreparable Harm \n \n“To establish irreparable harm . . . a plaintiff need not dem onstrate that the denial of \ninjunctive relief will be fatal to its business.”  Ross-Simons, 102 F.3d at 18 (citing General \nLeaseways, Inc. v. National Truck Leasing Ass’n, 744 F.2d 588, 591 (7th Cir. 1984)).  “It is usually \nenough if the plaintiff show s that its legal remedies are inadequa te.”  Id.  “Massachusetts courts \nhave generally recognized, in the co ntext of restrictive covenants, that the ‘task of  quantifying the \nconsequences of violating a non-competition clause is a particularly difficult and elusive one.’”  Oxford Glob. Res., Inc. v. Guerriero, No. 03-cv-12078-DPW, 2003 WL 23112398, at *11 \n(D. Mass. Dec. 30, 2003) (quoting Kroeger, 13 Mass.  App. Ct. at 322); see, e.g., New Eng. Circuit \nSale v. Randall, No. 96-cv-10840, 1996 WL 1171929, at  *1 (D. Mass. June 4, 1996) (stating that \n“it would be almost impossible to measure the plaintiff's damage if  the defendant is allowed to go \nto work for a competitor”). \n \nresponsibilities listed in  the description. See id. ¶ 4; D. 44- 3 ¶ 6.  Regardless of how accurately \nthat document describes Kovalenko’s specif ic responsibilities, Kovalenko and Andrews’s \narguments fail to rebut that K ovalenko’s work with Sirona like ly involves “Conflicting Business \nActivities” under the Agreement.  First, K ovalenko and Andrews do not deny that the job \ndescription reflects Kovalenko’s general responsibil ities as “VP, Product.”  See generally D. 44.  \nSecond, while Kovalenko asserts that she has “descr ibed what [she] actually  do[es] at Sirona to \nthe Court,” D. 44-1 ¶ 2 (emphasis omitted); D. 21 ¶ 7, such description, if anything, supports  that \nKovalenko’s job at Sirona likely involves “job duties or other bus iness-related activities” that \n“could put Nuance’s Confidential Bu siness Information at risk.”  See D. 1 ¶ 50; D. 1-1 § 7(e); \nD. 21 ¶ 7 (stating that Kovalenko’s role involv es “work[ing] cross-functionally to ensure \nsuccessful future launch of the Workspace so lution, while identifying new products and \nopportunities for the comp any in the future”). \n \n3 In light of this finding, the Court need not reach Nuance’s other bases for the breach of \ncontract claim (i.e., Kovalenko’ s alleged breaches of the non-so licitation and confidentiality \nprovisions), D. 3 at 17-18.  Case 1:22-cv-10656-DJC   Document 45   Filed 06/29/22   Page 20 of 2221 Kovalenko argues that, because Sirona does not  yet have “customers,” and Kovalenko has \nnot solicited any Nuance customers or used or disclosed any confidenti al information, Nuance \ncannot meet its burden to establish a danger of ir reparable harm.  D. 20 at 17–18.  Even crediting \nKovalenko’s representation that she “has had no reason to do any of these things at Sirona, nor \nwill she in the future,” see id., given the exte nt of Kovalenko’s experience at Nuance and the \napparent similarity between her positions at Nuance and Sirona, see D. 37 ¶ 16, “it is difficult to \nconceive how all of the informa tion stored in [Kovalenko]’s memo ry can be set aside as [s]he \napplies [her]self to a competitor’s business and its products,” see Marcam Corp., 885 F. Supp. at \n297.  “On the contrary, what [Kovalenko] knows about  [Nuance] is bound to influence what [s]he \ndoes for [Sirona], and to the extent it does, [Nuan ce] will be disadvantaged.”   See id.; see also \nAspect Software, 787 F. Supp. 2d at 127–130; Lo mbard Med. Techs., 729 F. Supp. 2d at 438–41.  \nFurther, although Sirona does not yet sell its pro duct to customers, such  does not diminish the \nirreparable harm Nuance would suffer if Kovale nko were to use her substantial knowledge of \nNuance’s confidential information to in directing developm ent of Sirona’s competing products.  \nSee, e.g., D. 4 ¶ 38 (describing Kovalenko’s knowledge of Nuance’ s marketing plans, customer \ninsights, confidential pr oduct roadmaps and pricing data).  Accordingly, Nuance has carried its \nburden of establishing a risk of irreparable harm absent preliminary injunctive relief. \nC. Balance of Hardships \n \n“Balancing harms requires the C ourt to weigh ‘the hardship to  the nonmovant if enjoined \nas contrasted with the hardship to the movant if  no injunction issues.’”  Get In Shape Franchise, \nInc. v. TFL Fishers, LLC, 167 F. Supp. 3d 173, 203 (D. Mass. 2016) (quoting Ross-Simons, 102 \nF.3d at 15).  As concluded above, Nuance likely has suffered or will suffer irreparable harm based \nupon Kovalenko’s alleged breach of the Agreement’ s non-compete provision.  By contrast, while Case 1:22-cv-10656-DJC   Document 45   Filed 06/29/22   Page 21 of 2222 Kovalenko may experience some hardship if the C ourt prevents her from c ontinuing to work at \nSirona, such will not prevent her from working in a different industry or for an employer that does \nnot provide products or se rvices that compete with Nuance.  Indeed, Kovalenko’s prior job offer \nfrom IQVIA confirms her employabil ity at a non-competitor of Nuance.   See D. 4 ¶ 50; D. 21 ¶ 43.  \nFurther, to the extent that Kovalenko suffers fro m injunctive relief, “this harm is a predictable \nconsequence” of her breach.  See Get In Sh ape, 167 F. Supp. 3d at 203 (citation omitted). \nD. Public Interest \n \nThe public interest will be served through pre liminary injunctive relief  in this case.  As \nnoted above, the public has an interest in the enforcement of reasonable restric tive covenants in \nemployment contracts,  see Lombard Med. Techs., 729 F. S upp. 2d at 443; Boulanger, 442 Mass. \nat 646.  Nuance seeks to enforce the Agreement, a valid, binding c ontract that is reasonable in \nscope and necessary to prevent ir reparable harm to its business. \nVI.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: In this case, authors Paul Tremblay, Sarah Silverman, Christopher Golden, and Richard Kadrey filed a class action lawsuit against OpenAI, Inc., alleging that OpenAI used their copyrighted books to train its AI language model, ChatGPT, without permission. The court partially granted and partially denied OpenAI’s motion to dismiss the claims, allowing only the claim under the \"unfair\" prong of California's Unfair Competition Law (UCL) to proceed, while dismissing the claims of vicarious copyright infringement, violation of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), negligence, and unjust enrichment, but allowing plaintiffs an opportunity to amend their complaints.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether OpenAI’s use of copyrighted books to train its AI language models, without consent from the authors, constitutes copyright infringement and violations of other related legal protections.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court dismissed several claims including vicarious copyright infringement, DMCA violations, negligence, and unjust enrichment, primarily due to plaintiffs' failure to sufficiently allege the necessary legal elements and factual bases. However, the court denied OpenAI’s motion to dismiss under the \"unfair\" competition prong of the UCL, finding that plaintiffs have adequately alleged unfair practices, allowing this claim to proceed.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: A group of authors sued OpenAI because their books were allegedly used to teach an AI how to read them without permission. The court found that most of their complaints didn’t have enough evidence to continue but agreed there might be unfair business practices that deserved further investigation. The authors now have another chance to gather more detailed complaints to move forward with the lawsuit.",

BACKGROUND  \nBefore the Court are two nearly identical putative class complaints in Tremblay et al v. \nOpenAI, Inc. et al , 23-cv-3223 and Silverman et al v. OpenAI, Inc. et al , 23-cv-3416.  Plaintiffs are \nauthors of books who allege that their boo ks were used to train OpenAI language models that \noperate the artificial intelligence (“AI”) software ChatGPT.1  Silverman Compl. ¶¶ 1 -4; Tremblay \nCompl. ¶¶  1-4.  Plaintiffs Paul Tremblay, Sarah Silverman, Christopher Golden, and Richard \nKadrey  (collectively, “Plaintiffs”) hold registered copyrights in their books.  Tremblay Compl. ¶¶ \n \n1 For the purposes of th e motion to dismiss  at bar , the Court accepts all factual allegations in the \nComplaint as true and construes the pleadings in the light most favorable to the Plaintiffs.  \nManzarek v. St. Paul Fire & Marine Ins. Co. , 519 F.3d 1025, 1031 (9th Cir. 2008).  \n Case 3:23-cv-03416-AMO     Document 68     Filed 02/12/24     Page 1 of 13 \n2 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  10, 12, Ex. A  (The Cabin at the End of the World (Tremblay) )2; Silverman Compl. ¶ ¶ 10-13, Ex. \nA (The Bedwetter (Silverman); Ararat  (Golden), and Sandman Slim (Kad rey)). \nDefendant OpenAI3 creates and sells certain AI software known as large language models \n(or “LLM”).  Tremblay Compl. ¶ 23.  These language models are “trained” by inputting large \namounts of texts known as the “training dataset.”  Id.  The language m odels copy  text from the \ntraining dataset and extract “expressive information.”  Id.  ChatGPT is an OpenAI language model \nthat allows paying  users to enter text prompts to which ChatGPT will respond and “simulate \nhuman reasoning,” including answering quest ions or summarizing books.  Id.  ¶¶ 22, 36 -38.  \nChatGPT generates its output based on “patterns and connections” from the training data.  Id. ¶ 39.  \nOpenAI copied Plaintiffs’ copyrighted books and used them in its training dataset.  Id. ¶ \n24.  When prompted  to summarize books written by each of the Plaintiffs, ChatGPT generated \naccurate summaries of the books’ content and themes.  Id. ¶ 41 (citing Ex. B); Silverman Compl. ¶ \n42 (citing Ex. B).  \nPlaintiffs seek to represent a class of all people in the U.S. who  own a copyright in any \nwork that was used as training data for OpenAI language models during the class period.  \nTremblay Compl. ¶ 42 ; Silverman Compl. ¶ 43 .  Plaintiffs assert six causes of action against \nvarious OpenAI entities: (1) direct copyright infr ingement (Count I); (2) vicarious infringement \n(Count II); (3) violation of  Section 1202(b) of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“DMCA”) \n(Count III); (4) unfair  competition under Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code Section 17200 (Count IV); (5) \nnegligence (Count V); and (6) unjust enrichment (Count VI).  \n OpenAI filed the instant motions to dismiss on August 28, 2023, seeking dismissal of \nCounts II through VI.  ECF 33 (“Motion”).4 \n \n2 Plaintiff Mona Awad volunt arily dismissed her claims without prejudice.  ECF 29.  \n \n3 Defendants are seven entities that Plaintiffs collectively refer to as “OpenAI.”  ECF 33 \n(“Motion ”) at 14 (citing Tremblay Compl. ¶¶ 13 -19; Silverman Compl . ¶¶ 14 -20).  The Court \nfollows this naming convention.  \n \n4 Defendants’ motion to dismiss addresses both the Silverman and the Tremblay complaints and \nwas filed concurrently on both dockets.  Motion at 1 n1.  \n Case 3:23-cv-03416-AMO     Document 68     Filed 02/12/24     Page 2 of 13 \n3 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  II. LEGAL STANDARD  \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a) requires that a complaint  contain “a short and plain \nstatement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.”  A defendant may move to \ndismiss a complaint for failing to state a claim upon which relief can be granted under Federal \nRule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6).  “Dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) is appropriate only where the \ncomplaint lacks a cognizable legal theory or sufficient facts to support a cognizable legal theory.”  \nMendiondo v. Centinela Hosp. Med. Ctr. , 521 F.3d 1097, 1104 (9th Cir. 2008).  To survive a Ru le \n12(b)(6) motion, a plaintiff must plead “enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on \nits face.”  Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly , 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007).  A claim is facially plausible \nwhen a plaintiff pleads “factual content that allows t he court to draw the reasonable inference that \nthe defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.”  Ashcroft v. Iqbal , 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009).  \nIn reviewing the plausibility of a complaint, courts “accept factual allegations in the \ncomplaint as true and construe the pleadings in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.” \nManzarek , 519 F.3d at 1031.  Nonetheless, courts do not “accept as true allegations that are merely \nconclusory, unwarranted deductions of fact, or unreasonable inferences.”  In re Gilead Scis. Secs. \nLitig. , 536 F.3d 1049, 1055 (9th Cir. 2008)  (citation omitted) . \nIII. ANALYSIS  \nDefendants seek dismissal of all causes of action except for the claim for  direct copyright \ninfringement.  Motion at 18.  Defendants seek dismissal of Count II for vicarious copyright \ninfringement; Count III for violation of Section 1202(b) of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act \n(“DMCA); Count IV for Unfair Competition under Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code § 17200; Count V for \nnegligence; and Count VI for unjust enrichment.  Id.  The Court addresses each in turn.  \nA. Vicarious Copyright Infringement (Count I I) \nThe Copyright Act grants the copyright holder exclusive rights to (1) “reproduce the \ncopyrighted work in  copies,” (2) “prepare derivate works,” and (3) “distribute copies .  . . of the \ncopyrighted work to the public. ”  17 U.S.C. § 106(1) -(3).  Copyright protection does not extend to \n“every idea, theory, and fact” underlying a copyrighted work.  Eldred v. Ashcroft , 537 U.S. 186, \n219 (2003); see 17 U.S.C. § 102(b).  Indeed, “[t]he mere fact that a work is copyrighted does not Case 3:23-cv-03416-AMO     Document 68     Filed 02/12/24     Page 3 of 13 \n4 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  mean that every element of the work may be protected.”  Corbello v. Valli , 974 F.3d 965, 973 (9th \nCir. 2020) (citation omitted).  \nCopyright infringement requires that a plaintiff show (1) “he owns as valid copyright” and \n(2) the defendant “copied aspects of his work.”  Corbello , 974 F.3d at 973.  The second prong \n“contains two separate components: ‘copying’ and ‘unlawful appropriatio n.’”  Id. at 974.  \n“Copying can be demonstrated either through direct evidence or by showing that the defendant \nhad access to the plaintiff’s work and that the two works share similarities probative of copying, \nwhile the hallmark of ‘unlawful appropriation ’ is that the works share substantial similarities.”  Id. \n(citations and internal quotations omitted); see Skidmore as Tr. for Randy Craig Wolfe Tr. v. Led \nZeppelin , 952 F.3d 1051, 1064 (9th Cir. 2020) (“the hallmark of ‘unlawful appropriation’ is that \nthe works share substantial  similarities”)  (emphasis in original) . \nA claim of vicarious infringement requires  a threshold showing of direct infringement , \nPerfect 10, Inc. v. Amazon.com, Inc. , 508 F.3d 1146, 1169 (9th Cir. 2007) (“ Amazon.com ”); see \nA&M Recs., Inc. v. Napster, Inc. , 239 F.3d 1004, 1013 n.2 (9th Cir. 2001) aff’d, 284 F.3d 1091 \n(2002) (“Secondary liability for copyright infringement does not exist in the absence of direct \ninfringement by a third party”).   A plaintiff must then show  that “the defen dant has (1) the right \nand ability to supervise the infringing conduct and (2) a direct financial interest in the infringing \nactivity.”  Perfect 10, Inc. v. Giganews, Inc. , 847 F.3d 657, 673 (9th Cir. 2017) (“ Giganews ”) \n(citation omitted).    \nDefendants arg ue that the vicarious infringement claim fails for three reasons: (1) Plaintiffs \nhave not alleged that direct infringement occurred; (2) Plaintiffs have not alleged that Defendants \nhad the  “right and ability to supervise”; and (3) Plaintiffs have not alleg ed “direct financial \ninterest.”  Motion at 19 -21.  The Court first considers  whether Plaintiffs have adequately alleged \ndirect infringement  and, ultimately, does not reach Defendants’ latter two arguments . \nPlaintiffs suggest  that they do not need to allege a “substantial similarity” because they \nhave evidence of “direct copying .”  ECF 48 (“Response”) at 15.   They  argue that because \nDefendants directly copied the copyrighted books to train the language models, Plaintiffs need not \nshow substantial similarity.  Id. at 15 (citing Range Rd. Music, Inc. v. E. Coast Foods, Inc. , 668 Case 3:23-cv-03416-AMO     Document 68     Filed 02/12/24     Page 4 of 13 \n5 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  F.3d 1148, 1154 (9th Cir. 2012) ( explain ing that “substantial similarity” helps  determine whether \ncopying occurred “when an allegedly infringing work appropria tes elements of an original without \nreproducing it in toto .”).  Plaintiff s misunderstand Range Rd.   There, the court did not need to find \nsubstantial similarity  because the infringement  was the public performance of copyrighted songs at \na bar.   Range Rd. , 668 F.3d at 1151 -52, 1154 .  Since the  plaintiffs provided unrebutted evidence \nthat the performed songs were the protected songs , they did not need to show that they were \nsubstantially similar.  Id. at 1154.   Distinctly, Plaintiffs  here have not alleged  that the ChatGPT \noutputs contain direct copies of the copyrighted books.  Because they fail to allege direct copying , \nthey must show a substantial similarity between the outputs and the copyrighted materials.  See \nSkidmore , 952 F.3d at 1064; Corbel lo, 974 F.3d at 973 -74. \nPlaintiff s’ allegation that “every output  of the OpenAI Language Model s is an infringing \nderivative work ” is insufficient.  Tremblay Compl. ¶ 59; Silverman Compl. ¶ 60 .  Plaintiffs fail to \nexplain what the outputs entail or allege t hat any particular output is substantially similar  – or \nsimilar at all – to their books.  Accordingly, the Court dismisses th e vicarious copyright \ninfringement claim with leave to amend.  \nB. Section 1202(b) of the DMCA (Count III)  \nIn addition to protecting aga inst vicarious and direct infringement, “[c]opyright law \nrestricts the removal or alteration of copyright management information ( ‘CMI ’) – information \nsuch as the title, the author, the copyright owner, the terms and conditions for use of the work, and \nother identifying information set forth in a copyright notice or conveyed in connection with the \nwork.”  Stevens v. Corelogic, Inc. , 899 F.3d 666, 671 (9th Cir. 2018).  Section 1202(b) of the \nDigital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) provides that one cannot, w ithout authority, (1) \n“intentionally remove or alter any” CMI, (2) “distribute . . . [CMI] knowing that the [CMI] has \nbeen removed or altered,” or (3) “distribute . . . copies of works . . . knowing that [CMI] has been \nremoved or altered .”  17 U.S.C. § 120 2(b).  To state a Section 1202 claim for removal or alteration \nof CMI, plaintiffs must first identify “what the removed or altered CMI was.”  Free Speech Sys., \nLLC v. Menzel , 390 F. Supp. 3d 1162, 1175 (N.D. Cal. 2019).  Plaintiffs must also show the \nrequi site mental state , as each of the three forms of Section 1202(b) violations  requires “knowing, Case 3:23-cv-03416-AMO     Document 68     Filed 02/12/24     Page 5 of 13 \n6 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  or . . . having reasonable grounds to know, that [intentionally removing CMI]  will induce, enable, \nfacilitate, or conceal” infringement.  17 U.S.C. § 1202(b).  \nOpenAI argues that the Section 1202(b)(1) claim fails because Plaintiffs do not plausibly \nallege that OpenAI intentionally removed CMI during the training process  or intended  to conceal \nor induce infringement, and the Section 1202(b)(3) claim fails because  Plaintiffs do not allege that \nDefendant distributed the copyrighted works or copies.  Motion at 21-22.  The Court begins  by \nanalyzing the 1202(b)(1) claim.  \n1. Section 1202(b)(1) – Intentionally Remove or Alter  CMI  \nSection 1202(b) requires knowledge or “reaso nable grounds to know” that the  CMI  \nremoval would “induce, enable, facilitate, or conceal an infringement.”  In the Ninth Circuit, a \nplaintiff “must make an affirmative showing, such as by demonstrating a past ‘pattern of conduct’ \nor ‘modus operandi,’ that  the defendant was aware or had reasonable grounds to be aware of the \nprobable future impact of its actions.”  Stevens , 899 F.3d at 674.  At the pleading stage, this \nrequires pleading facts “plausibly showing that the alleged infringer had this required me ntal \nstate.”  Andersen v. Stability AI Ltd. , No. 23 -CV-00201 -WHO, 2023 WL 7132064, at *10 (N.D. \nCal. Oct. 30, 2023); see Philpot v. Alternet Media, Inc. , No. 18 -CV-04479 -TSH, 2018 WL \n6267876, at *5 (N.D. Cal. Nov. 30, 2018) (dismissing DMCA claim where pla intiff “fail[ed] to \nplead any facts showing that [defendant] had the required mental state”).  \nPlaintiffs allege that “ [b]y design,” Defendants remove CMI from the  copyrighted  books \nused during the training process.  Tremblay Compl. ¶ 64; Silverman Compl. ¶  65.  However, \nPlaintiffs provide no facts supporting this assertion.  Indeed, the Complaints include excerpts of \nChatGPT outputs that include multiple references to Plaintiffs’ names, suggesting that OpenAI did \nnot remove all references to “the name of th e author.”  See, e.g. , Tremblay Compl. Ex. B at 3 \n(“Throughout these chapters, Tremblay masterfully maintains the suspense and psychological \nterror”); Silverman Compl. Ex B. at 1  (“Silverman uses her sharp wit to lend a comedic touch”) .  \nMoreover, there ar e no facts to support the assertion that “ [b]y design, the training process does \nnot preserve any CMI.”  Tremblay Compl. ¶ 64.  In Doe 1 v. GitHub, Inc. , No. 22 -CV-06823 -JST, \n2023 WL 3449131, at *11 (N.D. Cal. May 11, 2023) , plaintiffs alleged where the CMI typically Case 3:23-cv-03416-AMO     Document 68     Filed 02/12/24     Page 6 of 13 \n7 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  appeared, that defendants were aware that the CMI appeared repeatedly, and that defendants \nsubsequently “trained these programs to ignore or remove CMI and therefore stop producing it.”   \nThat was sufficient to s upport a “reasonable inference that Defendants intentionally designed the \nprograms to remove CMI . . .”  Id.  By contrast , Plaintiffs here only make conclusory allegations \nthat “[b]y design, the training process does not preserve any CMI.”  Tremblay Compl.  ¶ 64.  \nEven if Plaintiffs provided facts showing Defendants’ knowing removal of CMI from the \nbooks during the training process, Plaintiffs have not shown how omitting CMI in the copies used \nin the training set gave Defendants reasonable grounds to know tha t ChatGPT’s output would \ninduce, enable, facilitate, or conceal infringement.   See Stevens , 899 F.3d  at 673 (finding that \nallegations  that “someone might be able to use [the copyrighted work] undetected  . . . simply \nidentifies a general possibility that ex ists whenever CMI is removed ,” and fails to show the \nnecessary mental state ).  Plaintiffs argue that OpenAI’s failure to state which internet books it uses \nto train ChatGPT shows that it knowingly enabled infringement, because ChatGPT users will not \nknow i f any output is infringing.  Response at 21 -22.  However, Plaintiffs do not point to any \ncaselaw to suggest that failure to reveal such information has any bearing on whether the alleged \nremoval of CMI in an internal database will knowingly enable infringe ment.   Plaintiffs have failed \nto state a claim under Section 12(b)(1).  \n2. Section 1202(b)(3) – Distribute Works or Copies  \nPlaintiffs also allege that Defendants violated Section 1202(b)(3) because OpenAI created \nderivative works - ChatGPT outputs  - and distri buted th ose outputs  without the CMI included.  \nTremblay Compl. ¶ 65; Silverman Compl. ¶ 66.  The DMCA “does not prohibit merely omitting \nCMI from an infringing work.”  Dolls Kill, Inc. v. Zoetop Bus. Co. , No. 222CV01463RGKMAA, \n2022 WL 16961477, at *3 (C.D. Cal. Aug. 25, 2022).  While it may be unlawful to recreate \nanother’s work (e.g., under the Copyright Act), this conduct does not necessarily implicate the \nDMCA.  See, e.g. , Kirk Kara Corp. v. W. Stone &  Metal Corp. , No. CV 20 -1931 -DMG (EX), \n2020 WL 5991503, at *6 (C.D. Cal. Aug. 14, 2020) (emphasis in original) (dismissing claim \nbecause “while the works may be substantially similar , Defendant did not make identical  copies \nof Plaintiff’s works and then re move the engraved CMI”).  Case 3:23-cv-03416-AMO     Document 68     Filed 02/12/24     Page 7 of 13 \n8 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  Under the plain language of the statute , liability requires distributing the original “works” \nor “copies of [the] works.”  17 U.S.C. § 1202(b)(3).  Plaintiffs have not alleged that Defendants \ndistributed their books or copies of their books.  Instead, they have  allege d that “every output from \nthe OpenAI La nguage Models is an infringing derivative work” without providing any indication \nas to what such outputs entail – i.e., whether they are the copyrighted books or copies of the \nbooks .  That is insufficient  to support this cause of action under the DMCA .   \nPlaintiffs compare their claim to that in Doe 1, however, the plaintiffs in Doe 1 alleged that \nthe defendants “distributed copies of [plaintiff’s licensed] code knowing that CMI had been \nremoved or altered.”  Doe 1 , 2023 WL 3449131, at *11 .  The Doe 1  plain tiffs alleged that \ndefendants knew that the programs “reproduced training data,” such as the licensed code, as \noutput.  Id.  Plaintiffs here have not alleged that ChatGPT reproduces Plaintiffs copyrighted works  \nwithout CMI .  \n Accordingly, the Court dismiss es the DMCA claims with leave to amend.  \nC. UCL (Count IV)  \nOpenAI also seeks to dismiss Plaintiffs’ UCL claims.  “A business act or practice may \nviolate the UCL if it is either ‘unlawful,’ ‘unfair,’ or ‘fraudulent.’  Each of these three adjectives \ncaptures ‘a separate and distinct theory of liability.’”  Rubio v. Cap. One Bank , 613 F.3d 1195, \n1203 (9th Cir. 2010) (ci ting Kearns v. Ford Motor Co. , 567 F.3d 1120, 1127 (9th Cir. 2009)).  \n“The UCL’s coverage is sweeping, and its standard for wrongful business conduct intentionally \nbroad.”  Moore v. Apple, Inc. , 73 F. Supp. 3d 1191, 1204 (N.D. Cal. 2014).  Plaintiffs advan ce \nUCL claims under each prong , and the Court considers each in turn . \n1. Unlawful  \n Plaintiffs allege that Defendants engaged in “unlawful business practices” by violating the \nDMCA.  Tremblay Compl. ¶¶ 69 -70; Silverman Compl. ¶ 70 -71.  As the Court has dismiss ed the \npredicate DMCA claims, the derivate UCL claims cannot remain .  See Eidmann v. Walgreen Co. , \n522 F. Supp. 3d 634, 647 (N.D. Cal. 2021) (“If the ‘plaintiff cannot state a claim under the \npredicate law . . . [the UCL] claim also fails.’”) (alterations in original) (quoting Hadley v. Kellogg \nSales Co. , 243 F. Supp. 3d 1074, 1094 (N.D. Cal. 2017)); see Armstrong -Harris v. Wells Fargo Case 3:23-cv-03416-AMO     Document 68     Filed 02/12/24     Page 8 of 13 \n9 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  Bank, N.A. , No. 21 -CV-07637 -HSG, 2022 WL 3348426, at *3 (N.D. Cal. Aug. 12, 2022)  (citing \ncases ).   \nEven if Plaintiffs can bring claims under the DMCA, they must show economic injury \ncaused by the unfair business practice.  See Davis v. RiverSource Life Ins. Co. , 240 F. Supp. 3d \n1011, 1017 (N.D. Cal. 2017) (quoting Kwikset Corp. v. Superior Ct. , 51 Cal. 4th 310, 322 (2011)).  \nDefendants argue that Plaintiffs have not alleged that they have “lost money or property.”  Motion \nat 29 -30; see Kwikset Corp. , 51 Cal. 4th at 322-23.  Plaintiffs counter  that they have lost \nintellectual property in connection with the DMCA claims because of the “risk of future damage \nto intellectual property that results the moment a defendant removes CMI from digital copies of \nPlaintiffs’ work  – copies that can be reproduced and distributed online at near zero marginal cost.”  \nResponse at 28.  However, no where in Plaintiffs’ complaint do they allege that Defendants \nreproduced and distributed copies of their books.   Accordingly, any injury is speculative , and the \nunlawful prong of the UCL claim fails for this additional reason . \n2. Fraudulent  \n Plaintiffs also argue that they pleaded UCL violations based on “fraudulent” conduct .  \nResponse at 26 -27.  They point to a paragraph  in the complaint  that states that “consumers are \nlikely to be deceived” by Defendants’ unlawful practices and that Defendan ts “deceptively \ndesigned ChatGPT to output without any CMI.”  Tremblay Compl. ¶ 72.  The allegation’s \nreferences to CMI demonstrates that Plaintiffs ’ claims rest on a violation of the DMC A, and thus \nfail as the Court has dismissed the underlying DMCA claim .  Supra Sections B, C(1).  To the \nextent that Plaintiffs ground their claim in fraudulent  business practices, Plaintiffs fail to indicate \nwhere they have pleaded allegations of fraud.  Thus, they fail to satisfy the heightened pleading \nrequirements of Rul e 9(b)  which apply to  UCL fraud claims.  See Armstrong -Harris , 2022 WL \n3348246, at *2.  Therefore, the UCL claim based on fraudulent conduct also fails.  \n3. Unfair  \n Under  the unfair prong  of the UCL , Plaintiffs allege  that Defendants used Plaintiffs’ \ncopyright ed works to train ChatGPT without Plaintiffs’ authorization.  Tremblay Compl. ¶ 71; \nSilverman Compl. ¶  72.  California courts have defined “unfair” broadly .  For example, the Case 3:23-cv-03416-AMO     Document 68     Filed 02/12/24     Page 9 of 13 \n10 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  California Court of Appeal stated,  “California’s unfair competition law prohibits  not only \nunlawful business practices but also unfair business practices.  The statute is intentionally broad to \ngive the court maximum discretion to control whatever new schemes may be contrived, even \nthough they are not yet forbidden by law.”   People ex rel. Renne v. Servantes , 86 Cal.App.4th \n1081, 1095 (2001).  The Court of Appeal explained further , “[o]ne test for determining an ‘unfair’ \npractice is [whether] the gravity of the harm to the victim outweighs the utility of the defendant ’s \nconduct.”  Id. at 1095 .5  \n Assuming the truth of Plaintiffs’ allegations  - that Defendants used Plaintiffs’ copyrighted \nworks to train their language models for commercial profit  - the Court concludes that Defendants’ \nconduct may constitute  an unfair pr actice.6  Therefore, this portion of the UCL claim may proceed.  \nD. Negligence (Count V)  \nNegligence claims require that a plaintiff establish (1) duty; (2) breach; (3) causation; and \n(4) damages.  Corales v. Bennett , 567 F.3d 554, 572 (9th Cir. 2009 ) (citatio n omitted) .  There is a \n“general duty of care on a defendant . . . who has created a risk of harm to the plaintiff.”  Brown v. \nUSA Taekwondo , 11 Cal. 5th 204, 21 4 (2021), reh’g denied  (May 12, 2021) (citations omitted).  \nHowever, “not every defendant owes every plaintiff a duty of care.”  Id. at 213.  \nPlaintiffs allege that Defendants owed them a duty of care based on the control of Plaintiffs \ninformation in their possession and breached their duty by “negligently, carelessly, and recklessly \ncollecting, main taining, and controlling systems  – including ChatGPT  – which are trained on \nPlaintiffs’ [copyrighted] works.”  Tremblay Compl. ¶ ¶ 74-75; Silverman Compl. ¶ ¶ 75-76.  \nDefendants seek to dismiss the negligence claim, arguing that 1) Plaintiffs have not establ ished \n \n5 Defendants allege that the “unfair” prong requires alleging that the conduct “threatens an \nincipient vio lation of an antitrust law.”  ECF 54 (“Reply”)  at 18 (quoting Cel–Tech Commc'ns, \nInc. v. L.A. Cellular Tel. Co. , 20 Cal.4th 163 , 164  (1999)).  However, that is the definition for \nunfair acts “among competitors.”  Sybersound Recs., Inc. v. UAV Corp. , 517 F. 3d 1137, 1152 (9th \nCir. 2008) (quoting id.).  As that is not the basis of the allegations here, the definition does not \napply.  \n \n6 As OpenAI  does not raise p reemption, the Court does not consider it.  However, the Court notes \nthe possibility that to the ext ent the UCL claim alleges the same violations as the copyright claim, \nit may be preempted by the Copyright Act.   \n Case 3:23-cv-03416-AMO     Document 68     Filed 02/12/24     Page 10 of 13 \n11 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  that OpenAI owes them a duty and 2) the Complaints only challenge intentional acts.   Motion at \n30-31. \nThe Complaints allege that Defendants negligently maintained and controlled information \nin their possession.  Tremblay Compl. ¶ ¶ 74-75; Silverman Compl. ¶ ¶ 75-76.  Plaintiffs argue \nwithout legal support that Defendants owed a duty to safeguard Plaintiffs’ works.  Response at 30.  \nPlaintiffs do not identify what duty exists to “maintain[] and control[]” the public  information \ncontained in Plaintiffs’ copyrighted books.   The negligence claim fails on this basis.  \nPlaintiffs’ argument that there is a “special relationship” between the parties also fails.  See \nResponse at 30.  Nowhere in the Complaint s do Plaintiffs allege that there is any fiduciary or \ncustodial relationship between the parties.  Plaintiffs do not explain how merely possessing their \nbooks creates a special relationship, citing only to an inapposite case where defendants were \ncustodians of plaintiffs’ “personal and confidenti al information.”  Witriol v. LexisNexis Grp. , No. \nC05-02392 MJJ, 2006 WL 4725713, at *8 (N.D. Cal. Feb. 10, 2006).7 \n As Plaintiffs have not alleged that Defendants owed them a legal duty, the Court dismisses \nthis claim with leave to amend.  \nE. Unjust Enrichment (Count VI)  \nIn the sixth cause of action, Plaintiffs bring an unjust enrichment claim for OpenAI’s use \nof the copyri ghted books to train ChatGPT.  Tremblay Compl. ¶¶ 79 -86; Silverman Compl. ¶¶ 80 -\n87.  The Ninth Circuit allows  an unjust enrichment claim as either an independent cause of action \nor as  a “quasi -contract claim for restitution.”  ESG Cap. Partners, LP v. Stra tos, 828 F.3d 1023, \n1038 (9th Cir. 2016).   “To allege unjust enrichment as an independent cause of action, a plaintiff \n \n7 Defendants do not raise the economic loss doctrine, but it may also preclude recovery.  See N. \nAm. Chem. Co. v. Superior Ct. , 59 Cal. App. 4th 764, 777 (1997) (“The economic loss rule has \nbeen applied to bar a plaintiff’s tort recovery of economic damages unless such damages are \naccompanied by some form of physical harm (i.e., personal injury or property damage)”); see also \nAas v. Superior Ct ., 24 Cal. 4th 627, 636 (2000) (limiting liability in a negligence action to \ndamages for physical injuries and not permitting recovery for economic loss alone) ; see, e.g. , \nStrumlauf v. Starbucks Corp. , 192 F. Supp. 3d 1025, 1035 (N.D. Cal. 2016)  (granting motion to \ndismiss on ground that economic loss doctrine barred plaintiff’s claim ). \n \n Case 3:23-cv-03416-AMO     Document 68     Filed 02/12/24     Page 11 of 13 \n12 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  must show that the defendant received and unjustly retained a benefit at the plaintiff ’s expense.”  \nId.  Restitution is not ordinarily available to a plaintiff unless “the benefits were conferred by \nmistake, fraud, coercion or request; otherwise, though there is enrichment, it is not unjust.”  Nibbi \nBros., Inc. v. Home Fed. Sav. & Loan Assn. , 205 Cal. App. 3d  1415, 1422 (Cal. Ct. App. 1988) \n(quoting 1 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law (9th ed. 1987) Contracts, § 97, p. 126.) ; see Astiana v. \nHain Celestial Grp., Inc. , 783 F.3d 753, 762 (9th Cir. 2015) (quoting 55 Cal. Jur. 3d Restitution § \n2) (the theory underlying a n unjust enrichment claim is that “a defendant has been unjustly \nconferred a benefit ‘through mistake, fraud, coercion, or request.’” ). \nDefendants argue that this claim must be dismissed because Plaintiffs fail to allege what \n“benefit” they quasi -contractu ally “conferred” on OpenAI or that Plaintiffs conferred this benefit \nthrough “mistake, fraud, or coercion.”  Motion at 32 (citing Bittel Tech., Inc. v. Bittel USA, Inc. , \nNo. C10 -00719 HRL, 2010 WL 3221864, at *5 (N.D. Cal. Aug. 13, 2010) (“Ordinarily, a pl aintiff \nmust show that the benefit was conferred on the defendant through mistake, fraud or coercion .”) \n(citation omitted) .  Plaintiffs fail to allege that OpenAI  “has been unjustly conferred a benefit \n‘through mistake, fraud, coercion, or request.’”  See Astiana , 783 F.3d at 762 (citation omitted);  \nLeGrand v. Abbott Lab ’ys, 655 F. Supp. 3d 871, 898 (N.D. Cal. 2023)  (same);  see, e.g. , Russell v. \nWalmart, Inc. , No. 22 -CV-02813 -JST, 2023 WL 4341460, at *2 (N.D. Cal. July 5, 2023)  (“it is \nnot enough that Russe ll have provided Walmart with a beneficial service; Russell must also allege \nthat Walmart unjustly secured that benefit through qualifying conduct. Absent qualifying mistake, \nfraud, coercion, or request by Walmart, there is no injustice .”).  As Plaintiffs have not alleged that \nOpenAI unjustly obtained benefits from Plaintiffs’ copyrighted works through fraud, mistake, \ncoercion, or request, this claim fails.8 \nIV. CONCLUSION  \n For the foregoing reasons, the Court GRANTS  in part and DENIES  in part Defendants’ \nmotions to dismiss.  Plaintiffs’ amended complaint must be filed by March 13, 202 4.  No \n \n8 Because Plaintiffs fail to adequately allege the negligence and unjust enrichment claims, the \nCourt need not reach the preemption issue at this time.  \n Case 3:23-cv-03416-AMO     Document 68     Filed 02/12/24     Page 12 of 13 \n13 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  additional parties or claims may be added without leave of Court or stipulation of Defendant s.  \nThe amended complaint shal l consolidate the claims in 23 -cv-3223 -AMO ( Tremblay et al. v. \nOpenAI, Inc. et al. ), 23-cv-04625 -AMO ( Chabon et al. v.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: Groma, LLC, a Massachusetts-based company, filed a lawsuit against BuildRE, LLC, and related entities, claiming trademark infringement. The Defendants, primarily operating from Texas and Turkey, motioned to dismiss due to lack of personal jurisdiction over them in Massachusetts. The court granted the motion to dismiss, and Groma's motion for a preliminary injunction was denied as moot. The case did involve AI elements as one defendant, Groma GPS-Turkey, designs software using AI for vehicle automation, but the legal issue revolved around jurisdiction.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the Massachusetts court has personal jurisdiction over the Texas and Turkey-based Defendants for claims of trademark infringement.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court held that it did not have personal jurisdiction over the Defendants because they lacked sufficient contacts with Massachusetts—therefore, dismissing the case against them. The court did not need to address the preliminary injunction, as it lacked jurisdiction altogether.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine two companies fighting over who gets to use a specific name for their products. One company, based in Massachusetts, tries to sue other companies, who are based in Texas and another country, in a Massachusetts court. The Texas and international companies argue that because they have almost no connection to Massachusetts (no office, employees, or sales there), the Massachusetts court can't make decisions about them. The court agrees, saying it's like trying to pull someone into a fight who is standing way outside the ring—they simply don't belong in that courtroom. Thus, the court can’t do anything about the fight between these companies.",

[ Dkt. 1 ( “Compl.”) at ¶  1].  Plaintiff ha s filed a motion for a preliminary \ninjunction [Dkt. 13], which Defendants oppose [Dkt. 34].  Defendants have filed a joint motion  \nto dismiss  for lack  of personal jurisdiction [Dkt. 25] , which Plaintiff opposes [Dkt. 38] .  For the \nfollowing reasons, D efendant s’ joint motion to dismiss  [Dkt. 25] is GRANTED, and Plaintiff’s \nmotion for a preliminary injunction [Dkt. 13] is DENIED AS MOOT . Case 1:22-cv-11708-AK   Document 53   Filed 04/03/23   Page 1 of 182 I. BACKGROUND \nThe Court draws the facts from the complaint and undisputed evidentiary proffers \nsubmitted by both parties in support of their jurisdictional arguments.  Plaintiff Groma -\nMassachusetts  is a Massachusetts- based  company with a place of business in Boston, \nMassachusetts .  [Compl. at  ¶ 5].  Groma -Massachusetts is a real estate and technology  firm \nwhich provides real estate investment, development, and management services, as well as \ntechnology to tenants, developers, investors, property managers, and communities.  [ Id. at ¶ 12].  \nGroma -Massachusetts is the owner of U.S. Trademark Registration No. 6,244,525 for \n“GROMA” within Class 36 and Class 37, which encompass trademark uses in various real estate fields.  [ Id. at ¶ 33].     \nDefendant BuildRE is a Texas -based company with a place of business in Frisco, Texas.  \n[Id. at ¶ 6; Dkt. 28 at ¶ 4 ].  Defendant Groma GPS -Texas is a Texas -based corporation located at \nthe same address in Frisco , Texas , as BuildRE.  [Compl. at ¶  7; Dkt. 30 at ¶ 4].  Defendant \nGrom a GPS -Turkey is a Turkey-based corporation with a place of business in Gebze, Kocaeli , \nTurk ey.  [Compl. at  ¶ 8; Dkt. 29 at ¶¶ 4- 5].  Patrick Joseph Morgan is chief executive office r of \neach of the Defendant-corporations.  [Compl. at  ¶ 9; Dkt. 28 at ¶  2; Dkt. 29 at ¶  2; Dkt. 30 at \n¶ 2].  Groma GPS -Texas and Groma GPS -Turkey are wholly owned subsidiaries of BuildRE.  \n[Compl. at  ¶ 10].  All three companies are technology companies.  [ Id. at ¶¶ 37, 48, 67].   Groma  \nGPS-Turkey designs and creates GPS and vehicle automation software and hardware using \nartificial intelligence  (“AI”),  such as software to operate machines that drive piles into soil to \nbuild solar panels using AI and GPS technology.  [Dkt. 29 at ¶ ¶ 5-6 ].  BuildRE distributes \nproducts related to pile drivers for photovoltaic solar projects.  [Dkt. 28 at ¶  12].  BuildRE \ndistributes software products designed by Groma GPS-Turkey among other products for other Case 1:22-cv-11708-AK   Document 53   Filed 04/03/23   Page 2 of 183 companies.  [ Id. at ¶ 13].  To put it simply, BuildRE is a  parent company that distributes the \nsoftware products of its subsidiary, Groma GPS- Turkey.  Groma  GPS-Texas has not yet \nconducted any business and does not have any customers, sales, revenue, or a website.  [Dkt. 30 \nat ¶ 6].    \nPlaintiff does not dispute the following facts asserted by Defendants.  First, n one of the \nDefendants  is listed with the Massachusetts Secretary of the Commonwealth , nor do they pay \nany taxes in Massachusetts.  [Dkt. 28 at ¶ ¶ 5, 18; Dkt. 29 at ¶ ¶ 9, 20; Dkt. 30 at ¶ ¶ 5, 15].  \nSecond, none of the Defendants has  a physical presence in Massachusetts , such as offices, \nmanufacturing, or distribution facilities , nor do they have any employees in Massachusetts.  \n[Dkt. 28 at ¶ ¶ 6-7, 10-11; Dkt. 29 at ¶ ¶ 10-11, 16-17; Dkt. 30 at ¶¶ 7-8, 11-12].  Third, none of \nthe D efendants  has any customers in Massachusetts, nor do they derive any income from \noperations in Massachusetts , and there are no records of any sales or shipments to Massachusetts \nfrom any of the Defendants.  [Dkt. 28 at ¶ ¶ 15, 17, 19; Dkt. 29 at ¶ ¶ 18-19, 21; Dkt. 30 at ¶ ¶ 13-\n14, 16].   \nGroma -Massachusetts filed the complaint in this action  seeking damages and a \npreliminary and permanent injunction.  [Compl. at ¶ 1].  Groma -Massachusetts filed a motion for \na preliminary injunction shortly thereafter.  [Dkt. 13].  Defendants then jointly moved to dismiss for lack  of personal jurisdiction.  [Dkt. 25].  The Court stayed consideration of Plaintiff’s request \nfor a preliminary injunction until it could resolve the D efendants ’ motion to dismiss for lack of \npersonal jurisdiction.  [ See Dkt. 33].   \nII. LEGAL STANDARD  \nWhen “confronted with a motion to dismiss for want of in personam jurisdiction,” t he \nplaintiff bears the burden of proving that  the court may exercise personal jurisdict ion over the Case 1:22-cv-11708-AK   Document 53   Filed 04/03/23   Page 3 of 184 defendant.  Motus, LLC v. CarData Consultants, Inc., 23 F.4th 115, 121 (1st Cir. 2022) (citations \nomitted); see A Corp. v. All Am. Plumbing, Inc., 812 F.3d 54, 58 (1st Cir. 2016) (“[The plaintiff ] \nmust put forward ‘evidence of specific facts’ to demonstrate that jurisdiction exis ts.”).  When a \nmotion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction “is made at the inception of the case and the \nissue of jurisdiction is not intertwined with the merits, the prima facie approach controls.”  Motus , 23 F.4th at 121.  Under this  standard, the court should “consider only whether the \nplaintiff has proffered evidence that, if credited, is enough to support findings of all facts essential to personal jurisdiction. ”  Boit v. Gar-Tec Prods., Inc., 967 F.2d 671, 675 (1st Cir. \n1992).   \nThe cour t may  consider “the facts from the pleadings  and whatever supplemental filings \n(such as affidavits) are contained in the record,” including a defendant’s offerings.  Baskin -\nRobbins Franchising LLC v. Alpenrose Dairy, Inc ., 825 F.3d 28, 34 (1st Cir. 2016) .  While a \nplaintiff’s “ unsupported allegations in [ its] pleadings” are not sufficient , Boit, 967 F.2d at 680, \nthe court “must accept the plaintiff’s (properly documented) evidentiary proffers as true . . . irrespective of whether the defendant disputes them” for the purposes of the motion , Adelson v. \nHananel , 510 F.3d 43, 48 (1st Cir. 2007)  (internal citation and quotation marks omitted).  T he \ncourt is to view these facts in the light most favorable to the  plaintiff’s jurisdictional claim.  \nMass. Sch. of Law v. ABA , 142 F.3d 26, 34 (1st Cir. 1998) .  While a defendant may also offer \nevidence, the defendant’s evidentiary proffers only “become part of the mix . . . to the extent that they are uncontradicted.”   Adelson, 510 F.3d at  48 (citing Mass. Sch. of Law , 142 F.3d at  34); \nsee Baskin -Robbins , 825 F.3d at  34 (“We may, of course, take into account undisputed facts put \nforth by the defendant.”) .  Facts asserted in a defendant’s affidavits are not deemed disputed Case 1:22-cv-11708-AK   Document 53   Filed 04/03/23   Page 4 of 185 “merely because [ the party opposing the dismissal ], in an unsworn brief or in argument before a \ncourt, challenges them.”  Chen  v. U.S.  Sports Acad., Inc. , 956 F.3d 45, 56 (1st Cir.  2020). \nIII. DISCUSSION  \nFor a court to exercise personal jurisdiction over a defendant, the court must find \n“sufficient contacts between the defendant and the forum to satisfy both that state’s long- arm \nstatute and the Fourteenth  [or Fifth] Amendment’s Due Process clause.”  Sawtelle v. Farrell , 70 \nF.3d 1381, 1387 (1st Cir. 1995).  Defendants do not dispute the application of Massachusetts’ \nlong-arm statute and instead rest their challenge to personal jurisdiction on constitutional grounds.  T herefore, the focus of the Court’s inquiry is whether the exercise of personal \njurisdictio n over Defendant s here would be consistent with due process.\n1  \nDue process requires that a defendant have “minimum contacts” in the forum “such that \nmaintenance of the suit does not offend the traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice. ”  Int’l Shoe Co. v. Washington, 326 U.S. 310, 316 (1945).  The  Supreme Court has \nrecognized two categories of personal jurisdiction under the Constitution: general and specific.  General jurisdiction allows a court to exercise personal jurisdiction over a defendant in that forum irrespective of the forum’s relation to the cause of action.  G eneral jurisdiction reaches \n“causes of action arising from dealings entirely distinct from” a defendant’s in -state contacts , id. \nat 318, only when the defendant is “essentially at home” in the forum state, Ford Motor Co. v. \nMont. Eighth Judicial Dist. Ct., 141 S. Ct. 1017, 1024 (2021) .  Specific jurisdiction “allows a \n \n1 Even if Defendants did challenge the application of Massachusetts’ long- arm statute, the “jurisdictional \nrequirements imposed by the Massachusetts long- arm statute are quite similar to, though not completely congruent \nwith, the jurisdiction al requirements  imposed by the Due Process Clause,” and courts often “move directly to the \nconstitutional analysis” where “the modest difference between these requirements is not material.”  Baskin -Robbins  \nFranchising LLC v. Alpenrose Dairy, Inc ., 825 F.3d 28, 34 (1st Ci r. 2016) ; see Noonan v. Winston Co. , 135 F.3d 85, \n90 (1st Cir. 1998) (“Because we determine that the assertion of personal jurisdiction over Lintas:Paris and RJR \nFrance would offend due process, we decline to decide the difficult question whether plaintiffs have established a prima facie  case authorizing personal jurisdiction over these defendants under the Massachusetts long- arm statute.”).  Case 1:22-cv-11708-AK   Document 53   Filed 04/03/23   Page 5 of 186 court to hear a particular case as long as ‘that case relates sufficiently to, or arises from, a \nsignificant subset of contacts between the defendant and the forum.’”  Baskin -Robbins, 825 F.3d \nat 35 (quoting Phillips Exeter Acad. v. Howard Phillips Fund, Inc., 196 F.3d 284, 288 (1st Cir. \n1999) ).  Plaintiff  here advances personal jurisdiction arguments only with respect to specific \njurisdiction.  The Court limits its analysis accordingly.    \nIn order for a court to exercise specific jurisdiction over a defendant,  (1) the claim must \n“relate[] to or arise [] out of defendant’s contacts with the forum”; (2) the contacts must \n“constitute purposeful availment of the benefits and protections afforded by the forum’s laws” ; \nand (3) the exercise of jurisdiction must be reas onable.  Phillips Exeter Acad. , 196 F.3d at  288.  \n“Failure to make any one of these showings dooms any effort to establish specific personal jurisdiction.”  Scottsdale Capital Advisors Corp. v. Deal, LLC , 887 F.3d 17, 20 (1st Cir. 2018) .  \nWhere cases, such as this one, involve virtual contact “operated from outside the forum state that residents in that state can access, the focus of this analysis has typically been on the purposeful availment requirement.”   Kuan Cheng v. U.S. Sports Acad., Inc ., No. CV 18- 12533-FDS, 2019 \nWL 1207863, at *6 (D. Mass. Mar. 14, 2019), aff ’d sub nom. Chen , 956 F.3d 45.   \nIn assessing whether a defendant has “purpose[ ly] avail[ed] [ itself ] of the privilege of \nconducting business in the forum,” courts look to “the voluntariness of the contacts [ with the \nforum ] and the foreseeability of being haled into court based on those contacts .”  Motus , 23 F.4th \nat 124.  Purposeful availment requirements can  be met by showing a defendant’s “ specific \ntargeting of a forum’s residents” to demonstrate voluntariness and a defendant’s “regular course of sale in the forum” to establish  foreseeability.  Id.  (citations omitted ).  The mere fact that the \nsuit arises out of trademark infringement, which is likely to cause harm in the jurisdiction where the trademark holder resides, does not on its own rise to purposeful availment without  the Case 1:22-cv-11708-AK   Document 53   Filed 04/03/23   Page 6 of 187 defendant’s prior knowledge of the location of the trademark holder.  See A Corp ., 812 F.3d at  \n60-61; Motus , 23 F.4th at  124-26.  Moreover, t he defendant’s conduct with the forum must \n“result proximately from its own action s” rather than “the unilateral activities of third parties”  for \na court to find purposeful availment.  Motus , 23 F.4th at  124 ( citations omitted).  The purposeful \navailment requirement “assure [s] that personal jurisdiction is not premised solely upon a \ndefendant’ s ‘random, isolated, or fortuitous’ contacts with the forum state .”  A Corp., 812 F.3d at \n60-61 (quoting Sawtelle , 70 F.3d at  1391).   \nGroma -Massachusetts provides several potential jurisdictional hooks to argue in favor of \npurposeful availment.  First, Plaintiff  asks the Court to impute the actions of non- parties Aura, \nRent4Solar, and Stereos  to Defendants when assessing D efendant s’ contacts with Massachusetts .  \n[Dkt. 38 at 14] .  Second, Plaintiff points to  Defendants’  online presence, specifically, their \nwebsites.   [Id. at 15 -17].  Third, Plaintiff highlights Defendant BuildRE’s advertisement in a \nnationally distributed energy industry magazin e.  [Id. at 18].  Fourth, Plaintiff relies  on \nDefendants’ membership in two  industry organizations and attendance at a conference hosted by \nthose organizations.  [ Id.].  Because each Defendant presents similar circumstances in terms of \nits connections to the forum state, the Court treats the examination of whether the Court may \nexercise personal jurisdiction over the Defendants as a joint analysis except where otherwise \nnoted.  \nA. Aura, Rent4Solar, and Stereos \nIn an affidavit in support of its  opposition to the motion to dismiss, Groma -\nMassachusetts’ attorney assert s that non- parties Aura, Rent4Solar, and Stereos  and Defendants \nBuildRE, Groma GPS -Texas, and Groma GPS -Turkey “operate as a unitary business enterprise \nfor a shared purpose, and all of these companies are organized, under the control of, and directed Case 1:22-cv-11708-AK   Document 53   Filed 04/03/23   Page 7 of 188 by a common group of individuals, Patrick Morgan, Barbara Molina, Manuel Molina, and \nAngela Durbin.”2  [Dkt. 39 (“ Pl.’s Aff. ”) at ¶ 15].  As evidence for this conclusion, the affidavit  \nreference s an exhibit that  includes images  of the websites of BuildRE, Groma GPS- Turkey, \nAura, and Stereos, where Patrick Morgan, Barbara Molina, Manuel Molina, and Angela Durbin , \nor so me combination thereof, are listed in various roles, including founder, at all four \norganizations.  [ Id.; see Dkt. 39-11].  The photographs used for the individuals are identical on \nall four websites , and  the biographies of the team members on BuildRE’s website are, in places, \nidentical to those  on Aura’s website.  [ See Dkt. 39-11].  The affidavit also states that Defendants \nand Aura, Rent4Solar, and Stereos identify each other as partners or distributors on their websites.  [Pl’s Aff. at ¶ 4].  \nThe affidavit then  \n describes  a variety of jurisdictional hooks to tie non- parties Aura and \nRent4Solar to Massachusetts , such as press releases describing a deal between Aura and NFS \nLeasing, a Massachusetts -based company ; interactive forms and online webstores on Aura and \nRent4Solar’s websites ; and portions of Rent4Solar’s website and social media advertising that  \nthey provide “nationwide service. ”  [Id. at ¶¶ 22- 25].  The affidavit also describ es other \nconnections between Rent4Solar and Defendants , such as the fact that Rent4Solar’s webstore \nincludes Groma  GPS -Turkey products; that Rent4Solar’s  webstore tab labeled “Buy” redirects to \n \n2 Defendants filed a joint motion to strike portions of Plaintiff’s  affidavit.  [Dkt. 43].  The Court granted that motion \nto the extent the affidavit asserts legal conclusions, such as the one here —that Defendants and Aura, Rent4Solar, \nand Stereos “operate as a unitary business enterprise for a shared purpose.”  [ Dkt. 52; see Pl.’s Aff. at ¶  15].  \nHowever, t he Court may still consider the factual statements contained within such paragraphs, such as the \nreferences to the individuals leading the companies.  Case 1:22-cv-11708-AK   Document 53   Filed 04/03/23   Page 8 of 189 the BuildRE website ; and that Rent4Solar’s  website has a banne r directing customers looking to \nbuy instead of rent to buy from BuildRE.  [Id. at ¶ ¶ 25-26].   \nGroma -Massachusetts  argues that the actions of Defendants’ “business enterprise,” \nincluding Aura, Rent4Solar, and Stereos, “can be imputed to the defendants and can be relied \nupon independently to show purposeful availment.”  [Dkt. 38 at 14].  In analyzing when the acts \nof a subsidiary may be imputed to a parent company, the First Circuit has explained that there must be a “‘plus’ factor —something beyond the [entity’s] mere presence within the bosom of the \ncorporate family”—to establish that the “activity of one separate yet related corporate entity has conferred jurisdiction on another.”  Multi Tech. Indus., LLC v. Huhtamaki Forchheim, No. 05-\nCV-403-SM, 2007 WL 433368, at *2 (D.N.H. Feb. 7, 2007) (citing Donatelli v. Nat’l Hocke y \nLeague, 893 F.2d 459, 465-66 (1st Cir. 1990) ).  Though the Court is not asked to impute the \nactions of subsidiaries to a parent company here, and Plaintiff instead focuses generally on a “business enterprise,” s imilar logic may apply.   The “First Circuit has determined that due \nprocess is satisfied where the defendant in question exercises ‘substantial influence’ or ‘control’ over another party’s ‘decision to carry on the in- forum activities which constitute the relevant \n“minimum contacts .”’”  Duggan v. Martorello, 596 F. Supp. 3d 158, 177 (D. Mass. 2022) (citing \nDonatelli, 893 F.2d at 469).   \nPlaintiff has not established such “substantial influence” or “control” here, particularly \nwith respect to the non- parties’ activities in Massachusetts .  See Donatelli, 893 F.2d at 465 \n(noting that there is a “presumption of corporate separateness that [may] be overcome by clear evidence”).  The fact s that the same individuals may  lead the non- parties and the Defendants and \nthat they include one another among a list of many  “partners” or “distributors” on their websites \nare insufficient to confer specific jurisdiction over Defendants based on the actions of Aura, Case 1:22-cv-11708-AK   Document 53   Filed 04/03/23   Page 9 of 1810 Rent4Solar, and Stereos  in Massachusetts , assuming the latter’s  conduct establishes minimum \ncontacts in the first place .  See Tassinari v. Salvation Army Nat’l Corp., 610 F. Supp. 3d 343 356 \n(D. Mass. 2022) (“In sum, the evidence of overlapping leadership and common policies does not \nsatisfy the jurisdictional standard without more evidence of overwhelming  control.”).  Groma -\nMassachusetts has similarly failed to offer  proof that Defendants were involved in—let alone \ncontrolled or substantially influenced—Aura’s deal with NFS Leasing, whom Plaintiff claims is a Massachusetts company.  \nGroma -M\nassachusetts relies on Daynard v. Ness, Motley, Loadholt, Richardson & Poole, \nP.A., 290 F.3d 42 (1st Cir. 2002) , to support its request to attribute the contacts of Aura, \nRent4Solar, and Stereos to Defendants.  While “the actions of an agent may be attributed to the principal” for the “purposes of personal jurisdiction,” there must be a “sufficient relationship” to \n“permit the exercise of jurisdiction.”  Id.  at 55- 56.  Two defendant s in Daynard  had conceded \npersonal jurisdiction based on their forum state contacts, but two other defendants challenged personal jurisdiction.  Id. at 45.  T he plaintiff there alleged that the defendants were “in a joint \nventure, or at least held themselves out to be in a type of agency relationship.”  Id.  The Daynard \ncourt found that the defendants challenging personal jurisdiction had “held themselves out to be in some form of an agency relationship with” the defendants who had conceded jurisdiction.  Id.   \nThe court also found that the defendants challenging personal jurisdiction had “ratified” the other defendants’ “in -forum activities giving rise to [the] lawsuit” by “accepting and encouraging [the \nplaintiff’s] services, and agreeing to compensate him.”  Id.  at 45, 59-60.    \nThe unique circumstances in Daynard  that allow ed the court to impute the actions of the \ndefendants who had conceded jurisdiction to the defendants who challenged jurisdiction are not present here.  First, unlike here, the plaintiff in Daynard asked the court to impute the contacts of  Case 1:22-cv-11708-AK   Document 53   Filed 04/03/23   Page 10 of 1811 defendants in the case to other defendants  in the case who m the plaintiff alleged were  joint \nventure rs in the conduct at issue in the litigation .  See id. at 44- 45.  Groma -Massachusetts asks  \nthe Court to impute the actions of non-parties who are not alleged to have any role in the conduct \nat issue in the suit.  Second, unlike in Daynard , it is not clear here that Defendants or the non-\nparties “ever represented that they acted with the authority of the other.”  Ward v. Auerbach, \nCivil Action No. 16- 12543- FDS, 2017 WL 2724938, at *11 (D. Mass. June 23, 2017)  \n(distinguishing Daynard ).  Third, here, unlike in Daynard , there is no allegation that the \nDefendants “ initially authorized , or later ratified ” the non- parties’ forum state contacts  that \nGroma -Massachusetts asks the  Court to impute to Defendants .  See Daynard , 290 F.3d. at 55-60.   \nGroma -Massachusetts has not presented sufficient facts to allow the Court to impute the \nforum state activities of  non- parties  Aura, Rent4Solar, and Stereos to the Defendants.  As third \nparties, t heir forum -state conduct is  not relevant to the Court’s jurisdictional analysis  and does \nnot allow the Court to exercise personal jurisdiction over Defendants here .  See Helicopteros \nNacionales de Colombia v. Hall , 466 U.S. 408, 417 (1984)  (“[T]he unilateral activit[ies] of \nanother party or a third person [are] not an appropriate consideration when determining whether a defendant has sufficient contacts with a forum State to justify an assertion of jurisdiction .”).   \nB. Online Presence  \nGroma -Massachusetts  also asserts that the establishment and formatting of websites by \nGroma  GPS -Turkey and BuildRE  constitute purposeful availment because “ the websites  . . . had \nforeseeable and actual consequences in Massachusetts.”  [Dkt. 38 at 15].  Neither website has interactive features, allows online purchases, nor provides pricing information for its products, and neither business has initiated any contact with or responded to any Massachusetts resident through their respective websites.  [Dkt. 28 at ¶ ¶ 21- 22; Dkt. 29 at ¶ ¶ 22, 24] .  BuildRE’s Case 1:22-cv-11708-AK   Document 53   Filed 04/03/23   Page 11 of 1812 website has a “Contact Us’ tab which provides contact information, including a phone number, a \nphysical address in Hockley, Texas , an email address, and a WhatsApp contact number , to \nviewers .  [Dkt. 39-12 at 2].  The website also features an option to “Get In Touch,” which \nincludes a fillable form for users to  submit their name s, email s, phone numbers, company names, \nand a message.  [ Id.].  Groma -GPS Turkey has a similar webpage which lists a  physical address \nin Turkey and  an email address and  has a fillable “Contact Form” otherwise identical to the one \non BuildRE’s website.  [ Id. at 3 ].3  \nThis evidence is not sufficient to show purposeful availment.  “The mere availability of a \nprimarily informational website is not enough—by itself —to render a defendant susceptible to \njurisdiction in a particular forum.”  Motus , 23 F.4th at  125.  Websites are, by  nature, universal \nand can generally be accessed no matter the jurisdiction, but that does not mean that an entity, by creating a website, is thereby purposely availing itself  of the benefits and protections of any \njurisdiction with an internet connection.  See id.  There “must be more” to establish specific \njurisdiction, as “‘the universality of websites in the modern world would overwhelm constitutional limitations’ and render website operators amenable to suit anywhere within the vast reach of the internet .”  Id. (quoting Chen , 956 F.3d at 60).  When evaluating specific \njurisdiction, c ourts have looked for evidence  that the website engaged in  “specific targeting of  \nforum residents and evidence that the website has generated ‘substantial revenue from forum residents .’” Id. (quoting Chen , 956 F.3d at 60).  Plaintiff  here provides no proof that Defendants \nhave done either of these things, and Defendants refute that they have.  [ Dkt. 28 at ¶ ¶ 21- 22; Dkt. \n \n3 Groma- Massachusetts  also presents for consideration the websites of non- parties Aura, Rent4Solar, and Stereos, \nbut, as stated earlier , “the unilateral activit[ies] of another party or a third person [are] not an appropriate \nconsideration when determining whether a defendant has sufficient contacts with a forum State to justify an \nassertion of jurisdiction .”  Helicopteros Nacionales d e Colombia v. Hall, 466 U.S. 408, 417 (1984).   As such, \nconsideration of the websites of the non-parties  is not appropriate .  Even if it were, Plaintiff has failed to show that \nAura, Rent4Solar, and Stereos could be subject to specific jurisdiction in Massachusetts based on their websites.   Case 1:22-cv-11708-AK   Document 53   Filed 04/03/23   Page 12 of 1813 29 at ¶¶ 22, 24; see Dkt. 39- 1; Dkt. 39- 2; Dkt. 39- 11; Dkt. 39- 12; Dkt. 39-22].   Defendants’ \nwebsites “never mention [] Massachusetts ” and “afford[] no [direct] mechanism for \nMassachusetts residents to order  any goods or services” from Groma GPS -Turkey or BuildRE .  \nA Corp , 812 F.3d at  60.  Providing a means for  customers, some of whom may live in \nMassachusetts , to reach out to Defendants , without evidence of whether any forum  resident \nactually initiated contact through the website, is not enough to “constitute purposeful availment \nwith respect to Massachusetts .”  Motus , 23 F.4th at  125 (noting that without such evidence, the \nplaintiff “left the district court to guess whether [the defendant] has any Massachusetts customers, receives any revenue from Massachusetts, or has any other business connection with Massachusetts”) .  Here, Groma G PS-Turkey and BuildRE’s  websites “function[] more like a \ndigital billboard, passively advertising the business”  and offering only a means to contact the \nwebsit e proprietor.  A Corp., 812 F.3d at  60.  That is not enough to show purposeful availment.\n4   \nC. Advertisement in North American Clean Energy Magazine  \nGroma -Massachusetts  argues that BuildRE purposely availed itself of doing business in \nMassachusetts by purchasing advertising space in the March/April 2022 issue of North American Clean Energy magazine.  [Dkt. 38 at 7 ; see Pl.’s Aff. at ¶ 20; Dkt. 39- 13].  The magazine has a \ndigital subscription base of over 50,000 subscribers and is directly mailed to 30,000 subscribers.  [Pl.’s Aff. at ¶ 21 ].  Groma -Massachusetts  asserts that based on the size of distribution, it is \nreasonable to believe that some of these 30,000 mailed magazines went to entities and physical locations in Massachusetts .  [Dkt. 38 at 7].  Groma-Massachusetts argues that this supposed \noffline contact with Massachusetts , when combined with Defendants’  contact with the forum \n \n4 Groma- Massachusetts encourages the Court to evaluate the websites as evidence of purposeful availment usin g the \nsliding scale created in Zippo Mfg. Co. v. Zippo Dot Com, Inc ., 952 F. Supp. 1119, 1123- 24 (W.D. Pa. 1997) .  The \nFirst Circuit has declined to adopt this analysis, and this Court will not do so here.  Chen  v. U.S. Sports  Acad.,  Inc., \n956 F.3d 45, 55 n.3 (1st Cir. 2020) . Case 1:22-cv-11708-AK   Document 53   Filed 04/03/23   Page 13 of 1814 through their  website s, constitutes purposeful availment.  [ Id. at 18].  Besides the speculation that \nwould be requir ed to deduce how many, if any , copies of this magazine made their way to \nMassachusetts,  it is not clear  that this sort of nationally broadcast advertisement is enough to \nshow purposeful availment.  \nIn N oonan v. Winston Co., 135 F.3d 85, 91 (1st Cir. 1998), the First Circuit rejected the \nplaintiff’s argument that a defendant’s intent to reach the forum state could be inferred from the \nplacement of advertisements i n publications with international circulations.   Two of the foreign \ndefendants in Noonan had used the plaintiff’s image for a “full -page advertisement” in French \nmagazines and, with out the defendants’  knowledge, “at least 305 copies of various French \nmagazines containing the advertisements were distributed to, and at least 183 of these were sol d \nfrom, retail magazine outlets in the Boston area.”  Id. at 88.  Those two defendants challenged \npersonal jurisdiction.  The Noonan court contrasted the plaintiff’s jurisdictional claim, which \n“rest[ed] on an advertisement which appeared in 305 individual  magazines , circulated in \nMassachusetts”  by a French company—a “small distribution” —with the Supreme Court’s \ndecision in Calder  v. Jones, 465 U.S. 783 (1984) , where the forum  of California was the “focal \npoint of both the effect and the story” of a “libelous story [that] was generated from California sources, concerned a California celebrity, and appeared in a newspaper with a forum circulation of 600,000 copies.”  Noonan, 135 F.3d at 91 ; see Calder , 465 U.S. at 789.  In determining that \nthe plaintiff’s “Massachusetts -based injury [was]  not enough to support jurisdiction over the \ndefendants,” the Noonan court explained that to “find otherwise would inappropriately credit \nrandom, isolated, or fortuitous con tacts and negate the reason for the purposeful availment \nrequirement.”  Noonan, 135 F.3d at 92.  Just as in Noonan, here, Groma -Massachusetts has not Case 1:22-cv-11708-AK   Document 53   Filed 04/03/23   Page 14 of 1815 proffered  any facts to suggest Massachusetts was the “focal point” of circulation  for the \nmagazine in which BuildRE’s advertisement was published.  Id . at 91. \nThe size and consistency  of the advertisement  in the magazine here also suggest that any \ncontact with Massachusetts was not  voluntary or foreseeable.  “The size of a distribution of \noffending material helps determine whether a defendant acted intentionally .”  Id.  That is, “[j] ust \nas widespread circulation of a publication indicates deliberate action, thin distribution may \nindicate a lack of purposeful contact. ”  Id.; see also  Dalmau Rodriguez v. Hughes Aircraft Co., \n781 F.2d 9, 15 (1st Cir. 1986)  (finding that “the single advertisement” of the defendant’s product \nin a magazine the plaintiff received in the forum was “not the type of transaction that could reasonably lead a manufacturer to believe would  be the basis for haling him into” the forum).  \nHere, BuildRE placed an advertisement once  in a magazine distributed nationally .  Moreover, \nGroma -Massachusetts asks the Court to speculate that the number of magazine copies —of \n30,000—that were sent to Massachusetts residents was so significant that it supports the conclusion that Defendants purposefully availed itself of “the privilege of conducting activities” in Massachusetts.  See Motus , 23 F.4th at 122.  Plaintiff reaches too far.  Even drawing the \nfavorable inference that some substantial portion of these 30,000 copies made their way to Massachusetts, the one- off nature of the advertisement , its modest size in the context of a full \nmagazine, and its national distribution dilute  the contact to such a de minimus degree that \npurposeful availment  cannot be reasonably inferred. \nD. Involvement with SEIA, SEPA, and RE+   \nAs a final jurisdictional hook, Groma -Massachusetts points to the actions of three \norganizations that  at least some of the Defendants have been involved with to establish contacts \nin Massachusetts.  [Dkt. 38 at 18].  Plaintiff’s  affidavit  states that BuildRE and non- party Aura Case 1:22-cv-11708-AK   Document 53   Filed 04/03/23   Page 15 of 1816 are members of Solar Energy Industries Associate (“SEIA”) and Smart Electric Power Alliance \n(“SEPA”) .  [Pl.’s Aff. at ¶  27].  The affidavit  states that SEIA lists more than forty  \nMassachusetts -based members in its dir ectory, published press releases and articles describing \nMassachusetts -based activities , and has Massachusetts -specific webpages targeting \nMassachusetts entities.  [ Id. at ¶ 28].  Similarly, SEPA publishes, among other things, \nMassachusetts -based content  and lists Massachusetts- based entities as members.  [ Id. at ¶ 29].  \nThe affidavit  also claims that RE+ , a series of trade events produced and promoted by SEIA and \nSEPA, holds an annual conference, RE+ Northeast , in Boston, Massachusetts, with \nMassachusetts -based attendees.  [ Id. at ¶¶ 32-33].  Plaintiff states that BuildRE and Groma GPS \nattended RE+ conferences in California.  [ Id. at ¶ 30].  Although BuildRE does not dispute that it \nattended RE+’s conference in Anaheim, California, it asserts that it has not attended any trade show in Massachusetts, and Groma- Massachusetts has not provided evidence to the contrary.  \n[Dkt. 28 at ¶  20].   \nThe Court has already explained why the actions of \n non-parties  Aura, Rent4Solar, and \nStereos  are irrelevant to its jurisdictional inquiry.  Similar logic applies to its analysis of SEIA, \nSEPA, and RE+’s contacts with Massachusetts.  As this Court has already noted , “the unilateral \nactivit[ ies] of another party or a third pe rson [are] not an appropriate consideration when \ndetermining whether a defendant has sufficient contacts with a forum State to justify an assertion of jurisdiction.”   Helicopteros Nacionales , 466 U.S. at  417.  In fact, being haled  into a foreign \njurisdiction through the unilateral acts of another is exactly what the purposeful availment requirement is meant to prevent.  See Burger King , 471 U.S. at  475 (“This purposeful availment \nrequirement ensures that a defendant will not be haled into a jurisdiction solely as a result of  . . . \nthe unilateral activity of another party or third person.” (internal citations and quotation Case 1:22-cv-11708-AK   Document 53   Filed 04/03/23   Page 16 of 1817 omitted) ).  There is no allegation that any of the D efendants encouraged  or were any way \ninvolved in the actions of SEIA, SEPA, or RE+  to the extent that their conduct could establish \ncontacts in Massachusetts.   Mere membership in an organization also involved with \nMassachusetts -based entities cannot justify personal jurisdiction here.   \nIV. CONCLUSION \nGroma -Massachusetts  has failed to meet its burden to establish that personal jurisdiction \nexists over Defendants,  even when viewing the pleadings and evidentiary proffers as a whole and \nin a light favorable to the Plaintiff .  Because the Court finds that G roma -Massachusetts has failed \nto show that Defendants have purposefully availed themselves of conducting business in the \nforum state of Massachusetts, the Court need not evaluate the remaining two jurisdictional factors.\n5  See, e.g., Adams v. Adams, 601 F.3d 1, 8 (1st Cir. 2010) .  Without personal \njurisdiction over the Defendants, the Court cannot enter a preliminary injunction.  See United \nElec., Radio & Mach. Workers v. 163 Pleasant St. Corp., 960 F.2d 1080, 1084 (1st Cir. 1992) \n(explaining that the “absence of jurisdictional authority would render [a preliminary injunction] void”); see also  Covidien LP v. Esch, 229 F. Supp. 3d 94, 97 (D. Mass. 2017) (explaining that \nthe court “must have personal jurisdiction over the defendant in order to enter the requested \n \n5 Plaintiff also argue s in its  opposition that Groma  GPS- Turkey is subject to this Court’s jurisdiction under Federal \nRule of Civil Procedure 4(k)(2).  [Dkt. 38 at 20].  Plaintiff did not plead this basis for jurisdiction in its complaint.  \n[See Compl.  at ¶ 4].

    "summary": "1. **Summary:** The case involves PurePredictive, Inc. suing H2O.AI, Inc. for patent infringement regarding U.S. Patent No. 8,880,446, which relates to an automated predictive analytics factory. The court granted H2O.AI's motion to dismiss the case, holding that the patent claims are directed to abstract ideas involving mathematical processes implemented on a generic computer, and therefore, are patent-ineligible under 35 U.S.C. § 101. The use of artificial intelligence and machine learning is central to the patent as it involves automating the creation of predictive models.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue:** The central legal issue is whether the claims of the ‘446 Patent are directed to patent-eligible subject matter under 35 U.S.C. § 101 or if they are merely abstract ideas involving conventional use of mathematical processes and computer implementation.\n\n3. **Court's Holding:** The court held that the patent claims are directed to abstract concepts of mathematical algorithms for predictive analytics and merely employ generic computer implementation without any inventive concept, therefore making them patent-ineligible under § 101.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation:** Imagine you have a recipe that just says \"cook a meal,\" using any stove you might have. That's too broad and generic to be a unique idea. The court said PurePredictive's patent was like that—just telling a computer to do some math doesn’t make it a new idea. You can't patent something just because it's done on a computer. The court decided this wasn't enough to take away everyone else's right to also do math with a computer.",

No. 14  \n \n \nINTRODUCTION  \nPlaintiff PUREPREDICTIVE, Inc. (“PPI”) brings this action against H20.AI, Inc. (“H20”) \nfor direct and induced infringement of U.S. Patent No. 8,880,446 (“the ‘446 Patent”).  H20 moves \nto dismiss PPI’s claims, arguing that the ‘446 Patent is invalid because its claims are directed to \npatent -ineligible concepts under 35 U.S.C. § 101.  Because PPI’s claims are directed to the \nabstract concept of the manipulation of mathematical functions and make use of computers only as \ntools, rather than provide a specific improvement on a computer -related techno logy, I GRANT \nH20’s motion to dismiss the Complaint.  \nBACKGROUND  \nI. Factual Background  \nA. The ‘446 Patent  \nThe ‘446 Patent, titled “PREDICTIVE ANALYTICS FACTORY,” relates to “an \nautomated factory for predictive analytics.”  Complaint (“Compl.”) Ex. A (“The ‘446 Patent”) at \n1:15–16 [Dkt. No. 1 -1].  It describes that while “[d]ata analytics models are typically h ighly tuned \nand customized for a particular application” requiring “complex manual tools,” such customized \nmodels are “typically useless or at least inaccurate for other applications and fields.”  Id. at 1:20 –Case 3:17-cv-03049-WHO   Document 31   Filed 08/29/17   Page 1 of 12 \n2 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  32.  On the other hand, “a general purpose anal ytics framework typically is not specialized enough \nfor most applications without substantial customization.”  Id. at 1:32 –34.  There is thus a need for \n“an apparatus, system, method, and computer program product to generate a predictive ensemble \nin an aut omated manner . . . regardless of the particular field or application, with little or no input \nfrom a user or expert.”  Id. at 1:38 –45.  The ‘446 Patent purports to fill this gap.  \nClaim 14 is representative of the method, and recites the following elements:  \nA method for a predictive analysis factory, the method comprising:  \npseudo -randomly generating a plurality of learned functions based on training data without \nprior knowledge regarding suitability of the generated learned functions for the \ntrainin g data, the training data received for forming a predictive ensemble \ncustomized for the training data;  \nevaluating the plurality of learned functions using test data to generate evaluation metadata \nindicating an effectiveness of different learned functions at making predictions \nbased on different subsets of test data; and  \nforming the predictive ensemble comprising a subset of multiple learned functions from \nthe plurality of learned functions, the subset of multiple learned functions selected \nand combined ba sed on the evaluation metadata, the predictive ensemble \ncomprising a rule set synthesized from the evaluation metadata to direct different \nsubsets of the workload data through different learned functions of the multiple \nlearned functions based on the evalu ation metadata.  \nCompl. ¶ 17.  Put very simply, the method performs predictive analytics in three steps.  First, it \nreceives data and generates “learned functions,” or, for example, regressions from that data.  See \n‘446 Patent at 8:66 –9:12.  Second, it eval uates the effectiveness of those learned functions at \nmaking accurate predictions based on the test data.  Finally, it selects the most effective learned \nfunctions and creates a rule set for additional data input.  These three steps comprise the predictive  \nanalytics factory’s method.  Claim 1 recites a module -based apparatus for this predictive analytics \nfactory, Compl. ¶ 16, Claim 17 recites a computer program product to perform the operations of \nthe predictive analytics factory, Compl. ¶ 18, and Claim 23 recites a predictive analytics ensemble, \nCompl. ¶ 19.  \nB. The Parties and Procedural Background  \nPPI is a technology company that uses artificial intelligence to provide insight into \nbusiness’s data through the use of predictive modeling.  Compl. ¶¶ 7 –8.  It is  the owner of the ‘446 \nPatent.  Id. ¶ 11.  H20 is an open -source software company that provides a machine learning Case 3:17-cv-03049-WHO   Document 31   Filed 08/29/17   Page 2 of 12 \n3 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  platform called “H20 with AutoML,” integrated with applications and data products.  Id. ¶¶ 9, 15.  \nPPI alleges that H20 with AutoML infringes  on Claims 1, 14, 17, and 23 of the ‘446 Patent.  Id. ¶ \n20.  H20’s website, which includes links to source code documentation, tutorials, videos, \nexamples, and presentations about the platform, reinforces PPI’s belief that the platform infringes \non its cla ims.  Id. ¶¶ 21 –36.  On May 24, 2017, PPI informed H20 of the ‘446 Patent and PPI’s \nbelief that H20’s machine learning platform uses one or more apparatuses, methods, program \nproducts, and systems covered by the patent.  Id. ¶ 14.   \nPPI filed suit against H20 on May 26, 2017, alleging both direct infringement of the ‘446 \nPatent as well as induced infringement of the ‘446 Patent through the H20 with AutoML platform.  \nH20 now moves to dismiss PPI’s Complaint.  \nLEGAL STANDARD  \nUnder Federal Rule of Procedure 12( b)(6), a district court must dismiss a complaint if it \nfails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.  To survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to \ndismiss, the plaintiff must allege “enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its \nface. ”  Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly , 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007).  A claim is facially plausible when \nthe plaintiff pleads facts that “allow[] the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant \nis liable for the misconduct alleged.”  Ashcroft v. Iqbal , 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) (citation \nomitted).  While courts do not require “heightened fact pleading of specifics,” a plaintiff must \nallege facts sufficient to “raise a right to relief above the speculative level.”  Twombly , 550 U.S. at \n555, 570.  In decidin g whether the plaintiff has stated a claim upon which relief can be granted, \nthe court accepts the plaintiff’s allegations as true and draws all reasonable inferences in favor of \nthe plaintiff.  See Usher v. City of Los Angeles , 828 F.2d 556, 561 (9th Cir.  1987).  The court is \nnot required to accept as true “allegations that are merely conclusory, unwarranted deductions of \nfact, or unreasonable inferences.”  In re Gilead Scis. Sec. Litig. , 536 F.3d 1049, 1055 (9th Cir. \n2008).  \nTo state a claim for patent in fringement, “a patentee need only plead facts sufficient to \nplace the alleged infringer on notice.  This requirement ensures that the accused infringer has \nsufficient knowledge of the facts alleged to enable it to answer the complaint and defend itself.”  Case 3:17-cv-03049-WHO   Document 31   Filed 08/29/17   Page 3 of 12 \n4 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  Phonometrics, Inc. v. Hosp. Franchise Sys., Inc. , 203 F.3d 790, 794 (Fed. Cir. 2000).  The Federal \nCircuit has “repeatedly recognized that in many cases it is possible and proper to determine patent \neligibility under 35 U.S.C. § 101 on a Rule 12(b)(6) moti on.”  Genetic Techs. Ltd. v. Merial \nL.L.C. , 818 F.3d 1269, 1373 (Fed. Cir. 2016).  In such circumstances where it is possible and \nproper, “claim construction is not an inviolable prerequisite to a validity determination under § \n101.”  Bancorp Servs., L.L.C . v. Sun Life Assurance Co. of Can. , 687 F.3d 1266, 1273 (Fed. Cir. \n2012).   \nDISCUSSION  \nUnder Section 101 of the Patent Act, “[w]hoever invents or discovers any new and useful \nprocess, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter, or any new and useful i mprovement \nthereof, may obtain a patent therefor . . . .”  35 U.S.C. § 101.  The Supreme Court “has long held \nthat this provision contains an important implicit exception:  Laws of nature, natural phenomena, \nand abstract ideas are not patentable.”  Alice C orp. Pty. Ltd. v. CLS Bank Int’l , 134 S. Ct. 2347, \n2354 (2014).  The reason for the exception is clear enough ––“such discoveries are manifestations \nof . . . nature, free to all men and reserved exclusively to none.”  Mayo Collaborative Servs. v. \nPrometheus  Labs., Inc. , 132 S. Ct. 1289, 1293 (2012) (internal quotation marks and citations \nomitted).  The boundaries of the exception, however, are not so clear.  \nThe Alice court highlighted “the concern that drives this exclusionary principle as one of \npre-emption .”  Alice , 134 S. Ct. at 2354 (noting the delicate balance inherent in promoting \nprogress, the primary object of patent law, and granting a monopoly, the means for accomplishing \nthat goal).  In other words, patents that seek to wholly preempt others from u sing a law of nature \nor an abstract idea ––“the basic tools of scientific and technological work” ––are invalid.  Id.  \n“Accordingly, in applying the § 101 exception, we must distinguish between patents that claim the \nbuildin[g] block[s] of human ingenuity an d those that integrate the building blocks into something \nmore, thereby transform[ing] them into a patent -eligible invention.”  Id. (internal quotation marks \nand citations omitted).  \nIn evaluating whether claims are patent eligible, I must first “determine whether the claims \nat issue are directed to one of those patent -ineligible concepts.”  Alice , 134 S. Ct. at 2355.  “[T]he Case 3:17-cv-03049-WHO   Document 31   Filed 08/29/17   Page 4 of 12 \n5 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  ‘directed to’ inquiry applies a stage -one filter to claims, considered in light of the specification, \nbased on whether their character  as a whole is directed to excluded subject matter.”  Enfish, LLC v. \nMicrosoft Corp. , 822 F.3d 1327, 1335 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (internal quotation marks omitted).  \nAlthough there is no brightline rule for determining whether a claim is directed to an abstract i dea, \ncourts have articulated some guiding principles.  When evaluating computer -related claims, courts \nlook to whether the claims “improve the functioning of the computer itself,” Alice , 134 S. Ct. at \n2359, or whether “computers are invoked merely as a too l” to implement an abstract process.  \nEnfish , 822 F.3d at 1336.  \nIf the claims are directed to a patent -ineligible concept, I must then “consider the elements \nof each claim both individually and as an ordered combination to determine whether the additional  \nelements transform the nature of the claim into a patent -eligible application.”  Id. at 1334 (internal \nquotation marks and citations omitted).  This step entails the “search for an inventive concept ––\ni.e., an element or combination of elements that is suf ficient to ensure that the patent in practice \namounts to significantly more than a patent upon the [ineligible concept] itself.”  Alice , 134 S. Ct. \nat 2355 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).  “For the role of a computer in a \ncomputer -impleme nted invention to be deemed meaningful in the context of this analysis, it must \ninvolve more than performance of well -understood, routine, [and] conventional activities \npreviously known to the industry.”  Content Extraction & Transmission LLC v. Wells Farg o Bank, \nN.A., 776 F.3d 1343, 1347 –48 (Fed. Cir. 2014).  “[T]he mere recitation of a generic computer \ncannot transform a patent -ineligible abstract idea into a patent -eligible invention.”  Id. at 1348.  \nHowever, “an inventive concept can be found in the non -conventional and non -generic \narrangement of known, conventional pieces.”  BASCOM Glob. Internet Servs., Inc. v. AT&T \nMobility LLC , 827 F.3d 1341, 1350 (Fed. Cir. 2016).  \nI. Whether the Claims Ar e Directed to Patent -Ineligible Concepts  \nH20 asserts that PPI’s claims are directed to patent -ineligible concepts because they are \ndirected to an abstract mathematical process for testing and refining algorithms, citing several \ncases in support of its asse rtion.  They characterize PPI’s patent as an attempt to monopolize the \nuse of basic mathematical manipulations without reference to any specific implementation, Case 3:17-cv-03049-WHO   Document 31   Filed 08/29/17   Page 5 of 12 \n6 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  application, purpose, or use.   PPI counters that its claims are not only directed to computer -related \ntechnology but also solve a specific problem in and make improvements to computer -related \ntechnology.  It too offers various cases it claims support its position.   \nWhile the Federal Circuit has recognized “that it is not always easy to determine t he \nboundary between abstraction and patent -eligible subject matter,” several of its cases have offered \nguiding principles.  Internet Patents Corp. v. Active Network, Inc. , 790 F.3d 1343, 1347 (Fed. Cir. \n2015); see also Parker v. Flook , 437 U.S. 584, 589 (1 978) (“The line between a patentable \n‘process’ and an unpatentable ‘principle’ is not always clear.”).  H20 urges that this case is similar \nto Synopsys, Inc. v. Mentor Graphics Corp. , in which the Federal Circuit addressed whether \ncertain asserted claims w ere directed to a mental process or to a computer -related technology.  839 \nF.3d 1138, 1146 –51 (Fed. Cir. 2016).  The patent at issue related to the logic circuit design \nprocess and provided a scheme to translate functional descriptions of logic circuits in to hardware \ncomponent descriptions, without the requirement of certain intermediary steps, through constructs \nknown as control flow graphs and assignment conditions.  Id. at 1139 –40.  Explaining that “[t]he § \n101 inquiry must focus on the language of the A sserted Claims themselves,” the court noted that \nwhile “the inventions . . . were intended to be used in conjunction with computer -based designed \ntools, the [claims] were not confined to that conception” and “[we]re devoid of any reference to a \ncomputer or  any other physical component.”  Id. at 1147, 1149.  The claims, on their face, “d[id] \nnot call for any form of computer implementation of the claimed methods,” and the patent holder \ndid not argue that the claims “must be construed as requiring a computer to perform the recited \nsteps.”  Id. at 1149.   \nPPI distinguishes its patent specification and claims from those in Synopsys , pointing to \nvarious references to computers found in both.  Instead, it suggests that I analyze the case under \nEnfish, where the patents at issue were directed to “an innovative logical model for a computer \ndatabase” with a self -referential property, as opposed to the standard relational model.  822 F.3d at \n1330.  The Federal Circuit disagreed with the district court tha t the claims were directed to the \nabstract idea of “the concept of organizing information using tabular formats.”  Id. at 1337.  It \nexplained that “the claims [we]re not simply directed to any form of storing tabular data, but Case 3:17-cv-03049-WHO   Document 31   Filed 08/29/17   Page 6 of 12 \n7 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  instead are specifically dire cted to a self-referential table for a computer database.”  Id.  The self -\nreferential table was “an improvement of an existing technology” in that it offered “increased \nflexibility, faster search times, and smaller memory requirements.”  Id.  The court con trasted this \nclaim to others that simply “recited use of an abstract mathematical formula on any general \npurpose computer.”  Id. at 1338.  \nPPI also points to McRO , Inc. v. Bandai Namco Games America, Inc. , where  the patents \nrelated to  automating the proce ss of 3 -D animation of a character as it speaks.  837 F.3d 1299, \n1303 (Fed. Cir. 2016).   In examining whether the patent was directed to an abstract idea, the cou rt \nexplained that the computer “ perform[e]d a distinct process to automate a task previously \nperformed by humans” but went “ beyond merely organizing [existing] information into a new \nform or carrying out a fundamental economic process.”   Id. at 1314 –15 (internal quotatio n marks \nomitted).   Instead, it “ use[d] a combined order of specific rules that renders information into a \nspecific format that is then used and applied to create desired results:  a sequence of syn chronized, \nanimated characters.”   Id. at 1315.   Thus, the court concluded that the claim was not directed to an \nabstract idea.  Id. at 131 6. \nFairWarning IP, LLC v. Iatric Systems, Inc.  is illustrative of a claim that the Federal \nCircuit did not consider an improvement of an existing technological process.  839 F.3d 1089  \n(Fed. Cir. 20 16).  It involved  a patent on an invention that “ collect[ed] information regarding \naccesses of a patient’ s personal health information, analyze[d] the information according to one of \nseveral rules (i.e., related to accesses in excess of a specific volume, accesses during a pre -\ndetermined time interval, o r accesses by a specific user) to determine if the activity indicate[d] \nimproper access, and provide[d] notification if it determines tha t improper access has \noccurred.”   Id. at 1093 .  The court explained that “ analyzing information by steps people go \nthrough in their minds, or by mathematical algorithms, without more, ” are “ essentially mental \nprocesses wit hin the abstract -idea category.”   Id.  Similarly, “ merely presenting the results of \nabstract processes of collecting and analyzing information, without m ore (such as identifying a \nparticular tool for presentation), is abstract as an ancillary part o f such collection and \nanalysis.”   Id.  Applied to that patent, the court concluded that the claims were “ directed to a Case 3:17-cv-03049-WHO   Document 31   Filed 08/29/17   Page 7 of 12 \n8 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  combination of these abstract -idea catego ries,” specifically, “ collecting and analyzing information \nto detect misuse and notifying a user when misuse is detected.”   Id. at 1094.   Although the claims \n“us[ed] one of a few possible rules  to analyze the audit log data,”  those rules were nonetheless \ndirected to an abstract idea.  Id.  The mere “use of the computer,”  rather than “the inco rporation of \nthe claimed rules,” was not enough to “ improve [the] e xisting technological process.”   Id.  The \nFederal Circuit affirmed the district court’s dismissal of the suit on the pleadings.  Id. at 1097.  \nTurning to th is case, I agree with H20 that PPI’s claims are directed to a mental process \nand the abstract concept of using mathematical algorithms to perform predictive analytics.  The \nmethod of the predictive anal ytics factory is directed towards collecting and analyzing \ninformation.  The first step, generating learned functions or regressions from data —the basic \nmathematical process of, for example, regression modeling, or running data through an \nalgorithm —is not a patentable concept.  See DDR Holdings, LLC v. Hotels.com, L.P. , 773 F.3d \n1245, 1256 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (“We know that mathematical algorithms, including those executed \non a generic computer, are abstract ideas.”).  That the “function generator module” desc ribed in \nthe ‘446 Patent “may generate hundreds, thousands, or millions of learned functions, or more,” \n‘446 Patent at 9:55 –57, does not change this conclusion.  While PPI claims that this shows it \nwould be impossible for a human to perform such a task, just because  a computer can make \ncalculations more quickly than a human does not render a method patent eligible.  See Bancorp \nServs., L.L.C. v. Sun Life Assurance Co. of Canada (U.S.) , 687 F.3d 1266, 1278 (Fed. Cir. 2012) \n(“The computer required by some of Bancorp’s claims is employed only for its most basic \nfunction, the performance of repetitive calculations, and as such does not impose meaningful \nlimits on the scope of those claims.”);  Synopsys , 839 F.3d at 1146 (“ Methods which can be \nperformed entirely i n the human mind are unpatentable not because there is anything wrong with \nclaiming mental method steps as part of a process containing non -mental steps, but rather because \n[they] embody the ‘ basic tools of sc ientific and technological work’  that are free to all men and \nreserved exclusively to none. ”).  The patent specification’s description of this process as a “brute \nforce, trial -and-error approach,” reinforces that this process is merely the running of data through a \nmachine.  ‘446 Patent, 10:6 –10. Case 3:17-cv-03049-WHO   Document 31   Filed 08/29/17   Page 8 of 12 \n9 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  The n ext steps of the method are similarly abstract.  The method takes the learned \nfunctions, evaluates their effectiveness, and selects those most effective to create a rule set.  These \nare mathematical processes that not only could be performed by humans  but also go to the general \nabstract concept of predictive analytics  rather than any specific application.  Again, the patent \nspecification’s language reinforces this conclusion ; it describes “an apparatus, system, method, \nand computer program product [th at] would comprise a predictive analytics factory configured to \ngenerate a predictive ensemble regardless of the particular field or application .”  ‘446 Patent at \n1:41–44 (emphasis added).  These claims are similar to those in Synopsys ; that the claims “were \nintended to be used in conjunction with computer -based design tools” did not save the broad and \nabstract language of the asserted claims.  Synopsys , 839 F.3d at 1149.   \nIf I accept PPI’s assertion that the claims are directed to a compute r-related technology, \nPPI still cannot show that its claims improve the functioning of a computer -related technology \nrather than use computers as a tool.  See Alice , 134 S. Ct. at 2359; Enfish , 822 F.3d at 1336.  \nWhile PPI points to Claim 17  (which specifi cally references a “computer program product ”), other \nclaims’ use of the term “module,” a nd the patent specification’s reference to the learned functions \ncomprising “a computer readable code,” ‘446 Patent at 8:50 –51, these few passing references to \ncomputers only show that the method uses the computer as a tool for automation of its process.  \nSee DDR Holdings , 773 F.3d at 1256 (“[R]ecitation of generic computer limitations does not make \nan otherwise ineligible claim patent -eligible.  The bare fact tha t a computer exists in the physical \nrather than purely conceptual realm is beside the point.” (internal quotation marks and citations \nomitted)).   \nIn Enfish , for example, the claims improved upon the standard relational model with a new \ntype of self -refere ntial database, which constituted more than “recited use of an abstract \nmathematical formula on any general purpose computer.”  822 F.3d at 1338.  And in McRo , the \ntechnology went beyond mere “organiz[ation] [of existing] information into a new form or \ncarrying out a fundamental economic process.”  837 F.3d at 1314 –15.  But PPI fails to identify \nany previously existing technology that its claims improve upon, or that its claims do more than \ncarry out regression analysis and evaluation.  Instead, its claims “merely present[] the results of Case 3:17-cv-03049-WHO   Document 31   Filed 08/29/17   Page 9 of 12 \n10 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  abstract processes of collecting and analyzing information” and “us[e] one of a few possible rules \nto analyze the [] data.”  FairWarning , 839 F.3d at 1094.  \nPPI’s claims are directed to the patent -ineligible abstract concept  of testing and refining \nmathematical algorithms.  While they may invoke computers as a tool for this process, the claims \ndo not make a specific improvement on an existing computer -related technology.  Because PPI’s \nclaims are directed to patent -ineligible  concepts, I will move on to Alice ’s step two.  \nII. Whether the Additional Elements Transform the Nature of the Claim into a \nPatent -Eligible Application  \nH20 argues that PPI’s claims do not contain an inventive concept sufficient to transform \nthem into a patent -eligible application.  PPI counters that its claims contain both an \nunconventional improvement in its field a nd an inventive concept through its ordered \ncombination .  It likens its claims to those in DDR Holdings and BASCOM .  It describes its claims \nas aim ing to “generate a predictive ensemble in an automated manner” with “little or no input \nfrom a user or expert,” while still offering customization and finely tuned predictive ensembles.  \nOpp. at 19 –20.  PPI points out that its ensembles “do not nee d extensive tuning and \ncustomization” and “are applicable regardless of the particular field or application.”  Opp. at 20 \n(internal quotation marks omitted).  It alleges that this process constitutes an unconventional \nsolution in its field and that its par ticular arrangement is an improvement to existing technology.   \nIn DDR Holdings , the Federal Circuit examined a patent that claimed a technical solution \nto the “Internet -centric problem” of third -party web merchants luring the host website’s visitor \ntraffi c away when visitors would click on merchants’ advertisements.  773 F.3d at 1248, 1259.  \nThe patents disclosed a system that created a new composite webpage displaying the product \ninformation from the third -party merchant, but retaining the host website’s “look and feel” and \nallowing the host website to retain its visitor traffic.  Id. at 1248 –49.  The court found that the \n“new, hybrid webpage that merges content” from two sources and creates a “store within a store” \nwas an inventive solution to the problem of customer loss tied specifically to the Internet.  Id. at \n1257 –58.  The court explicitly “caution[ed], however, that not all claims purporting to address \nInternet -centric challenges are eligible for patent.”  Id. at 1258.   Case 3:17-cv-03049-WHO   Document 31   Filed 08/29/17   Page 10 of 12 \n11 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  It is easy to distinguish the present case.  For starters, PPI does not claim that its patent is \nInternet -centric, but instead that its claims are “necessarily rooted in computer technology” and \n“take place in a technological environment.”  Opp. at 18.  The realm of computer technology or \ntechnological environments is far broader than Internet -centric challenges.  Moreover, while the \nclaims in DDR Holdings  were directed to a very specific problem ––that allowing third -party \nadvertising on websites resulted in decreased visitor retention ––here, PPI’s claims address the \nuniversal problem in any analytical framework of  choosing between a more generally applicable \nor more specific and customized model.  And finally, while the solutions in DDR Holdings were \nspecifically engineered to construct a hybrid web page “stor[ing] visually perceptible elements \nfrom the identified host website,” 773 F.3d at 1257 (internal quotation marks omitted), PPI’s \nsolutions remain the abstract mathematical processes of collecting and analyzing data.  This is not \nthe unconventional or inventive solution necessary to satisfy the second step of Alice. \nNor are PPI’s claims like those in BASCOM .  In that case, the claims at issue were directed \nto “a content filtering system for filtering content retrieved from an Internet computer network.”  \n827 F.3d at 1348 (internal quotation marks omitted).  The filtering system was “located on a \nremote ISP server that . . . allow[ed] individual network accounts to customize the filtering of \nInternet traffic associated with the account.”  Id. at 1345.  While the Federal Circuit found that the \nclaims were directed to the abstract idea of content filtration, they agreed with the patent holder \nthat they contained the inventive concept of “installation of a filtering tool at a specific location, \nremote from end -users, with customizable filter features specific to each end user.”  Id. at 1350.  \nBut the court again clarified that the “claims d[id] not merely recite the abstract idea of filtering \ncontent along with the requirement to perform it on the Internet, or to perform it on a set of generic \ncomputer components,” bec ause “[s]uch claims would not contain an inventive concept.”  Id.   \nPPI’s claims cannot meet that showing.  While the claims in BASCOM  were specifically \ntied not only to the Internet but also to the specific function of content filtration as well as concre te \nlocations, PPI’s claims “merely recite the abstract idea of” predictive analytics “along with the \nrequirement to perform it on . . . a set of generic computer components.”  BASCOM , 827 F.3d at \n1350.  PPI’s claims do not describe specific system architec ture, and references to generic Case 3:17-cv-03049-WHO   Document 31   Filed 08/29/17   Page 11 of 12 \n12 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  “modules” do not provide any further specificity.  While PPI claims that “the ordered combination \nof the claims” provides an inventive concept, there is nothing inventive about its particular \narrangement.  Instead, its claim s recite the functional steps for collecting, analyzing, and refining \ndata through mathematical algorithms.  As BASCOM  explained, an inventive concept “must be \nsignificantly more than the abstract idea itself.”  Id. at 1349.  PPI’s technology, while perhap s an \neffective method, is simply an implementation of the basic concept of predictive analytics on an \napparatus, computer program product, or other medium.  \nBecause PPI cannot show an inventive concept sufficient to transform its claims, its claims \nfail as  patent ineligible under Section 101.  \nCONCLUSION  \nFor the reasons stated above, I GRANT H20’s motion to dismiss the Complaint.   \nAmendment would be futile in light of the analysis above; leave to amend was not sought and will \nnot be granted.  Judgment shall be entered accordingly.  \nIT IS SO ORDERED.  \nDated:  August 2 9, 2017  \n \n  \nWilliam H.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: The case involves a dispute where Concord Music Group and other music publishers (the plaintiffs) sought a preliminary injunction against Anthropic PBC (the defendant), alleging that Anthropic's AI model, Claude, has been improperly trained using copyrighted song lyrics owned by the plaintiffs. The court denied the preliminary injunction, ruling that the plaintiffs failed to demonstrate a likelihood of irreparable harm, which is necessary for such injunctive relief. The case specifically involves the use of artificial intelligence, as the plaintiffs argue that Anthropic's AI model used copyrighted song lyrics in its training dataset without appropriate licensing.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the plaintiffs are entitled to a preliminary injunction preventing Anthropic from using the plaintiffs' copyrighted lyrics to train its AI models, based on alleged copyright infringement causing irreparable harm.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court denied the request for a preliminary injunction due to insufficient evidence of irreparable harm, indicating that plaintiffs did not effectively demonstrate the likelihood of harm that would require immediate relief pending the resolution of the case on its merits.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine you have a special recipe that you've let other people use in exchange for rewards. A company uses parts of your recipe to train a robot to cook, without asking permission. You're worried this keeps you from sharing or earning from your recipe, so you ask a judge to make the company stop until there's a final decision. The judge says, \"For now, I'm not convinced this hurts you enough without more proof, so I won't stop them yet.\"",

(“CCMG”) ; Universal Music Corp., Songs of Universal, Inc., \nUniversal Music  - MGB NA LLC, Polygram Publishing, Inc., Universal Music - Z Tunes LLC  \n(collectively, “UMPG Plaintiffs”);  and ABKCO Music, Inc. (“ABKCO”) .  Publishers own or \ncontrol the exclusive rights to millions of musical compositions (the “Works”) .  Mot. at 2 .  \nPublishes identify 500 examples of the Works in Exhibit A to the complai nt.  Compl. Ex. A, ECF \nNo. 1 .  Publishers  license the Works  to digital music services, social media platforms, and lyric s \naggregators.  Mot. at 3.  Publisher s depend on revenues from the licenses to support and promote \nsongwriters, and songwriters depend on licensing royalties for their livelihoods.  Id.   \nDefendant Anthropic PBC (“Anthropic”) is a technology company whose signature \nproduct  line is “Claude,” a series of general -purpose  AI large language models (“LLMs”).  Decl. \nof Jared Kaplan ¶ 8 , ECF No. 209  (“Kaplan Decl.”) .  LLMs, including Claude , are trained by \ncreating a “neural network,” a computer program that can study large datasets (referred to as the \n“corpus”) “consisting of hundreds of millions , if not billions,  of pieces of content .”  Id. ¶¶ 17, 18.  \nAn LLM’s training  corpus may be assembled fro m information publicly available on the Internet, \nnon-public data from third parties, or internally created data.  Id. ¶ 28.  The corpus is broken down \ninto “tokens,” which may be words  or characters.  Id. ¶ 19.  The tokens are grouped into \nsequences, shuffled, and analyzed by the neural network in the context of surrounding tokens in \norder to learn language patterns and relationships between words and phrases.  Id. ¶¶ 19 -20.  After \nClaude learns statistical language patterns, Anthropic fine -tunes it to adh ere to a set of principles \nthat train Claude to be “helpful” and “harmless.”  Id. ¶¶ 38 -39.  “Helpful” means that Claude will \nanswer questions and assist with tasks; “harmless” means that Claude will not do or say things that \npeople find dangerous or harmful.  Id. ¶ 39.  According to Anthropic, Claude is designed to use \nthe learning from its training to generate original content.  Id. ¶ 9.

Mot. at 5.  Publishers contend that when prompted, Claude has responded with output \ncontaining “verbatim or near -verbatim copies of the Works.”  Id. at 5-6.  Publishers argue that by \nusing the Works to train Claude, and reproduc ing the Works in Claude’s output, Anthropic \nviolates their rights under the Copyright Act , causing “incalculable harm.”  Id. at 8 .  \nAnthropic does not  meaningfully  dispute that Claude’s training corpus includes the Works .  \nSee Kaplan Decl. ¶ 31 (“If [the Works] were included in the training set, it is likely because they \nare commonly found all across the Internet[.]”).  Anthropic asserts, however, that Claude’s \nintended purpose is not to reproduce existing materials in response to user queries , but “ to \ngenerate original outputs that meet the full range of customer needs.”  Id. ¶ 15.   \nB. Procedural Background  \nOn October 18, 2023, Publishers commenced this action in the U.S. District Court for the \nMiddle District of Tennessee  by filing a complaint asserting claims for direct copyright \ninfringement, contributory infringement, vicarious infringement, and removal or alteration of \ncopyright management information.  ECF No . 1.  On November 16, 2023, Publishers moved for a \npreliminary injunction .  ECF No. 40 .  On November 22, 2023, Anthropic moved to dismiss the \ncase for lack of personal jurisdiction or, in the alternative, to transfer venue.  ECF No. 54.  On \nJune 24, 2024, the court granted Anthropic’s motion in part, and transferre d the case to the \nNorthern D istrict of California without ruling on the preliminary injunction motion.  ECF No. 124.  \nOn August 1, 2024 , Publishers filed a renewed motion for preliminary injunction  in this \ndistrict .  ECF No. 179 .  On August 15, 2024, Anthropic filed a motion to dismiss Counts II , III, \nand IV under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6).2  ECF No. 205.  On August 21, 2024, this \ncase was reassigned to the undersigned.  On November 25, 2024, the Court heard argument on the \nmotion for preliminary injunction.  ECF No. 272.  On December 30, 2024, the parties submitted a \nstipulation and proposed order regarding the preliminary injunction, ECF No. 290, which the \nCourt entered on January 2, 2025 , ECF No. 291.    \n \n2 The Court heard argument on Anthropic’s Rule 12(b)(6) motion on December 19, 2024, and took \nthe matter under submission.

LEGAL STANDARD  \n“A preliminary injunction is an extraordinary remedy never awarded as of right.”  Winter \nv. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc ., 555 U.S. 7, 24 (2008).  “A plaintiff seeking a preliminary \ninjunction must establish that he is likely to succeed on the merits, that he is likely to suffer \nirreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief, that the balance of equities tips in his favor, \nand that an injunction is in the public interest.”  Id. at 20.  These four factors are often referred to \nas the Winter factors, an d all must be satisfied.   Id.  Under the Ninth Circuit’s “sliding scale \napproach,” a preliminary injunction may issue where “serious questions going to the merits were \nraised and the balance of hardships tips sharply in [the movant’s] favor.”  Alliance for the Wild \nRockies v. Cottrell , 632 F.3d 1127, 1131 (9th Cir. 2011).   \n“[I]n a copyright infringement case, the plaintiff must demonstrate a likelihood of \nirreparable harm as a prerequisite for injunctive relief, whether preliminary or permanent.”  \nFlexible Lifeline Sys., Inc. v. Precision Lift, Inc. , 654 F.3d 989, 998 (9th Cir. 2011).  The party \nseeking injunctive relief has the burden of demonstrating that it has met the necessary elements.  \nKlein v. City of San Clemente , 584 F.3d 1196, 1201 (9th Cir. 2009).   \nIII. DISCUSSION  \nThis case involves alleged copyright infringement based on Claude’s “input” ( i.e., the use \nof the Works as an “input” in its training corpus), and on Claude’s “output” (i.e., the responses it \ngenerates to user prompts ).  Publishers  sought preliminary injunctive relief to address both forms \nof alleged infringement.  \nWith respect to output -based infringement, this issue has been resolved for purposes of this \nmotion by the parties’ recent stipulation.  ECF No. 291.  Publishers  originally sought  a \npreliminary injunction ordering Anthropic to “maintain effective guardrails that prevent its current \nand future AI models from generating output that reproduces, distributes, or displays the lyrics, in \nwhole or in part, to compositions owned or controlled by Publishers . . . or creates derivative \nworks using those lyrics .”  See Prop. Order at 3, ECF No. 179 -1.  In the joint stipulation  entered \nby the Court on January 2, 2025 , Anthropic has agreed to maintain already -implemented \nguardrails as to its current AI models and products .  ECF No. 291.   For new LLMs and products, Case 5:24-cv-03811-EKL     Document 321     Filed 03/25/25     Page 4 of 13 \n5 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  Anthropic will apply guardrails on input and output in a manner consistent with the already -\nimplemented guardrails.  Id.  \nIn light of the stipulation, this Order focuses solely on the relief related to the alleged  \ninput -based infringement – that is, Anthropic’s use of unauthorized copies of the Works for \ntraining .  In that regard, Publishers seek to restrain Anthropic “from using copies of lyrics (or \nportions of lyrics) to compositions owned or controlled by Publishers for future training of \nAnthropic’s AI models (unless expressly authorized to do  so by Publishers via license or other \nwritten agreement).”  Prop. Order at 3.   \nA. The Nature and Scope of the Requested Relief  \nThe nature and scope of the requested relief has shifted over the course of these \nproceedings.   Initially, it was unclear whether an injunction prohibiting “future training of \nAnthropic’s AI models” would include models that are currently in development or that have \nalready been released.  The difference in scope  – and possibly the nature of the remedy  – is \nsignificant :  An injunction requir ing Anthropic to retrain already -released models, or to rebuild the \ntraining corpus for models in development, could i mpose unforeseeable costs on Anthropic.  \nKaplan  Decl. ¶ 61.   In addition, i t was unclear which lyrics  Anthropic would be prohibited from \nusing.  In its opposition, Anthropic raised concerns that it would be forced to change its practices, \nresulting in large costs and causing “ incalcula b[le]” harm in the broader marketplace.  Opp. to \nMot. at 9, 26 -27, ECF No. 207 (“Opp.”) .  In reply , Publishers stated that they “are not asking that \nAnthropic retrain or extract data from its existing or in -progress AI models .”  Reply in Support of \nMot. at 13 , ECF No. 225 (“Reply”) .  At hearing , Publishers further clarified that they “are not \nasking Anthropic to have to retrain existing models” or “to pull models out of the marketplace,” \nand that the requested injunction would “not include any models that are currently under \ndevelopment.”  Hr’g Tr. at 23 -24, ECF No. 276 .   \nAlthough Publishers have tried to  clarify the scope of the proposed injunction, the details \nremain elusive and poorly defined .  The complaint incorporates and references 500 songs listed in \nExhibit A,  but this list is “illustrative and non -exhaustive.”  Compl.  Ex. A ; see also id. ¶ 37.  At \nhearing, Publishers confirmed that the injunction would extend  “to all of Publishers’ works ,” Case 5:24-cv-03811-EKL     Document 321     Filed 03/25/25     Page 5 of 13 \n6 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  which  number in the “hundreds of thousands at least .”  Hr’g Tr. at 29 -32.  Publishers’ counsel \ncould not say how many songs would be subject to the injunction.  Id. at 31.  Moreover, t he \ninjunction would apply to songs that Publishers currently own and to an unknowable universe of \nsongs that they may acquire  while the injunction is in place .  Id. at 30 -31.  Publishers would also \n“update ” the list to add or remove songs as necessary .  Id. at 30.  Publishers did not offer a \nconcrete or definitive way for Anth ropic – as the party subject to the injunction and the legal \nrepercussions of a violation – to ascertain its parameters or comply with its terms.3   \nThe enormous and seemingly ever-expanding  scope of Works included in the requested \ninjunction raises significant concerns  regarding enforceability and manageability .  According to \nAnthropic , excluding an undefined amount of unknown material from its training corpus w ould be \n“virtually impossible,” and would require Anthropic to “have to undertake constant efforts to \nupdate the corpus, and restart the future model’s training process, potentially out of cycle, every \ntime [Publishers] ‘update’ their catalogs.”  Kaplan Decl. ¶ 65.  “If t he expectation is that \nAnthropic is to re -start the training process from scratch every quarter as [Publishers]  update their \nworks, as suggested in the proposed order, ” Anthropic’s ability to release any new models would \nbe severely curtailed by the length of its training  process.  Id.   \nThus, e ven if the Court charged Publishers with “policing the system within the limits of \nthe system,” A&M Records, Inc. v. Napster, Inc. , 239 F.3d 1004, 1027 (9th Cir. 2001), given the \nunknown number of Works  involved , there is no manageable process through which  the Court \ncould enjoin the use of the Works for training purposes without unduly burdening Anthropic.  See \nCalifano v. Yamasaki , 442 U.S. 682 , 702  (1979) (acknowledging rule that injunctive relief “should \nbe no more burdensome to the defendant tha n necessary to provide complete relief to the \nplaintiffs”).  At hearing, Publishers did not squarely respond to the Court’s concern about \n \n3 Publishers argue  that the requested relief is not overbroad, citing to Apple Inc. v. Psystar Corp. , \n658 F.3d 1150, 1161 (9th Cir. 2011).  In that summary judgment opinion, the Ninth Circuit \naffirmed a permanent injunction prohibiting future infringement of copyrighted work s that \nbelong ed to Apple  but which were not at issue in that litigation .  The re, the injunction including \nthe additional works was appropriate “because liability has been established as between the \nparties[.]”  Here, by contrast, the Court has not decide d the merits of Publishers’ infringement \nclaims or Anthropic’s fair use defense.  Case 5:24-cv-03811-EKL     Document 321     Filed 03/25/25     Page 6 of 13 \n7 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  managing such a vague and unwieldy injunction .  See Hr’g Tr. at 30 -31. \nThe undefined nature of the relief sought here casts a long shadow over Publishers’ \nrequest.  See Trump v. Int ’l Refugee Assistance Project , 582 U.S. 571, 5 79 (2017) ( “Crafting a \npreliminary injunction is an exercise of discretion and judgment, often dependent as much on the \nequities of a given case as the substance of the legal issues it presents.”).  The Court does not have \nunfettered discretion to issue an injunction  that may be overbroad because it includes works for \nwhich Publishers may not have established ownership or control .  United States v. BNS, Inc. , 858 \nF.2d 456, 460 (9th Cir. 1988)  (concluding that district court’s injunction was an abuse of \ndiscretion because it “was overbroad under the circumstances”); see also Religious Tech. Ctr. v. \nNetcom On -Line Commc’n Servs., Inc. , 923 F. Supp. 1231, 1259 (N.D. Cal. 1995) (declining to \nexpand TRO to include additional works protected by copyright and trade secret law, noting that \n“a broad injunction which goes beyond the scope of the allegedly infr inging activities should be \navoided for First Amendment reasons”).  Even if the Court were inclined to issue an injunction \nthat is limited in scope to the 500 Works identified in the complaint, Publishers have not requested \nthis narrower form of relief, and at hearing Publishers insisted that the injunction apply “to all of \n[their] work s.”  Hr’g Tr. at 30 .  The Court therefore finds it inappropriate to issue a more limited \ninjunction.   \nThe Court turns next to the  Winter  factors , and also finds an injunction inappropriate on \nthe independent ground that Publishers have not shown  irreparable harm  on the record presented.  \nB. Irreparable Harm  \nA showing of irreparable harm is a prerequisite for injunctive relief .  Flexible Lifeline Sys., \n654 F.3d at 998 .  Irreparable harm must be “likely,” not just possible.  Winter , 555 U.S. at 22.  “A \nplaintiff must do more than merely allege imminent harm sufficient to establish standing; a \nplaintiff must demonstrate  immediate threatened injury as a prerequisite to preliminary injunctive \nrelief.”  Boardman v. Pac. Seafood Grp ., 822 F.3d 1011, 1022 (9th Cir. 2016) (quoting Caribbean \nMarine Servs. Co. v. Baldrig e, 844 F.2d 668, 674 (9th Cir.1988)).   \nPublishers contend they will suffer two primary types of irreparable harm should \nAnthropi c continue to  use the copyrighted works :  reputational harm and market -related harm .  Case 5:24-cv-03811-EKL     Document 321     Filed 03/25/25     Page 7 of 13 \n8 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  The Court addresses each in turn.   \n1. Reputational Harm  \nPublishers contend that Anthropic’s ongoing use of the copyrighted works will cause them \nto suffer reputational harm  by depriving them of control over the works , denying them credit and \ngoodwill associated with the works , and harming their reputations through the creation of \nunauthorized derivative works.  Mot. at 23 -25.  A loss of control over business reputation or \ndamage to customer goodwill “could constitute irreparable harm” where supported by evidence.  \nHerb Reed Enter s., LLC v. Fla . Ent. Mgmt., Inc ., 736 F.3d 1239, 1250 (9th Cir. 2013) .  For the \nreasons discussed below, Publishers have not made this showing  here. \nThe Court notes that the reputational harm described by Publishers appears largely related \nto Claude’s outputs rather than the use of the Works for training purposes alone.  See Mot. at 24 -\n25.  For example, Publishers claim that “Claude routinely reproduces, distributes, and displays \nPublishers’ copyrighted lyrics in its output but fails to identify Publishers or their songwriters as \nthe source.”  Id.  And “Claude frequently generates output that combines portions of the Works \nwith other lyrics or text, oft en in ways inconsistent with and inimical to authorial intent – and for \nwhich the songwriter would never have granted a license.”  Id. at 25.  The parties’ stipulation \naddressed and resolved Publishers’ motion for injunctive relief to the extent it concerns Claude’s \noutput.   \nPublishers have not demonstrated reputational harm  based on the  use of the Works as \ntraining  input .  Publishers cite to  several  declarations , which  are largely duplicative  of each other.   \nThe declarations discuss the effect of unlicensed use of copyrighted works as “damaging” or \n“harmful” generally, but they fail to identify any specific harm .  For example, Concord’s \nExecutive Vice President of Business and Legal Affairs  and Publishing states that Anthropic’s \nconduct denies Concord and its songwriters “the right and ability to control the exploitation of \ntheir copyrighted works,” and that this “loss of control is enormously damaging.”  Decl. of Duff \nBerschback ¶ 21 , ECF No. 184  (“Concord Decl.”) .4  Although the Court acknowledges the value \n \n4 Other declarations submitted by Publishers echo these general sentiments.  ABKCO’s Chief \nOperative Officer states that when Anthropic “engages in unauthorized uses of the ABKCO Case 5:24-cv-03811-EKL     Document 321     Filed 03/25/25     Page 8 of 13 \n9 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  an artist places on control of their own works, n one of the  declarations explain how or why the use \nof the Works  to train Claude has been, or will be, “enormously damaging” to Publishers or \nsongwriters.  To a certain extent, all copyright infringement involves a loss of control .  But \naccepting Publishers’ argument on this record would imply automatic entitlement to injunctive \nrelief in all copyright cases, a premise the Ninth Circuit has rejected.  See Perfect 10, Inc. v. \nGoogle, Inc ., 653 F.3d 976, 980 (9th Cir. 2011) (“[T]he propriety of injunctive relief in cases \narising under the Copyright Act must be evaluated on a case -by-case basis in accord with \ntraditional equitable principles and  without the aid of presumptions[.]”).  \nPublishers also cite a statement from the Board of Directors of the Nashville Songwriters \nAssociation International (“NSAI”) .  Decl. of Bart Herbison Ex. A, ECF No. 46 -1 (“NSAI \nLetter”) .  There , NSAI Board members express ed concern that by creating new compositions \nusing copyrighted  lyrics, or by turning “important, award -winning, socially meaningful songs” \ninto “something the composers never intended,”  Claude will diminish the value of the works or \nresult in a “misuse of [songwriters’] art.”  Id.  The NSAI letter, which cites several examples of \noutput where Claude has changed lyrics or created mashups of certain Works, relies on Appendix \nE to the Declaration of Dr. Robert Leonard.  See id . Ex. E,  ECF No. 46 -1.  The Claude o utputs \ndiscussed in the Leonard Declaration dated November 16, 2023, pre -date Publishers’ filing of the \noriginal preliminary injunction motion .  See ECF No. 50.  Accordingly, this and other output s \nwere addressed by the parties’ stipulation , and do not provide a basis for injunctive relief .5   \nA preliminary injunction must be “grounded in evidence,” not based on what harm \nPublishers “might suffer.”  Herb Reed Enter s., LLC , 736 F.3d at 1250 (holding that district court \nerred in issuing preliminary injunction without sufficient evidence of irreparable harm).  Because \n \nWorks and exploits those works to its own ends without permission,” it “wrests . . . control away \nfrom ABKCO and our songwriters” and deprives them of the ability to decide how the works are \nused “in ways that are enormously damaging and cannot be undone.”   Decl. of Alisa Coleman \n¶ 23, ECF No. 185 (“ABKCO Decl.”); see also  Decl. of David Kokakis ¶¶ 13 -16, 25, ECF No. \n187 (“UMPG Decl.”); Decl. of Kenton Draughon ¶¶ 13 -16, 22, ECF No. 186 (“CCMG Decl.”).   \n5 Moreover, Publishers’ theory that mashups or other similar outputs may cause irreparable harm \nif they offen d songwriters would essentially require the Court to engage in a hypothetical fair use \nanalysis as to each example.  The Court declines  to decide such questions in the hypothetical .  Case 5:24-cv-03811-EKL     Document 321     Filed 03/25/25     Page 9 of 13 \n10 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  Publishers’ evidence does not demonstrate a likelihood of irreparable harm arising from \nreputational harm , Publishers are not entitled to a preliminary injunction on this basis.   \n2. Market -Related Harm  \nPublishers also contend that Anthropic’s use of copyrighted lyrics will erod e the value of \nthe Works  by undermining the licensing market , damaging Publishers’ position to negotiate future \ntraining licenses with AI developers , and harming  Publishers’ relationships with songwriters.  \nMot. at 26 -28.  In effect, Publishers argue that output containing the Works  and the use of the \nWorks to train Claude  affects Publishers’ position both (1) in the existing licensing market  and (2) \nin the emerging market for licensing copyrighted works for use by AI developers.  Id. at 26.   The \nCourt addresses each of these in turn.   \nAs to the existing licensing market , Publishers  argue that Anthropic’s unlicensed use of the \nWorks  reduce s demand for licenses for the lyrics , and undermine s Publishers ’ ability to negotiate \nnew licenses and to renew existing licenses .  Mot. at 26 .  Publishers have not submitted any \nevidence that Anthropic’s use of lyrics to train Claude reduces license fees with lyric aggregators, \nlyric websites, or other existing licensees, which  provide  entirely different services and do not \ncompete with Claude.  To the extent Publishers are arguing  that lyrics appearing in Claude’s \noutput  undermine s their ability to license to lyrics aggregators, this potential harm is addressed by \nthe parties’ stipulation.  In addition, Anthropic vigorously dispute s that Claude could be used as an \nalternative to lyrics aggregator s, as Claude was designed precisely not to perform these functions .  \nSee Opp. at 2 (“Anthropic’s tool is not designed to output copyrighted material, and Anthropic has \nalways had guardrails in place aimed at preventing this result.  If those measures failed in some \ninstances many months ago, that would have been a ‘bug,’ not a ‘feature,’ of the product.”).   \nThe evidence submitted by Publishers in the form of declarations by Publishers’ \nrepresentatives  are largely duplicative of each other , and state in a general and conclusory manner \nthat Anthropic’s use of the Works  is harmful .  But they do not demonstrate how using the W orks \nto train Claude is affecting – let alone diminish ing – the value of any of the Works.  Nor do they \nshow that training Claude with the Works  is harming Publishers’ negotiating position vis-à-vis \nnew or existing licensees like lyrics aggre gators .  See Decl. of Michael D. Smith ¶¶ 48 -49, ECF Case 5:24-cv-03811-EKL     Document 321     Filed 03/25/25     Page 10 of 13 \n11 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  No. 182  (“Smith Decl.”) ; Concord Decl. ¶¶ 19 -27; ABKCO Decl. ¶¶ 21 -29; CCMG Decl. ¶¶ 20 -\n28; UMPG Decl. ¶ ¶ 20-31.  For example, Publishers have not identified any lost licensing deal or \nany licensing arrangement that Publishers have had to renegotiate on less favorable terms.   \nEven if Publishers’ evidence demonstrated  that Anthropic’s use of the Works to train \nClaude diminished Publishers’  position in the existing licensing market , Publishers  fail to \ndemonstrate that their losses could not be compensated through monetary damages .  See Fox \nBroad. Co. v. Dish Network LLC , 747 F.3d 1060, 1073 (9th Cir. 2014) (denying preliminary \ninjunction because Fox’s harm was not “irreparable,” as it could be compensated monetarily \nthrough existing licensing agreements that “could, at the very least, constitute a starting point or an \naid in calculating damages”).  Thus, Publishers do not demonstra te irreparable harm on this basis.  \nAs to  the emerging market related  to AI developers , Publishers argue that Anthropic’s use \nof the Works will negatively impact the emerging market for AI training licenses and diminish \ntheir ability to negotiate such licenses in the future .  Mot. at 27.  They theorize that “[i]f Anthropic \ncontinues to exploit and devalue  the Works, even if only during the pendency of this case, its \nconduct will become entrenched in the AI industry and the public consciousness .”  Id.  Publishers \nfurther contend that Anthropic’s use “will permanently undermine Publishers’ leverage in future \nnegotiations with AI developers to license lyrics as training data.”  Id. \nThe evidence cited by Publishers is insufficient  to support this theory .  For example, \nPublishers’ economics expert  states that “ [i]f LLM developers like Anthropic were permitted  to \ntake lyrics and other copyrighted works without compensating rightsholders, this growing market \nfor copyrighted works would  likely contract and may collapse.”  Smith  Decl. ¶ 56  (emphasis \nadded) .  This statement is both conclusory and speculative.  Other declarations cited by Publishers \non this point are similarly general  in nature.  They fail to provide  details or specifics r egarding \nhow, if at all, Anthropic’s use of the W orks to train Claude has affected their respective abilities to \nnegotiate training licenses  with other AI developers , or how it will inflict harm  on the emerging \nlicensing market.  See Concord Decl. ¶¶  25, 27; ABKCO  Decl. ¶ 29; CCMG Decl. ¶ 28; UMPG \nDecl. ¶ 31.  Publishers have not demonstrate d a likelihood of  harm  arising from Anthropic’s use of \nthe W orks for training purposes .  Am. Passage Media Corp. v. Cass Comm’cns, Inc. , 750 F.2d Case 5:24-cv-03811-EKL     Document 321     Filed 03/25/25     Page 11 of 13 \n12 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  1470, 1473 (9th Cir. 1985) (finding insufficient evidence of irreparable harm where supporting \naffidavits were “conclusory and without sufficient support in facts”) . \nEven if Publishers had shown that the use of the Works to train Claude will cause them \nharm within the emerging AI licensing market, they once again fail to show that such harm is \nirreparable.  According to Publishers’ evidence, the market for AI training licenses has grown over \nthe course of this lawsuit rather than diminished.  See Smith Decl. ¶¶ 76 -77 (listing content \nlicensing agreements that OpenAI and other AI developers have entered into in recent years).  If \nother AI developers are obtaining licenses to use copyrighted material for training purpos es, then \nit follows that (1) the market is not being significantly harmed by Anthropic’s use of the Works \nwithout licenses, and (2) the value of the loss of licensing fees could be ascertained.  Thus, any \nharm arising from the emerging AI licensing market would be compensable rather than \nirreparable.  See Fox Broad. Co. , 747 F.3d at 1073.  Publishers have not shown a likelihood of \nirreparable harm based on Anthropic’s use of the Works to train Claude.6   \nPublishers cite several cases for the proposition that courts must treat the use of \ncopyrighted works in emerging technology markets with caution and care.  Mot. at 26 -27 (citing \nMetro -Goldwyn -Mayer Studios Inc. v. Grokster, Ltd ., 545 U.S. 913 , 929  (2005), Waymo LLC v. \nUber Tech. Inc ., No. C -17-00939 -WHA, 2017 WL 2123560, at *11 (N.D. Cal. May 15, 2017), \nand Warner Bros. Ent. Inc. v. WTV Sys., Inc ., 824 F. Supp. 2d 1003, 1012 (C.D. Cal. 2011)).  The \nCourt does not disagree.  However, Publishers  fail to explain how this general proposition  entitles \nthem to relief.  To the contrary, these cases demonstrate that emerging technologies often test the \nbounds and principles of copyright law.  Here, it is an open question whether training generative \nAI models with copyrighted material is infri ngement or fair use.  By seeking a preliminary \ninjunction, Publishers  are essentially asking the Court to define the contours of a licensing market \nfor AI training where the threshold question of fair use remains unsettled .  The Court declines to \n \n6 Publishers’ third argument is that the use of the Works for training purposes harms Publishers’ \nrelationships with songwriters.   See Mot. at 28 (citing ABKCO Decl. ¶  28 (“If Anthropic is \npermitted to continue to violate [ABKCO’s] rights, that will cause permanent and lasting damage \nto our relationship and reputation with our songwriters that will undermine our business as a music \npublisher.”)).   The evidence cited for this proposition is similarly general and conclusory, and thus \nfails to establish irreparable harm.  Case 5:24-cv-03811-EKL     Document 321     Filed 03/25/25     Page 12 of 13 \n13 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  award Publishers the extraordinary relief of a preliminary injunction based on legal rights (here, \nlicensing rights) that have not yet been established.  See Perfect 10, 653 F.3d at 980. \nBecause Publishers have not established the prerequisite factor of irreparable harm , the \nCourt does not address the other  Winter factors .  See Famous Birthdays, LLC v. SocialEdge, Inc. , \nNo. CV 21 -9562 PA (MRW x), 2022 WL 1592726, at *4 (C.D. Cal. Feb. 11, 2022)  (“Because the \nCourt concludes that Famous Birthdays has failed to establish that it will likely suffer irreparable \nharm in the absence of preliminary relief, the Court does not reach the other elements required for \na preliminary injunction. ” (citing Tech. & Intell. Prop. Strateg ies Grp. PC v. Fthenakis , No. C 11 -\n2373 MEJ, 2012 WL 159595, at * 4 n.6  (N.D. Cal. Jan. 17, 2012) )). \nIV. CONCLUSION  \nFor the foregoing reasons, Publishers  are not entitled to the extraordinary remedy of a \npreliminary injunction.  Publishers’ Motion is DENIED without prejudice.  In reaching this \nconclusion, the Court does not address whether Publishers could plausibly state either direct or \nsecondary infringement claim s against Anthropic , as those question s are appropriately reserved for \nAnthropic’s motion to dismiss the complaint  and subsequent proceedings on the merits . \nIT IS SO ORDERED.  \nDated:   \n \n  \nEumi K.

    "summary": "**1. Summary:**\nThis case involves a dispute between Samsara Inc. and Motive Technologies, Inc., both Delaware corporations that primarily operate out of San Francisco, California. Samsara accused Motive of infringing its patents and misappropriating its proprietary technology. In response, Motive sought to transfer the venue to the Northern District of California, arguing that the case involved California-based parties, witnesses, and events. The dispute includes claims about AI technology related to Samsara's AI-driven dashboard cameras. The court granted Motive's motion to transfer the case to California due to the case's strong connections to that jurisdiction.\n\n**2. Key Legal Issue:**\nThe key legal issue was whether the case should be transferred from Delaware to the Northern District of California under 28 U.S.C. § 1404(a) for reasons of convenience and in the interest of justice.\n\n**3. Court's Holding:**\nThe court held that the factors considered under the § 1404(a) transfer statute strongly favored moving the case to the Northern District of California. The court found that the parties, events, and relevant state laws had significant ties to California, outweighing Samsara's preference to litigate in Delaware.\n\n**4. ELI5 Explanation:**\nImagine you and a friend started arguing while playing a video game on your friend's console at their home. Even though you prefer to argue at your house because it's nicer, the argument is about things that happened at your friend's place, using their game, and involving their teammates. So, it's fairer to continue the argument there because it involves people and stuff that are all at their place, and it makes talking and solving things easier. Similarly, this court case is being moved to California because that's where all the important elements of the argument are actually happening.",

For the reasons set forth below, the Court GRANTS  Defendant’ s motion.1 \nI. BACKGROUND \nA. The Parties  \nPlaintiff Samsara Inc. (“Plaintiff” or “Samsara ”) is a Delaware corporation with its  \nprincipal place of business in San Francisco, California.  (D.I. 23 ¶ 11).  Samsara is a technology \ncompany that offers hardware dashboard cameras for motor vehicles along with software \napplications that use artificial intelligence to critique behind -the- wheel driver behavior and \nimprove driver safety.  ( Id. ¶¶ 7, 37). \nDefendant Motive is also a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business in San \nFrancisco, California.  ( Id. ¶ 12).  Like Samsara, Motive competes in the market for driver safety \nand fleet management technology.  ( Id. ¶¶ 5, 8).   According to the Amended Complaint , Motive \nengaged in a scheme to  steal Samsara’s proprietary technology over the course of nearly five years , \nincluding by copying Samsara’s product designs, marketing strategies, and other patented technical elements of its business .  (Id. ¶¶ 1, 2, 9).  Motive allegedly achieved this by, among other \nthings, directing its employees to register for and digitally access Samsara’s  products using \ncustomer accounts with fictitious names or on behalf of fake entities , manipulating Samsara’s \ncustomer support team by posing as other Samsara customers , and soliciting  Samsara’s employees \nto defect to Motive .  (Id. ¶¶ 2-5).  T he Amended Complaint asserts Motive infringed three of \nSamsara’s patents  and violated other statutory and common law.  ( Id. ¶¶ 125 -233).  \n \n1  Because the Court agrees that this case should be transferred, it declines to rule on the \nparties’ other motions discussed herein , which remain pending.  ( See D.I. 29, 38, 47).   Case 1:24-cv-00084-MN   Document 60   Filed 08/14/24   Page 2 of 15 PageID #: <pageID>2 B. Procedural History  \nOn January 24, 2024, Samsara initiated this action by fil ing a complaint against Motive \nasserting  claims for  patent infringement, false advertising under the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. \n§ 1125(a), fraud under California statutory and common law, Cal. Civ. Code §§ 1709 et seq ., \nviolation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, 18 U.S.C. § 1030, and violation of California’s \nUnfair Competition Law  (“UCL”) , Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code §§ 17200 et seq .  (D.I. 1 (“ the Original \nComplaint”) ).  Shortly after, on February 8, Samsara filed a companion complaint with the U.S \nInternational Trade Commission (“ITC”)  pertaining to the alleged infringement of the same patent s \nat issue here.   (D.I. 27, Ex. C ).  The ITC instituted an investigation on March 12 (“ the ITC  \nInvestigation ”).  (D.I. 34, Ex 1). \nOn February 15, 2024, Motive filed a complaint in federal court in the Northern District of \nCalifornia , initiating an action captioned  Motive Technologies, Inc. v. Sam sara Inc., No. 24-902 \n(JD) (N.D. Cal .) (“the California Action”).   (D.I. 27, Ex. D).  In the California Action, Motive \nasserts near-mirror claims  against Samsara for patent infringement, false advertising, fraud , \nmisappropriation of trade secrets, defamation, and intentional interference with business relations .  \n(Id.). \nOn February 28, 2024, Motive moved to dismiss the Original C omplaint for failure to state \na claim pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure  12(b)(6 ) and simultaneously moved to transfer \nthe case to the North District of California pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1404(a).  (D.I. 15).  That same \nday, pursuant to an arbitration clause (“Arbitration Clause”) contained in Samsara’s commercial \nTerms of Service  agreement (“Terms” or “TOS”) , (D.I. 27, Ex. B  § 19.1),2 Motive initiated an \n \n2  The parties vigorously dispute whether the TOS created an enforceable contract .  If it did, \nMotive says, the parties would be beholden to the TOS’s  Arbitration Clause,  which states \nthat “ [a]ny dispute arising from or relating to these Terms or Customer’s use of the \nProducts . . . shall be finally and exclusively settled by confidential arbitration in San Case 1:24-cv-00084-MN   Document 60   Filed 08/14/24   Page 3 of 15 PageID #: <pageID>3 arbitration before  the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services , Inc.  (“JAMS”) seeking a \ndeclar atory judgment that Samsara’s claims  must proceed in arbitration and that Motive is not \nliable for the claims asserted in this Court and before the ITC ( “the JAMS Arbitration”) .  (D.I. 34, \nEx 2 at 1). \nOn March 20, 2024, rather than answer Motive’s motion to dismiss and transfer, Samsara \nfiled an amended complaint  in this action (“the Amended Complaint”) .  (D.I. 23).  The Amended \nComplaint added two new claims t o the seven claims asserted in the O riginal Complaint:  a false \nadvertising claim under the UCL; and a  false advertising  claim under  the Delaware Deceptive \nTrade Practices Act  (“DDTPA”) , 6 Del. Code  §§ 2351 et seq .  (D.I. 23 ¶¶ 221-233).  \nOn April 3, 2024, Motive again moved to transfer the case to the Northern District of \nCalifornia and, in the alternative, dismiss the Amended Complaint .  (D.I. 25).  Motive also filed a \nmotion to stay this action due to the pendency of  the ITC Investigation pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \n§ 1659(a ).  (D.I.  29).  \nOn April 17, 2024, Samsara oppose d the motions to transfer, dismiss, and stay.  (D.I. 31, \n33).  On April 24, Motive filed reply briefs on all three motions.  ( D.I. 35, 36) .  On May 1, Samsara  \n \nFrancisco, California . . . in accordance with the Arbitration Rules and Procedures of \n[JAMS] . (‘JAMS Rules’). ”  TOS § 19.1.   And even if the Arbitration Clause is invalid,  \nargues  Motive, the parties are  bound to litigate this dispute pursuant to the TOS’s forum \nselection clause (“the Forum Selection Clause”) , which stipulates  that, “[s]ubject to the \nagreement to arbitrate set forth herein, exclusive jurisdiction and venue for actions arising from  or related to these Terms or Customer’s use of the Products will be the state and \nfederal courts located in San Francisco County, California”  and “ will be governed by the \nlaws of the State of California .”  TOS §  20.  Because the Court concludes that this action \nshould be transferred under the traditional Jumara analysis , it declines to rule on whether \nthe TOS created an enforceable  contract , whether the parties are bound by the Arbitration \nClause or Forum Selection Clause, and whether it is the JAMS arbiter or a federal court \nthat has the authority to interpret the preliminary issue of arbitrability under  the TOS.  Case 1:24-cv-00084-MN   Document 60   Filed 08/14/24   Page 4 of 15 PageID #: <pageID>4 moved to strike Motive ’s reply on the motion to stay and alternatively requested  permission to file \na sur -reply.  (D.I. 38).  That motion was fully briefed as of May 22, 2024.  (D.I. 39, 40). \nIn the meantime, the JAMS Arbitration  moved forward.  On June 4, Samsara filed a n \nunopposed motion in this Court for a contingent stay of any claims found to be arbitral , which the \nCourt so-ordered the next day.   (D.I. 43).  On June 26, Samsara filed an emergency motion for a \npreliminary injunction seeking to enjoin Motive from proceeding with the JAMS Arbitration.   On \nJuly 3, Motive submitted its answering brief.  (D.I. 53).  On July 8, Samsara replied, and the motion \nwas fully submitted .  (D.I. 56).3  \nII. LEGAL STANDARD  \n“For the convenience of parties and witnesses, in the interest of justice,” district courts \nhave the authority to transfer venue  “to any other district or division where it might have been \nbrought.”  28 U.S.C. § 1404(a) .  In determining whether an action should be transferred under \n§ 1404(a), the Court will “consider all relevant factors to determine whether on balance the litigation would more conveniently proceed and the interests of justice be better served by transfer to a different forum.”  Jumara v. State Farm Ins. Co., 55 F.3d 873, 879 (3d Cir. 1995)  (citation \nomitted).   “[A] plaintiff, as the injured party, generally [is] ‘accorded [the] privilege of bringing \nan action where he chooses.’”  Helicos Biosciences Corp. v. Illumina, Inc., 858 F. Supp. 2d 367, 371 (D. Del. 2012) (quoting Norwood v. Kirkpatrick , 349 U.S. 29, 31 (1955)).  A plaintiff’s choice \nof location in bringing the action, therefore,  “should not be lightly disturbed.”  Jumara, 55 F.3d at \n879 (citation omitted) .   \n \n3  On August 9, 2024, Samsara submitted a notice of subsequent authority, (D.I. 58) , \ninforming the Cour t that the arbitrator had delayed proceedings  in the JAMS Arbitration \npending the Court’s decision on Samsara’s motion for a preliminary injunction. Case 1:24-cv-00084-MN   Document 60   Filed 08/14/24   Page 5 of 15 PageID #: <pageID>5 In the Third Circuit,  a motion to transfer is evaluated pursuant to twelve “private and public \ninterests protected by the language of § 1404(a).”  Id .  The six private interests include: \n[(1)] plaintiff’s forum preference as manifested in the original \nchoice; [(2)] the defendant’s preference; [(3) ] whether the claim \narose elsewhere; [(4) ] the convenience of the parties as indicated by \ntheir relative physical and financial condition; [(5) ] the convenience \nof the witnesses – but only to the extent that the witnesses may \nactually be unavailable for trial in one of the fora; and [(6) ] the \nlocation of books and records (similarly limited to the extent that the \nfiles could not be produced in the alternative forum).  \n Id. (citations omitted).  The six public interests include:   \n[(7)] the enforceability of the judgment; [(8)] practical \nconsiderations that could make the trial easy, expeditious, or inexpensive; [(9)] the relative administrative difficulty in the two \nfora resulting from court congestion; [(10)] the local interest in \ndeciding local controversies at home; [(11)] the public policies of \nthe fora; and [(12)] the familiarity of the trial judge with the \napplicable state law in diversity cases.  \n Id. at 879-80 (citations omitted) .  \n“The burden is on the moving party to establish that a balancing of proper interests weigh[s] \nin favor of the transfer .”  Shutte v. Armco Steel Corp., 431 F.2d 22, 25 (3d Cir. 1970).  “[ C]ourts \n[have] broad discretion to determine, on an individualized, case -by-case basis, whether \nconvenience and fairness considerations weigh in favor of transfer.”  Jumara , 55 F.3d at 883 \n(citing Stewart Org., Inc. v. Ricoh Corp., 487 U.S. 22, 29 (1988) ).  “[U]nless the balance of \nconvenience of the parties is strongly in favor of [the] defendant, the plaintiff’s choice of forum \nshould prevail.”  Shutte , 431 F.2d at 25 (citation omitted) . \nIII. DISCUSSION  \nA. Appropriateness of the Transferee Venue  \n“The first step in the transfer analysis is to determine whether this action could have been \nbrought in the proposed transferee venue ,” here, the Northern District of California (“Northern Case 1:24-cv-00084-MN   Document 60   Filed 08/14/24   Page 6 of 15 PageID #: <pageID>6 District”).   Papst Licensing GmbH & Co. KG v. Lattice Semiconductor Corp., 126 F. Supp. 3d \n430, 437 (D. Del. 2015).  Here, there is no dispute that this case could have been brought in the \nNorthern District.  I ndeed, the California Action is pending there between the parties.4  Thus, the \nthreshold inquiry under § 1404(a) is satisfied and the only remaining  issue before the Court is \nwhether to exercise its discretion to transfer the case to the Northern District.  The Court addresses the Jumara factors in turn below. \nB. The Jumara Factors  \n1. Plaintiff’s Forum Preference  \n“It is black letter law that a plaintiff’s choice of a proper forum is a paramount consideration \nin any determination of a transfer request .”  Shutte , 431 F.2d at 25.  “Assuming jurisdiction and \nproper venue, weight is given to plaintiff’s choice because it is plaintiff’s choice and a strong showing under the statutory criteria in favor of another forum is then required as a prerequisite to transfer.”   Puff Corp. v. KandyPens, Inc., No. 20 -976 ( CFC ), 2020 WL 6318708, at *3 (D. Del. \nOct. 28, 2020)  (citation omitted) .  Samsara is a Delaware- incorporated entity that has elected to \n \n4   Samsara briefly  suggests that the  dueling federal court actions are subject to  the “first -to-\nfile rule ,” (D.I. 33 at 2), which “counsels that a later -filed action involving the same \ncontroversy should be dismissed, transferred, or stayed in favor of the  first-\nfiled action.”  Nexans Inc. v. Belden Inc. , 966 F. Supp. 2d 396, 403 (D. Del. 2013) .  \nAccording to Samsara, under that rule, this Court must retain jurisdiction because Samsara \nfiled this action before Motive filed the California Action.  As Motive correctly points out, however, (D.I. 26 at 13), this action does not involve “the same issues already before \nanother district court.”  E.E.O.C. v. Univ. of Pennsylvania, 850 F.2d 969, 971 (3d Cir. \n1988) .  Indeed, “ the primary focus of the analysis is on whether the issues in the current \nmatter ‘concern the same set of facts ’ as in the first -filed action.”  In re Mobile Telecomms . \nTechs., LLC , 243 F. Supp. 3d 478, 485 (D. Del. 2017)  (citation omitted).  This action stems \nfrom Motive’s alleged infringement of Samsara’s patents  and theft of its  proprietary \ntechnology, whereas the California Action principally involves Samsara’s  purported \ninfringement of Motive’s patent  and misappropriation of its trade secrets – two factually \ndistinct disputes.   Accordingly, the first- to-file rule does not control here.  Id. Case 1:24-cv-00084-MN   Document 60   Filed 08/14/24   Page 7 of 15 PageID #: <pageID>7 bring suit in Delaware .  That choice remains entitled to “ paramount consideration,” and , therefore, \nthis factor weighs against transfer .  Shutte , 431 F.2d at 25. \n2. Defendant’ s Forum Preference  \nMotive has a clear  interest in litigating in the Northern District , where it is headquartered , \nits employees are located,  and there is pending related litigation.  “As this Court has often held, \nthe physical proximity of the proposed transferee district to a defendant ’s principal or key place of \nbusiness (and relatedly, to witnesses and evidence potentially at issue in the case) is a clear, \nlegitimate basis for seeking transfer.”  Papst , 126 F. Supp. 3d at 439.  This factor favors transfer.   \n3. Whether the Claims Arose Elsewhere  \nPatent claims arise wherever alleged infringement has occurred.   See Treehouse Avatar \nLLC v. Valve Corp., 170 F. Supp. 3d 706, 710 (D. Del. 2016).  “[A]s to this factor, this Court typically focuses on the location of the production, design and manufacture of the accused instrumentalities. ”  Papst , 126 F. Supp. 3d at  439.  Here, the nexus of the claimed infringement \noccurred in San Francisco, California  – which Samsara does not dispute , (D.I. 33 at 19) – because \nMotive “designed, developed, and [produc ]ed the accused products in the Northern District of \nCalifornia .”  Allen M ed. Sys., Inc. v. Mizuho Orthopedic Sys., Inc., No. 21-1739 ( CFC ), 2022 WL \n1046258, at *2 (D. Del. Apr. 7, 2022).\n5   \nIn addition, Samsara claims that “Motive ’s leadership team” orchestrated its  alleged  \nconduct , and Motive’s employees carried it out, from “Motive offices  in San Francisco .”  (D.I. 23 \n¶¶ 2, 53); (id. ¶ 3 (Motive’s “management team,” located in San Francisco, “endorsed a policy \nwhereby senior Motive employees created fictitious companies to procure Samsara products and \n \n5  For Samsara’s part, San Francisco is listed as the location of the company on the patents at \nissue  here, and more than a dozen of the patents’ inventors are listed as being from San \nFrancisco or the surrounding area.  (D.I. 23, Ex. 1 at 1 & Ex. 2 at 1). Case 1:24-cv-00084-MN   Document 60   Filed 08/14/24   Page 8 of 15 PageID #: <pageID>8 access its platform”) ); (see also D.I. 28 ¶¶ 4-6 ( averring that , “[a]t the relevant time,” a dozen \nMotive “employees named in [the Amended] Complaint  worked in or around San Francisco, \nCalifornia ” at “Motive’s principal place of business”)). \nOn the other hand, the re are no allegations that any of the conduct at issue occurred in, \nfrom , or even near  Delaware.  Neither party is alleged to maintain an office or employ individuals \nin Delaware.  (D.I. 28 ¶ 3).  Samsara asserts in its opposition papers that the parties have other \noffices and employees elsewhere in the U.S. and abroad, (D.I. 33 at 5; D.I. 34, Exs. 6-7) , and \nsupposes that the alleged conduct “may have taken place in any of those locations ,” (D.I. 33  at 19) .  \nBut allegations about those  satellite offices and personnel are nowhere to be found in the Amended \nComplaint ( aside from a single mention of Buffalo, New York ), and do not outweigh the numerous \nallegations that the conduct at issue  here was “carried out and sanctioned by multiple senior -level \nMotive employees, including members of its executive team,”  who sat in Motives offices in San \nFrancisco .  (D.I. 23 ¶ 55); (see also, e.g., id. ¶ 3 (Motive’s alleged scheme  “has been carried out \nand sanctioned by Motive’s CEO, CPO, CTO and other senior employees ” located in California )). \nIn light of the foregoing, the Court concludes that the claims at issue here arose in  the \nNorthern District of California .  Therefore, t his factor weigh s in favor of transfer.   \n4. Convenience of the Parties \nThe Court considers three factors in d etermining the convenience of the transferee forum \nfor the parties:  (1) the parties’ physical location; (2) the parties’ logistical and operational costs of \ntraveling to litigate in Delaware, as opposed to the proposed transferee district; and (3) the relative \nability of each party to bear these costs in light of its size and financial  standing.  See MEC \nResources, LLC v. Apple, Inc., 269 F. Supp. 3d 218, 225 (D. Del.  2017). \nThe parties are both headquartered in San Francisco, California, minutes from the \ntransferee court.   (D.I. 23 ¶¶ 11 -12).  This Court, by contrast , sits nearly 3,000 miles away in Case 1:24-cv-00084-MN   Document 60   Filed 08/14/24   Page 9 of 15 PageID #: <pageID>9 Wilmington, Delaware .  Traveling to Delaware for the purposes of litigation would impose \nsubstantial additional costs in comparison to litigating in the Northern District.   This is particularly \ntrue given that the parties’ relevant employees are largely located in California, including at least \na dozen Motive personnel who are named in the Amended Complaint .  (D.I. 28 ¶ 6) .  Dragging all \nthose witnesses to court in Delaware imposes an operational burden on the parties that would be minimized by granting the transfer sought. \nSamsara counters that Motive has global operations, can afford the  financial obligation,  \nand that there will be a “likely low amount of travel involved.”  (D.I. 33 at 19-20) ; see, e.g. , \nGraphics Props. Holdings Inc. v. Asus Comput er Int’l, Inc. , 964 F. Supp. 2d 320, 328 (D. Del. \n2013) (“[A] s a practical matter, regardless of the trial venue, most of the discovery will take place \nin California or other locations mutually agreed to by the parties .”).  Accepting those arguments \nas true, they nonetheless do not outweigh the fact that both parties ’ primary offices and their \nrelevant employee witnesses are physically located in  the Northern District.  Litigating this case \nthere will impose lower financial and operational burdens on the parties.  This favors transfer.  \n5. Convenience of the Witnesses  \nThis factor carries weight “only to the extent that the witnesses may actually be unavailable \nfor trial in one of the fora.”  Jumara, 55 F.3d at 879.  “ [W]itnesses who are employed by a party \ncarry no weight, because each party is able, indeed, obligated to procure the attendance of its own employees for trial.”  VLSI Tech. LLC v. Intel Corp., No. 18-966 ( CFC ), 2018 WL 5342650, at *7 \n(D. Del. Oct. 29, 2018)  (citation and quotation marks omitted) .  Accordingly, this factor only \nconcerns third- party witnesses , and “ is only given weight when there is some reason to believe \nthat a witness actually will refuse to testify absent a subpoena .”  Smart Audio Techs., LLC v. Apple, \nInc., 910 F. Supp. 2d 718, 732 (D. Del. 2012) .  Because no party has identified any third -party \nwitness who would be unavailable for trial in either Delaware or  California, this factor is neutral.  Case 1:24-cv-00084-MN   Document 60   Filed 08/14/24   Page 10 of 15 PageID #: <pageID>10 6. Location of Books and Records \nThis factor  is neutral .  Motive’s documents, records, and data servers are all stored in its \nprincipal offices in San Francisco, not in Delaware (D.I. 28 ¶  5).  The same appears to be true of \nSamsara.  (D.I.  33 at 20 ).  But t he Court give s weight to this factor  only “to the extent that the files \n[and other evidence] could not be produced in the alternative forum.”  Jumara , 55 F.3d at 879.   \nThis factor receives minimal weight given the state of litigation technology today, the advent of e-\ndiscovery, and the ease with which documentary evidence can be produced electronically.  See, \ne.g., Blackbird Tech LLC v. E.L.F. Beauty, Inc., No. 19-1150 ( CFC ), 2020 WL 2113528, at *4 (D. \nDel. May 4, 2020); Intell. Ventures I LLC v. Altera Corp., 842 F. Supp. 2d 744, 759 (D. Del. 2012).   \n“Because no records have been identified as only being available in either the Northern District of \nCalifornia or Delaware, this factor is neutral .”  VLSI , 2018 WL 5342650, at *7. \n7. Enforceability of the Judgment \nThis factor is also neutral because “[t] here is no suggestion that a judgment would be \nunenforceable in either the District of Delaware or the Northern District. ”  Altera , 842 F. Supp. 2d  \nat 759. \n8. Practical Considerations  \nThe Court must consider “practical considerations that could make the trial easy, \nexpeditious, or inexpensive.”  Jumara, 55 F.3d at 879.  As a practical matter, the parties are litigating  in four separate fora – here, the Northen District, the ITC, and the JAMS Arbitration.  I t \nwould serve judicial economy to reduce that number by litigating the two federal court actions in \none court, and would serve traditional economy by , at the least, “eliminat[ing] the cost associated \nwith local counsel in Delaware. ”  Papst , 126 F. Supp. 3d at 444 (“[T]his added cost [is] a practical \nconsideration that could make litigation here more expensive than in a transferee court like the Northern District of California. ”). Case 1:24-cv-00084-MN   Document 60   Filed 08/14/24   Page 11 of 15 PageID #: <pageID>11 The Court also notes that Samsara’s decision to initiate the ITC Investigation s hortly after \nfiling the Original Complaint in this action  calls into question whether Samsara ever fully intended \nto litigate in this forum at all.  The ITC filing entitles Motive to a stay of the patent claims  under \n28 U.S.C. § 1659(a) , which “Samsara does not contest.”  (D.I. 31 at 1).  As Samsara was surely \naware, t he result is that “ any matters directly relating to the patent infringement claim will not be \naddressed until af ter the ITC investigation is complete .”  FMC Corp. v. Summit Agro USA, LLC , \nNo. 14-51 ( LPS), 2014 WL 3703629, at *3 (D. Del. July 21, 2014).6 \nOne additional practical factor that weighs in favor of transfer is the Forum Selection \nClause contained in  Samsara’s TOS .  Although the Court does not construe the TOS or rule on its \nenforceability, it is nevertheless telling that, as a practical matter, Samsara’s default forum is “ the \nstate and federal courts located in San Francisco County, California”  under “the laws of the State \nof California .”  TOS § 20.  Samsara simply cannot press that clause across the board against its \ncustomer s while simultaneously claiming that the Northern District is inconvenient here .  \nAccordingly, the Court finds that this factor weighs in favor of transfer. \n9. Relative Administrative Difficulty Due to Court Congestion \nThis factor weighs somewhat in favor of transfer.  The Court takes judicial notice of the \nmost recent Judicial Caseload Profiles , (D.I. 34, Ex. 9), as of  December 31 , 2023.  I n the District \nof Delaware, the median length of time between filing and disposition in civil cases is 8.3 months, \nthere are  666 weighted filings  per judgeship, and there are only four sitting judges.  By comparison, \nthe Northern District currently  takes 6.9 months for the average civil disposition, has  486 weighted \n \n6  Samsara’s assertion that its non -patent claims should move forward in this Court in the \nmeantime only tips the scale further in favor of transfer, for the purposes of the practicality \nprong.  (D.I. 33 at 1).  Litigating different claims in different venues  at different speeds – \nall based on  the same set of facts – promotes obvious in efficiencies that this factor was \ndesigned to curtail.  Papst , 126 F. Supp. 3d at 444 (noting this prong’s concern for  “the \ninterests of judicial economy”) . Case 1:24-cv-00084-MN   Document 60   Filed 08/14/24   Page 12 of 15 PageID #: <pageID>12 filings per judgeship, and staffs 14 judges  (with additional vacancies waiting to be filled).  In the \nNorthern  District,  however, it takes nearly 11 months longer to get from filing to trial (48.9 month s \nas compared to 38 months in Delaware ).  Although there are similarities  between the two districts  \nin terms of caseload , the Court focuses on the difference in weighted filings  per judge  (666 to 486) .  \nThat metric, which factors in how complex and time -consuming civil actions are, suggests that the \nNorthern District is less congested because it has about 180 (27%) fewer weighted filings per \njudgeship than this District.  In the Court’s view, this factor weighs in favor of transfer. \n10. Local Interest in Deciding Local Controversies at Home \nThis factor favors transfer, but only slightly.  First, “patent issues do not give rise to a local \ncontroversy or implicate local interests.”  TriStrata Tech., Inc. v. Emulgen Labs., Inc ., 537 F.  Supp. \n2d 635, 643 (D. Del. 2008).  Second, Delaware has an in interest in having its corporate citizens \nlitigate in its own courts.  But the Northern District also has an interest in this litigation, since both \nparties have their principal place of business there, many of the alleged witnesses are California \ncitize ns, the accused products were developed there, and the claims implicate California law .  \nAltera , 842 F. Supp. 2d at 760.  Balancing those competing interest s, the Court finds this factor \nweighs slightly in favor of transfer.  \n11. Public Policies of the Fora  \nThis factor is neutral.   Both parties are Delaware corporation s and “Delaware ’s public \npolicy encourages Delaware corporations to resolve their disputes in Delaware courts.”  VLSI , \n2018 WL 5342650, at *9.   That being said, the parties are headquartered in California , the action \nimplicates largely California -based individuals, and there are key disputes under California law .  \nBecause both fora have public policy interests, the Court finds that this factor is neutral. Case 1:24-cv-00084-MN   Document 60   Filed 08/14/24   Page 13 of 15 PageID #: <pageID>13 12. Familiarity of the Trial Judge with the Applicable State Law  \nSamsara asserts three California state law claims  under the UCL, Cal. Civ. Code, and \nCalifornia common law .  In addition, the parties  hotly contest  a threshold dispute about the \nenforceability of the TOS  and whether the parties should be forced to arbitrate, itself an inquiry to \nbe taken up under the California state law of contracts.   California law runs throughout this \nlitigation.7  Samsara argues that should not matter because “this Court is fully capable of applying \nCalifornia law.”  (D.I. 33 at 18).  True, but that is not the test, and accepting that premise would \nobviate this prong altogether, given that every federal court is “fully capable” of applying foundational state law .  Regardless, t he Northern District of California is undoubtedly “more \nfamiliar” with California law than this Court. \nSamsara also asserts one claim under Delaware law, for unfair competition under the \nDDTPA.  Notably, Samsara asserted that claim for the first time in its Amended Complaint, only after receiving Motive’s first motion to transfer.   In any event, the  DDTPA analysis mirrors that \nof the Samsara’s federal claims.  See, e.g., Mil. Certified Residential Specialist, LLC v. Fairway \nIndep. Mortg. Corp., 251 F. Supp. 3d 750, 757 (D. Del. 2017)  (“Courts reviewing DDTPA \nviolations apply the same standards as they apply to [Lanham Act] trademark infringement claims .”).  Therefore, the Court finds that there is unlikely to be any entirely  Delaware- specific \nlaw at issue in this case such that this forum has any great  advantage over the Northern District.  \nThis factor  favors transfer.   \nC. Balancing the Private and Public Factors \nAfter balancing the twelve Jumara factors, the Court concludes that this case should be \ntransferred to the Northern District.  Seven  factors weigh in favor of transfer  and only one weighs \n \n7  The federal  claims are not implicated under this Jumara prong.    Case 1:24-cv-00084-MN   Document 60   Filed 08/14/24   Page 14 of 15 PageID #: <pageID>14 against, with  four factors neutral .  Samsara’s choice to litigate in this Court is to be given \nparamount consideration.  Motive , however, has shown that th is dispute is between companies \nheadquartered in California, about events that took place in California, featuring Californian \nemployee witnesses, under multiple counts of California law.  On top of that, the courts of Northern \nCalifornia are Samsara’s typical preferred venue per its TOS , and this action will ultimately be at \nleast partially – i f not fully – stayed in light of the parties ’ ongoing disputes in other venues .  \nEvaluating the factors together and giving each its appropriate weight, Motive has shown that the \nJumara factors weigh strongly in favor of transfer.    \nIV. CONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, Defendant’s  motion to transfer the case to the United States \nDistrict Court for the Northern District of California  pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1404(a) is \nGRANTED.  An appropriate order will follow. Case 1:24-cv-00084-MN   Document 60   Filed 08/14/24   Page 15 of 15 PageID #: <pageID>",

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: Loop AI Labs Inc., a startup developing AI technology, sued its former CEO Anna Gatti and others, claiming misappropriation of trade secrets and other violations. The case involves Loop's motion to subpoena documents from several entities, which Gatti and her related companies opposed, arguing privacy and irrelevance. The court granted and denied parts of the motion, allowing some subpoenas with modifications to address privacy concerns, showcasing the involvement of AI through Loop's technology being a core aspect of the trade secrets discussed.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether Loop AI Labs Inc. is entitled to the discovery of documents from third parties regarding alleged trade secret misappropriation and other claims against Anna Gatti and others, considering privacy and relevance objections.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court granted Loop’s subpoenas in part, allowing the requested discovery with certain limitations on time frames and scope to protect against privacy invasion and ensure relevance, while denying parts of the subpoenas deemed overly broad or inadequately justified.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine a company makes special secret recipes and their ex-boss is accused of stealing those secrets to make money elsewhere. The company wants to check phone records and money trails to prove their claims. The court said they could look at some things but not others and had to be careful about privacy.",

BACKGROUND  \nLoop filed this action in February  2015 against Defendants Almawave USA; Almaviva \nS.p.A. (“Almaviva”) and Almawave S.r.l. (together, the “Almaviva Defendants”); Gatti; IQSystem \nLLC; and IQSystem Inc.  Loop is a startup that develops artificial intelligence technology.  It \nalleges that Gatt i, its former CEO, conspired with the Almaviva Defendants to misappropriate \nLoop’s trade secrets and sabotage its investor negotiations.  According to Loop, while pretending \nto work full time for Loop, Gatti took a concurrent CEO position with Almawave USA  and \nallegedly established IQSystem LLC and IQSystem Inc. “to funnel the money that she was \nreceiving as compensation” for her  illegal  activities.

(“Google”) ; 3) WI Harper Group, Inc.  (“WI \nHarper”) ; 4) Carr &  Ferrell, LLP  (“Carr & Ferrell”); and 5) Bank of the West.  Joint Letter Exs. 1 -\n5.  Defendants Gatti, IQSystem LLC, and IQSystem Inc.  move for a protective order as to each of \nthe fi ve subpoenas, arguing that they improperly seek  their private and privileg ed information that \nis irrelevant to this action.  \nII. LEGAL STANDARD  \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 45 governs discovery of nonparties by subpoena.  Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 45.  The Advisory Committee Notes to Rule 45 state that “the scope of discovery through a \nsubpoena is the same as that applicable to Rule 34 and the other discovery rules,” which in turn is \nthe same as under Rule 26(b).  Advisory Committee Notes to 1970 Amendment.  Rule 26(b) \nallows a party to obtain discovery concerning  \n \nany nonprivileged  matter that is relevant to any party’s claim or \ndefense and proportional to the needs of the case, considering the \nimportance of the issues at stake in the action, the amount in \ncontroversy, the parties’ relative access to relevant information, the \npartie s’ resources, the importance of the discovery in resolving the \nissues, and whether the burden or expense of the proposed discovery \noutweighs its likely benefit.  \nFed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(1).  “Information within this scope of discovery need not be admissible i n \nevidence to be discoverable.”  Id. \nRule 45 provides that “on timely motion, the court for the district where compliance is \nrequired must quash or modify a subpoena that . . . requires disclosure of privileged or other \nprotected matter, if no exception or  waiver applies; or . . . subjects a person to undue burden.”  \nFed. R. Civ. P. 45(c)(3)(A)(iii), (iv).  “[A] court determining the propriety of a subpoena balances \nthe relevance of the discovery sought, the requesting party’s need, and the potential hardsh ip to the Case 4:15-cv-00798-HSG   Document 437   Filed 02/29/16   Page 2 of 12 \n3 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  party subject to the subpoena.”  Gonzales v. Google , 234 F.R.D. 674, 680 (N.D. Cal. 2006) \n(citation omitted).  The party who moves to quash a subpoena bears the “burden of persuasion” \nunder Rule 45(c)(3).  Moon v. SCP Pool Corp ., 232 F.R.D. 633, 637 (C.D. Cal. 2005) (citations \nomitted).  \nA party generally lacks standing under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure Rule 45(c)(3) to \nchallenge a subpoena issued to a non -party “unless the party claims a personal right or privilege \nwith respect to the documents requested in the subpoena. ”  In re REMEC, Inc. Sec. Litig ., No. CIV \n04CV1948 JLS AJB, 2008 WL 2282647, at *1 (S.D. Cal. May 30, 2008) (citing Nova Prod s., Inc. \nv. Kisma Video, Inc. , 220 F.R.D. 238, 241 (S.D.N.Y.  2004); In re Cree Inc.

DISCUSSION  \nAs a preliminary matter, Defendants2 appear to object to all five subpoenas on the ground \nthat Loop has failed to comply with California Code of Civil Procedure section 2019.210.  Loop \nalleges a claim for misappropriation of trade secrets pursuant to California Civil Code section \n3426, California’s Uniform Trade Secrets Act (“CUTSA”).  Section 2019.210 provides that in any \naction alleging misappropriation of trade secrets under CUTSA, “before co mmencing discovery \nrelating to the trade secret, the party alleging the misappropriation shall identify the trade secret \nwith reasonable particularity subject to any orders that may be appropriate under Section 3426.5 of \nthe Civil Code.”  Cal. Civ. Proc. C ode § 2019.2 10.  Although it is not clearly stated, i t appears that \nDefendants ’ position is that unless and until Plaintiff identifies its alleged t rade secrets with \n                                                 \n2 The joint letter does not always make clear on whose behalf the objections are made, whether it \nbe Gatti, IQSystem LLC, or IQSystem Inc., or some combination thereof .  Therefore, the court \nwill refer to the objections as “Defendants’ objections,” meaning Gatti, IQSystem LLC, and \nIQSystem Inc. collectively.  Case 4:15-cv-00798-HSG   Document 437   Filed 02/29/16   Page 3 of 12 \n4 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  particularity, Plaintiff is not entitled to discovery.   \nThis argument is without merit.  After the parties filed the instant joint letter, the \nundersigned granted in part and denied in part Defendant IQSystem Inc.’s motion to compel Loop \nto provide a particularized trade secret disclosure pursuant to section 2019.210 and to stay \ndiscovery unti l Loop provides such disclosure.  [Docket No. 331.]  The court concluded that \nsection 2019.210 applies in this case and that Loop  had failed to sufficiently identify the trade \nsecrets at issue.  However, the court denied IQSystem Inc.’s motion to stay all discovery in this \ncase pending Loop’s compliance with section 2019.210, holding that section 2019.210 only \nsupports a stay of “discovery related to the trade secret[s].”  Id. at 7.  The court stayed discovery as \nto Loop’s CUTSA claim only, and ordered that  Loop could proceed with such discovery upon \nfiling a statement identifying with reasonable particularity the trade secrets at issue in this lawsuit.  \nId. \nLoop filed a statement regardi ng its trade secrets on January 11, 2016.  Without expressing \nan opinion on the sufficiency of Loop’s disclosure, the court notes that to date, n o party has moved \nto challenge Loop’s disclosure .  Moreover, there is no  argument or  indication th at the five \nsubpoenas at issue relate  solely to Loop’s CUTSA claim.  Accordingly, Defendants’ objections to \nthe five subpoenas based on section 2019.210 are overruled.  \nA. Subpoena to AT&T  \nLoop’s subpoena to AT&T seeks “all records reflecting the incoming and outgoing call \nhistory, text or other data messages, and data transfer from March 1, 2013 through the present” for \nfive specified phone numbers  that are associated with accounts held by Gatti, IQSystem LLC, and \nIQSystem Inc.  The subpoena also asks for the same information for any other phone numbers \nheld by Gatti.   Loop argues that the records of communications by Gatti, IQSystem LLC, and \nIQSystem Inc. are highly relevant to its allegations about Gatti’s participation in a conspiracy \ninvolving wire fraud.  In its second amended complaint, Loop  alleges that “Gatti utilized a wide \nvariety of communications means including in -person meetings, teleconference meetings, \ntelephone calls, emails, text messages, and social media messages” in order “[t]o carry out as well \nas conceal her fraudulent activi ties and wrongdoings.”  2d Am. Compl. ¶ 143 .  It also argues that Case 4:15-cv-00798-HSG   Document 437   Filed 02/29/16   Page 4 of 12 \n5 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  Gatti justified “repeated disappearances” from work on the basis of personal reasons, and that \nthese records will confirm “her true whereabouts and activities” during her employment with \nLoop.   \nDefendants object on the ground that the subpoena potentially calls for attorney -client \ncommunications and documents protected by California’s right to privacy, such as \ncommunications between Gatti and her physician.   They also argue that the subpoena  may not be \nenforced to t he extent that it violates the f ederal Stored Communications Act  (“SCA”) , 18 U.S.C. \n§§ 2701 -2712.   Further, Defendants argue that the subpoena is overbroad as to time and scope and \ncalls for documents not relevant to any party’s cl aim or defense, since it seeks information about \ncommunications that post -date the allegations in the operative complaint.   \nDefendants’  privacy objections appear solely based on their reading of the subpoena as \ncalling for the substance  of potentially pri vileged or protected communications.  This is contrary \nto Loop’s intent, since Loop contends that it does not seek the content of the communications.  \nAccording to Loop, it simply seeks “a list of technical data of the date/time the communication \nwas made or received, the numbers called, and other technical  data.”  Jt. Letter at 3.   It argues that \ndisclosure of such data —and not the contents of communications themselves —is expressly \npermitted by the SCA .   \nCivil subpoenas are subject to the prohibitions of the SCA.  See Theofel v. Farey -Jones , \n359 F.3d 1066, 1071 -72, 1077 (9th Cir. 2004).  The SCA generally prohibits “‘providers’ of \ncommunication services from divulging private communications to certain entities and/or \nindividuals.”  Quon  v. Arch Wireless Operating Co., Inc ., 529 F.3d 892, 90 0 (9th Cir. 2008) , rev’d \non other grounds by City of Ontario v. Quon , 560 U.S. 746 (2010).   It permits an electronic \ncommunications service provider to “divulge a record or other information pertaining  to a \nsubscriber to or customer of such service  (not including the contents of communications . . . ) . . . \nto any person other than a governmental entity.”   18 U.S.C. § 2702(c)(6).  The Ninth Circuit has \nheld that w ireless communications providers such as  AT&T are properly classified as “electronic \ncommunication service [s].”  Quon , 529 F.3d at 901; see Mintz v. Mark Bartelstein & Assocs., Inc. , \n885 F. Supp. 2d 987, 992 (C.D. Cal. 2012).  Because Loop is not a governmental entity, AT&T Case 4:15-cv-00798-HSG   Document 437   Filed 02/29/16   Page 5 of 12 \n6 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  may disclose to it the subscriber information  requested by the subpoena .  See id . at 992 -93 \n(holding SCA permits AT&T to disclose subscriber information pursuant to subpoena, including \ndate, time, originating and receiving telephone number  for specified date range) ; see also  Obodai \nv. Indeed, Inc. , No. 13 -80027 -MISC EMC  (KAW) , 2013 WL 1191267, at *3 (N.D. Cal. Mar. 21, \n2013)  (“Since subscriber information is not protected by the SCA, [litigant] may obtain non -\ncontent information pursu ant to a valid, civil subpoena.”) .  AT&T may not provide the content of \nany communications, including text messages , consistent with the SCA .3  See Mintz , 885 F. Supp. \n2d at 993 .  To the extent that Loop’s subpoena could be read to request the content of the \nrequested communications, this order explicitly holds that AT&T is prohibited from  provid ing the \ncontent of any communications.   \nAs to the scope of the subpoena, Loop s eeks the requested information from March 1, 2013 \nthrough the present.4  Loop argues that the time frame is appropriate since Gatti’s scheme \n“continues to date as alleged in the Second Amended Complaint.”  Jt. Letter at 2.  It also argues \nthat Gatti has co ntinued to improperly solicit Loop’s confidential investors and advisors by phone \nand text messages “as recently as a few weeks ago.”  Id.  Loop gives no other information about \nthese allegedly improper activities.  In the second amended complaint, Loop ma kes a number of \nallegations about Gatti’s continued wrongdoing, including the allegation that after her termination \nfrom Loop, Gatti continued to make false and misleading communications with Loop’s employees \nand investors “with the intent to cause further  damage to [Loop].”  2d Am. Compl. ¶ 36.  It alleges \nthat before and after Gatti’s termination, she has “continued to use text messaging to solicit \n[Loop’s] confidential contacts, witnesses, past, current and prospective investors, advisors and \ntheir famil ies,” and that Gatti “recently ” solicited by text messages “key individuals in investment \nfunds” at issue in this action.   Id. at ¶ 143; see also  ¶¶ 147, 149, 226 (“Defendants’ [racketeering] \nactivities were ongoing for at least one year, and continued thr ough her termination from [Loop] \n                                                 \n3 Since the content of Defendants’ communications is not at issue, Defendants’ privacy objections \nare overruled.  \n \n4 Defendants ask the court to limit the time period to June 1, 2012 t hrough  February 23, 2015, the \ndate Loop filed its complaint.  However, the AT&T subpoena  does not seek data prior to March 1, \n2013.  Case 4:15-cv-00798-HSG   Document 437   Filed 02/29/16   Page 6 of 12 \n7 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  on February 3, 2015.”).   Given Plaintiff’s allegations about Gatti’s continued wrongdoing, the \ncourt finds that the appropriate time period for the information requested in the AT&T subpoena is \nMarch 1, 2013 through Septemb er 23, 2015 , the date Loop filed its second amended complaint.  \nB. Subpoena to Google  \nLoop’s subpoena to Google requests four categories of information , two of which are \nsubject to Defendants’ objections : 1) all documents and communications concerning Gatti’s \nemployment with Google and Youtube, Inc. (“Youtube”), including her complete \nemployee/personnel file  (Request for Production (RFP) 1) ; and 2) any documents related to any \napplication for unemployment benefits made by Gatti for which Google or Youtube recei ved \nnotification  (RFP 3) .  Defendants  argue that the requested information, including the “day to day \nins and outs of Gatti’s employment with Google,” is not relevant to any party’s claims or defenses, \nand that Gatti’s employment file is private.   \nIn response, Loop argues that Gatti’s employment records are “critically at issue in this \ncase,” because Loop alleges that Gatti made material misrepresentations regarding her past \nemployment, compensation, and academic history in order to fraudulently ind uce Loop into giving \nher a large percentage of company shares and a high salary.  Jt. Letter at 4.  While Loop alleges a \nclaim of fraud in the inducement against Gatti  based upon alleged misrepresentations about her \neducation and prior employment at the Un iversity of California, Berkeley and Skype, it makes no \nallegations about any misrepresentations by Gatti about her employment with Google or Youtube  \nin connection with that or any other claim .  See 2d Am. Compl. ¶¶ 258 -262.  Moreover, to the \nextent that L oop seeks to confirm details about Gatti’s employment with Google and Youtube, \nsuch as the dates of employment and compensation, it does not need the contents of Gatti’s \npersonnel file to do so; it can obtain this information through less burdensome source s, including \ndepositions of Gatti and/or her former supervisors.  Since Gatti’s personnel file from Google \nand/or Youtube are of minimal relevance and are not proportional to the needs of the case, \nDefendants’  motion to quash the subpoena to Google is gran ted as to RFP 1 .  See Fed. R. Civ. P. \n26(b)(1).   This ruling is made without prejudice to Loop re -serving the portion of its subpoena \nseeking Gatti’s personnel file from Google  and/or YouTube  should Loop learn facts in discovery Case 4:15-cv-00798-HSG   Document 437   Filed 02/29/16   Page 7 of 12 \n8 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  that establish the clear re levance of th ose personnel file s. \nAs to any application by Gatti for unemployment benefits, Loop offers no argument about \nthe relevance of such documents .  Accordingly, the motion to quash the subpoena is granted as to \nRFP 3 . \nC. Subpoena to WI Harper Group  \nLoop’s subpoena to WI Harper Group seeks 24 categories of information.  Defendants \nobject to  the following  four categories: 1) all documents and communications related to, referring \nto, or in any way discussing or including th e name Anna Gatti or any of Gatti’s contact \ninformation  (RFP 3) ; 2) all text messages between anyone at WI Harper Group and Gatti, \nincluding any text messages to or from Shahi Ghanem  (RFP 4) ; 3) all LinkedIn, Facebook, and \nany other social media messages to or from Anna Gatti and anyone at WI Harper Group, including \nany message or request sent to Peter Liu  (RFP 6) ; and 4) all documents and communications \nregarding or relating to IQSystem Inc.  and IQSystem LLC  (RFP 16) . \nLoop explains that WI Harper was one of Loop’s business relationships that “was \ndestroyed by Gatti directly and through the other Defendants,” and that Gatti  improperly continued \nto solicit WI Harper after her termination.  Loop contends that Gatti admitted that she has waived \nobjections to this subpoena since she did not assert objections to the Almaviva Defendants’ \nsubpoena to WI Harper seeking “all document s related to Anna Gatti.”  Jt. Letter at 5.   \nAlthough not clearly stated, it appears that Defendants object to these four categories of \ninformation on privacy and overbreadth grounds.  However, they provide no support or \nexplanation for these objections, merely incorporating by reference their arguments related to the \nAT&T subpoena , which do not appear applicable.  They also do not respond to Loop’s assertion , \nand therefore concede  that Defendants waived their objections to the subpoena.  Accordingly, the \nmotion to quash the WI Harper subpoena is denied.  \nD. Subpoena to Carr & Ferrell  \nLoop’s subpoena to the Carr & Ferrell law firm seeks thirteen categories of documents .  \nDefendants object to the following categories: 1) correspondence by attorney Jeffrey Capaccio \nregarding Loop, its employees, Gatti, Tony DiNapoli, Gennaro DiNapoli, and the Almaviva Case 4:15-cv-00798-HSG   Document 437   Filed 02/29/16   Page 8 of 12 \n9 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  Defendants , and document s from Capaccio’s files regarding the same (RFP 2); 2) all documents \nregarding IQSystem Inc. and IQSystem LLC (RFP 3); 3) documents regarding payments to \nCapaccio from Gatti, Tony DiNapoli, or any of the defendants (RFP 4); 4) all documents related to \nthe Almaviva Defendants or the IQSystem Defendants’ goals for, expectations of, and \nrequirements for Carr & Ferrell in connection with its work as a contractor for the Almaviva \nDefendants (RFP 5); 5) communications with Gatti from March 1, 2013 through the pre sent (RFP \n6); and communications by or to Capaccio regarding this litigation (RFP 10).  Defendants also \nobject to RFP 1, which seeks all engagement letters between Carr & Ferrell and any of the \ndefendants in this action and/or Tony DiNapoli.   Loop contends  that Capaccio is Gatti’s co -\nconspirator, and a close friend of Gatti’s boyfriend and alleged co -conspirator Tony DiNapoli.  It \nalleges that Capaccio schemed with Gatti to force Loop to sell its intellectual property at a bargain \nprice.  See 2d Am. Compl. ¶¶ 211 -13.  Loop alleges that Capaccio and DiNapoli “have a tried and \ntrue modus operandi for seeking to force start -ups to sell on the cheap to other companies.”  Id. at \n211.   \nDefendants again incorporate by reference their arguments related to the AT&T subpoena.  \nThey baldly assert  that the subpoena calls for attorney -client privileged communications and \ndocuments protected by the attorney work product doctrine , without providing an y information or \ncontext about the relationship between Carr & Ferrell, Capaccio, and any of the defendants in this \ncase.  They ask the court to limit the time period to June 1, 2012 to February 23, 2015, and to limit \nthe scope to documents excluding privi leged communications and documents containing attorney \nwork product  and documents concerning Loop and the Almaviva Defendants, “excluding attorney -\nclient privileged communications between Almaviva’s counsel and Gatti as Almaviva’s agent and \nother Almaviva agents/employees.”   Jt. Letter at 7.   In response, Loop argues that Defendants do \nnot, and cannot allege  that they ever retained Carr & Ferrell as counsel for any matter, and that \nthey have no basis to block the production of these highly relevant documen ts. \nFederal privilege law applies in this federal question case.  Fed. R. Evid. 501 ; see also \nLoop AI Labs Inc. v. Gatti,  No. 15 -cv-00798 HSG (DMR), 2016 WL 730211, at *2 (N.D. Cal. \nFeb. 24, 2016).  The attorney -client privilege protects from discovery “co nfidential Case 4:15-cv-00798-HSG   Document 437   Filed 02/29/16   Page 9 of 12 \n10 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  communications between attorneys and clients, which are made for the purpose of giving legal \nadvice.”  United States v. Richey , 632 F.3d 559, 566 (9th Cir. 2011) (citation omitted).  The \nprivilege is “narrowly and strictly construed,” and the pa rty asserting it bears the burden of \nproving that it applies.  Vasudevan Software, Inc. v. IBM Corp. , No. 09 -5897 -RS (PSG), 2011 WL \n1599646, at *1 (N.D. Cal. Apr. 27, 2011)  (citations omitted); accord United States v. Bergonzi , \n216 F.R.D. 487, 493 (N.D. Ca l. 2003) (holding that party asserting privilege “must make a prima \nfacie showing” that privilege applies) (citing In re Grand Jury Investigation , 974 F.2d 1068, 1071 \n(9th Cir. 1992)); see Richey , 632 F.3d at 566.  Here, Defendants have made no showing tha t the \nprivilege applies, as they do not assert that Carr & Ferrell or Capaccio  ever represented them in \nany capacity.  Moreover, as to Loop’s request for engagement letters between Carr & Ferrell and \nany of the defendants in this action and/or Tony DiNapol i, the Ninth Circuit has held that the \nattorney -client privilege usually does not protect from disclosure “the identity of the client, the \namount of the fee, the identification of payment by case file name, and the general purpose of the \nwork performed.”  Clarke v. Am. Commerce Nat’l Bank , 974 F.2d 127, 129 (9th Cir. 1992).   \nThe work product doctrine protects from discovery “materials prepared by an attorney in \nanticipation of litigation,” be they “by or for the attorney.”  Bergonzi , 216 F.R.D. at 494 (citations \nomitted); accord  Richey , 632 F.3d at 567.  To qualify for work -product protection, materials must \n“(1) be prepared in anticipation of litigation or for trial and (2) be prepared by or for another party \nor by or for that other party’s represe ntative.”  Richey , 632 F.3d at 567 (citation omitted).  When a \ndocument was not prepared exclusively for litigation, it will receive protection if “in light of the \nnature of the document and the factual situation in the particular case, the document can be  fairly \nsaid to have been prepared or obtained because of the prospect of litigation.”  Id. at 568 (citation \nomitted).  As with their attorney -client privilege objection, Defendants make no showing that the \nwork product doctrine applies to the documents re quested by Loop’s subpoena.   \nThe court notes its concern that Defendants did not respond to any of Loop’s assertions \nabout the lack of an attorney -client relationship between Defendants and Capaccio.  Further, even \nthough it appears that Capaccio represen ted the Almaviva Defendants at some point, the Almaviva \nDefendants did not move to quash the subpoena or participate in the instant joint letter.  Since the Case 4:15-cv-00798-HSG   Document 437   Filed 02/29/16   Page 10 of 12 \n11 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  attorney -client privilege is “narrowly and strictly construed,” the court declines to quash the \nsubpoena on attorney -client privilege and attorney work product protection grounds.  However, in \nan abundance of caution, the court will allow for the possibility that Carr & Ferrell may withhold \ncertain documents based on privilege.  To the e xtent that Carr & Ferrell withholds documents in \nresponse to Loop’s subpoena, it must promptly provide a privilege log in conformance  with this \ncourt’s Standing Order.  [ See Docket No. 401 (Notice of Amended Discovery Procedures).]  Carr \n& Fer rell may only withhold documents based on an objectively reasonable assertion of attorney -\nclient privilege and/or attorney work product protection.  \nAs to the scope of the subpoena, Loop seeks the requested information for various time \nframes, including 201 2 to the present, June 1, 2013 to the present, January 2014 to the present, and \nMarch 1, 2013 to the present.  Loop argues that Capaccio and DiNapoli’s alleged modus operandi \nis continuous and ongoing.  See 2d Am. Compl. ¶¶ 211 -13, 228 -31.  The court orders  Carr & \nFerrell to produce the re sponsive  information starting from the dates requested in the subpoena \nthrough September 23, 2015.   \nE. Subpoena to Bank of the West  \nLoop’s subpoena to Bank of the West se eks 15 categories of information, including the \nidentification of bank accounts held by Gatti , Tony DiNapoli, IQSystem Inc., IQSystem LLC, the \nAlmaviva Defendants, Almawave USA, and others, and documents associated with opening such \naccounts; communications between Gatti and specific Bank of the West employees or \nrepresentatives; documents and com munications related to specific instances of cash pick -ups; and \ndocuments and communi cations related to Loop and/or this litigation.  Loop argues that the \nrequested information is relevant to its allegations that Gatti used the assistance of specific Bank \nof the West employees to conduct her unlawful activities related to the Almaviva Defendants and \nused bank accounts to obtain and make fraudulent payments.  2d Am. Compl. ¶¶ 27, 43, 50, 151 -\n54, 234.  It also argues that the information requested is relevant  to review the funds Gatti received \nwhile she was supposed to be exclusively working for Loop.  \nDefendants object to nine RFPs, again incorporat ing by reference their arguments related \nto the AT&T subpoena.  They also argue that their personal financial in formation is  private and Case 4:15-cv-00798-HSG   Document 437   Filed 02/29/16   Page 11 of 12 \n12 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  that the subpoena is overbroad and should be limited to documents concerning Loop and the \nAlmaviva Defendants only.  Defendants seek to limit the scope to documents and information \nfrom June 1, 2012 through February 23, 2015.  \nAs no ted above, federal privilege law applies in this case.  Defendants provide no support \nfor their claim that the information sought is protected from discovery, and no explanation why \ntheir privacy would not be sufficiently protected if sensitive financial i nformation is designated as \n“confidential” or “highly confidential —attorneys’ eyes only” pursuant to the parties’ protective \norder.  [Docket No. 230.]   See, e.g.,  In re Heritage Bond Litigation , No. CV 02 -1475 -DT(RCX), \n2004 WL 1970058, at *5 n.12 (C.D. Cal . July 23, 2004) (“Any privacy concerns Kasirer \ndefendants have in their bank records and related financial statements are adequately protected by \nthe protective order, and are not sufficient to prevent production in this matter.” ) (citing Sneirson \nv. Chem ical Bank , 108 F.R.D. 159, 162 (D. Del. 1985) ; accord In re Yassai , 225 B.R. 478, 483 \n(Bankr. C.D. Cal. 1998) .  As to the scope of the subpoena, Loop does not seek documents or \ninformation prior to June 1, 2012.  The court finds that the appropriate time p eriod for the \ninformation requested in the Bank of the West subpoena is June 1, 2012  through September 23, \n2015.  \nIV. CONCLUSION  \nFor the foregoing reasons, Defendants’ motion for a protective order and/or to quash \nLoop’s subpoenas to AT& T, Google, WI Harper Group, Carr & Ferrell, and Bank of the West is \ngranted in part and denied in part.  \n \nIT IS SO ORDERED.  \nDated: February 2 9, 2016  \n______________________________________  \nDonna M.

    "summary": "1. **Summary:** This case involves Modulus Financial Engineering Incorporated suing Modulus Data USA and Modulus Data, Inc. for trademark infringement, unfair competition, and cancellation of trademarks. The U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona granted the defendants’ motion to dismiss due to lack of personal jurisdiction, as the defendants had no meaningful connections or activities directed at Arizona. Although Modulus owns a trademark related to software including artificial intelligence, the case's jurisdictional issue did not delve into AI-related facts.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue:** Whether the U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona has personal jurisdiction over the defendants, who allegedly infringed on Modulus Financial Engineering's trademarks.\n\n3. **Court's Holding:** The court held that it did not have personal jurisdiction over the defendants because the defendants did not conduct activities expressly aimed at Arizona, thus failing to establish a meaningful connection to the forum necessary for personal jurisdiction.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation:** Imagine you're trying to sue someone in your hometown court because they copied your idea, but the other person never set foot in, sold anything to, or even tried to talk to people in your town. The court says it can't handle the case because there's no connection between the person you're suing and your town. It's like trying to bring someone to your backyard to solve a fight when they've never even been in your neighborhood.",

No. CV-19-04685 -PHX -SMB  \n \nORDER  \n \n  \nPending before the Court is Defendants ’ Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff’s Complaint \nfor Lack of Personal Jurisdiction , (Doc. 16 , “Mot.” ). Plaintiff Modulus Financial \nEngineering Inc. (“Modulus”) responded , (Doc. 21 , “Resp.” ), and Defendants Modulus \nData USA, Inc.  and Modulus Data, Inc. replied , (Doc. 23 , “Reply” ). The Court has \nconsidered the pleadings , exhibits,  and applicable law and will grant Defendants’  Motion .1 \nI. BACKGROUND  \nModulus  is an Arizona software design and development services corporation that \nprovides  its services across the world .2 (Doc. 1,  “Compl.”  ¶¶ 2, 8.) Its complaint alleges \nvarious federal, state, and common law claims of trademark infringement, unfair \ncompetition, and cancellation of trademarks against Defendants  Modulus Data USA and \n 1 No party requested oral argument and the Court finds the Motion suitable for resolution \nwithout hearing . LRCiv 7.2(f).  2 While not directly relevant for jurisdictional purposes, Modulus owns the trademark \n“Modulus” in connection with “[s]oftware design and development”  and “[c]omputer \nsoftware development tools; [c]omputer software for statistical  analysis, database engines, \nfinance, stock trading, stock market data and artificial  intelligence.”  (Compl. ¶ 9.) The June \n16, 2015 registration certificate shows Modulus has continuously used the mark  since \nMarch 22, 2002. ( Id. ¶¶ 8, 10.)

(See generally id. ¶¶ 1, 76 -118.)  Modulus Data USA is a New York \ncorporation with its principal place of business in Massachusetts  and Modulus Data is a \nCanadian entity. ( Id. ¶¶ 3-4; Doc. 16 -1 at 2, 5. ) Defendants , formerly operating as Log10 \nSolutions,  provide various tools and services concerning software and database integration \nand allegedly began infringing on Plaintiff’s trademark s sometime in September 2015. \n(Compl. ¶¶ 19 -25.) \nThe complaint alleges virtually no conduct  by either Defendant  involving Arizona.3 \nNeither  Defendant  has ever: (1) held an office or  place of business in Arizona; (2) \nspecifically  targeted or advertised to Arizona residents; (3)  employed  an authorized \nrepresentative in  Arizona ; (4) had  Arizona clients; (5) earned revenue from Arizona; or (6) \nsold goods or services in Arizona using the allegedly infringing trademarks . (Doc. 16 -1 at \n2-3, 5-6.) With the se allegations  in mind, Defendants move to dismiss for lack of personal \njurisdiction.  \nII. LEGAL STANDARD  \nBefore  trial, a defendant can move to dismiss the complaint against him for lack of \npersonal jurisdiction  under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(2) . Data Disc, Inc. v. \nSystems Tech. Assocs., Inc. , 557 F.2d 1280, 1285 (9th Cir. 1977); Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(2).  \nPlaintiff bear s the burden of establishing personal jurisdiction. Morrill v. Scott Fin. Corp. , \n873 F.3d 1136, 1141 (9th Cir. 2017); see also Ziegler v. Indian River Cty. , 64 F.3d 470, \n473 (9th Cir. 1995). Whe n the motion is based on writt en materials rather than an \nevidentiary hearing,  as is the case here,  “plaintiff need only make a prima facie showing of \njurisdictional facts.” Sher v. Johnson , 911 F.2d 1357, 1361 (9th Cir. 1990)  (citing Data \nDisk, 557 F.2d at 1285) . In determining whethe r plaintiff has met this burden, the \ncomplaint’s uncontroverted allegations must be taken as true, and “conflicts between the \nfacts contained in the parties’ affidavits must be resolved in [plaintiff’s] favor for purposes \n 3 The closest paragraph alleges that “a substantial part of the events or omissions giving \nrise to the claim occurred in this district and/or a substantial part of property that i s subject \nof the action is situated in this district.” (Compl. ¶ 7.) Nothing else comes close. ( See id. \n¶¶ 18 -118.) In fact, it appears that the impetus for this lawsuit stems from  a Chicago \nconference. ( See id. ¶ 72-75.) Case 2:19-cv-04685-SMB   Document 30   Filed 05/15/20   Page 2 of 13 \n- 3 -  \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n of deciding whether a prima facie case for personal jurisdiction exists.” AT & T v. \nCompagnie Bruxelles Lambert , 94 F.3d 586, 588 (9th Cir. 1996)  (internal quotation marks \nand citation omitted).  \n“When no federal statute governs personal jurisdiction, the district court applies the \nlaw of t he forum state.” Freestream Aircraft (Bermuda) Ltd. v. Aero Law Grp. , 905 F.3d \n597, 602 (9th Cir. 2018)  (citation omitted) . Arizona law exercises  personal jurisdiction to \nthe “maximum extent permitted by the Arizona Constitution and the United States \nConstitution.” Ariz. R. Civ. P. 4.2(a); see also A. Uberti and C. v. Leonardo , 892 P.2d \n1354, 1358 (Ariz. 1995) (analyzing personal jurisdiction in Ar izona under federal law) . \nTherefore, analyzing  personal jurisdiction under Arizona law and federal due process is the \nsame.  Schwarzenegger v. Fred Martin Motor Co. , 374 F.3d 797, 800 –01 (9th Cir. 2004).  \nIn the personal jurisdiction context, “[d]ue process  requires that a defendant be haled \ninto court in a forum State based on his own affiliation with the State, not based on the \n‘random, fortuitous, or attenuated’ contacts he makes by interacting with other persons \naffiliated with the State.” Walden v. Fior e, 571 U.S. 277, 286 (2014) (quoting Burger King \nCorp. v. Rudzewicz , 471 U.S. 462, 475 (1985)). “Although a nonresident's physical \npresence within the territorial jurisdiction of the court is not required, the nonresident \ngenerally must have certain minimu m contacts .  . . such that the maintenance of the suit \ndoes not offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.” Walden , 571 U.S. \nat 283 (citation and internal quotations omitted).  “Depending on the strength of those \ncontacts, there are tw o forms that personal jurisdiction may take: general and specific.” \nPicot v. Weston , 780 F.3d 1206, 1211 (9th Cir. 2015)  (citation omitted); see also  Cybersell , \nInc. v. Cybersell , Inc. , 130 F.3d 414, 416 (9th Cir. 1997) . General jurisdiction exists when \nthe defendant has “continuous and systematic” contacts with the forum state, whereas \nspecific jurisdiction exists when the controversy arises from or is related to the defendant’s \ncontact s with the forum state. See Helicopteros Nacionales de Colombia , S.A.  v. Hall , 466 \nU.S. 408, 41 6 (1984).  Modulus only asserts the Court has specific jurisdiction over \nDefendants.  Case 2:19-cv-04685-SMB   Document 30   Filed 05/15/20   Page 3 of 13 \n- 4 -  \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n “The inquiry whether a forum State may assert specific jurisdiction over a \nnonresident defendant focuses on the relationship among the defendant, the forum, and the \nlitigation.” Walden , 571 U.S. at 283 –84 (internal quotation  marks and citation  omitted). \nCourts “employ a three -part test to assess whether a defendant has sufficient contacts with \nthe forum state to be subject to specific personal jurisdiction:  \n \n(1) The non -resident defendant must purposefully direct his activities or \nconsummate some transactio n with the forum or resident thereof; or perform \nsome act by which he purposefully avails himself of the privilege of \nconducting activities in the forum, thereby invoking the benefits and \nprotections of its laws;  \n \n(2) the claim must be one which arises out  of or relates to the defendant's \nforum -related activities; and  \n \n(3) the exercise of jurisdiction must comport with fair play and substantial \njustice, i.e. it must be reasonable.  \n \nPicot , 780 F.3d at 1211  (quoting Schwarzenegger , 374 F.3d at 802 ). “The plai ntiff bears \nthe burden of satisfying the first two prongs of the test.” Schwarzenegger , 374 F.3d at 802  \n(citing Sher, 911 F.2d at 1361) . If it does so , “the burden then shifts to the defendant to \n‘present a compelling case’ that the exercise of jurisdictio n would not be reasonable.” \nSchwarzenegger , 374 F.3d at 802  (quoting  Burger King , 471 U.S. at 476–78). Absent a \nshowing of a “compelling case” that exercising jurisdiction would be unreasonable, it is \npresumed reasonable. Burger King , 471 U.S. at 477. If a plaintiff fails to meet the first \nprong, the Court need not address the others . Ariz. Sch. Risk Reten tion Trust, Inc. v. NMTC, \nInc., 169 F.  Supp.  3d 931, 936 (2016).  \nIII. DISCUSSION  \nModulus claims  the Court has  specific , but not general,  personal jurisdiction over \nDefendants because they purposefully directed their tortious conduct at Arizona . It also \nclaims  jurisdictional discovery  is appropriate if the Court finds it lacks personal jurisdiction \nover them . As explained below, the Court disagrees with Modulus on both claims .  Case 2:19-cv-04685-SMB   Document 30   Filed 05/15/20   Page 4 of 13 \n- 5 -  \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n A. The Court Lacks  Personal Jurisdiction Over Defendants . \nIn claiming “[p]ersonal  jurisdiction is beyond question,” Modulus contends, without \ndistinguishing between the two Defendants , that the Court can exercise specific jurisdiction \nover both. ( See Mot. at 6 -17.) It generally  argues personal jurisdiction exists  because \nDefendants  “targeted [it] and its intellectual property in Arizona , with knowledge that [it] \nwas a resident of Arizona .” (Id. at 2.) The Court begins with the minimum contacts test . \ni. Purposeful Direction  \nThe first prong of the minimum contacts test require s Modulus to show Defendants \n“either (1) ‘purposefully availed’ [themselves] of the privilege of conducting activities in \nthe forum, or (2) ‘purposefully directed’ [their] activities toward the forum.” Pebble Beach \nCo. v. Caddy , 453 F.3d 1151, 1155 (9th Cir. 2006) (citing Schwarzenegger , 374 F.3d at \n802). “A purposeful availment analysis is most often used in suits sounding in contract,” \nwhile a purposeful direction analysis “is most often used in suits sounding in tort.” \nSchwar zenegger , 374 F.3d at 802 ; Ziegler , 64 F.3d at 473 (“we apply different purposeful \navailment tests to contract and tort cases”);  Brown v. Reese , No. CV12 -2003 PHX DGC, \n2013 WL 525354, at *4 (D. Ariz. Feb. 11, 2013) (“[T]he Ninth Circuit has held that a \ndistrict court should apply different jurisdictional tests to contract and tort cases.”) .  \nSince Modulus’s  complaint alleges seven claims sounding in tort , the Court will \napply the “purposeful direction” test.4 See, e.g., Marvix Photo, Inc. v. Brand Tech., In c., \n647 F.3d 1218, 1228 (9th Cir. 2011) (“ Because Marvix has alleged copyright infringement, \na tort -like cause of action, purposeful direction is the proper analytical framework” \n(internal quotation marks and citation omitted)); Morrill , 873 F.3d at 1142 (“The \n[purposeful direction] test applies here given the [tortious] nature of the underlying \n 4 Neither party seems to dispute u sing th is test either. Modulus argues that “Defendants \n[p]urposefully [d]irected [t]heir [a]ctivities to Arizona,” (Resp. at 7), while Defendants \nclaim “Plaintiff cannot establish purposeful direction[,]” (Mot. at 4; see also Reply at 9 \n(“Plaintiff cannot demonstrate that Defendants purposefully directed any activities toward \nArizona.”)). Defendants  dispute, however, whether the Court should use Calder in \nanalyz ing purposeful direction. ( See Reply at 6 -7 (arguing that “courts in this jurisdiction \ndo not always apply the Calder ‘effects’ test to assess the ‘purposeful direction’ \nrequirement in trademark infringement cases.” (emphasis added))). As the Court \npreviously explained, this argument is unpersuasive. (See generally  Doc. 29.)

Purposeful direction is evaluated under the three -part “effects” framework  \noutlined in Calder v. Jones , 465 U. S. 783 (1984). See Schwarzenegger , 374 F.3d at 805 . \nIt “requires that the defendant allegedly have (1) committed an intentional act, (2) expressly \naimed at the forum state, (3) causing harm that the defendant knows is likely to be suffered \nat the forum state.” Id. (quoting Dole Food Co., Inc. v. Watts , 303 F.3d 1104,  1111  (9th \nCir. 2002) ); see also Yahoo!  Inc. v. La Ligue Contre Le Racisme Et L’Antisemitiseme , 433 \nF.3d 1199,  1206 (9th Cir. 2006)  (noting same) . Calder ’s first part is unquestionably \nsatisfied,5 but the second i s not . \n1. Defendant s Did Not  Expressly Aim  Their  Conduct at Arizona . \nCalder ’s second  part “asks whether the defendant’s allegedly tortious action was \n‘expressly aimed at the forum.’” Picot , 780 F.3d at 1214 (citation omitted) ; see also Pebble \nBeach , 453 F.3d at 1156 . Express aiming requires “‘ something more ’ than mere \nforeseeability” that an out-of-state defendant’s  conduct impacted the forum  in question . \nSchwarzenegger , 374 F.3d at 805 (citation omitted). Although the only factual assertions \nconcerning Defendants’ Arizona conduct are raised in Modulus’s response, it  argues this \npart of Calder is satisfied  for two reasons. First,  because Defendants knew its headquarters \nwas in Arizona  when the y committed the alleged tortious conduct. Second, because they  \npurchased ads that solicited business from Arizona and displayed the infringing mark on \nweb browsers here. (Resp. at 6, 12 -13.) For jurisdictional purposes here, the Court assumes \nthese  claims  are true. See Compagnie Bruxelles Lambert , 94 F.3d at 588. \nDefendants argue this fails to make a prima facie showi ng of personal jurisdiction.  \nThey claim the complaint does not allege  their tortious  conduct occurred in or directly \ntargeted Arizona. (Mot. at 5 -6; see also Reply at 9 ( “Plaintiff’s mere allegations of \n‘intentional infringement’ are thus insufficient to d emonstrate that Defendants ‘expressly \naimed’ their actions at Arizona or knew harm would likely be suffered in Arizona.”) ) They \nmore particularly  argue that : \n 5 Accepting Modulus’s  allegations as true , Defendants  committed intentional acts by \ninfringing on its intellectual property rights, which is the basis for each claim . (See Compl. \n¶¶ 18 -76, 86, 93, 100, 107, 112, 116.)  Case 2:19-cv-04685-SMB   Document 30   Filed 05/15/20   Page 6 of 13 \n- 7 -  \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n  \nThe mere fact that their website is accessible in Arizona does \nnot equate to conduct targeting Ar izona consumers. \nDefendants do not encourage consumers in Arizona to access \nits webpage, nor do they have clients in Arizona. When a \nwebsite advertiser does nothing other than register a domain \nname and post an essentially passive website, and nothing else  \nis done to encourage residents of the forum state, there is no \npurposeful direction at the forum.  \n \n(Id.) They further  argue that “even if Defendants were on notice of Plaintiff’s residence, \nthe foreseeability of injury in a forum is not a sufficient benchmark for exercising personal \njurisdiction.” (Reply at 9.) After considering both parties’ arguments, the Court agrees with \nDefendants.  Modulus  has not made its required prima facie showing that  Defendants \nexpressly aimed their conduct at this forum . Cf. Picot , 780 F.3d at 1215.  \na. Defendants’ Mere Knowledge of Modulus’s  Presence  in \nArizona Does Not Show T hey Express Aim ed Th eir Conduct \nat This Forum . \nModulus’s  first argument that Defendants’ knowledge of its location in Arizona \nwhen they committed the alleged  tortious conduct show s they expressly targeted  Arizona  \nis unpersuasive . See Walden , 571 U.S. at 290 ; see also Morrill , 873 F.3d at 1145 (“[T]he \npotential foreseeability of some incidental harm to Plaintiff[] in Arizona . . . without more, \ndoes not show that Defendants expressly targeted the forum state.”) . In Walden , the \nSupreme Court held that an out -of-state tortfeasor’s mere knowledge of a plaintiff’s “strong \nforum connections,” combined with the fact that harm was foreseeable to plaintiff in that \nforum , “improperly attribute [d] a plaintiff’s forum connections to the defendant and makes \nthose connection s ‘decisive’ in the jurisdictional analysis.” Walden , 571 U.S.  at 289. This \nis exactly what Modulus  asks the Court to do here.  \nIn claiming its approach is appropriate , Modulus  relies in part on Jason Scott \nCollection Inc. v. Trendily Furniture LLC , No. CV-17-02712 -PHX -JJT, 2017 WL \n6888514, at * 1, *3-4 (D. Ariz. Oct. 25, 2017) . There, the court found personal jurisdiction \nover a Texas company that was selling counterfeits of plaintiff’s copyrighted furniture , Case 2:19-cv-04685-SMB   Document 30   Filed 05/15/20   Page 7 of 13 \n- 8 -  \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n even though no sales occurred in Arizona , because defendant knew the infringement would \nbe felt here. Id. However, later that year in Axiom Foods, Inc. v. Acerchem Int’l, Inc.,  874 \nF.3d 1064, 10 70 (9th Cir. 2017) , the Ninth Circuit made clear that “while a theory of \nindividualized targeting may remain  relevant to the minimum contacts inquiry, it will not, \non its own, support the exercise of specific jurisdiction, absent compliance with what \nWalden  requires. ” Since Axiom , courts  in this Circuit have agreed that “infringement of a \nplaintiff’s intellectua l property rights with knowledge that plaintiff’s operations are based \nin the forum and that the harm will be felt there, is insufficient to establish personal \njurisdiction without a further showing that the defendant otherwise expressly aimed its \nactiviti es at the forum.”  Theos Med. Sys., Inc. v. Nytone Med. Prod ., Inc. , Case No. 19 -cv-\n01092 -VKD, 2020 WL 500511, at *7 (N.D. Cal. Jan. 31, 2020) (quoting One True Vine, \nLLC v. Liquid Brands, LLC , No. C -10-04102 -SBA, 2011 WL 2148933, at *4 (N.D. Cal. \nMay 31, 2011) ; see also Kellytoy Worldwide, Inc. v. Jay at Play Int’l Hong Kong Ltd. , No. \nCV 19 -cv-07831 -AB, 2019 WL 8064196, at *4 (C.D. Cal. Dec. 5, 2019)  (explaining same).  \nRequiring more than mere knowledge or foreseeability of harm  makes sense too.  \nOnly c onsidering where Modulus  is harmed  distorts the proper focus of the “minimum \ncontacts” inquiry, which is “the relationship among the defendant, the forum, and the \nlitigation.” Walden , 571 U.S. at 287  (quoting Calder , 465 U.S. at 788). Modulus’s  reques t \nimproperly asks the Court to  do that here by considering  its location in Arizona and \nimport ing its forum  connection s to Defendants. Again, c ourts have repeatedly rejected this \nargument. See Walden , 571 U.S. at 290 (“ Calder made clear that mere injury to a forum \nresident is not a sufficient connection to the forum .”); see also Morrill , 873 F.3d at 1145 \n(“Calder adopted the rule that to establish the basis for specific personal jurisdiction, a tort \nmust involve the forum state itself, and not just have some e ffect on a party who resides \nthere.”); Picot , 780 F.3d at 1214 (“Rather, ‘an injury is jurisdictionally relevant only insofar \nas it shows that the defendant has formed a contact with the forum State.’” (quoting \nWalden , 571 U.S. at 290)).  \nSince “[t]he prope r question is not where the plaintiff experienced a particular injury Case 2:19-cv-04685-SMB   Document 30   Filed 05/15/20   Page 8 of 13 \n- 9 -  \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n or effect but whether the defendant’s conduct connects him to the forum in a meaningful \nway,” Walden , 571 U.S. at 290, Defendants’ mere knowledge of Modulus  in Arizona , by \nitself,  does n ot meaningful connect them  to this forum . Rather, t his knowledge  more readily \nshows Modulus  is connected here , which is entirely irrelevant in considering Defendants’ \nconnections . See Morrill , 873 F.3d at 1143 (explaining that a defendant’s “relationship \nmust arise out of contacts that [it] creates with the forum” and “not the defendant’s contacts \nwith persons who reside there”). If the opposite were true, and Modulus  could somehow \ntether Defendants to Arizona in a meaningful way by the simple fact that it resides here, \npersonal jurisdiction would indeed be a nullity. Accordingly, Defendants’ connections with \nthis forum by the sole fact that they knew Modulus  is located here  and would be harmed \nhere insufficiently shows  they expressly aimed their conduct at Arizona. Cf. id. at 1148 -\n49. \nb. Defendants’ Online Presence Does Not  Show  They \nExpressly Aimed Their Conduct at Arizona.  \nModulus’s  second argument that Defendants expressly targeted  Arizona through \ntheir online presence  is similarly  unpersuasive.  As an initial matter, Modulus  points to no \nallegations supporting its argument.  Nonetheless, it first argues Defendants expressly \ntargeted Arizona because they directed online ads at Arizona consumers . The only support \nfor this is counsel’s affidavit, whic h states that “while browsing the internet from [his] \noffice in Phoenix, Arizona, [he] was presented with a Google Ad for Defendants’ \nofferings.” (Doc. 21 -1 ¶ 8.) However, t his declaration does not show the ad was specifically \ndirected at Arizona  consumers , only that it showed up here.  See Marvix Photo , 647 F.3d at \n1231 (“Not all material placed on the Internet is, solely by virtue of its universal \naccessibility, expressly aimed  at every state in which it is accessed.”).  To be sure, the \nsituation here is quite unlike  the one in Marvix Photo , where the Ninth Circuit  found the \nexpress aiming requirement met because  “a substantial number of hits to [ defendant’s ] \nwebsite came from Ca lifornia residents”  and it had a  “specific focus on California —\ncentered [on] celebrity and entertainment industries.” Id. at 1230.  There is no thing  \nsupporting  a similar finding here besides  an isolated ad appearing on counsel’s web Case 2:19-cv-04685-SMB   Document 30   Filed 05/15/20   Page 9 of 13 \n- 10 -  \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n browser while he was in  Arizona .6 One can easily imagine how absurd it would be if \ncounsel walked across state lines to New Mexico, opened his laptop, and wrote a similar \naffidavit and the Court permitted suit there based on this happenstance . This is clearly \nincorrect , and the mere viewing of the ad in Arizona by Modulus’s  counsel cannot be \nattributed to Defendants. See Walden , 571 U.S. at 286 (“[I]t is likewise insufficient to rely \non a defendant’s ‘random, fortuitous, or attenuated contacts’ or on the ‘unilateral activity’ \nof a plaintiff.” (quoting Burger King , 471 U.S. at 475)).  \nModulus  also argues that Defendants expressly aimed their conduct at Arizona by \noperating a website allow ing prospective clients , including  but not exclusively  Arizonans,  \nto download a master services agreement, request a lengthy white paper, and communicate \nwith them. (Resp. at 6.) This does not  show “express aiming” is satisfied  either . Although \nthe Ninth Circuit in the past has understandably  “struggled with the question [of] whether \ntortious  conduct on a nationally accessible website is expressly aimed at any, or all, of the \nforums in which the website can be viewed”  because of the rapidly changing pace of \ntechnology,  it has provided some guidance to lower courts. See Marvix Photo , 647 F.3d a t \n1229  (citations omitted). As the court outlined : \n \nOn the one hand, we have made clear that maintenance of a passive website \nalone cannot satisfy the express aiming prong. On the other, we have held \nthat operating even a passive website in conjunction wit h something more —\nconduct directly targeting the forum —is sufficient. In determining whether \na nonresident defendant has done something more, we have considered \nseveral factors, including the interactivity of the defendant’s website, the \ngeographic scope of  the defendant’s commercial ambitions, and whether the \ndefendant individually targeted a plaintiff known to be a forum resident.  \n \nId. (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). In other words, just because a \ndefendant operates a website does not mea n the “expressly aimed” requirement disappears . \nId. Instead , a defendant’s virtual presence is merely a medium for which the court must \n 6 Modulus  does not argue that anything in the adve rtisement explicitly targets Arizona’s \nmarketplace either.  Case 2:19-cv-04685-SMB   Document 30   Filed 05/15/20   Page 10 of 13 \n- 11 -  \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n consider in determining whether a  defendant expressly aim ed its conduct at the forum .7 \nThe Court’s conclusion  today comports with this guidance . Although a nyone, including \nArizonans, can access Defendants’ website , nothing on it indicates  they used it to expressly \naim their tortious conduct at  Arizona . This is  especially true considering Defendants  “never \nhad an office in Arizona, do not specifically target or advertise to residents of Arizona, \nhave no clients in Arizona, have not earned any revenue from Arizona, and never sold any \ngoods or services that utilize the name or mark Modulus in any manner in Arizona.” (Reply \nat 10;  see also Docs. 16 -1 at 2 -3, 5-6.) Instead, Defendants’  virtual  contacts appear to be \nprecisely what the Supreme Court coined as  “random, fortuitous, or attenuated” contacts \nwith Arizona that exist simply because they host a universally accessible we bsite.  Cf. \nWalden , 571 U.S. at 286; Burger King , 471 U.S. at 475.  This is not enough  to show \n“express aiming” under  Calder . \nIn sum, Modulus  has not alleged  or otherwise provided any evidence outlining \nDefendants’ necessary minimum contacts show ing a meaningful connection between \nDefendants and Arizona  exists to permit the Court to exercise its limited jurisdiction over \nthem . To the contrary, Defendants’  uncontradicted  rebuttal evidence shows they lacked, \nand still lack,  any meaningful connection  to this forum . Thus, because  Modulus  has failed \nto show Defendants alleged infringement  was expressly aimed at Arizona, the Court will \nnot analyze Calder ’s third requirement , Schwarzenegger , 374 F. 3d. at 807 n.1 , or the \nremaining prongs of the minimum contacts test. Ariz. Sch. Risk Retention Trust , 169 F.  \nSupp.  3d at 936.  Because the Court lacks  personal jurisdiction over Defendants, dismiss ing \nthem is required . Cf. Walden , 571 U.S. at 291.  \nB. Jurisdictional Discovery is Unwarranted.  \nModulus  altern atively requests the opportunity to conduct jurisdictional discovery \n 7 This of course also presumes that the underlying tortious conduct arises out of defendant’s \nvirtual presence, since the Court is  limited to considering whether “the defendant’s suit-\nrelated condu ct . . . create[s] a substantial connection with the forum State.” Walden , 571 \nU.S. at 284  (emphasis added) . As the Ninth Circuit reasoned, considering virtual contacts \ncreated through a website not otherwise  related to  the underlying tortious conduct woul d \nbe improper. See Picot , 780 F.3d at 1215 n.3  (“A plaintiff may not create personal \njurisdiction over one claim by arguing that jurisdiction might be proper over a different \nhypothetical claim not before the court.”  (citation omitted) ). Case 2:19-cv-04685-SMB   Document 30   Filed 05/15/20   Page 11 of 13 \n- 12 -  \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n if the Court finds that it has failed to establish a prima facie case of personal jurisdiction  \nover Defendants . (Resp. at 17.) Modulus  believes jurisdictional  discovery woul d “further \ndemonstrate Defendants’ purposeful targeting and evince additional contacts with the State \nof Arizona, including U.S./Arizona -based clients or partners, other promotional efforts in \nthe State, and prior versions of the website wit h greater levels of interactivity.” ( Id.) \nDefendants argue jurisdictional discovery “would be a waste of party and judicial \nresources. ” (Reply at 11.)  The Court agrees with Defendant s. \nA trial court has broad discretion as to whether to permit limited juri sdictional \ndiscovery. Data Disk , 557 F.2d at 1285 n.1 (citing Wells Fargo & Co. v. Wells Fargo \nExpress Co. , 556 F.2d 406, 430 n.24 (9th Cir. 1977)).  While “[d]iscovery should ordinarily \nbe granted where pertinent facts bearing on the question of jurisdicti on are controverted or \nwhere a more satisfactory showing of the facts is necessary,” Butcher’s Union Local No. \n498 v. SDC Inv., Inc. , 788 F.2d 535, 540 (9th Cir. 1986) (citations and internal quotations \nomitted), “[w]here a plaintiff’s claim of personal ju risdiction appears to be both attenuated \nand based on bare allegations in the face of specific denials made by the defendant[], the \nCourt need not permit even limited discovery,” Pebble Beach , 453 F.3d at 1160 (quoting \nTerracom v. Valley Nat’l Bank , 49 F.3 d 555, 562 (9th Cir. 1995)). A court also need not \npermit “[a plaintiff’s] request for discovery . . . based on little more than a hunch that it \nmight yield jurisdictionally relevant facts.” Boschetto v. Hansing , 539 F.3d 1011, 1020 (9th \nCir. 2008).  \nModulus’s  reaching  request for jurisdictional discovery appears to be a fishing \nexpedition for jurisdictional facts and will be denied.  Pebble Beach , 453 F.3d at 1160 ; see \nalso Johnson v. Mitchell , No. CIV -S-10-1968 -GEB -GGH -PS, 2012 WL 1657643, at *7 \n(E.D.  Cal. May 10, 2012).  On a fundamental level, the complaint contains virtually no  \njurisdiction al allegations. Even after the barren complaint was  challenged, Modulus  \nprovided  nothing evincing the Court’s  personal jurisdiction over either Defendant  beyond \naffidavits by counsel  and screenshots of the parties’  website s. As explained above, these \nthings do not show  Defendants are meaningfully connected to Arizona . Modulus’s  ad hoc , Case 2:19-cv-04685-SMB   Document 30   Filed 05/15/20   Page 12 of 13 \n- 13 -  \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n \nlast-minute  hunches that additional information might turn up and estab lish personal \njurisdiction is no cause for opening  discovery , even under limited circumstances .8 \nBoschetto , 539 F.3d at 1020. To allow discovery at this stage, especially where neither \nparty claims no forum otherwise has personal jurisdiction over Defendan ts as it relates to \nModulus’s  claims , is unwarranted.  \nIV.  CONCLUSION  \nModulus  has failed to make a prima facie showing that Defendants have sufficient \nminimum contacts with Arizona that meaningfully connect them here. There is nothing, \nallegation or otherwise,  illustrating how their underlying tortious conduct impacted \nArizona, let alone how it was purposefully directed at this forum . Modulus similarly fails \nto show why limited  jurisdictional discovery is warranted  under these circumstances.  \n \nAccordingly,   \n \nIT IS ORDERED GRANTING  Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff’s \nComplaint for Lack of Personal Jurisdiction , (Doc. 16) ; \n \nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED directing the Clerk of Court to terminate this case.  \n  \nDated this 14th day of May, 2020.  \n \n \n \n \n 8 Modulus  also does not explain with any clarity which anticipated jurisdictional facts \nwould impact which parts of the Court’s jurisdictional calculus.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: The court case involves a patent infringement dispute between Singular Computing LLC and Google LLC regarding patented methods of processing using Compact Arithmetic Processing Elements, which are designed to perform low precision and high dynamic range (LPHDR) arithmetic operations. The court denied Google's motion to dismiss, which argued that Singular's patents are directed to abstract ideas that are not patentable under 35 U.S.C. § 101.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: The key legal issue is whether the patents held by Singular Computing describe patentable subject matter or if they are directed to abstract ideas, which are not patentable under 35 U.S.C. § 101.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court denied Google's motion to dismiss, holding that it could not determine at this stage that the asserted claims in the patents are directed to unpatentable subject matter. The court found plausible and specific factual allegations that the patents incorporate inventive concepts that arguably go beyond mere abstract ideas.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine Singular Computing created a new way for computers to do math, allowing them to do it faster and with fewer parts. They got patents for these methods, believing this would improve how computers handle tasks like artificial intelligence. Google used similar methods, and Singular said Google was infringing on their patents. Google tried to get the case thrown out, claiming Singular's ideas were too abstract to be patented. The court decided that Singular's patents might indeed describe something unique enough to be protected, so the case should not be dismissed outright.",

J. \nThis is a patent infringement dispute concerning computer system architectures.  U.S. \nPatent Nos. 8,407,273 (“ the ’273 Patent”), 9,218,156 (“ the ’156 Patent”), and 10,416,961 (“ the \n’961 Patent”), held by plaintiff Singular Computing LLC, each describe a method of “Processing \nwith Compact Arithmetic Processing Element[s].”  Singular has brought suit for infringement of \nthe three patents, i ncluding all egations of willful infringement and a request for treble damages , \nagainst defendant Google LLC.  \nGoogle has moved to dismiss  the amended complaint , contending that the patents -in-suit \nclaim fundamental and abstract ideas that are not patentable under 35 U.S.C. § 101.  For the \nreasons set forth below, the motion will be denied. \nI. Background  \nA. Factual Background  \nThe facts are stated as set forth in the amended complaint (“AC”) unless  otherwise noted.  \n1. Singular Computing  \nSingular Computing is a Delaware limited liability company based  in Newton and 2 \n Cambridge , Massachusetts .  (AC ¶ 1).  It was founded by Joseph Bates , Ph.D., in order to \ndevelop computers with novel architectures.  ( Id. ¶ 6).  Those architectures include processors \nwith parts “designed to perform low precision and high dynamic range (LPHDR) arithmetic \noperations.”  ( Id. ¶ 9).  According to the complain t, such  architectures “allow [] for more \nefficient use of a computer’s transistors,” which improves computer performance in certain \napplications such as artificial intelligence software.  ( Id. ¶¶ 9 -12). \n2. The ’273 Patent  \nThe ’273 Patent  is entitled “Processi ng with Compact Arithmetic Processing Element” \nand was issued on March 26, 2013.  It generally relates to “a processor or other device” that \n“includes processing elements  designed to  perform  arithmetic  operations  . . . on numerical values \nof low precision but high dynamic range .”  (’273 Patent  col. 2 ll. 11- 18).  In other words, those \nLPHDR processing elements often “produce results that frequently differ from exact results” by \na margin of error, but “ they are capable of operating on inputs and/or  producing outputs spanning \na range” of numbers that is relatively large.  ( See i d. col. 2 ll. 28- 39). \nAccording to the patent, conventional central  processing units (“CPUs”) perform \narithmetic al operations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, a nd division, “with great \nprecision,” which typical ly requires “on the order of a million transistors.”  ( Id. col. 3 ll. 7- 22).  \nAlthough such CPUs “make inefficient use of their transistors,” this high- precision architecture \nremains the norm because “ [m]any applications need this kind of precision” and it preserves  \n“software compatibility with earlier designs.”  ( Id.; see also id. col. 5 ll. 41- 62). \nBecause of the inefficiency of conventional CPU designs , “other kinds of computers have \nbeen developed to attain higher performance.”  ( Id. col. 3. ll. 31- 32).  The patent describes a \nvariety of such architectures, including single instruction stream/multiple data stream designs, \nfield programmable gate arrays, and graphics processing units  (“GPUs ”).  (See generally i d. col.  3 \n 3 l. 30- col. 5 l. 62).  The patent claims that while many of those  architectures use lower -precision \narithmetic and may have advantages for specialized applications, they suffer from a variety of \nflaws that either prevent their  use for modern general -purpose computing or render them \napproximately as inefficient as conventional CPU designs.  ( See generally id. ). \nThe ’273 Patent  purports to take a “fundamentally different approach” from prior \narchitectures by incorporating LPHDR p rocessing elements  into computer processors  or other \ndevices .  (Id. col. 5 l. 63- col. 6 l. 2).  According to the patent, each individual LPHDR processing \nelement is “relatively small,” which enables them to be deployed together in “massively parallel” \nconfigurations.  ( Id. col. 6 ll. 51- 55).  And the patent claims that while persons of ordinary skill \nin the art commonly believe that such “massive amounts of LPHDR arithmetic” are of little use, \nthey “are in fact useful and provide significant practical benef its in at least several significant \napplications.”   (Id. col. 6 l. 51- col. 7 l. 11).  For example, it claims that processors with multiple \nLPHDR processing elements  can efficiently solve a task known as the nearest neighbor problem, \nwhich has applications in compressing or comparing various types of data.  (Id. col. 17 l. 29- col. \n21 l. 32). \n3. The ’ 156 & ’961 Patent s \nThe ’156 Patent  and ’ 961 Patent are also both entitled “Processing with Compact \nArithmetic Processing Element.”  The ’156 Patent  was issued on December 22, 2015, and is a \ncontinuation of the ’273 Patent .  The ’961 Patent  was issued on September 17, 2019, and is a \ncontinuation of the ’156 Patent .1  Both the ’156 Patent  and the ’961 Patent  share a specification \nwith the ’273 Patent . \n \n1 To be precise, the ’961 Patent is a continuation of U.S. Pat. No. 10,120,648, which is a continuation of \nU.S. Pat. No. 9,792,088, which is a continuation of the ’156 Patent . 4 \n 4. Google , LLC  \nGoogle , LLC  is a Delaware limited liability company .  Among other things, it provides \nconsumers with a variety of internet -based computer services such as  Google Search,  Google \nTranslate, Google Photos, Google Assistant, and Gmail.  ( See AC  ¶¶ 2, 15).  The amended \ncomplaint alleges that Google has built and used several computer systems for its own data \ncenters that infringe on the ’273, ’156, and ’961 Patent s.  (Id. ¶¶ 1 6-26, 81- 132).  \nB. Procedural Background  \nOn December 20, 2019, Singular filed this action.  The amended complaint  was filed on \nMarch 20, 2020.  It alleges three counts against Google:  infringement of the ’273 Patent  (Count \n1); infringement of the ’156 Patent  (Count 2); and infringement of the ’961 Patent  (Count 3). \nOn April 17, 2020, Google moved to dismiss the amended complaint  under Fed. R. Civ. \nP. 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.  \nII. Legal Framework  \nA. Legal Standard  \nOn a m otion to dismiss made pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), the court “must assume the truth \nof all well- plead[ed] facts and give . . . plaintiff the benefit of all reasonable inferences \ntherefrom.”  Ruiz v. Bally Total Fitness Holding Corp., 496 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 2007) (citing \nRogan v. Menino, 175 F.3d 75, 77 (1st Cir. 1999)).  To survive a motion to dismiss, the \ncomplaint must state a claim that is plausible on its face.  Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly , 550 U.S. \n544, 570 (2007).  In other words, the “[f]actual allegations must be enough to raise a right to \nrelief above the speculative level,  . . . on the assumption that all the allegations in the complaint \nare true (even if doubtful in fact).”  Id. at 555 (citations omitted).  “The plausibility standa rd is \nnot akin to a ‘probability requirement,’ but it asks for more than a sheer possibility that a \ndefendant has acted unlawfully.”  Ashcroft v. Iqbal , 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) (quoting Twombly , 5 \n 550 U.S. at 556).  Dismissal is appropriate if the complaint  fails to set forth “factual allegations, \neither direct or inferential, respecting each material element necessary to sustain recovery under \nsome actionable legal theory.”  Gagliardi v. Sullivan, 513 F.3d 301, 305 (1st Cir. 2008) (quoting \nCentro Médico del  Turabo, Inc. v. Feliciano de Melecio, 406 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 2005)). \nWhether a claim is drawn to patent -eligible subject matter under § 101 is an issue of law.   \nGenetic Techs. Ltd. v. Merial LLC , 818 F.3d 1369, 1373 (Fed. Cir. 2016) .  Accordingly, court s \nhave occasionally decided the issue of § 101 patentability at the pleadings stage.  See, e.g., \nRothschild Digital Confirmation, LLC v. Skedulo Holdings Inc., 2020 WL 1307016 (N.D. Cal. \nMar. 19, 2020) .  However, “like many legal questions,” determining el igibility under § 101 can \ninvolve “subsidiary fact questions” —in particular, the second step of the Alice /Mayo test , which \nasks whether a patent’s claims contain a sufficiently inventive concept.  Aatrix Software, Inc. v. \nGreen Shades Software, Inc., 882 F .3d 1121, 1128  (Fed. Cir. 2018) .  Therefore , while the \nFederal Circuit has held that “patent eligibility can be determined at the Rule 12(b)(6) stage ,” it \nhas also cautioned that  “[t]his is true only when there are no factual allegations that, taken as \ntrue, prevent resolving the eligibility question as a matter of law.”   Id. at 1125. \nB. Statutory Framework  \nAn invention is generally patentable if it qualifies as a “new and useful process, machine, \nmanufacture, or composition of matter.”  35 U.S.C. § 101.  However, “this provision contains an \nimportant implicit exception.  Laws of nature, natural phenomena, and abstract ideas are not \npatentable.”  Mayo Collaborative Servs. v. Prometheus Labs., 566 U.S. 66, 70 (2012) (citing \nDiamond v. Diehr , 450 U.S. 175, 185 (1981)).  In applying this exception, a court “must \ndistinguish between patents that claim the building  blocks of human ingenuity and those that \nintegrate the building blocks into something more.”  Alice Corp. Pty. Ltd. v. CLS Bank Intern., \n573 U.S. 208, 217 (2014) (internal quotations omitted). 6 \n The framework for making that distinction involves a two- step process.  At step one, the \ncourt determines “whether the claims at issue are directed to one of those patent -ineligible \nconcepts” that is so abstract as to “risk disproportionately tying up the use of [] underlying \nideas.”  Alice , 573 U.S. at 217 (quoting Mayo , 566 U.S. at 73).  If step one is answered \naffirmatively, the court continues to step two.  At step two, the court looks for an “inventive \nconcept,” namely “an element or combination of elements that is sufficient to ensure that the \npatent in practice  amounts to significantly more than a patent upon the ineligible concept itself.”  \nId. at 217- 18 (internal quotations omitted).   If step two is also answered affirmatively, then the \npatent claims subject matter that is not patentable and is therefore invalid . \nIII. Analysis  \nA. The Representative Claims  \nAs an initial matter, the Court must determine which claims of the ’273, ’156 , and ’961 \nPatent s to analyze to resolve the pending motion.  The amended complaint  asserts infringement \nas to several claims of each patent .  (See AC ¶ ¶ 87, 104, 122) .  But it also alleges that three of \nthose claims are representative:  claim 53 of the ’273 Patent , claim 7 of the ’156 Patent , and \nclaim 4 of the ’961 Patent .  (Id. ¶¶ 31, 47, 64).  Google does not dispute  that those three  claims \nare representative.  ( See Def. Mem. at 6).   Accordingly, the Court may assess whether the \nasserted claims are invalid under § 101 based on those claims.  See Berkheimer v. HP Inc. , 881 \nF.3d 1360, 1365 (Fed. Cir. 2018).  \nClaim 53 of the ’273 Patent  recites:  \nA device:  \ncomprising at least one first low -precision high- dynamic range (LPHDR) \nexecution unit adapted to execute a first operation on a first input signal \nrepresenting a first numerical value to produce a first output signal representing a \nsecond  numerical value;  7 \n wherein the dynamic range of the possible valid inputs to the first operation is at \nleast as wide as from 1/1,000,000 through 1,000,000 and for at least X=5% of the \npossible valid inputs to the first operation, the statistical mean, over repeated \nexecution of the first operation on each specific input from the at least X % of the \npossible valid inputs to the first operation, of the numerical values represented by \nthe first output signal of the LPHDR unit executing the first operation on th at \ninput differs  by at least Y=0.05% from the result of an exact mathematical \ncalculation of the first operation on the numerical values of that same input;  \nwherein the number of LPHDR execution units in the device exceeds by at least \none hundred the non -negative integer number of execution units in the device \nadapted to execute at least the operation of multiplication on floating point \nnumbers that are at least 32 bits wide.  \n(’273 Patent  at col. 31 l. 62- col. 32 l. 18, col. 32 ll. 37- 41, 60- 62; AC ¶ 31 ). \n Next, claim 7 of the ’156 Patent  recites:  \n A device comprising:  \nat least one first low precision high -dynamic range (LPHDR) execution unit \nadapted to execute a first operation on a first input signal representing a first \nnumerical value to produce a first output signal representing a second numerical \nvalue,  \nwherein the dynamic range of the possible valid inputs to the first operation is at \nleast as wide as from 1/1,000,000 through 1,000,000 and for at least X=5% of the \npossible valid inputs to the first ope ration, the statistical mean, over repeated \nexecution of the first operation on each specific input from the at least X % of the \npossible valid inputs to the first operation, of the numerical values represented by \nthe first output signal of the LPHDR unit executing the first operation on that \ninput differs by at least Y=0.05% from the result of an exact mathematical \ncalculation of the first operation on the numerical values of that same input; and \nat least one first computing device adapted to control the operation of the at least \none first LPHDR execution unit  \nwherein the at least one first computing device comprises at least one of a central \nprocessing unit (CPU), a graphics processing unit (GPU), a field programmable \ngate array (FPGA), a microcode- based p rocessor, a hardware sequencer, and a \nstate machine; and,  \nwherein the number of LPHDR execution units in the device exceeds by at least \none hundred the non -negative integer number of execution units in the device \nadapted to execute at least the operation o f multiplication on floating point \nnumbers that are at least 32 bits wide.  8 \n (’156 Patent  at col. 29 l. 54- col. 30 l. 17, col. 30 ll. 21- 23; AC ¶ 47).  \nFinally, claim 4 of the ’961  Patent recites:  \nA device comprising:  \nat least one first low precision high- dynamic range (LPHDR) execution unit \nadapted to execute a first operation on a first input signal representing a first \nnumerical value to produce a first output signal representing a second numerical \nvalue,  \nwherein the dynamic range of the possible va lid inputs to the first operation is at \nleast as wide as from 1/1,000,000 through 1,000,000 and for at least X=10% of \nthe possible valid inputs to the first operation, the statistical mean, over repeated \nexecution of the first operation on each specific in put from the at least X % of the \npossible valid inputs to the first operation, of the numerical values represented by \nthe first output signal of the LPHDR unit executing the first operation on that \ninput differs by at least Y=0.2% from the result of an exa ct mathematical \ncalculation of the first operation on the numerical values of that same input;  \nat least one first computing device adapted to control the operation of the at least \none first LPHDR execution unit;  \n(’961 Patent at col. 30 ll. 17- 37, 49- 51; AC  ¶ 64).  \nB. Whether the Claims Are Directed to a Patent -Ineligible Abstract Concept  \nThe Court must first determine if the claims in question are “directed to” a patent-\nineligible abstract idea.2 \n“At some level, all inventions  . . . embody, use, reflect, rest upon, or apply laws of nature, \nnatural phenomenon, or abstract ideas .”  Alice , 573 U.S. at 217 (quotations omitted) .  \nAccordingly, “it is not enough to merely identify a patent -ineligible concept underlying the \nclaim; [the court] must determine whether that patent -ineligible concept is what the claim is \ndirected to.”  Thales Visionix Inc. v. United States , 850 F.3d 1343, 1349 (Fed. Cir. 2017) \n(internal quotations omitted).  In pursuing that inquiry, “the claims are considered in their \n \n2 For the sake of  simplicity, the Court will use the term “abstract idea” to describe non -patentable subject \nmatter, although the label is imprecise and the prohibition also extends to matters such as “laws of nature” and \n“natural phenomena.”  See Mayo , 566 U.S. at 70.  9 \n entirety  to ascertain whether their character as a whole is directed to excluded subject matter.”  \nInternet Patents Corp. v. Active Network Inc. , 790 F.3d 1343, 1346 (Fed. Cir. 2015).  Although \n“the specification may  . . . be useful in illuminating whether the cla ims are ‘directed to’ the \nidentified abstract idea  . . . any reliance on the specification in the § 101 analysis must always \nyield to the claim language.”  ChargePoint, Inc. v. SemaConnect, Inc., 920 F.3d 759, 767- 69 \n(Fed. Cir. 2019) (internal citations om itted).  \nDelineating the bounds of the “abstract ideas” category has proved somewhat elusive.   \nAt one end of the spectrum, the caselaw makes clear that algorithms and mathematical formulas \nexpressing “fundamental truth[ s]” are squarely within the realm of unpatentable abstract ideas.  \nSee Alice, 573 U.S. at 218- 220 (citing Gottschalk v. Benson, 409 U.S. 63 (1972); Parker v. \nFlook , 437 U.S. 584 (1978)).  However, abstract ideas are not limited to “preexisting, \nfundamental truths that exist in principle apart  from any human action.”  Id.  at 220 (internal \nquotations omitted).  A patent merely covering an application of an otherwise general practice, \neven a complex practice, may be directed to an abstract idea.  See, e.g. , Bilski v. Kappos , 561 \nU.S. 593, 611 (2010) (holding that “[t]he concept of hedging [financial transactions]” was a \npatent -ineligible “abstract idea, just like the algorithms at issue in Benson and Flook ”). \nNo clear boundaries have been drawn around the category of ineligible abstract ideas.  In \nfact, the Supreme Court has rejected the creation of categorical rules for determining patent -\nineligible subject matter in favor of  resolving cases narrowly.  See id. at 609 (refusing to \nconclude that business -process claims at issue were categorically un patentable).  Instead, courts \n“have found it sufficient to compare claims at issue to those claims already found to be directed \nto an abstract idea in previous cases.”  Enfish, LLC v. Microsoft Corp., 822 F.3d 1327, 1334 \n(Fed. Cir. 2016); see also  Alice , 573 U.S. at 221 (“[W]e need not labor to delimit the precise 10 \n contours of the ‘abstract ideas’ category in this case. It is enough to recognize that there is no \nmeaningful distinction between the concept of risk hedging in Bilski and the concept of \nintermediated settlement at issue here. Both are squarely within the realm of ‘abstract ideas’ as \nwe have used that term.”).   The claims at issue must therefore be placed in context within the \ncaselaw.  \nSingular contends that the claims are “directed to an i mprovement to computer \nfunctionality” and therefore patent eligible.”  (Pl. Opp . at 6 ; see also  AC ¶¶ 46, 63, 77).  Indeed, \nthe Supreme Court has suggested that claims are patent -eligible if they “purport to improve the \nfunctioning of the computer itself.”   Alice , 573 U.S. at 225.  And w hile the Supreme Court \ndiscussed such improvements to computer functionality at step two of the inquiry, the Federal \nCircuit has  concluded that improvements of that kind are not “inherently abstract” and should be \nanalyzed at  the first step.  Enfish , 822 F.3d at 1335.  Accordingly, the Federal Circuit  has held \nthat if a patent generally relates to computer -functionality improvements, then “the first step in \nthe Alice inquiry asks whether the focus of the claims is on the specific asserted improvement in \ncomputer capabilities  . . . or, instead, on a process that qualifies as an ‘ abstract idea’  for which \ncomputers are invoked merely as a tool.”  Id.  at 133 5-36.  If the claims are “directed to ‘an \nimprovement to computer functionality itself, not on economic or other tasks for which a \ncomputer is used in its ordinary capacity,’” then they are not directed to an abstract idea and are \npatent -eligible.  Cellspin Soft, Inc. v. Fitbit, Inc., 927 F.3d 1306, 1315 (Fed. Cir. 2019)  (quoting \nid.); see also  Aatrix , 882 F.3d at 1127 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (collecting cases).  \nGoogle contends that the claims at issue are not directed to improvements in computer \nfunctionality, but rather to LPHDR arithmetic, which it summarizes  as the “abstract idea of doing \nan arithmetic calculation with an intended degree of imprecision .”  (Def. Mem. at 11 -12).  It 11 \n further contends that applying that  idea to numbers that have a high dynamic range is “equally \nabstract,” because the idea of high  dynamic range “is, literally, just mathematics, and it is \ncompletely abstract.”  ( Id. at 10 ). \nWhether that is true raises issues of claim construction.  Google describes LPHDR \narithmetic in fairly general terms.  In its view, “‘low precision’ means the ex ecution unit is not \nadapted to calculate the precisely correct mathematical result every time,” and “‘high dynamic \nrange’ means only that the execution unit can represent a relatively broad range of numbers.’”  \n(Def. Mem. at 11 -12).  But Singular proposes a narrower construction, defining “low precision” \nand “high dynamic range” as they are set forth  in the claims with  “very precise limitations.”  (Pl. \nOpp. at 8) .  Indeed, the  claims themselves set specific parameters for what constitutes low \nprecision and high dynamic range.  For example, claim 53 of the ’273 Patent  sets forth particular \nminimum levels of precision and specifies a dynamic range “at least as wide as from 1/1,000,000 \nthrough 1,000,000.”  ( ’273 Patent  at col. 32 ll. 1- 12, 60- 62).3  In short, the parties dispute how \nnarrowly the claims define LPHDR arithmetic.  \nThat dispute may affect the § 101 analysis.  The Federal Circuit has held that “[i]f there \nare claim construction disputes at the Rule 12(b)(6) stage  . . . the court must proceed by adopting \nthe non- moving party’s constructions.”  Aatrix , 882 F.3d at 1125.4  Adopting Singular’s \nconstruction of the claims  would limit them to particular precision and dynamic range \nparameters , as opposed to the notion of LPHDR arithmetic more broadly.  And limiting the \n \n3 Claim 7 of the ’156  Patent  sets forth identical parameters for precision and dynamic range.  Claim 4 of the \n’961 Patent sets forth slightly different parameters, although they are still specified exactly.  \n4 The Federal Circuit has advised that if claim -construction disputes arise on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, a \ncourt may also “r esolve the disputes to whatever extent is needed to conduct the § 101 analysis, which may well be \nless than a full, formal claim  construction.”  Aatrix , 882 F.3d at 1125.  Google does not contend that solution is \nappropriate here.  12 \n preemptive effect of the claims in that manner bolsters Singular’s argument that they are directed \nto improving computer functionality by proposing a particular computing architecture with \nparticular specifications , rather than more broa dly to the “notion of doing less precise \ncalculations .”  (Def. Mem. at 10).  See ChargePoint, Inc ., 920 F.3d at  766 (explaining that step \none of the Alice inquiry asks “ whether a claim is truly focused on an abstract idea  . . . whose use \nthe patent law doe s not authorize anyone to preempt ”).5  Thus, questions of claim construction—\nspecifically, of determining what limitations exist for the “low precision” and “high dynamic \nrange” arithmetic performed by the LPHDR processing elements —preclude granting Google’s \nmotion to dismiss.  \nGoogle contends  that the claims are directed to an abstract concept  even  if the court \nadopts Singular’s construction.  Because the claims “do not require any particular architecture \nfor the LPHDR unit,” it says, they “would impermissibly monopolize” any device “that does  \narithmetic in a way that leads to the error rates in the claim and can do calculations across the \nspecified dynamic ranges.”  (Def. Reply at 5, 7- 8).  But what limiting effect those particular error \nrates and dynamic ranges have on the claims is not clear  on this record.6  It may be that  they  are \nspecific enough to sufficiently limit the claims, or it may be that they cover an impermissibly \nbroad range of devices , as Google contends.  Making that determination requires further \ndevelopment of the factual r ecord.  \n \n5 Google contends that these limitations do not demonstrate patent eligibility because the patents’ \nspecification admits that such precision and dynamic range parameters may vary.  (Def. Mem.  at 19-20; see ’273 \nPatent  at 27:5 -7).  But because it is the claim language, rather than the specification, that “defines the breadth of \neach claim,” those general statements in the specification must yield to the claim language when identifying “the \ntrue focus of a claim.”  ChargePoint , 920 F.3d at 766.    \n6 Similarly, it is not currently clear whether those parameters —or the number of LPHDR units set forth in \nclaims 53 and 7—supply “the specificity required to transform a claim from one claiming only a result to one \nclaiming a way of achieving it .”  Compare  Ericsson Inc. v. TCL Commc ’n Tech. Holdings Ltd. , 955 F.3d 1317, 1328 \n(Fed. Cir. 2020)  (quoting SAP Am., Inc. v. InvestPic , LLC, 898 F.3d 1161, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2018)).   13 \n In any event , even setting aside the issues with claim construction, and assuming that the \nclaims  are directed to a patent -eligible abstract concept, there are questions of fact at the second \nstep of the analysis that preclude dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6).  \nC. Whether t he Claims Lack a Sufficiently Inventive Concept for Patentability  \nIf the asserted claims of a patent are directed to an abstract idea, they must be examined \nfor an “inventive concept sufficient to transform the claimed abstract idea into a patent -eligible \napplication.”   Alice , 573 U.S. at 221 (quotations omitted). \nThat examination requires the court to “consider the elements of each claim both \nindividually and as an ordered combination.”  Id. at 217.  The inquiry searches for “an element or \ncombination of elements that is sufficient to ensure that the patent in practice amounts to \nsignificantly more than a patent upon the ineligible concept itself.”  Id. at 217 -18 (internal \nquotations omitted) .  “An inventive concept reflects something more than the application of an \nabstract idea using ‘well -understood, routine, and conventional activities previously known to \nthe industry.’”  Cellspin , 927 F.3d at 1316 (Fed. Cir. 2019) (quoting Alice , 573 U.S. at 225)). \n“The question of whether a claim element or combination of elements is well- understood, routine \nand conventional to a skilled artisan in the relevant  field is a question of fact.”  Berkheimer , 881 \nF.3d at  1368.  \nHere, the amended complaint  alleges  how the computer architectures claimed by the \npatents -in-suit were unconventional.  For example, it alleges that the device of claim 53 of the \n’273 Patent  “substantially differs structurally from devices in the prior art ” because it includes \nLPHDR proces sing elements with particular parameters of precision and dynamic range.  ( See \nAC ¶ 42).  It alleges that by contrast, previous computing architectures, such as GPUs, did not \ninclude any such processing elements.  ( Id.).  In fact, the amended complaint  alleges, building \nthe device of claim 53 “required the design and manufacture of hardware different from the 14 \n hardware used in conventional processing units, because conventional hardware at that time was \ncompletely unsuitable to implement the invention. ”  (Id. ¶ 43).  Moreover, it  alleges  that “by \ndeploying massive numbers of  LPHDR execution units  in conjunction with far smaller numbers \nof higher precision processing elements ”—at least 100 fewer, to be precise —the device of claim \n53 “can execute a far larger number of operations per period than a conventional computer ” \nwhile “s upport [ing]  operations performed at a wider range of precisions and dynamic ranges .”  \n(AC ¶¶ 45 -46).  In discussing the other representative claims, the amended complaint  makes \nsimilar allegations —specifically , that they incorporated LPHDR processing elements in a way \nthat differed from and improved upon traditional computing architectures.  ( See AC ¶¶ 59- 63, \n73-80).  Accepting all of th ose allegations as true, as the Court must, t hey suggest  that even if the \nclaims are directed to an abstract idea (LPHDR arithmetic), the particular  way in which they \nincorporated that idea into existing computer processing architecture was unconventional.  See \nCellspin , 927 F.3d at 1316- 18. \nGoogle c ontends that those architectural arrangements  “existed in preexisting, \nconventional implementation s” of computer processors , and that the patents’ own specification \nconfirms this .  (Def. Mem. at 18- 20).7  It is true that the specification describes prior computing \narchitectures with features that appear broadly similar .  For example, it explains that  some \nexisting computers of a single instruction stream/multiple data stream (“SIMD”) design already \n“distribute data across a grid of processing element s,” some of which use small bit widths, \nallowing “more of them to fit in the computer.”  ( ’273 Patent  at col. 3 ll. 40- 62).  Similarly, it \n \n7 Google also contends that two other featur es alleged in the amended complaint —the use of logarithmic \nnumber system arithmetic or floating -point number system arithmetic, each at a particular bit width —are neither \nunconventional nor claimed by the patents.  (Def. Mem. at 14- 17).  Because the Court concludes that the amended \ncomplaint  adequately alleges that the claimed architectural features were unconventional, it does not reach  that \nquestion here. 15 \n notes that conventional GPU devices are  a pre -existing “variety of parallel processor” with \n“thousands of nearly identical threads of computing” that sometimes use lower -precision number \nformats.  (See id. at col. 4 l. 64- col. 5 l. 30).  However, it also notes shortcomings with those \nprior architectures  that supposedly distinguish them from the claimed invention.  ( See i d. at col. 4 \nll. 7- 23 (describing “ limitations ” in some types of SIMD computers  that made them unsuitable \n“as a general purpose computer”); col. 5 ll. 31- 40 (explaining how conventional GPUs are \n“wasteful of transistors” in the same way as conventional  CPU s)). \nIn any event, the amended complaint  sufficiently alleges that the claimed elements are \ninventive.  As set forth above, it describes how the claimed invention’s design and use of \nLPHDR processing elements supposedly varies  from conventional practice.  ( See, e.g., AC ¶¶ 42, \n43, 45- 46).  And the Federal Circuit has treated “allegations in the complaint ” as sufficient to \ndemonstrate that claims “were potentially inventive.”  Cellspin , 927 F.3d at 1317 (citing Aatrix , \n882 F.3d at 1128).   “ As long as what makes the claims inventive is recited by the claims, the \nspecification need not expressly list all the reasons why this claimed structure is \nunconventional.”  Id.    \nHere, the claims recite the features that supposedly make them  inventive —namely, the \nspecified  precision and dynamic -range parameters for LPHDR processing elements and the \ninclusion of at least 100 more such units than conventional processing elements  in the claimed \ncomputing architecture .  (See, e.g., ’273 Patent  at col. 31 l. 62- col. 32 l. 18, col. 32 ll. 37- 41, 60-\n62).  Google questions whether those features are truly inventive, rather than merely a set of \n“entirely arbitrary” specifications.  (Def. Mem. at 19 -20).  But the amended complaint  alleges \nthat they were both novel and an improvement to existing  computer architecture, and at this 16 \n stage, the Court must accept those allegations as true.8  Therefore, because the amended \ncomplaint  contains “plausible and specific factual allegations that [those] aspects of t he claims \nare inventive,” it is sufficient to survive a  motion to dismiss .  Cellspin , 927 F.3d at 1317.  \nIn summary, the Court cannot conclude at this juncture that the patents -in-suit recite \nunpatentable subject matter under 35 U.S.C. § 101 and are therefore invalid .  Accordingly, \nGoogle’s motion to dismiss will be denied. \nIV. Conclusion  \nFor the foregoing reasons, the  motion of defendant Google LLC to dismiss for failure to \nstate a claim upon which relief can be granted is DENIED.  \nSo Ordered.  \n \n /s/ F. Dennis Saylor IV   \n F. Dennis Saylor IV  \nDated: June  25, 2020  Chief Judge, United States District Court  \n \n8 Google further contends that the “specification disclaims the significance  of any particular level of \nimprecision.”   (Def. Mem. at 20 (citing ’273 Patent  at col. 27 ll. 54 -62).  But even if that is true, the amended \ncomplaint  does allege that the particular parameters set forth in the claims at issue are inventive.  ( See, e.g. , AC ¶ \n42).  Because those allegations have some support in the claims, which recite those same parameters, they must be \ntaken as true.  See Cellspin , 927 F.3d at 1317 ( explaining  that “plausible and specific factual allegations that aspects \nof the claims are inventive are sufficien t”). ",

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: This court case involves a patent infringement lawsuit filed by People.ai, Inc. against SetSail Technologies, Inc. People.ai claims that SetSail's software products infringe on several of its patents related to data analytics and CRM systems that involve machine learning. The court granted SetSail's motion to dismiss because People.ai failed to provide sufficient factual details showing how SetSail's software specifically infringes the patents in question.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether People.ai's complaint adequately alleges patent infringement by showing how SetSail's software meets the specific elements of the asserted patents.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court dismissed the complaint because People.ai did not provide enough factual allegations to plausibly claim that SetSail's software infringes its patents. The assertions failed to demonstrate the \"how and why\" of the alleged infringement, as required by precedent.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine you've invented a special kind of robot that sorts your mail, and you've gotten a patent to protect your idea. Then, you find a competitor selling a similar robot and you think they're copying your idea. To convince a judge they're infringing on your patent, you need to clearly show how their robot does the same things as your patented design. In this case, the judge didn't see enough detail from People.ai to show that SetSail’s software was actually using their patented ideas, so the case was dismissed.",

For the following reasons, the motion is GRANTE D.  \nSTATEMENT  \nPatent owner People.ai , Inc.  asserts five patents: U.S. Patent Nos. 10,679,001 (“the ’001 \npatent”); 10,565,229 (“the ’229 patent”); 10,496,634 (“the ’634 patent”); 10,657,129 (“the \n’129 patent”); and 10,503,783 (“the ’783 patent”).  The asserted patents address data-analytics  \nsoftwar e that optimize  customer -relationship management (“CRM”) systems . Case 3:20-cv-09148-WHA   Document 58   Filed 06/08/21   Page 1 of 12 \n2 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  CRM platforms such as Salesforce manage a business’s  relationships and interactions \nwith customers in order to streamline sales.  The more data input into the system, the more \nhelpful CRM  platforms  can be.  People.ai has developed patented software  that uses machine \nlearning ( i.e., artificial intelligence)  to automate data parsing and analysis to improve the \nquality of information  input into a CRM system.  SetSail competes in the same burgeoning \nmarket as People.ai , and offers various software packages, including SetSail Collect and \nDiscover (“SetSail  software ”).   \nAround October 2020, People .ai first contacted SetSail  regarding  infringement of its \npatents by SetSail’s software , and sue d in December ( Compl. ¶  11).  SetSail  moved  to dismiss  \nin February 2021, which prompted People.ai’s  amendment as of right in March (Amd. C ompl. , \nDkt. No. 36).  SetSail now moves  to dismiss  the amended complaint .  This order follows full \nbriefing and oral argument (held telephonically due to COVID -19). \nANALYSIS   \nTo survive a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), a complaint must contain sufficient \nfactual matter, accepted as true, to state a claim for relief that is plausible on its face.  Ashcroft \nv. Iqbal , 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009).  A claim is facially plausibl e when there are sufficient \nfactual allegations to draw a reasonable inference that the defendant  is liable for the \nmisconduct alleged.  While a court must take all of the factual allegations in the complaint as \ntrue, it is “not bound to accept as true a l egal conclusion couched as a factual allegation.”  Bell \nAtl. Corp. v. Twombly , 550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007).  “Factual allegations must be enough to raise \na right to relief above the speculative level.”  Ibid.  Of particular importance below, in both \nTwombly and Iqbal  the Court made plain:  allegations merely consistent  with liability are not \nenough.  550 U.S. at 556 –57; 556 U.S. at 678.  Allegations of infringement “without \nexplanation as to the how or why these products infringe  . . .  do[] not lead to any inference that \nplaintiff may be entitled to relief.”  PageMelding, Inc. v. ESPN, Inc. , No. C 11 -06263 WHA, \n2012 WL 851574, at *2 (N.D. Cal. Mar. 13, 2012).  Case 3:20-cv-09148-WHA   Document 58   Filed 06/08/21   Page 2 of 12 \n3 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  1. DIRECT INFRINGEMENT . \nA. THE ’001  PATENT . \nThe ’001 pa tent describes the use of machine learning to  filter a user’s  electronic \nactivities ( e.g., emails) to prevent certain electronic activities ( e.g., personal  emails) from being \ningested by  the CRM platform  (’001 patent  at Abstract,  Cl. 8).   In a footnote in its opposition , \nPeople.ai  withdraws its  claim for the ’001 patent , even though it subsequently argues the merits \nof the claim  (Opp. 3 fn.1) .  This order  accordingly  dismisses the infringement claim  as to the \n’001 patent  on that basis .   \nB. THE ’229  PATENT . \nThe ’229 patent describes a system that match es electronic activities ( e.g., emails) with \none or more record objects ( e.g., a specific customer  profile ) in the user’s CRM platform  (’229 \npatent at Abstract) .  The amended complaint  provides a claim chart for exemplary claim 19  \ndescribing how  the SetSail software infringes the patent (Amd. Compl. ¶ 41,  Exh. G).  After \ndisclosing a filtering process that identifies responsive electronic activities , Claim 19 recites  in \nrelevant part  (italics  added ): \nin response to determining that the electronic activity is to be \nmatched to at least one record object of the identified system of \nrecord,  \nidentify a first set of candidate record objects . . . based on an \nobject field v alue of the record object that identifies the one or \nmore recipients;  \nidentify a second  set of candidate record objects . . . based on the \nsender of the electronic activity , wherein the second policy \nincludes a third set of rules for identifying  candidate record objects \nof a second record object type;  \nselect at least one candidate record object included in both the first \nset of candidate record objects and the second  set of candidate \nrecords objects;  and \nstore, in a data structure, an association  between the  selected at \nleast one candidate record object and the electronic activity.  \n(col. 145:3 –25). In other words, the patented  system will :  (1) identify  a set of  potential record \nobjects ( e.g., a customer account) based on the recipient  of an electronic activity ( e.g., an \nemail) ; (2) identify a second set of potential record objects based on the sender  of an electronic Case 3:20-cv-09148-WHA   Document 58   Filed 06/08/21   Page 3 of 12 \n4 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  activity ; and (3)  select a record object by cross -referencing the two sets.  Defendants argue the \namended complaint does not properly allege the SetSail  software  matches electronic activities \nusing the elements claimed in the patent.   This order agrees.    \nTo support the allegations, t he amended complaint  presents  a video  screensho t showing \nthat the SetSail  software  can identify  both email recipients and senders  and two quotes from \ndefendant’s blog:   \n• SetSail Collect was purpose -built to map every contact and \ninteraction to the appropriate account or opportunity. . . .  \n• SetSail Collect captures every  interaction a sales rep has.  Collect \nwill identify as much information as possible for every phone call, \nemail, and meeting . \n(Amd. Compl.  Exh. G) .  These factual  allegations indicate  that, merely  consistent  with the ’229 \npatent, the SetSail  software  can match emails  to customer profiles .  The amended complaint \ndoes not plausibly  allege the software generates two sets of candidate  record objects  — instead  \nciting  the same  screenshot and same two broad  statements by SetSail for each limitation.  \nAllegations  that the SetSail software c ross-referenc es two sets  of record objects receives short \nshrift  in the amended complaint :  “The mapp ing of multiple accounts/contacts and the \ncapturing of every interaction a sales rep has as described by SetSail (and shown in the screen \ncaptures above) includes selecting a candidate record object in both the first and second sets of \ncandidate record obj ects as claimed ” (Amd. Compl.  Ex. G at 1 8).  This order need not accept \nthis conclusory allegation  regarding how the SetSail  software matches emails to customers . \nPeople.ai argues “given that SetSail parses emails to determine senders and recipients \nand th at SetSail admits that it is able to match when there are multiple accounts for the same \ncustomer, it is certainly plausible (even highly likely) that SetSail applies rules based on \nsenders and recipients in order to select the appropriate account or oppor tunity” ( Opp. 11).  But \nthe amended complaint does not address why it is plausible that the SetSail software uses the \nspecific elements of the patent as claimed , nor does it address why it cannot put forth \nadditional, relevant factual allegations .   Case 3:20-cv-09148-WHA   Document 58   Filed 06/08/21   Page 4 of 12 \n5 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  The amended complaint  omits  infringement allegations uncovered through any \ninvestigation People.ai may have made  into the SetSail software’s backend functionality.  An \norder dated January 7, 2021, requires “a complaint [to] explain how or why an accused produc t \ninfringes every element of every asserted claim or explain why that cannot be shown at this \nstage” (Dkt. No. 18  at ¶ 1).  See also PageMelding, Inc , 2012 WL 851574, at *2.  The amended \ncomplaint has not satisfied this requirement.   People.ai notes in its  opposition  that it cannot \nreview  SetSail’s source code and that information regarding infringing functionality will be \nuncovered in discovery ( Opp.  11–12).  But a  Rule  12(b)(6)  review  does not consider \nallegations outside the pleadings , and  the amended co mplaint  fails to speak to  People.ai’s  \nability  — or lack thereof  — to probe  the SetSail software for infringement.  Because the facts \nas alleged are insufficient, the direct infringement claim  for the ’229 patent fails.  \nC. THE ’634  PATENT . \nThe ’634 patent describes a system  that develops a “completion score” for a particular \nbusiness opportunity  (’634 patent  at Abstract,  Cl. 10).  SetSail  argues  the amended complaint’s \nfactual support is conjectu re and fails to suggest that  the SetSail softw are calculates a \ncompletion score using the same methods laid out in the patent.   This order agrees.  \nClaim 10 of the  ’634 patent recites  in relevant part : \ndetermine a completion score indicating a likelihood of completing \nan event associated with the first  record object, the completion \nscore based on  [1] the timestamp  of each of the plurality of \nelectronic activities and  [2] at least one of the role, the title, or the \ndepartment of the at least one participant of each of the plurality of \nelectronic activities;  \n(col. 196:64 –197:3 ).  To allege infringement of this element ( and previous claim element s \nrelated to identifying time stamps and a participant’s role/title/department ), the amended  \ncomplaint  cites the following  from  SetSail ’s website : \n• SetSail “[a]utomates the capturing of key customer interactions ,” \ninclud ing email . \n• SetSail  “enriches data” “by using third -party data providers to add \njob titles, emails, phone numbers.”  \n• A “model is built using a range of sales data: customer Case 3:20-cv-09148-WHA   Document 58   Filed 06/08/21   Page 5 of 12 \n6 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  information, sales rep activity, voice/email communications, \nhistorical results, and more  . . . .  The model can then make \npredictions, such as how likely a deal is to be won based on \ncontent of communications between the sales rep and the \ncustomer .” \n• “The underlying machine learning technology predicts the \nlikelihood of a deal to close.”   \n(Amd. Comp l. Exh. H ).  From th ese references , People.ai arguably alleges t he SetSail softwar e \nidentif ies timestamps for electronic activit ies.  Capturing key interacti ons (first bullet) and \nharvesting email -communication data (third bullet) can include  identifying  email timestamps.   \nFrom these references, People.ai also arguably  alleges the SetSail Software can identify a \nparticipant’s role/title /department though its use of third -party sources (second bullet) and \nidentification of customer information (third bullet).   \n People.ai runs into a problem when it tries to merge  these allegations  and conclude that \nthe SetSail software calculates a completion  score as claimed  in the patent .  The amended \ncomplaint  alleges the SetSail software has an array of  different  means at its disposal  it can use \nto analyze data.  The amended complaint, however,  provides no plausible factual basis to \nconclude the SetSail software  determine s a completion score  using the particular means of  \nanalyzing  data claim ed by the ’634 patent — timestamp  identification and role/title/department \nidentification .  Rather, the al legations reveal merely  the possibility that the SetSail  software \nhas the capability to utilize the claimed  combination of analyses .  The amended complaint does \nnot adequately allege the “how and why” of infringement, and People.ai  has failed to address \nany practical obstacles to its investigation into infringement.  Accepting all factual allegations \nin the amended complaint as true , People.ai  does not properly  allege  the SetSail  software \ninfringes  the ’634 patent’s recited limitations.  See Iqbal , 556 U.S. at 678.   \nD. THE ’129  PATENT . \nThe ’129 patent describes systems and methods that connect and update a “node profile” \n(e.g., a profile for an activity participant) with information from related electronic activities \n(e.g., emails)  (’129 patent at Abstract, col. 1 :41–65).  SetSail  argues  here as well  that People.ai  \nonly pleads that  the SetSail  software has the same (unprotected)  end functionality.   This order \nagrees.  Case 3:20-cv-09148-WHA   Document 58   Filed 06/08/21   Page 6 of 12 \n7 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  SetSail primarily challenges the following limitation from e xemplary claim 20:  \nMatch the electronic activity to at least one node profile of the \nplurality of node profiles based on determining  that the extracted \ndata of the electronic activity and one or more values of the fields  \nof the at least one node profile satisfy a node profile matching \npolicy;  \n(col. 199:39 –43).  “[S]uch node profiles are determined dynamically by a ‘node graph \ngeneration system’ based on information from the company’s records and other information \nsuch as the role, the title o r the department of an individual who is identified in an electronic \nactivity ” (Amd. Compl.  ¶ 121 (citing ’129 patent  at 25:44 –26:23 )).   \nThe amended complaint  contains no factual allegations explaining how the SetSail \nsoftware uses a “node graph generation system” to match electronic activities with node \nprofiles.  For example, the amended complaint  cites SetSail’s general claim that “SetSail \nCollect captures every interaction a sales rep has.”  This blurb does not plausibly indicate t hat \nthe SetSail software uses a “node profile matching policy” powered by a “node graph \ngeneration system.”   People.ai pleads only conclusory explanations connecting the SetSail  \nsoftware to the claim elements  that this order need not accept as true:  \nBecause SetSail uses electronic activities to determine whether to \ncreate new contacts, People.ai is informed and believes that SetSail \nmatches electronic activities  to node profiles of participants by \ndetermining extracted data ( for example, an email address, a first \nor last name, or a company name) and data included in the node \nprofile . \n(Amd. Compl . Exh. I at 7).  Similar to the ’229 and ’634 patent s, the amended complaint does \nnot sufficiently explain  how or why SetSail infringe s the ’129 patent .  Without further \nallegations , the claim remains purely speculative .  Twombly , 550 U.S. at 554 –55; see also \nPageMelding, Inc , 2012 WL 851574, at *2 .  The infringement claim for the ’129 patent fails.    \nE. THE ’783  PATENT . \nThe ’783 patent addresses  whether to associate an electronic activity ( e.g., an email) with \nan existing record object ( e.g., a customer profile) or to create a new record object  based upon \nwhether a match score meets a certain minimum threshold  (’783 Paten t at abstract) .  SetSail  Case 3:20-cv-09148-WHA   Document 58   Filed 06/08/21   Page 7 of 12 \n8 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  one again assert s that the amended complaint does not properly allege that  the SetSail software  \nuses the  recited limitations of exemplary claim 12.   This order agrees.  \nExemplary claim 12 of the ’783 patent contains , in relevant  part, the following element  \n(italics added) : \ndetermine for each candidate record object, responsive to \ncomparing the activity field -value pairs to the object -field value \npairs of the plurality of candidate record objects, that a match score  \nindicating a likel ihood of the electronic activity matching the \ncandidate record object does not satisfy a threshold ; \n(’783 patent  at 198:20 –25).  People. ai cites SetSail’s blurb that : “Collect will automatically log \nwhen a meeting occurs, identify all attendees, and creates new contacts if any of them aren’t \nalready a contact ” (Amd. Compl.  Exh. J at 12 ) (emphasis in original).   \nThese allegations suggest  the SetSail  software  has simil ar functionality as the ’783 patent  \n— creating a new  profile for a contact  if one  does not already exist  in the system  — but the \namended complaint  fails to assert  that functionality is achieved using the patented elements.  \nThe amended complaint omits allegations regarding how SetSail creates a match score or \nmatching threshold, and instead parrots the claim language: “People.ai is informed and \nbelieves that SetSail uses a match score to match an electronic activity to a candidate record \nobjects of the plur ality of candidate record objects to determine which candidate record object \nis the closes t match with the electronic activity”  (ibid).   These conclusory recitations are \ninsufficient to state a claim.  Twombly , 550 U.S. at 555.   \nPeople.ai  argues that whether  the SetSail software uses a “match score” to associate \nelectronic activities with candidate record objects concerns claim constructio n and not the \nsufficiency of the pleadings.  But the parties have not presented conflicting interpretations of \nthe claim  terms  here — People.ai  has rather  failed to properly address the “match score ” and \n“threshold” elements  at all  beyond conclusory statem ents this order need not accept.  Neither \nof the cases People.ai  cites supports its argument  (Opp. 19) .  Nalco Co. v. Chem -Mod, LLC  \nfocused on whether the patent owner  pleaded facts that established a complete defense to its \nown claims , not whether the fac tual allegations were sufficiently plausible under Twombly and \nIqbal .  883 F.3d 1337, 1347 –48 (Fed. Cir. 2018).

Uniloc’s complaint  alleged  how Apple’s product met a certain claim element  — the \nparties  just interpret ed that  particular limitation  differently , a classic claim construction \ndispute .  Id. at *3 –4.  Whereas h ere, the amended complaint  has not adequately alleged  how or \nwhy the SetSail  software  uses a match score in the first place  — or what information People.ai  \nrequires to make that allegation .  PageMelding , 2012 WL 851574, at *2.  People.ai’s  \ninfringement claim for the ’783 patent  accordingly  fails. \n2. INDIRECT  INFRINGEMENT . \nSetSail  contends the amended complaint fails to state a claim for indirect infringement \nbecause it (1) fails to plead  a direct infringement claim and (2) fails to allege facts showing \neither induced or contributory infringement.  Both contributory and induced infringement \nrequire sufficient allegations of direct infringement.  See 35 U.S.C. § 271(b), (c) ; Medgraph, \nInc. v. Medtronic, Inc. , 843 F.3d 942, 948  (Fed. Cir. 2016) .  As explained, People.ai  fails to \nstate a claim for direct infringement for each patent asserted.  But even if People.ai  had \nsuccessfully pleaded direct infringement, its indirect infringement argumen ts still fail.  \nA. INDUCED INFRINGEMENT . \n“Whoever actively induces infringement of a patent shall be liable as an infringer .”  35 \nU.S.C. § 271(b).  Induced infringement  “requires knowledge that the induced acts constitute \npatent infringement.” Global -Tech App liances, Inc. v. SEB S.A. , 563 U.S. 754, 766 (2011). \nSuch knowledge requires that the accused inducer not only had “knowledge of the patent in \nsuit” but also “knew the acts were infringing.” Commil USA, LLC v. Cisco Sys., Inc. , 575 U.S. \n632, 639, 642 (2015 ). The accused inducer must also have possessed “a specific intent to \nencourage another's infringement of the patent.” Vita-Mix Corp. v. Basic Holding, Inc. , 581 \nF.3d 1317, 1328 (Fed. Cir. 2009).    \nThe amended complaint’s  perfunctory recitation of  the elements of induced infringement \nfail to provide factual support  for the claim .  For example, for the ’634 patent :  “On \ninformation and belief, prior to this action, SetSail had knowledge of and intended to cause \ndirect infringement by others and/or SetSa il willfully blinded itself to the existence of the ’634 Case 3:20-cv-09148-WHA   Document 58   Filed 06/08/21   Page 9 of 12 \n10 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  patent and such infringement ” (Amd. Compl. ¶ 78).  People.ai has simply couched its legal \nconclusions in the guise of factual allegations, which Twombly  and Iqbal  soundly rejec ted.  \nTwombly , 550 U.S.  at 555; Iqbal , 556 U.S. at 678.   \nThe amended compla int also provides only  a cursory overview of pre -suit \ncorrespondence between the parties , and does not  allege that a claim chart or other description \nof infringement was included with the correspondence  (Amd. Compl. ¶¶ 11, 42, 74, 104, 135) .  \nBare allegations of knowledge of a patent do not support an inference of knowledge of alleged \ninfringement.  People.ai’s  induced infringement theory fails.  \nB. CONTRIBUTORY INFRINGEMENT . \nTo state a claim for contributory infringement , the patent owner must properly allege:  \n“1) that there is direct infringement, 2) that the accused infringer had knowledge of the patent, \n3) that the component has no substantial noninfringing uses, and 4) th at the component is a \nmaterial part of the invention.”  Fujitsu Ltd. v. Netgear Inc. , 620 F.3d 1321, 1326 (Fed. Cir. \n2010).  \nThe amended complaint repeats  the same assertion for each patent.  The allegations \nregarding , for example,  the ’634 patent state:   \nOn information and belief, defendant SetSail is also a contributory \ninfringer of one of more claims of the ’634 patent, at least because \nit sells, offers to sell, or imports into the US a product for use in \npracticing subject matter claimed in the ’634 pat ent, constituting a \nmaterial part of the invention, knowing the same to be especially \nmade or especially adapted for use in such infringement, and not a \nstaple article or commodity of commerce suitable for substantial \nnon-infringing use .  \n(Amd. Compl. ¶ 79 ).  This merely parrots the text of  Section 2 71(c).  Such a legal conclusion \nis not entitled to the presumption of truth.   \nAs explained, People.ai do es not properly allege pre -suit knowledge.  The amended \ncomplaint  also provides no insight into how the SetSail software  constitutes a component of a \nlarger system infringing the patent s at issue .  Without more factual matter,  People.ai  has not \nsatisfied Rule 8’s requirement f or “fair notice of what the claim is and the grounds upon which Case 3:20-cv-09148-WHA   Document 58   Filed 06/08/21   Page 10 of 12 \n11 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  it rests.”  Twombly , 550 U.S. at 555  (cleaned up) .   For these reasons, People.ai’s  contributory \nliability claim fails.  \n3. IMPORT AND EXPORT ALLEGATIONS . \nPeople.ai  includes in its allegations (fle eting) references to 35 U.S.C. § 271(f) and (g), \nwhich extend liability for patent infringement to the export from the United States of a \npatented invention ’s components , and the import into the United States of products made by a \npatented process, respect ively.  These allegations fail.  In short, software in the abstract  can be \nneither a component, as required by Section 271(f), nor a manufacture, as required by Section \n271(g).  Microsoft Corp. v. AT & T Corp. , 550 U.S. 437, 450 –51 (2007) (Section 271(f) ); \nBayer AG v. Housey Pharm., Inc. , 340 F.3d 1367, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2003) (Section 271(g) ).    \nMoreover, the amended complaint’s allegations regarding import and export are \nconclusory , boilerplate insertions, such as , “Defendant SetSail  is liable as an indirect infringer \nfor the direct infringement of others that have made, used, sold, or offered to sell, or imported \ninto the U.S.,  products or services  that are within the scope of one or more claims of the ’634 \npatent” ( Amd. Compl.  ¶ 77) .  The amended complaint pleads no further information regarding \nactivities outside the United States.   People.ai  attempts to exonerate its pleading in its \nopposition, arguing : “SetSail does not claim that it does not engage in any import/export \nactivity o r that it has no customers, business partners, or operations abroad” (Opp.  24).  Double \nnegative aside, it is not the sufficiency of SetSail’s  denial at issue here but the sufficiency of \nthe amended complaint.  This order does not accept as true the amende d complaint’s \nconclusory allegations regarding Section 271(f) and (g), which People.ai  appears to \nacknowledge as speculative.  Twombly , 550 U.S. at 555.  \nFor the foregoing reasons, People.ai’s  Section 271(f) and (g) allegations fail.  \nCONCLUSION   \nFor the above reasons, SetSail’s  motion to dismiss  is GRANTED .   \nPeople.ai  may move for leave to file an amended complaint . People.ai  has FOURTEEN \nDAYS from the date of this order to file a motion, noticed on the normal 35 -day calendar, for \nleave to file a n amended complaint.  Their motion must affirmatively demonstrate how the Case 3:20-cv-09148-WHA   Document 58   Filed 06/08/21   Page 11 of 12 \n12 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  proposed amended complaint corrects the deficiencies identified in this order, as well as any \nother deficiencies raised in defendant's motion, if at all, but not addressed herein.   The motion \nshould be accompanied by a  proposed amended complaint as well as a  redlined copy of the \namended complaint.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: In this case, several music publishing companies have sued Anthropic PBC, claiming that its AI, Claude, infringed their copyrights by using their song lyrics to train its language models without permission. The court granted Anthropic's motion to dismiss the claims for secondary copyright infringement and removal of copyright management information, giving the plaintiffs permission to amend their complaint. The case highlights the issues of AI models being trained on potentially copyrighted material and the challenges of proving contributory and vicarious infringement in such contexts.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether Anthropic's AI model infringed copyright laws by using and distributing songs in a manner that constitutes contributory or vicarious infringement and if it removed copyright management information in violation of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA).\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court dismissed the claims for contributory and vicarious infringement and removal of copyright management information, citing a lack of specific allegations of direct third-party infringement and insufficiently shown knowledge by Anthropic of such infringements. However, the court allowed the plaintiffs to amend their complaint to address these deficiencies.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine you wrote a super cool song and a robot (AI) reads it without asking you first, then tells other people your song without saying you wrote it. The song companies who own many songs say this robot is not playing by the rules. The court said the companies need to better explain how the robot is breaking these rules before they can continue with their complaint.",

Id. ¶¶ 37 -39; see also id . Ex. A.  Publishers  collect \nincome from licenses and agreements regarding the Works.  Id. ¶ 44.  Publishers  depend on \nrevenues from the licenses to support and promote songwriters, and songwriters depend on \nlicensing royalties for their livelihoods.  Id. ¶ 47.    \nDefendant Anthropic PBC (“Anthropic”) is a technology company whose signature \nproduct line is “Claude,” a series of general -purpose AI large language models (“LLMs”).  Id. \n¶¶ 49-50.  Anthropic provides  access to Claude through a chat interface (“chatbot”) on its website ; \nthe chatbot is available to the public through a paid subscription or through a more limited free \nversion.  Id. ¶ 52.  Anthropic also provides access  to Claude  “as a commercial Application \nProgramming Interface (“API”) through which custom third -party client software interacts with \nClaude  AI models .”  Id.  Anthropic sells or licenses the API-based access to its commercial \ncustomers.2  Id. \nAnthropic trains Claude  by first creating a training “corpus,” meaning it collects (or \n“scrapes”) a large amount of content from the Internet “and potentially other sources”  to create a \ntraining dataset .  Id. ¶ 54(a).  Anthropic then removes unwanted content  from the corpus , i.e., \nmaterial that is duplicative or offensive, and converts the information into words or parts of words \ncalled “tokens.”  Id. ¶ 54(b) -(c).  Once this material is copied into computer memory, Anthropic \n“finetune s” Claude through “reinforcement learning” based on human and AI feedback.  Id. \n¶ 54(d).  After this process is complete, Claude models generate output consi stent with the \nmaterial in the training corpus and the reinforcement feedback.

For purposes of ruling on this motion, the \nCourt assumes that the allegations related to Anthropic’s business practices, including Claude’s \navailability, training and functionality,  remain current .

See, e.g ., id. ¶¶ 66 -67.  Publishers claim  \nthat Anthropic infringes their copyright s by copying the lyrics for Claude’s training, and then \ndistributing them in Claude’s output in response to “queries related to songs and various other \nsubject matter.”  Id. ¶ 80.  \nB. Procedural Background  \nOn October 18, 2023, Publishers commenced this action in the U.S. District Court for the \nMiddle District of Tennessee by asserting claims for direct copyright infringement, contributory \ninfringement, vicarious infringement, and the removal of copyright management information  \n(“CMI”) in violation of  Section 1202(b) of the Digital Millenium Copyright Act (“DMCA”) .3  \nECF No. 1.  On November 22, 2023, Anthropic filed a motion to dismiss the case for lack of \npersonal jurisdiction under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(2), or, in the alternative, to \ntransfer venue.  ECF No. 54.  On June 24, 2024, the Middle District of Tennessee granted \nAnthropic’s motion in part, and transferred the case to the Northern District of California.  ECF \nNo. 124.   \nOn August 15, 2024, Anthropic filed a motion to dismiss  all but the direct copyright \ninfringement claims under Rule 12(b)(6).4  ECF No. 205.  On August 21, 2024, this case was \nreassigned to the undersigned.  On December 19 , 2024, the Court heard argument on the motion to \ndismiss  and took th e motion under submission .  ECF No. 2 81.     \nII. LEGAL STANDARD  \nUnder Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), a court must dismiss a complaint if it fails \nto state a claim upon which relief can be granted.  To avoid dismissal, the plaintiff must allege \n \n3 The DMCA amended existing copyright law to add, inter alia , Sections 1201 -1205, concerning \nCopyright Protection and Management Systems.   \n4 The Court DENIES Publishers ’ request to deny this motion as untimely .  Publishers argue that \nAnthropic violate d Rule 12(g) by failing to include its Rule 12(b)(6) arguments in the earlier -filed \nRule 12(b)(2) motion.   See ECF No. 54.   This argument lacks merit because t he parties’ pre -\ntransfer stipulated case management schedule permitted Anthropic to file an answer “or otherwise \nrespond” after the Middle District of Tennessee  ruled on Anthropic’s Rule 12(b)(2) motion to \ndismiss.  See ECF No. 64 .  The Court further notes that the interest of judicial efficiency would be \npoorly served by denying this motion on untimeliness grounds , only to have Anthropic seek to re -\nfile it under Rule 12(c), thereby prolong ing the pleading s phase of this case.  ECF No. 1.   Case 5:24-cv-03811-EKL     Document 322     Filed 03/26/25     Page 3 of 12 \n4 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  “enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.”  Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly , \n550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007).  A claim is facially plausible when the pleaded facts allow the court “to \ndraw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.”  Ashcroft v. \nIqbal , 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009).  For purposes of a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, the court generally \n“accept[s] factual allegations in the complaint as true and construe[s] the pleadings in the light \nmost favorable t o the nonmoving party.”  Manzarek v. St. Paul Fire & Marine Ins. Co ., 519 F.3d \n1025, 1031 (9th Cir. 2008).  However, the court need not “assume the truth of legal conclusions \nmerely because they are cast in the form of factual allegations.”  Fayer v. Vaughn , 649 F.3d 1061, \n1064 (9th Cir. 2011) (per curiam) (quoting W. Mining Council v. Watt , 643 F.2d 618, 624 (9th Cir. \n1981)).   \nIf dismissal is warranted, the court should grant leave to amend “unless it determines that \nthe pleading could not possibly be cured by the allegation of other facts.”  Lopez v. Smith , 203 \nF.3d 1122, 1127 (9th Cir. 2000) (en banc) (quoting Doe v. United States , 58 F.3d 494, 497 (9th \nCir. 1995) ).   \nIII. DISCUSSION  \nAnthropic seeks to dismiss  Counts II (contributory infringement), III (vicarious \ninfringement), and IV (the intentional removal of CMI), arguing that Publishers have failed to \nstate a claim.  The Court addresses each in turn.  \nA. Contributory Infringement (Count II) \nTo state a claim for contributory infringement, Publishers must allege that Anthropic \n(1) has knowledge of another’s infringement, and (2) materially contributes to or induces that \ninfringement.  Perfect 10, Inc. v. Visa Int ’l Serv. Ass ’n, 494 F.3d 788, 795 (9th Cir. 2007).  “[T]he \nexistence of direct infringement is a necessary element of a claim for contributory infringement. ”  \nPetroliam Nasional Berhad v. GoDaddy.com, Inc. , 897 F. Supp. 2d 856, 867 (N.D. Cal. 2012) \n(citing  Perfect 10 , 494 F.3d at 795 ).  Anthropic moves to dismiss Count II on the grounds that \nPublishers fail to allege either a predicate act of direct infringement by a third party, or specific \nknowledge by Anthropic of any third -party infringement.   Case 5:24-cv-03811-EKL     Document 322     Filed 03/26/25     Page 4 of 12 \n5 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  1. Publishers have not alleged a predicate act of direct third -party \ninfringement.  \nAccording to Publishers, the complaint adequately alleges predicate acts of third -party \ninfringement by both individual Claude users and Anthropic business customers.  Opp. at 8.  \nPublishers point to allegations that individual users, through Anth ropic’s website, “ can request and \nobtain through Claude verbatim or near -verbatim copies of lyrics[.]”  Compl . ¶ 65.  Publishers \nalso allege that “ [w]hen  a user prompts . . . Claude’s AI chatbot to provide the lyrics to songs . . . \nthe chatbot will provide responses that contain all or significant portions of thos e lyrics.”  Id. ¶ 8.  \nPublishers argue that because Claude is available to users “in a variety of ways,” individual users \n“could and would direct Claude to deliver copies of Publishers’ lyrics.”5  Opp. at 9.  Publishers \nfurther contend that Anthropic’s business customers “might use the Claude API tool” to seek \ncopyrighted lyrics  in the process of prompting Claude to generate creative output.6  Id. at 9 -10.   \nPublishers’ allegations and arguments do not support the requested inference of direct \nthird -party infringement.  The allegations assert what unidentified users “can” do when prompting \nClaude, but Publishers have not clearly allege d a predicate act of direct  third -party  infringement.  \nOther allegations emphasized by Publishers in their opposition are conclusory, and provide no \nfacts regarding direct third -party infringement.7  See Compl. ¶¶ 11, 120 and 134 .   \n \n5 This argument relies on  an unsupported assumption .  First, Publishers point to allegations that \nAnthropic provides individual users with access to Claude “in a variety of ways, including as a \n‘limited free version’” on Anthropic’s website .  Opp. at 9 (citing Compl. ¶ 52).  Next, Publishers \nallege that there is a “well -established market of users searching for lyrics online.”  Id. (citing \nCompl. ¶¶ 9, 108).  From these allegations, Publishers ask the Court to infer that “typical users \nmay have sought lyrics from Claude as that service is no more costly or inconvenient than any \nother [lyrics aggregator] method.”  Id.  Publishers also attempt to shift the burden to Anthropic, \nnoting that “Anthropic has not explained why users would not seek to use Claude . . . to obtain \nlyrics.”  Id.  Neither the allegations nor Publishers’ arguments on this point support the requested \ninference.  \n6 This argument involves similar assumptions.  Publishers assert that Anthropic makes Claude AI \nmodels available to business customers through its API, which interacts with third -party client \nsoftware .  Opp. at 9 -10 (citing Compl. ¶ 52).  Publishers note Anthropic ’s acknowledge ment  that \nsome of its customers “ might use the Claude API as a tool to ‘brainstorm[] plot ideas for stories.’”  \nId. at 10 (citing Mot. at 1 ).  Based on these facts, Publishers conclude that “[i]t is reasonable to \ninfer that some requests will seek copyrighted works ,” citing an alle ged prompt,  by an unidentified \nuser, to “[w]rite a short piece of fiction in the style of Louis Amstron g.”  Id. (citing  Compl. ¶ 79 ).  \nPublishers’ assertions do not support a reasonable inference of direct infringement by Anthropic’s \nbusiness customers.   \n7 Publishers cite August Image, LLC v. Trend Hunter Inc ., No. CV 22 -7120 -DMG (MAAx), 2023 \nWL 6783845, at *2 (C.D. Cal. Sept. 12, 2023 ), in support of their argument that the complaint Case 5:24-cv-03811-EKL     Document 322     Filed 03/26/25     Page 5 of 12 \n6 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  The parties  spent time at hearing and in their briefs  disput ing whether prompts that were \nentered by Publishers’ investigators – as opposed to a third party  – could satisfy this threshold \npleading requirement.  Although t he complaint contains numerous examples of output containing \ncopyrighted lyrics  generated by Claude in response to prompts , the complaint does not attribute \nthe prompts to a n author .  See e.g., id. ¶¶ 66 -69.  Anthropic argues that these allegations “reflect \nPlaintiffs’ attempts to generate alleged copies of their own lyrics,” and are therefore “ per se non-\ninfringing, so they cannot support a secondary infringement claim.”  Mot. at 6.  Publishers appear \nto concede that at least some of the prompts discussed in the complaint were entered by Publishers \nor their investigators.  See Opp. at 13 ( arguing that “[i]t would be premature to dismiss the \n[c]omplaint for failure to specify other third -party infringements when Publishers have alleged that \nClaude regurgitate s lyrics in response to . . . Plaintiffs and their investigators ”) (citing Compl.  \n¶¶ 66-74, 75 -79).  None of the allegations in the complaint indicate who submitted the prompts  \nthat resulted in infringing output , let alone whether they were submitted by Publishers’ \ninvestigators.  See, e.g ., Compl. ¶ 67 (alleging that “when Anthropic’s Claude is prompted ‘What \nare the lyrics to I Will Survive by Gloria Gaynor, ’ . . . the model responds by providing a nearly \nword -for-word copy of those lyrics”).  If the “users” referenced in the complaint are Publishers’ \ninvestigators, Publishers should allege this.8  The Court declines to decide at this time whether \noutput prompted by Publishers’ investigators would constitute a predicate act of third -party \ninfringement  as a matter of law  because Publishers have not allege d these facts .   \n2. Publishers have not alleged that Anthropic had knowledge of specific \nacts of third -party infringement.  \nEven if Publishers had alleged a predicate act of third -party infringement, they have not \n \nadequately alleges direct third -party infringement.  Opp. at 11.  Much of the language quoted by \nPublishers related to the direct infringement claim in August Image .  Id.  The plaintiff in August \nImage  included more detail, including  the URL location of the allegedly infringing uses.   Id.  \nAugust Image  does not otherwise assist Publishers as the court did not directly discuss the third -\nparty infringement requirement.  \n8 The record contains a significant amount of evidence that Publishers’ experts prompted Claude \nfor output containing protected song lyrics .  That evidence, which was submitted in connection \nwith Publishers’ motion for preliminary injunction, may not be considered for purposes of ruling \non this motion.   Case 5:24-cv-03811-EKL     Document 322     Filed 03/26/25     Page 6 of 12 \n7 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  stated a plausible claim because the complaint does not allege that Anthropic knew or had reason \nto know of any third -party infringement.  The first prong of a contributory infringement claim \n“requires more than a generalized knowledge ” of “the possibility of infringement.”  Luvdarts, LLC \nv. AT & T Mobility, LLC , 710 F.3d 1068, 1072 (9th Cir. 2013) (holding that conclusory allegations \nthat defendant s had the required knowledge of infringement were “plainly insufficient” to satisfy \nspecific knowledge require ment ).  To state a claim for contributory infringement , Publishers must \nallege “ actual knowledge of specific acts of infringement .”  Id.   \nPublishers contend  that A nthropic is “well aware of  its licensees’ and users’ infringing \nactivities through its AI products”  because it “knowingly trained its AI models on infringing \ncontent on a massive scale in order to enable those models to generate responses to user prompts \nthat infringe Publishers’ copyrighted lyrics.”  Opp. at 15 (citing Compl. ¶ 122).   Such  allegations \nare conclusory at best.  Claude may be capable of “ substantial lawful as well as unlawful uses ,”  \nbut contributory liability does no t “automatically follow ” where the technology arguably permits  \nboth.  Luvdarts , 710 F.3d at 1072 ( first quoting Metro -Goldwyn -Mayer Studios Inc. v. Grokster, \nLtd., 545 U.S. 913, 932 -33 (2005 ); then citing A&M Record, Inc. v. Napster Inc ., 239 F.3d 1004, \n1021 (9th Cir. 2001) ).  In other words,  the inclusion of protected lyrics in Claude’s training corpus  \nalone  does not establish actual knowledge by Anthropic of third -party infringement.   \nThe cases cited by Publishers in support of this theory do not assist them in light of the \nconclusory nature of the  allegations  in the complaint .  See Opp. at 16.  For example, i n BMG Rts. \nMgmt. (US) v. Jo yy Inc. , the court held that the defendant’s responses to over half of plaintiffs’ \ntakedown requests for copyrighted material supported a reasonable inference that the defendant \nhad specific knowledge of third -party infringement  related to the requests .  716 F. Supp. 3d 835, \n843 (C.D. Cal. 202 4).  And in Splunk Inc. v. Cribl, Inc. , the court held that the plaintiff adequately \nalleged knowledge of infringement because the defendant’s CEO “‘derived go -S2S from Splunk’s \ncopyrighted source code,’ ‘provided this code to Cribl . . . with knowledge that go -S2S was an \nunlicensed derivative of Splunk’s copyrighted S2S version 3 code,’ and ‘each new version of \nCribl’s Stream software includes a new copy of this unlicensed derivative of Splunk’s copyrighted \nS2S version 3 code .’”  662 F. Supp. 3d 1029, 1052 (N.D. Cal. 2023)  (citation omitted) .  In those Case 5:24-cv-03811-EKL     Document 322     Filed 03/26/25     Page 7 of 12 \n8 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  cases , the plaintiffs made specific allegations establishing the element of knowledge or supporting \nan inference of knowledge .  Here, the allegations  regarding knowledge are conclus ory and \nspeculative.  They do not satisfy the pleading standard .   \nBecause the complaint fails to allege either a predicate act of direct third -party \ninfringement or actual knowledge of infringement , the Court grants the motion as to Count II with \nleave to amend.   \nB. Vicarious Infringement (Count III) \n  “To state a claim for vicarious copyright infringement, a plaintiff must allege that the \ndefendant has (1) the right and ability to supervise the infringing conduct and (2) a direct financial \ninterest in the infringing activity.”  Perfect 10 , 494 F.3d at 802 (citing Ellison v. Robertson , 357 \nF.3d 1072, 1078 (9th Cir. 2004)).  Stated differently, “[o] ne . . . infringes vicariously by profiting \nfrom direct infringement while declining to exercise a right to stop or limit it.”   Id. (quoting \nGrokster , 545 U.S. at 930 ).  “Like contributory liability, vicarious liability requires an underlying \nact of direct infringement.”  Perfect 10, Inc. v. Yandex N.V ., 962 F. Supp. 2d 1146, 1158 (N.D. \nCal. 2013).   As discussed above, Publishers fail to allege the necessary predicate act of direct \ninfringement  by a third party .  Thus , the Court grants the motion to dismiss Count III with leave to \namend.   \nAccording to Anthropic , Publishers also fail to state a claim for vicarious infringement \nbecause they have not alleged that Anthropic  had a direct financial interest in any infringing \nactivity.  On this point , the Court disagrees.  “Financial benefit exists where the availability of \ninfringing material ‘acts as a draw  for customers. ’”  Napster , 239 F.3d at 1023 (citing Fonovisa , \nInc. v. Cherry Auction, Inc ., 76 F.3d 259, 263 -64 (9th Cir. 2001)).   “The size of the draw  relative \nto a defendant ’s overall business is immaterial. ”  Perfect 10, Inc. v. Giganews, Inc ., 847 F.3d 657, \n673 (9th Cir . 2017)  (quoting Perfect 10, Inc. v. Giganews, Inc. , No. CV 11 -07098 -AB (SHx), \n2014 WL 8628031, at *3 (C.D. Cal. Nov. 14, 2014)) .  “The essential aspect of the ‘direct financial \nbenefit ’ inquiry is whether there is a causal relationship between the infringing activity and any \nfinancial benefit a defendant reaps, regardless of how substantial  the benefit is in proportion to a \ndefendant ’s overall profits.”  Ellison , 357 F.3d at 1079 .  “There is no requirement that the draw be Case 5:24-cv-03811-EKL     Document 322     Filed 03/26/25     Page 8 of 12 \n9 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  ‘substantial. ’”  Id. \nAssuming  for the sake of argument that Publishers will amend the complaint to allege a \npredicate act of third -party infringement, t he current allegations  plausibly state that Anthropic \nreceived a direct financial benefit.  See, e.g ., Compl. ¶ 94 (alleging that Anthropic receives \nrevenues from commercial customers based on the amount of text submitted by the customers’ \nend users into the Claude API and the amount of text generated as output ); id. (alleging that \nAnthropic “is paid every time one of its custom ers’ end users submits a request for Publishers’ \nsong lyrics, and it is paid again every time its Claude API generates output copying and relying on \nthose lyrics” ); id. ¶ 98 ( “One of the reasons that Anthropic’s AI models are so popular and \nvaluable is because of the substantial underlying text corpus that includes Publishers’ copyrighted \nlyrics.   As such, Publishers’ copyrighted content serves as a draw for individual users, commercial \ncustomers, and ultimately investors.” ).  Accepting these allegations as true for purposes of this \nmotion, Publishers have plausibly allege d that Anthropic received a direct financial benefit  from \npotentially infringing activity .  See e .g., Keck v. Alibaba.com Hong Kong Ltd., 369 F. Supp. 3d \n932, 938 (N.D. Cal. 2019)  (denying motion to dismiss vicarious infringement claim where the \nplaintiff  alleged that defendants reproduced plaintiff ’s artwork on their websites ; the infringing \nmaterial drew customers to the websites ; defendants received commissions from the sale of \nunauthorized copies of her work ; and defendants had monetized increased traffic due to the work) .  \nHowever , because Publishers have failed to allege direct infringement by Anthropic’s users, the \nCourt grants the motion with leave to amend as to Count III.  \nC. Removal o r Alteration of Copyright Management Information (Count IV) \nCount IV allege s that Anthropic “intentionally remov ed or alter ed copyright management \ninformation from Publishers’ musical compositions, and/or distribut ed or import ed for distribution \ncopies of Publishers’ musical compositions knowing that copyright management information has \nbeen removed or altered, without Publishers’ authorization ,” in violation of Section 1202(b)  of the \nDMCA .  Compl. ¶ 149.  The complaint does not specify which subsections of Section 1202(b) are \nat issue .  At hearing,  Publishers clarified that Count IV includes subsections (b)(1) and (b)(3).  \n12/19/2024 Hr’g Tr. at 20 .

Corelogic, Inc ., 899 F.3d 666, 671 (9th Cir. 2018)  (citing \n17 U.S.C. § 1202(b) -(c)).  Section 1202(b)(1) provides, “No person shall, without the authority of \nthe copyright owner or the l aw . . . intentionally remove or alter any copyright management \ninformation.”   17 U.S.C. § 1202(b)(1).   Section 1202(b)(3) states : \n \nNo person shall, without the authority of the copyright owner or the law . . . distribute \n. . . copies of works, or phonorecords, knowing that copyright management \ninformation has been removed or altered without authority of the copyright owner or \nthe law,  knowing, or . . . having reasonable grounds to know, that it will induce, \nenable, facilitate, or conceal an infringement of any right under this title.   \n“Both provisions thus require the defendant to possess the mental state of knowing, or having a \nreasonable basis to know, that  [the removal of CMI]  ‘will induce, enable, facilitate, or conceal ’ \ninfringement. ”  Stevens , 899 F.3d at 673 ; see also Doe 1 v. GitHub, Inc ., 672 F. Supp. 3d 837, 858 \n(N.D. Cal. 2023) (“On a motion to dismiss, a plaintiff must allege sufficient facts to support the \nreasonable inference that the defendant ‘knew or had a reasonable basis to know that the removal \nor alteration of CMI . . . w[ould] aid infringement.’” ).   \nAccording to Publishers , the allegations reflect that Anthropic intentionally removed CMI.  \nPublishers highlight paragraph s 84 and  149 of the complaint, but those allegations are conclusory .  \nThey simply repeat the statut ory language without stating any facts to show that Anthropic \nintentionally removed CMI .  Publishers identify other portions of the complaint relating to the \nomission of CMI from Claude’s output, and contend these sections support an inference that CMI \nwas intentionally removed.  See Opp. a t 21-22 (citing Compl. ¶¶ 11, 73, 74, 86, 87) .  They do not.  \nAlthough Publishers plausibly allege that the output omits the CMI regarding the Works, th ey \nhave not sufficiently pled that Anthropic acted intentionally as to the removal of CMI.  See \nCompl. ¶  11 (alleging that Claude’s output “often omits critical [CMI]” regarding the Works ”), \n¶ 86 (alleging that when Claude has reproduced lyrics they are “often unaccompanied by” CMI ), \n¶¶ 73, 74, 87  (examples of song lyrics where Claude allegedly omitted attribution).   Case 5:24-cv-03811-EKL     Document 322     Filed 03/26/25     Page 10 of 12 \n11 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  Citing GitHub , Publishers urge the Court to infer from these allegations that the removal of \nCMI was intentional, or that Anthropic intentionally designed Claude’s training process to remove \nCMI.  See Opp. at 21 , 24.  Github  does not support this argument because the plaintiff’s \nallegations  in that case were much more specific.  There, the court concluded it could reasonably \ninfer intentional removal of CMI based on the allegations that (1) the defendants knew the source \ncode they used to train their AI programs contained  CMI, (2)  the defendants knew that CMI was \nimportant for protecting copyright interests, and (3) Github had regularly processed takedown \nnotices “such that it was aware its platform was used to distribute code with removed or altered \nCMI in a manner which induced infringement.”  Github , 672 F. Supp. 3d at 858.  Here, \nPublishers ’ allegations are conclusory .  Unlike Github , Publishers allege no specific  facts that \nreflect Anthropic’s intentional removal of CMI  or that it was on notice that CMI had been \nremove d.  \nThe Court notes that Publishers have allege d that some outputs do include attribution for \nlyrics .  See, e.g ., Compl. ¶ 76 (alleging that Claude produced chords and lyrics to “Daddy Sang \nBass” in response to query of “Give me the chords to Daddy Sang Bass by Johnny Cash”).  These \nallegations arguably undermine Publishers’ theory that Anthropic intentional ly remov es CMI  by \ndesign, see Opp. at 24, because they suggest that CMI was not removed across the board – \nintentionally or otherwise – during Claude’s training process.  In Tremblay v. OpenAI, Inc. , the \ncourt found that similarly contradictory allegations undermined the pla intiffs ’ Section 1202(b) \nclaim.  716 F. Supp. 3d 772, 779 (N.D. Cal. 2024) (noting that plaintiffs could not support their \nassertion that defendants removed CMI from copyrighted books used in AI training “by design” \nbecause their allegations included excerpts of outputs , which  referenc ed authors’ names).  At \nminimum, the contradictory nature of Publishers’ allegations  undermines their argument that CMI \nwas intentionally removed .   \nTurning to Section 1202(b)(3), Publishers contend that their allegations regarding Claude’s \ntraining process support a reasonable inference that Anthropic “knew its conduct would induce, \nenable, facilitate, or conceal further infringement.”  Opp. at 24.   This argument seems to rely on \nthe same allegations regarding Anthropic’s training process, and the same underlying theory that Case 5:24-cv-03811-EKL     Document 322     Filed 03/26/25     Page 11 of 12 \n12 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  Claude’s training process imbued Anthropic with knowledge that the removal of CMI would \ninduce third party infringement.  Once again, Publishers’ allegations are too conclusory to \nestablish such knowledge, and Publishers fail to state a plausible claim under Section 1202(b) .  \nAccordingly , the Court grants  the motion to dismiss Count IV with leave to amend . \nIV. CONCLUSION  \nFor the foregoing reasons, Anthropic’s motion to dismiss Counts II, III, and IV is \nGRANTED  with leave to amend .  Publishers may file an amended complaint  within 30 days of \nthis order .  Publishers shall not add any new claims without leave of court.  \nIT IS SO ORDERED.  \nDated:   \n \n  \nEumi K.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: The court case involves Stephen Thaler, who sought copyright registration for a piece of visual art autonomously generated by his AI system, the \"Creativity Machine.\" The U.S. Copyright Office denied the application, and Thaler filed a lawsuit challenging this decision. The court ruled in favor of the defendants, asserting that human authorship is required for copyright protection, and thus works created without human involvement, like those generated solely by AI, are not eligible for copyright.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether a work generated entirely by an artificial intelligence system, without any human involvement, is eligible for copyright protection.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court held that copyright protection under U.S. law requires human authorship, and therefore, works created autonomously by AI systems without human creativity or intervention are not eligible for such protection.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine you paint a picture and want to own the rights to it so no one else can copy it without your permission. That's what copyright is for. But in this case, a computer made the art by itself, without any person helping. The rules say only humans can own copyright. So, because the picture was made entirely by the computer, not by a person, it can't have copyright protection.",

Howell  \n \nMEMORANDUM OPINION   \nPlaintiff Ste phen Thaler owns a computer system he calls the “Creativity Machine,” \nwhich he claims generated a piece of visual art of its own accord.  He sought to register the work \nfor a copyright , listing the computer system as the author and explaining that the copyright \nshould transfer to him as the owner of the machine .  The Copyright Office denied the application \non the grounds that the work lacked human authorship, a prerequisite for a valid copyright to \nissue , in the view of the Register of Copyrights .  Plaintiff challenge d that denial, culminating in \nthis lawsuit against the United States Copyright Office and Shira Perlmutter, in her official \ncapacity as the Register of Copyrights and the Di rector of the United States Copyright Office  \n(“defendants”) .  Both parties have now moved for summary judgment, which motions present \nthe sole issue of whether a work generated entirely by an artificial system absent human \ninvolvement should be eligible fo r copyright.  See Pl.’s Mot. Summ. J . (Pl. ’s Mot. ”), ECF No. \n16; Defs.’ Cross -Mot. Summ. J. ( “Defs.’ Mot. ”), ECF No. 17.  For the reason s explained below, \ndefendants are correct that human authorship is an essential part of a valid copyright claim, and Case 1:22-cv-01564-BAH   Document 24   Filed 08/18/23   Page 1 of 152 \n therefore plaintiff’s pending motion for summary judgment is denied and defendants ’ pending \ncross -motion for su mmary judgment is granted.  \nI. BACKGROUND  \nPlaintiff develops and owns computer programs  he describes as having  “artificial \nintelligence” (“AI”)  capable of generating original pieces of visual art , akin to the output of a \nhuman artist.  See Pl.’s Mem. Supp. Mot. Summ. J. (“ Pl.’s Mem.”)  at 13 , ECF No. 1 6.  One such \nAI system —the so -called “Creativity Machine” —produced the work at issue here, titled “A \nRecent Entrance to Paradise:”  \n \nAdmin. Record (“A R”), Ex. H,  Copyright Review Board Refusal Letter Dated February 14, 2022 \n“(Final Refusal  Letter”) at 1 , ECF No. 13 -8.   \nCase 1:22-cv-01564-BAH   Document 24   Filed 08/18/23   Page 2 of 153 \n After its creation, plaintiff attempted to register this work with the Copyright Office.  In \nhis application, he identified the author  as the Creativity Machine, and explained the work had \nbeen “autonomously created by a computer algorithm running on a machine,” but that plaintiff \nsought to claim the copyright of the “computer -generated work” himself “as a work -for-hire to \nthe owner of th e Creativity Machine.”  Id., Ex. B, Copyright Application (“Application”) at 1, \nECF No. 13 -2; see also id. at 2 (listing “Author” as “Creativity Machine,” the work as “[c]reated \nautonomously by machine,” and the “Copyright Claimant” as “Steven [sic] Thaler” with  the \ntransfer statement, “Ownership of the machine”) .  The Copyright Office  denied the application \non the basis that the work “lack[ed] the human authorship necessary to support a copyright \nclaim ,” noting that copyright law only extends to works created by human beings.   Id., Ex. D, \nCopyright Office Refusal Letter  Dated August 12, 2019  (“First Refusal Letter”) at 1, ECF No. \n13-4. \nPlaintiff requested reconsideration of his application, confirming that the work “was \nautonomously generated by an AI” and “lack[ed] traditional human authorship,” but contesting \nthe Copyright Office’s human authorship requirement and urging that AI should be \n“acknowledge[d]  . . . as an author where it otherwise meets authorship criteria, with any \ncopyright ownership vesti ng in the AI’s owner.”  Id., Ex. E, First Request for Reconsideration at \n2, ECF No. 13 -5.  Again , the Copyright Office refused to register the work , reiterating its \noriginal rationale that “[b]ecause copyright law is limited to ‘original intellectual conce ptions of \nthe author,’ the Office will refuse to register a claim if it determines that a human being did not \ncreate the work.”  Id., Ex. F, Copyright Office Refusal Letter Dated March 30, 2020 (“Second \nRefusal Letter”) at 1, ECF No. 13 -6 (quoting Burrow -Giles Lithographic Co. v. Sarony , 111 U.S. \n53, 58 (1884)  and citing 17 U.S.C. §  102(a); U.S. Copyright Office , Compendium of U.S. Case 1:22-cv-01564-BAH   Document 24   Filed 08/18/23   Page 3 of 154 \n Copyright Office Practices § 306 (3d ed. 2017)).   Plaintiff made a second request for \nreconsideration along the same lines as h is first, see id. , Ex. G, Second Request for \nReconsideration at 2, ECF No. 13 -7, and the Copyright Office Review Board affirmed the denial \nof registration, agreeing that copyright protection does not extend to the creations of non -human \nentities, Final Ref usal Letter at 4, 7.  \nPlaintiff timely challenged that decision in this Court , claiming that defendants’ denial of \ncopyright registration to the work titled “A Recent Entrance to Paradise,” was “arbitrary , \ncapricious, an abuse of discretion  and not in acc ordance with the law, unsupported by s ubstantial \nevidence , and in excess of Defendants’ statutory authority ,” in viola tion of the Administrative \nProcedure Act (“APA”), 5 U.S.C. § 706(2) .  See Compl.  ¶¶ 62–66, ECF No. 1.  The parties agree \nupon the key facts narrated above to focus , in the pending cross -motions for summary judgment , \non the sole legal issue of whether a work autonomously generated by an AI system is \ncopyrightable. See Pl.’s Mem. at 13; Defs.’ Mem. Supp. Cross -Mot. Summ. J. & Opp’n Pl.’s \nMot. Summ. J. (“Def s.’ Opp’n”)  at 7, ECF No. 17.   Those  motions are now ripe for re solution .  \nSee Defs.’ Reply Supp. Cross -Mot. Summ. J. (“Def s.’ Reply”) , ECF No. 21.  \nII. LEGAL STANDARD  \nA. Administrative Procedure Act  \nThe APA provides for judicial review of any “final agency action for which there is no \nother adequate remedy in a court,” 5 U.S.C. § 704, and “instructs a reviewing court to set aside \nagency action foun d to be ‘arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in \naccordance with law,’” Cigar Ass’n of Am. v. FDA , 964 F.3d 56, 61 (D.C. Cir. 2020) (quoting 5 \nU.S.C. § 706(2)(A)).  This standard “‘requires agencies to engage in reasoned decision making,’ \nand . . . to reasonably explain to reviewing courts the bases for the actions they take and the \nconclusions they reach.”  Brotherhood of Locomotive Eng’rs & Trainmen v. Fed. R.R. Admin. , Case 1:22-cv-01564-BAH   Document 24   Filed 08/18/23   Page 4 of 155 \n 972 F.3d 83, 115 (D.C. Cir. 2020) (quoting Dep’t of Homeland  Sec. v. Regents of Univ. of Cal.  \n(“Regents ”), 140 S. Ct. 1891, 1905  (2020)).   Judicial review of agency action is limited to “the \ngrounds that the agency invoked when it took the action,” Regents , 140 S. Ct. at 1907 (quoting \nMichigan v. EPA , 576 U.S. 743,  758 (2015)), and the agency, too, “must defend its actions based \non the reasons it gave when it acted,” id. at 1909.  \nB. Summary Judgment  \nPursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56, “[a] party is entitled to summary \njudgment only if there is no genuine issue of material fact and judgment in the movant ’s favor is \nproper as a matter of law.”  Soundboard Ass’n v. FTC , 888 F.3d 1261, 1267 (D .C. Cir. 2018) \n(quoting Ctr. for Auto Safety v. Nat'l Highway Traffic Safety Admin. , 452 F.3d 798, 805 (D.C. \nCir. 2006)); see also  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a).   In APA cases such as this one, involving cross -\nmotions for summary judgment, “the district judge sits  as an appellate tribunal.  The ‘entire case’ \non review is a question of law.”  Am. Bioscience, Inc. v. Thompson , 269 F.3d 1077, 1083 –84 \n(D.C. Cir. 2001) (footnote omitted) (collecting cases).   Thus, a court need not and ought not \nengage in fact finding, s ince “[g]enerally speaking, district courts reviewing agency action under \nthe APA ’s arbitrary and capricious standard do not resolve factual issues, but operate instead as \nappellate courts resolving legal questions.”  James Madison Ltd. by Hecht v. Ludwig , 82 F.3d \n1085, 1096 (D.C. Cir. 1996); see also Lacson v. U.S. Dep ’t of Homeland Sec. , 726 F.3d 170, 171 \n(D.C. Cir. 2013) (noting, in an APA case, that “determining the facts is generally the agency ’s \nresponsibility, not [the court ’s]”).  Judicial review, w hen available, is typically limited to the \nadministrative record, since “[i]t is black -letter administrative law that in an [APA] case, a \nreviewing court should have before it neither more nor less information than did the agency \nwhen it made its decision. ”  CTS Corp. v. EPA , 759 F.3d 52, 64 (D.C. Cir. 2014) (internal \nquotation marks and citation omitted).  Case 1:22-cv-01564-BAH   Document 24   Filed 08/18/23   Page 5 of 156 \n III. DISCUSSION  \nUnder the Copyright Act of 1976, copyright protection attaches “immediately” upon the \ncreation of “original works of authorship fixed in any t angible medium of expression,” provided \nthose works meet certain requirements.  Fourth Estate v. Public Benefit Corporation v. Wall -\nStreet.com, LLC , 139 S. Ct. 881, 887 (2019); 17 U.S.C. §  102(a).  A copyright claimant can also \nregister the work with the Register of Copyrights.  Upon concluding that the work is indeed \ncopyrightable, the Register will issue a certificate of registration,  which , among other \nadvantages,  allows the claimant to pursue infringement claims in court .  17 U.S.C. §§ 410(a), \n411(a) ; Unicolors v. H&M Hennes & Mauritz, L.P. , 142 S. Ct. 941, 944 –45 (2022) .  A valid \ncopyright exists upon a qualifying work’s creation and “apart” from registration , however ; a \ncertificate of registration merely confirms that the copyright has existed all along .  See Fourth \nEstate , 139 S. Ct. at 887.  Conversely, if the Register denies an application for registration for \nlack of copyrightable subject matter —and did not err in doing so —then the work at issue was \nnever subject to copyright protection at all.  \nIn considering plaintiff’s copyright registration application as to “A Recent Entrance to \nParadise,” the Register concluded that “this particular work will not support a claim to \ncopyright” because the work lacked human authorship  and thus no copyright exi sted in the first \ninstance.  First Refusal Letter at 1; see also Final Refusal Letter at 3 (providing the same \nrationale in the final reconsideration decision).  By design in plaintiff’s framing of the \nregistration application, then, the single legal quest ion presented here is whether a work \ngenerated autonomously by a computer falls under the protection of copyright law upon its \ncreation.   Case 1:22-cv-01564-BAH   Document 24   Filed 08/18/23   Page 6 of 157 \n Plaintiff attempts to complicate the issues presented by devoting a substantial portion of \nhis briefing to the viabil ity of various legal theories under which a copyright in the computer’s \nwork would transfer to him , as the computer’s owner ; for example, by operation of common law \nproperty principles or the work -for-hire doctrine.  See Pl.’s Mem. at 31 –37; Pl.’s Reply Su pp. \nMot. Summ. J. & Opp’n Def.’s Cross -Mot. Summ. J. (“Pl.’s Opp’n”) at 11 –15, ECF No. 18.  \nThese arguments concern  to whom a valid copyright should have been registered, and in so doing \nput the cart before the horse.1  By denying registration, the Regist er concluded that no valid \ncopyright had ever existed in a work generated absent human involvement, leaving nothing at all \nto register and thus no question as to whom that registration belonged.   \nThe only question proper ly presented , then, is whether the Register acted arbitrarily or \ncapriciously  or otherwise in violation of the APA  in reaching that conclusion.  The Register did \nnot err in denying the copyright registration application presented by plaintiff.  United States \ncopyright law protects only works of human creation.   \nPlaintiff correctly observes that throughout its long history, copyright law has proven \nmalleable enough to cover works created with or involving technologies developed long after \ntraditional media of writings memorialized on paper .  See, e.g. , Goldstein v.  California , 412 U.S. \n546, 561 (1973) (explaining that the constitutional scope of Congress’s power to “protect the \n‘Writings’ of ‘Authors’” is “broad,” such that “writings” is not “limited to script or printed \nmaterial,” but  rather encompasses “any ph ysical rendering  of the fruits of creative intellectual or \naesthetic labor”);  Burrow -Giles Lithographic Co. v. Sarony , 111 U.S. 53, 58 (1884 ) (upholding \n \n1  In pursuing these arguments , plaintiff  elaborates on his development, use, ownership , and prompting  of the  \nAI generating software  in the so-called “Creativity  Machine ,” implying a level of human involvement in this case \nentirely absent in the administrative record.  As detailed, supra , in Part I , plaintiff consistently represented to the \nRegister that the AI system generated the work “autonomously” and that he played n o role in its creation, see \nApplication at 2, and judicial review of the Register’s final decision must be based on those same facts.  Case 1:22-cv-01564-BAH   Document 24   Filed 08/18/23   Page 7 of 158 \n the constitutionality of an amendment to the Copyright Act to cover photographs ).  In fact, that \nmalleability is ex plicitly baked into the modern incarnation of the Copyright Act, which provides \nthat copyright attaches to “original works of authorship fixed in any tangible medium of \nexpression, now known or later developed .”  17 U.S.C. § 102(a)  (emphasis added) .  Copyr ight is \ndesigned to adapt with the times.  Underlying that adaptability, however, has been a consistent \nunderstanding that human creativity is the sine qua non  at the core of copyrightability, even as \nthat human creativity is channeled through new tools or  into new media.  In Sarony , for example, \nthe Supreme Court reasoned that photographs amounted to  copyrightable creations of “authors,” \ndespite issuing from a mechanical device that merely reproduced an image of what is in front o f \nthe device , because the photographic result  nonetheless “represent[ed]” the “ original intellectual \nconceptions of the aut hor.”  Sarony , 111 U.S. at 59.  A camera may generate only a “ mechanical \nreproduction” of a scene, but does so only after the photographer develops a “mental conception ” \nof the photograph,  which is given its final form by that photographer’s decisions like  “posing the \n[subject] in front of the camera, selecting and arranging the costume, draperies, and other various \naccessories in said photograph, arranging the subject so as to present graceful outlines, arranging \nand disposing the light and shade, suggesti ng and evoking the desired expression, and from such \ndisposition, arrangement, or representation” crafting the overall image.   Id. at 59–60.  Human \ninvolvement in, and ultimate creative control over, the work at issue was key to the conclusion \nthat the new type of work fell within the bounds of copyright.  \nCopyright has never stretched so far, however, as to protect works generated by new \nforms of technology operating absent any guiding human hand, as plaintiff urges here.  Human \nauthorship is a bedrock requ irement of copyright.  Case 1:22-cv-01564-BAH   Document 24   Filed 08/18/23   Page 8 of 159 \n That principle follows  from  the plain text of the Copyright Act.  The current incarnation \nof the copyright law, the Copyright Act of 1976, provides copyright protection to “ original works \nof authorship fixed in any tangible medium of expression, now known or later developed, from \nwhich they can be perceived, reproduced, or otherwise communicated, either directly or with the \naid of a machine or device.”  17 U.S.C. § 102(a).  The “fixing” of the work in the tangible \nmedium must be done “ by or under the authority of the author.”  Id. § 101.   In order to be \neligible for copyright,  then,  a work must have an “author.”   \nTo be sure, as plaintiff points out, the critical word “author” is not defined in the \nCopyright Act.  See Pl.’s Mem. at 24.   “Author ,” in its relevant sense,  means “one that is the \nsource of some form of intellectual or creative work ,” “[t]he creator of an  artistic work; a painter, \nphotographer, filmmaker, etc.”  Author , MERRIAM -WEBSTER  UNABRIDGED DICTIONARY , \nhttps://unabridged.merriam -webster.com/unabridged/author  (last visited Aug. 1 8, 2023); Author , \nOXFORD ENGLISH DICTIONARY , https://www.oed.com/dictiona ry/author_n  (last visited Aug. 10, \n2023).  By its plain text, the 1976 Act thus requires a copyrightable work to have an originator \nwith the capacity for i ntellectual, creative, or artistic labor .  Must that originator be a human \nbeing  to claim copyright protection ?  The answer is yes.2 \nThe 1976 Act’s  “authorship” requirement as presumptively being human  rests on \ncenturies of settled understanding.  The Constitution enables  the enactment of  copyright and \npatent law by granting Congress the authority to “promote the progress of science and useful \narts, by securing for limited times to authors  and inventors the exclusive right to their  respective \n \n2  The issue of whether non-human sentient beings may be covered by “person” in the C opyright Act is only \n“fun conjecture for academics ,” Justin Hughes, Restating Copyright Law’s Originality Requirement , 44 COLUMBIA \nJ. L. & ARTS 383, 408 –09 (2021), though  useful in illuminating the purposes and limits of copyright protection as  AI \nis increasingly employed .  Nonetheless , delving into this debate is a n unnecessary detour  since “[t]he day sentient \nrefugees from some intergalactic war arrive on Earth and are granted asylum in Iceland, copyright law will be the \nleast of our problems .” Id. at 408.  Case 1:22-cv-01564-BAH   Document 24   Filed 08/18/23   Page 9 of 1510 \n writings and discoveries.”  U.S. Const. art. 1,  cl. 8.  As James Madison explained, “[t]he utility \nof this power will scarcely be questioned,” for “[t]he public good fully coincides in both cases \n[of copyright and patent] with the claims of individuals.”  THE FEDERALIST NO. 43 (James \nMadison) .  At the founding, both copyright and patent were conceived of as forms of property \nthat the government was established to protect, and it was understood that recognizing exclusive \nrights in that property would further the public good by incentivizing individuals t o create and \ninvent.  The act of human creation —and how to best encourage human individuals to engage in \nthat creation, and thereby promote science and the useful arts —was thus central to American \ncopyright from its very inception.  Non-human actors need n o incentivization with the promise \nof exclusive rights under United States law , and copyright was therefore not designed to reach \nthem .   \nThe understanding that “authorship” is synonymous with human creation has persisted \neven as the copyright law has othe rwise evolved.  The immediate precursor to the modern \ncopyright law —the Copyright Act of 1909 —explicitly provided that only a “person” could \n“secure copyright for his work” under the Act.  Act of Mar. 4, 1909, ch. 320, §§ 9, 10, 35  Stat. \n1075, 1077.  Copyr ight under the 1909 Act  was thus unambiguously limited to the works of \nhuman creators.  There is absolutely no indication that  Congress intended to effect any change to \nthis longstanding requirement with  the modern incarnation of the copyright law.  To the contrary, \nthe relevant congressional report indicates that in enacting the 1976 Act, Congress intended to \nincorporate the “original work of authorship” standard “without cha nge” from the previous 1909 \nAct.  See H.R. REP. NO. 94-1476, at 51 (1976).   \nThe human authorship requirement  has also been consistently recognized by  the Supreme \nCourt when called upon to interpret the copyright law .  As already noted , in Sarony , the Court’s Case 1:22-cv-01564-BAH   Document 24   Filed 08/18/23   Page 10 of 1511 \n recognition of the copyrightability of a pho tograph rested on the fact that the human creator, not \nthe camera, conceived of and designed the image and then used the camera to capture the image.  \nSee Sarony , 111 U.S. at 60.   The photograph was “the product of [the photographer’s] \nintellectual inventi on,” and given “the nature of authorship,” was deemed “an original work of \nart . . . of which [the photographer] is the author.”  Id. at 60 –61.  Similarly, in Mazer v. Stein , the \nCourt delineated a prerequisite for copyrightability to be that a work “must be original, that is, \nthe author’s tangible expression of his ideas .”  347 U.S. 201, 214 (1954).  Goldstein v. \nCalifornia , too, defines “author” as “an ‘originator,’ ‘he to whom anything owes its origin,’” 412 \nU.S. at 561 (quoting Sarony , 111 U.S. at 58) .  In all these cases, authorship centers on acts of \nhuman creativity.   \nAccordingly, courts have uniformly declined to recognize copyright in works created \nabsent any human involvement , even when , for example,  the claimed author was divine .  The \nNinth Circ uit, when confronted with a book “claimed to embody the words of celestial beings \nrather than human beings,” concluded that “some element of human creativity must have \noccurred in order for the Book to be copyrightable,” for “it is not creations of divine beings that \nthe copyright laws were intended to protect.”  Urantia Found . v. Kristen Maaherra , 114 F.3d \n955, 95 8–59 (9th Cir. 1997 ) (finding that because the  “members of the Contact Co mmission \nchose and formulated the specific questions asked” of the celes tial beings, and then “select[ed] \nand arrange[d]” the resultant “revelations,” the Urantia Book was “at least partially the product \nof human creativity” and thus protected by copyright ); see also  Penguin Books U.S.A., Inc. v. \nNew Christian Church of Full E ndeavor , 96-cv-4126 (RWS), 2000 WL 1028634, at *2 , 10–11  \n(S.D.N.Y. July 25, 2000) ( finding a valid copyright where a woman had “filled nearly thirty \nstenographic notebooks with words she believed were dictated to her” by a “‘Voice’ which  Case 1:22-cv-01564-BAH   Document 24   Filed 08/18/23   Page 11 of 1512 \n would speak to her  whenever she was prepared to listen,” and who had worked with two human \nco-collaborators to revise and edit those notes into a book , a process which involved enough \ncreativity to support human authorship ); Oliver v. St. Germain Found. , 41 F. Supp. 296, 297 , 299  \n(S.D. Cal. 1941) (finding no copyright infringement where plaintiff claimed to have transcribed \n“letters” dictated to him by a spirit named Phylos the Thibetan, and defendant copied the same \n“spiritual world messages for recordation and use b y the living” but was not charged with \ninfringing plaintiff’s “style or arrangement” of those messages ).  Similarly, i n Kelley v. Chicago \nPark District , the Seventh Circuit refused to “recognize[] copyright” in a cultivated garden, as \ndoing so would “press [] too hard on the[] basic principle[]” that “[a]uthors of copyrightable \nworks must be human.”  635 F.3d 290, 304 –06 (7th Cir. 2011).  The garden “ow[ed] [its] form to \nthe forces of nature,” even if a human had originated the plan for the “initial arrangem ent of the \nplants,” and as such lay outside the bounds of copyright.  Id. at 304.   Finally, in Naruto v. Slater , \nthe Ninth Circuit held that a crested macaque  could not sue under the Co pyright Act for the \nalleged infringeme nt of photographs this monkey had taken of himself, for “all animals,  since \nthey are not human” lacked statutory standing under the  Act.  888 F.3d 418, 420 (9th Cir. 2018).  \nWhile resolving the case on standing  grounds , rather than the copyrightability of the monkey’s \nwork, the Naruto  Court  nonetheless  had to consider whom the Copyright Act was designed to \nprotect and , as with those courts confronted with the nature of authorship, concluded that only \nhumans  had standing, explaining that the terms used to describe who has rights under the Act, \nlike “‘children ,’ ‘grandchildren,’ ‘legitimate,’ ‘widow,’ and ‘widower[,]’ all imply humanity and \nnecessarily exclude animals.”  Id. at 426.  Plaintiff can point to no case in which a court has \nrecognized copyright in a work originating with a non-human.  Case 1:22-cv-01564-BAH   Document 24   Filed 08/18/23   Page 12 of 1513 \n Undoubtedly, we are approaching new frontiers in copyright as artists put AI in the ir \ntoolbox to be used  in the generation of new visual  and ot her artistic  works.  The increased \nattenuation of  human creativity from the actual generation of the final work will prompt  \nchallenging questions  regarding  how much human input is necessary to qualify  the user of an AI \nsystem  as an  “author” of a generated work , the scope of the protection obtained  over the resultant  \nimage , how to assess the originality of AI -generated works where the systems may have been \ntrained on  unknown  pre-existing works,  how copyright might best be used to incentivize creative \nworks i nvolving AI , and more .  See, e.g. , Letter from Senators Thom Tillis and Chris Coons to \nKathi Vidal, Under Secretary of Commerce for Intellectual Property and Director of the U.S. \nPatent and Trademark Office, and Shira Perlmutter, Register of Copyrights and Director of the \nU.S. Copyright Office (Oct. 27, 2022), https://www.copyright.gov/laws/ hearings/Letter -to-\nUSPTO -USCO -on-National -Commission -on-AI-1.pdf  (requesting that the United States Patent \nand Trademark Office and the United States Copyright Office “jointly establish a national \ncommission on AI” to assess, among other topics, how intell ectual property law may best \n“incentivize future AI related innovations and creations” ). \nThis case, however, is not nearly so complex .  While plaintiff attempts to transform the \nissue presented here, by asserting new facts that he “provided instructions an d directed his AI to \ncreate the Work,” that “the AI is entirely controlled by [him],”  and that “the AI only operates at \n[his] direction,” Pl.’s Mem. at 36–37—implying that he played a controlling role in generating \nthe work —these statements direct ly contradict  the administrative record.  Judicial review of a \nfinal agency action under the APA is limited to the administrative record, because “[i]t is black -\nletter administrative  law that in an [APA] case, a reviewing court should have before it neither \nmore nor less in formation than did the agency when it made its decision.”  CTS Corp. , 759 F.3d Case 1:22-cv-01564-BAH   Document 24   Filed 08/18/23   Page 13 of 1514 \n at 64 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  Here, plaintiff informed the Register that \nthe work was “[c]reated autonomously by machine,” and  that his  claim to the copyright was only \nbased on the fact of his “[o]wnership of the machine.”  Application at 2.  The Register therefore \nmade her decision based on the  fact the  application presented  that plaintiff played no role in \nusing the AI to gener ate the work, which plaintiff never attempted to correct.  See First Request \nfor Reconsideration at 2 (“It is correct that the present submission lacks traditional human \nauthorship —it was autonomously generated by an AI .”); Second Request for Reconsiderati on at \n2 (same ).  Plaintiff ’s effort to update and modify the facts for judicial review  on an APA claim is \ntoo late .  On the record  designed by plaintiff from the outset of his application for copyright \nregistration , this case presents only the question of whether a work generated autonomously by a \ncomputer system  is eligible for copyright .  In the absence of any human involvement in the \ncreation of the work, the clear and straightforward answer is  the one given by the Register:  No. \nGiven that the work at issue did not give rise to a valid copyright upon its creation, \nplaintiff’s myriad theories for how ownership of such a copyright co uld have passed to him  need \nnot be further addressed .  Common law doctrines  of property transfer cannot be  implicated \nwhere no  property right exists to transfer in the first instance.  The work -for-hire provisions of \nthe Copyright Act, too, presuppose that  an interest  exists  to be claimed.  See 17 U.S.C §  201(b) \n(“In the case of a work made for hire, the employer  . . . owns all of the rights comprised in the \ncopyright.”).3  Here, the image autonomously generated by plaintiff’s computer system was \n \n3  In any event , plaintiff’s attempts to cast the work as a work -for-hire must fail as both definitions of a “work \nmade for hire” available under the Copyright Act require that the individual who prepares the work is a human \nbeing.  The first definition provides that “a ‘work made for hire’ is  . . . a work prepared by an employee  within the \nscope of his or her  employment ,” while the second qualifies certain eligible works “ if the parties expressly agree in \na written instrument signed by them  that the work shall be consid ered a work made for hire.” 17 U.S.C. § 101 \n(emphasis added).  The use of personal pronouns in the first definition clearly contemplates only human beings as \neligible “employees ,” while the second necessitates a meeting of the minds and exchange of signatu res in a valid \ncontract not possible with a non -human entity.   Case 1:22-cv-01564-BAH   Document 24   Filed 08/18/23   Page 14 of 1515 \n never eligible f or copyright, so none of the doctrines  invoked by plaintiff  conjure up a copyright \nover which ownership  may be claimed . \nIV. CONCLUSION  \nFor the foregoing reasons , defendants are correct that the Copyright Office acted properly \nin denying copyright registration for a work created absent any human involvement .  Plaintiff’s \nmotion for summary judgment is therefore denied and defendants ’ cross -motion for summary \njudgment is granted.  \nAn Order consistent with this Memorandum Opinion will be entered contemporaneously.  \nDate:  August  18, 2023  \n___________________________  \nBERYL A.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: This court case involves Samsara Inc., a company providing AI-powered dashboard cameras, suing Motive Technologies for allegedly stealing proprietary technology and infringing patents related to driver safety technology. The main procedural issue in this opinion is whether to transfer the case from Delaware to the Northern District of California. The court grants the transfer due to various factors, including both parties being based in California, the relevance of California law, and the other related proceedings occurring there.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the case should be transferred to a different venue for the convenience of the parties and in the interest of justice, under 28 U.S.C. § 1404(a).\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court granted the motion to transfer the case to the Northern District of California, citing factors such as the location of the parties and witnesses, the origin of the claims, the connection to California law, and considerations of judicial economy.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine two tech companies who make smart cameras that help trucks drive safely are in a big argument. One company says the other company stole its ideas. They went to a court in Delaware, but both companies actually have their main offices in California, where most of this argument took place and where many witnesses are.

Danon, WILLIAMS & CONNOLLY LLP, \nWashington, DC – attorneys for Defendants                  August 14, 2024 Wilmington, Delaware  Case 3:24-cv-06049-JD     Document 60     Filed 08/14/24     Page 1 of 15NOREIKA, U.S. DISTRICT JUDGE:  \nBefore the Court is the motion (D.I. 25) of Defendan t Motive Technologies, Inc. \n(“Defendant” or “Motive ”) to transfer this case to the Northern District of California pursuant to \n28 U.S.C. § 1404(a).  For the reasons set forth below, the Court GRANTS  Defendant’ s motion.1 \nI. BACKGROUND \nA. The Parties  \nPlaintiff Samsara Inc. (“Plaintiff” or “Samsara ”) is a Delaware corporation with its  \nprincipal place of business in San Francisco, California.  (D.I. 23 ¶ 11).  Samsara is a technology \ncompany that offers hardware dashboard cameras for motor vehicles along with software \napplications that use artificial intelligence to critique behind -the- wheel driver behavior and \nimprove driver safety.  ( Id. ¶¶ 7, 37). \nDefendant Motive is also a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business in San \nFrancisco, California.  ( Id. ¶ 12).  Like Samsara, Motive competes in the market for driver safety \nand fleet management technology.  ( Id. ¶¶ 5, 8).   According to the Amended Complaint , Motive \nengaged in a scheme to  steal Samsara’s proprietary technology over the course of nearly five years , \nincluding by copying Samsara’s product designs, marketing strategies, and other patented technical elements of its business .  (Id. ¶¶ 1, 2, 9).  Motive allegedly achieved this by, among other \nthings, directing its employees to register for and digitally access Samsara’s  products using \ncustomer accounts with fictitious names or on behalf of fake entities , manipulating Samsara’s \ncustomer support team by posing as other Samsara customers , and soliciting  Samsara’s employees \nto defect to Motive .  (Id. ¶¶ 2-5).  T he Amended Complaint asserts Motive infringed three of \nSamsara’s patents  and violated other statutory and common law.  ( Id. ¶¶ 125 -233).  \n \n1  Because the Court agrees that this case should be transferred, it declines to rule on the \nparties’ other motions discussed herein , which remain pending.  ( See D.I. 29, 38, 47).   Case 3:24-cv-06049-JD     Document 60     Filed 08/14/24     Page 2 of 152 B. Procedural History  \nOn January 24, 2024, Samsara initiated this action by fil ing a complaint against Motive \nasserting  claims for  patent infringement, false advertising under the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. \n§ 1125(a), fraud under California statutory and common law, Cal. Civ. Code §§ 1709 et seq ., \nviolation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, 18 U.S.C. § 1030, and violation of California’s \nUnfair Competition Law  (“UCL”) , Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code §§ 17200 et seq .  (D.I. 1 (“ the Original \nComplaint”) ).  Shortly after, on February 8, Samsara filed a companion complaint with the U.S \nInternational Trade Commission (“ITC”)  pertaining to the alleged infringement of the same patent s \nat issue here.   (D.I. 27, Ex. C ).  The ITC instituted an investigation on March 12 (“ the ITC  \nInvestigation ”).  (D.I. 34, Ex 1). \nOn February 15, 2024, Motive filed a complaint in federal court in the Northern District of \nCalifornia , initiating an action captioned  Motive Technologies, Inc. v. Sam sara Inc., No. 24-902 \n(JD) (N.D. Cal .) (“the California Action”).   (D.I. 27, Ex. D).  In the California Action, Motive \nasserts near-mirror claims  against Samsara for patent infringement, false advertising, fraud , \nmisappropriation of trade secrets, defamation, and intentional interference with business relations .  \n(Id.). \nOn February 28, 2024, Motive moved to dismiss the Original C omplaint for failure to state \na claim pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure  12(b)(6 ) and simultaneously moved to transfer \nthe case to the North District of California pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1404(a).  (D.I. 15).  That same \nday, pursuant to an arbitration clause (“Arbitration Clause”) contained in Samsara’s commercial \nTerms of Service  agreement (“Terms” or “TOS”) , (D.I. 27, Ex. B  § 19.1),2 Motive initiated an \n \n2  The parties vigorously dispute whether the TOS created an enforceable contract .  If it did, \nMotive says, the parties would be beholden to the TOS’s  Arbitration Clause,  which states \nthat “ [a]ny dispute arising from or relating to these Terms or Customer’s use of the \nProducts . . . shall be finally and exclusively settled by confidential arbitration in San Case 3:24-cv-06049-JD     Document 60     Filed 08/14/24     Page 3 of 153 arbitration before  the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services , Inc.  (“JAMS”) seeking a \ndeclar atory judgment that Samsara’s claims  must proceed in arbitration and that Motive is not \nliable for the claims asserted in this Court and before the ITC ( “the JAMS Arbitration”) .  (D.I. 34, \nEx 2 at 1). \nOn March 20, 2024, rather than answer Motive’s motion to dismiss and transfer, Samsara \nfiled an amended complaint  in this action (“the Amended Complaint”) .  (D.I. 23).  The Amended \nComplaint added two new claims t o the seven claims asserted in the O riginal Complaint:  a false \nadvertising claim under the UCL; and a  false advertising  claim under  the Delaware Deceptive \nTrade Practices Act  (“DDTPA”) , 6 Del. Code  §§ 2351 et seq .  (D.I. 23 ¶¶ 221-233).  \nOn April 3, 2024, Motive again moved to transfer the case to the Northern District of \nCalifornia and, in the alternative, dismiss the Amended Complaint .  (D.I. 25).  Motive also filed a \nmotion to stay this action due to the pendency of  the ITC Investigation pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \n§ 1659(a ).  (D.I.  29).  \nOn April 17, 2024, Samsara oppose d the motions to transfer, dismiss, and stay.  (D.I. 31, \n33).  On April 24, Motive filed reply briefs on all three motions.  ( D.I. 35, 36) .  On May 1, Samsara  \n \nFrancisco, California . . . in accordance with the Arbitration Rules and Procedures of \n[JAMS] . (‘JAMS Rules’). ”  TOS § 19.1.   And even if the Arbitration Clause is invalid,  \nargues  Motive, the parties are  bound to litigate this dispute pursuant to the TOS’s forum \nselection clause (“the Forum Selection Clause”) , which stipulates  that, “[s]ubject to the \nagreement to arbitrate set forth herein, exclusive jurisdiction and venue for actions arising from  or related to these Terms or Customer’s use of the Products will be the state and \nfederal courts located in San Francisco County, California”  and “ will be governed by the \nlaws of the State of California .”  TOS §  20.  Because the Court concludes that this action \nshould be transferred under the traditional Jumara analysis , it declines to rule on whether \nthe TOS created an enforceable  contract , whether the parties are bound by the Arbitration \nClause or Forum Selection Clause, and whether it is the JAMS arbiter or a federal court \nthat has the authority to interpret the preliminary issue of arbitrability under  the TOS.  Case 3:24-cv-06049-JD     Document 60     Filed 08/14/24     Page 4 of 154 moved to strike Motive ’s reply on the motion to stay and alternatively requested  permission to file \na sur -reply.  (D.I. 38).  That motion was fully briefed as of May 22, 2024.  (D.I. 39, 40). \nIn the meantime, the JAMS Arbitration  moved forward.  On June 4, Samsara filed a n \nunopposed motion in this Court for a contingent stay of any claims found to be arbitral , which the \nCourt so-ordered the next day.   (D.I. 43).  On June 26, Samsara filed an emergency motion for a \npreliminary injunction seeking to enjoin Motive from proceeding with the JAMS Arbitration.   On \nJuly 3, Motive submitted its answering brief.  (D.I. 53).  On July 8, Samsara replied, and the motion \nwas fully submitted .  (D.I. 56).3  \nII. LEGAL STANDARD  \n“For the convenience of parties and witnesses, in the interest of justice,” district courts \nhave the authority to transfer venue  “to any other district or division where it might have been \nbrought.”  28 U.S.C. § 1404(a) .  In determining whether an action should be transferred under \n§ 1404(a), the Court will “consider all relevant factors to determine whether on balance the litigation would more conveniently proceed and the interests of justice be better served by transfer to a different forum.”  Jumara v. State Farm Ins. Co., 55 F.3d 873, 879 (3d Cir. 1995)  (citation \nomitted).   “[A] plaintiff, as the injured party, generally [is] ‘accorded [the] privilege of bringing \nan action where he chooses.’”  Helicos Biosciences Corp. v. Illumina, Inc., 858 F. Supp. 2d 367, 371 (D. Del. 2012) (quoting Norwood v. Kirkpatrick , 349 U.S. 29, 31 (1955)).  A plaintiff’s choice \nof location in bringing the action, therefore,  “should not be lightly disturbed.”  Jumara, 55 F.3d at \n879 (citation omitted) .   \n \n3  On August 9, 2024, Samsara submitted a notice of subsequent authority, (D.I. 58) , \ninforming the Cour t that the arbitrator had delayed proceedings  in the JAMS Arbitration \npending the Court’s decision on Samsara’s motion for a preliminary injunction. Case 3:24-cv-06049-JD     Document 60     Filed 08/14/24     Page 5 of 155 In the Third Circuit,  a motion to transfer is evaluated pursuant to twelve “private and public \ninterests protected by the language of § 1404(a).”  Id .  The six private interests include: \n[(1)] plaintiff’s forum preference as manifested in the original \nchoice; [(2)] the defendant’s preference; [(3) ] whether the claim \narose elsewhere; [(4) ] the convenience of the parties as indicated by \ntheir relative physical and financial condition; [(5) ] the convenience \nof the witnesses – but only to the extent that the witnesses may \nactually be unavailable for trial in one of the fora; and [(6) ] the \nlocation of books and records (similarly limited to the extent that the \nfiles could not be produced in the alternative forum).  \n Id. (citations omitted).  The six public interests include:   \n[(7)] the enforceability of the judgment; [(8)] practical \nconsiderations that could make the trial easy, expeditious, or inexpensive; [(9)] the relative administrative difficulty in the two \nfora resulting from court congestion; [(10)] the local interest in \ndeciding local controversies at home; [(11)] the public policies of \nthe fora; and [(12)] the familiarity of the trial judge with the \napplicable state law in diversity cases.  \n Id. at 879-80 (citations omitted) .  \n“The burden is on the moving party to establish that a balancing of proper interests weigh[s] \nin favor of the transfer .”  Shutte v. Armco Steel Corp., 431 F.2d 22, 25 (3d Cir. 1970).  “[ C]ourts \n[have] broad discretion to determine, on an individualized, case -by-case basis, whether \nconvenience and fairness considerations weigh in favor of transfer.”  Jumara , 55 F.3d at 883 \n(citing Stewart Org., Inc. v. Ricoh Corp., 487 U.S. 22, 29 (1988) ).  “[U]nless the balance of \nconvenience of the parties is strongly in favor of [the] defendant, the plaintiff’s choice of forum \nshould prevail.”  Shutte , 431 F.2d at 25 (citation omitted) . \nIII. DISCUSSION  \nA. Appropriateness of the Transferee Venue  \n“The first step in the transfer analysis is to determine whether this action could have been \nbrought in the proposed transferee venue ,” here, the Northern District of California (“Northern Case 3:24-cv-06049-JD     Document 60     Filed 08/14/24     Page 6 of 156 District”).   Papst Licensing GmbH & Co. KG v. Lattice Semiconductor Corp., 126 F. Supp. 3d \n430, 437 (D. Del. 2015).  Here, there is no dispute that this case could have been brought in the \nNorthern District.  I ndeed, the California Action is pending there between the parties.4  Thus, the \nthreshold inquiry under § 1404(a) is satisfied and the only remaining  issue before the Court is \nwhether to exercise its discretion to transfer the case to the Northern District.  The Court addresses the Jumara factors in turn below. \nB. The Jumara Factors  \n1. Plaintiff’s Forum Preference  \n“It is black letter law that a plaintiff’s choice of a proper forum is a paramount consideration \nin any determination of a transfer request .”  Shutte , 431 F.2d at 25.  “Assuming jurisdiction and \nproper venue, weight is given to plaintiff’s choice because it is plaintiff’s choice and a strong showing under the statutory criteria in favor of another forum is then required as a prerequisite to transfer.”   Puff Corp. v. KandyPens, Inc., No. 20 -976 ( CFC ), 2020 WL 6318708, at *3 (D. Del. \nOct. 28, 2020)  (citation omitted) .  Samsara is a Delaware- incorporated entity that has elected to \n \n4   Samsara briefly  suggests that the  dueling federal court actions are subject to  the “first -to-\nfile rule ,” (D.I. 33 at 2), which “counsels that a later -filed action involving the same \ncontroversy should be dismissed, transferred, or stayed in favor of the  first-\nfiled action.”  Nexans Inc. v. Belden Inc. , 966 F. Supp. 2d 396, 403 (D. Del. 2013) .  \nAccording to Samsara, under that rule, this Court must retain jurisdiction because Samsara \nfiled this action before Motive filed the California Action.  As Motive correctly points out, however, (D.I. 26 at 13), this action does not involve “the same issues already before \nanother district court.”  E.E.O.C. v. Univ. of Pennsylvania, 850 F.2d 969, 971 (3d Cir. \n1988) .  Indeed, “ the primary focus of the analysis is on whether the issues in the current \nmatter ‘concern the same set of facts ’ as in the first -filed action.”  In re Mobile Telecomms . \nTechs., LLC , 243 F. Supp. 3d 478, 485 (D. Del. 2017)  (citation omitted).  This action stems \nfrom Motive’s alleged infringement of Samsara’s patents  and theft of its  proprietary \ntechnology, whereas the California Action principally involves Samsara’s  purported \ninfringement of Motive’s patent  and misappropriation of its trade secrets – two factually \ndistinct disputes.   Accordingly, the first- to-file rule does not control here.  Id. Case 3:24-cv-06049-JD     Document 60     Filed 08/14/24     Page 7 of 157 bring suit in Delaware .  That choice remains entitled to “ paramount consideration,” and , therefore, \nthis factor weighs against transfer .  Shutte , 431 F.2d at 25. \n2. Defendant’ s Forum Preference  \nMotive has a clear  interest in litigating in the Northern District , where it is headquartered , \nits employees are located,  and there is pending related litigation.  “As this Court has often held, \nthe physical proximity of the proposed transferee district to a defendant ’s principal or key place of \nbusiness (and relatedly, to witnesses and evidence potentially at issue in the case) is a clear, \nlegitimate basis for seeking transfer.”  Papst , 126 F. Supp. 3d at 439.  This factor favors transfer.   \n3. Whether the Claims Arose Elsewhere  \nPatent claims arise wherever alleged infringement has occurred.   See Treehouse Avatar \nLLC v. Valve Corp., 170 F. Supp. 3d 706, 710 (D. Del. 2016).  “[A]s to this factor, this Court typically focuses on the location of the production, design and manufacture of the accused instrumentalities. ”  Papst , 126 F. Supp. 3d at  439.  Here, the nexus of the claimed infringement \noccurred in San Francisco, California  – which Samsara does not dispute , (D.I. 33 at 19) – because \nMotive “designed, developed, and [produc ]ed the accused products in the Northern District of \nCalifornia .”  Allen M ed. Sys., Inc. v. Mizuho Orthopedic Sys., Inc., No. 21-1739 ( CFC ), 2022 WL \n1046258, at *2 (D. Del. Apr. 7, 2022).\n5   \nIn addition, Samsara claims that “Motive ’s leadership team” orchestrated its  alleged  \nconduct , and Motive’s employees carried it out, from “Motive offices  in San Francisco .”  (D.I. 23 \n¶¶ 2, 53); (id. ¶ 3 (Motive’s “management team,” located in San Francisco, “endorsed a policy \nwhereby senior Motive employees created fictitious companies to procure Samsara products and \n \n5  For Samsara’s part, San Francisco is listed as the location of the company on the patents at \nissue  here, and more than a dozen of the patents’ inventors are listed as being from San \nFrancisco or the surrounding area.  (D.I. 23, Ex. 1 at 1 & Ex. 2 at 1). Case 3:24-cv-06049-JD     Document 60     Filed 08/14/24     Page 8 of 158 access its platform”) ); (see also D.I. 28 ¶¶ 4-6 ( averring that , “[a]t the relevant time,” a dozen \nMotive “employees named in [the Amended] Complaint  worked in or around San Francisco, \nCalifornia ” at “Motive’s principal place of business”)). \nOn the other hand, the re are no allegations that any of the conduct at issue occurred in, \nfrom , or even near  Delaware.  Neither party is alleged to maintain an office or employ individuals \nin Delaware.  (D.I. 28 ¶ 3).  Samsara asserts in its opposition papers that the parties have other \noffices and employees elsewhere in the U.S. and abroad, (D.I. 33 at 5; D.I. 34, Exs. 6-7) , and \nsupposes that the alleged conduct “may have taken place in any of those locations ,” (D.I. 33  at 19) .  \nBut allegations about those  satellite offices and personnel are nowhere to be found in the Amended \nComplaint ( aside from a single mention of Buffalo, New York ), and do not outweigh the numerous \nallegations that the conduct at issue  here was “carried out and sanctioned by multiple senior -level \nMotive employees, including members of its executive team,”  who sat in Motives offices in San \nFrancisco .  (D.I. 23 ¶ 55); (see also, e.g., id. ¶ 3 (Motive’s alleged scheme  “has been carried out \nand sanctioned by Motive’s CEO, CPO, CTO and other senior employees ” located in California )). \nIn light of the foregoing, the Court concludes that the claims at issue here arose in  the \nNorthern District of California .  Therefore, t his factor weigh s in favor of transfer.   \n4. Convenience of the Parties \nThe Court considers three factors in d etermining the convenience of the transferee forum \nfor the parties:  (1) the parties’ physical location; (2) the parties’ logistical and operational costs of \ntraveling to litigate in Delaware, as opposed to the proposed transferee district; and (3) the relative \nability of each party to bear these costs in light of its size and financial  standing.  See MEC \nResources, LLC v. Apple, Inc., 269 F. Supp. 3d 218, 225 (D. Del.  2017). \nThe parties are both headquartered in San Francisco, California, minutes from the \ntransferee court.   (D.I. 23 ¶¶ 11 -12).  This Court, by contrast , sits nearly 3,000 miles away in Case 3:24-cv-06049-JD     Document 60     Filed 08/14/24     Page 9 of 159 Wilmington, Delaware .  Traveling to Delaware for the purposes of litigation would impose \nsubstantial additional costs in comparison to litigating in the Northern District.   This is particularly \ntrue given that the parties’ relevant employees are largely located in California, including at least \na dozen Motive personnel who are named in the Amended Complaint .  (D.I. 28 ¶ 6) .  Dragging all \nthose witnesses to court in Delaware imposes an operational burden on the parties that would be minimized by granting the transfer sought. \nSamsara counters that Motive has global operations, can afford the  financial obligation,  \nand that there will be a “likely low amount of travel involved.”  (D.I. 33 at 19-20) ; see, e.g. , \nGraphics Props. Holdings Inc. v. Asus Comput er Int’l, Inc. , 964 F. Supp. 2d 320, 328 (D. Del. \n2013) (“[A] s a practical matter, regardless of the trial venue, most of the discovery will take place \nin California or other locations mutually agreed to by the parties .”).  Accepting those arguments \nas true, they nonetheless do not outweigh the fact that both parties ’ primary offices and their \nrelevant employee witnesses are physically located in  the Northern District.  Litigating this case \nthere will impose lower financial and operational burdens on the parties.  This favors transfer.  \n5. Convenience of the Witnesses  \nThis factor carries weight “only to the extent that the witnesses may actually be unavailable \nfor trial in one of the fora.”  Jumara, 55 F.3d at 879.  “ [W]itnesses who are employed by a party \ncarry no weight, because each party is able, indeed, obligated to procure the attendance of its own employees for trial.”  VLSI Tech. LLC v. Intel Corp., No. 18-966 ( CFC ), 2018 WL 5342650, at *7 \n(D. Del. Oct. 29, 2018)  (citation and quotation marks omitted) .  Accordingly, this factor only \nconcerns third- party witnesses , and “ is only given weight when there is some reason to believe \nthat a witness actually will refuse to testify absent a subpoena .”  Smart Audio Techs., LLC v. Apple, \nInc., 910 F. Supp. 2d 718, 732 (D. Del. 2012) .  Because no party has identified any third -party \nwitness who would be unavailable for trial in either Delaware or  California, this factor is neutral.  Case 3:24-cv-06049-JD     Document 60     Filed 08/14/24     Page 10 of 1510 6. Location of Books and Records \nThis factor  is neutral .  Motive’s documents, records, and data servers are all stored in its \nprincipal offices in San Francisco, not in Delaware (D.I. 28 ¶  5).  The same appears to be true of \nSamsara.  (D.I.  33 at 20 ).  But t he Court give s weight to this factor  only “to the extent that the files \n[and other evidence] could not be produced in the alternative forum.”  Jumara , 55 F.3d at 879.   \nThis factor receives minimal weight given the state of litigation technology today, the advent of e-\ndiscovery, and the ease with which documentary evidence can be produced electronically.  See, \ne.g., Blackbird Tech LLC v. E.L.F. Beauty, Inc., No. 19-1150 ( CFC ), 2020 WL 2113528, at *4 (D. \nDel. May 4, 2020); Intell. Ventures I LLC v. Altera Corp., 842 F. Supp. 2d 744, 759 (D. Del. 2012).   \n“Because no records have been identified as only being available in either the Northern District of \nCalifornia or Delaware, this factor is neutral .”  VLSI , 2018 WL 5342650, at *7. \n7. Enforceability of the Judgment \nThis factor is also neutral because “[t] here is no suggestion that a judgment would be \nunenforceable in either the District of Delaware or the Northern District. ”  Altera , 842 F. Supp. 2d  \nat 759. \n8. Practical Considerations  \nThe Court must consider “practical considerations that could make the trial easy, \nexpeditious, or inexpensive.”  Jumara, 55 F.3d at 879.  As a practical matter, the parties are litigating  in four separate fora – here, the Northen District, the ITC, and the JAMS Arbitration.  I t \nwould serve judicial economy to reduce that number by litigating the two federal court actions in \none court, and would serve traditional economy by , at the least, “eliminat[ing] the cost associated \nwith local counsel in Delaware. ”  Papst , 126 F. Supp. 3d at 444 (“[T]his added cost [is] a practical \nconsideration that could make litigation here more expensive than in a transferee court like the Northern District of California. ”). Case 3:24-cv-06049-JD     Document 60     Filed 08/14/24     Page 11 of 1511 The Court also notes that Samsara’s decision to initiate the ITC Investigation s hortly after \nfiling the Original Complaint in this action  calls into question whether Samsara ever fully intended \nto litigate in this forum at all.  The ITC filing entitles Motive to a stay of the patent claims  under \n28 U.S.C. § 1659(a) , which “Samsara does not contest.”  (D.I. 31 at 1).  As Samsara was surely \naware, t he result is that “ any matters directly relating to the patent infringement claim will not be \naddressed until af ter the ITC investigation is complete .”  FMC Corp. v. Summit Agro USA, LLC , \nNo. 14-51 ( LPS), 2014 WL 3703629, at *3 (D. Del. July 21, 2014).6 \nOne additional practical factor that weighs in favor of transfer is the Forum Selection \nClause contained in  Samsara’s TOS .  Although the Court does not construe the TOS or rule on its \nenforceability, it is nevertheless telling that, as a practical matter, Samsara’s default forum is “ the \nstate and federal courts located in San Francisco County, California”  under “the laws of the State \nof California .”  TOS § 20.  Samsara simply cannot press that clause across the board against its \ncustomer s while simultaneously claiming that the Northern District is inconvenient here .  \nAccordingly, the Court finds that this factor weighs in favor of transfer. \n9. Relative Administrative Difficulty Due to Court Congestion \nThis factor weighs somewhat in favor of transfer.  The Court takes judicial notice of the \nmost recent Judicial Caseload Profiles , (D.I. 34, Ex. 9), as of  December 31 , 2023.  I n the District \nof Delaware, the median length of time between filing and disposition in civil cases is 8.3 months, \nthere are  666 weighted filings  per judgeship, and there are only four sitting judges.  By comparison, \nthe Northern District currently  takes 6.9 months for the average civil disposition, has  486 weighted \n \n6  Samsara’s assertion that its non -patent claims should move forward in this Court in the \nmeantime only tips the scale further in favor of transfer, for the purposes of the practicality \nprong.  (D.I. 33 at 1).  Litigating different claims in different venues  at different speeds – \nall based on  the same set of facts – promotes obvious in efficiencies that this factor was \ndesigned to curtail.  Papst , 126 F. Supp. 3d at 444 (noting this prong’s concern for  “the \ninterests of judicial economy”) . Case 3:24-cv-06049-JD     Document 60     Filed 08/14/24     Page 12 of 1512 filings per judgeship, and staffs 14 judges  (with additional vacancies waiting to be filled).  In the \nNorthern  District,  however, it takes nearly 11 months longer to get from filing to trial (48.9 month s \nas compared to 38 months in Delaware ).  Although there are similarities  between the two districts  \nin terms of caseload , the Court focuses on the difference in weighted filings  per judge  (666 to 486) .  \nThat metric, which factors in how complex and time -consuming civil actions are, suggests that the \nNorthern District is less congested because it has about 180 (27%) fewer weighted filings per \njudgeship than this District.  In the Court’s view, this factor weighs in favor of transfer. \n10. Local Interest in Deciding Local Controversies at Home \nThis factor favors transfer, but only slightly.  First, “patent issues do not give rise to a local \ncontroversy or implicate local interests.”  TriStrata Tech., Inc. v. Emulgen Labs., Inc ., 537 F.  Supp. \n2d 635, 643 (D. Del. 2008).  Second, Delaware has an in interest in having its corporate citizens \nlitigate in its own courts.  But the Northern District also has an interest in this litigation, since both \nparties have their principal place of business there, many of the alleged witnesses are California \ncitize ns, the accused products were developed there, and the claims implicate California law .  \nAltera , 842 F. Supp. 2d at 760.  Balancing those competing interest s, the Court finds this factor \nweighs slightly in favor of transfer.  \n11. Public Policies of the Fora  \nThis factor is neutral.   Both parties are Delaware corporation s and “Delaware ’s public \npolicy encourages Delaware corporations to resolve their disputes in Delaware courts.”  VLSI , \n2018 WL 5342650, at *9.   That being said, the parties are headquartered in California , the action \nimplicates largely California -based individuals, and there are key disputes under California law .  \nBecause both fora have public policy interests, the Court finds that this factor is neutral. Case 3:24-cv-06049-JD     Document 60     Filed 08/14/24     Page 13 of 1513 12. Familiarity of the Trial Judge with the Applicable State Law  \nSamsara asserts three California state law claims  under the UCL, Cal. Civ. Code, and \nCalifornia common law .  In addition, the parties  hotly contest  a threshold dispute about the \nenforceability of the TOS  and whether the parties should be forced to arbitrate, itself an inquiry to \nbe taken up under the California state law of contracts.   California law runs throughout this \nlitigation.7  Samsara argues that should not matter because “this Court is fully capable of applying \nCalifornia law.”  (D.I. 33 at 18).  True, but that is not the test, and accepting that premise would \nobviate this prong altogether, given that every federal court is “fully capable” of applying foundational state law .  Regardless, t he Northern District of California is undoubtedly “more \nfamiliar” with California law than this Court. \nSamsara also asserts one claim under Delaware law, for unfair competition under the \nDDTPA.  Notably, Samsara asserted that claim for the first time in its Amended Complaint, only after receiving Motive’s first motion to transfer.   In any event, the  DDTPA analysis mirrors that \nof the Samsara’s federal claims.  See, e.g., Mil. Certified Residential Specialist, LLC v. Fairway \nIndep. Mortg. Corp., 251 F. Supp. 3d 750, 757 (D. Del. 2017)  (“Courts reviewing DDTPA \nviolations apply the same standards as they apply to [Lanham Act] trademark infringement claims .”).  Therefore, the Court finds that there is unlikely to be any entirely  Delaware- specific \nlaw at issue in this case such that this forum has any great  advantage over the Northern District.  \nThis factor  favors transfer.   \nC. Balancing the Private and Public Factors \nAfter balancing the twelve Jumara factors, the Court concludes that this case should be \ntransferred to the Northern District.  Seven  factors weigh in favor of transfer  and only one weighs \n \n7  The federal  claims are not implicated under this Jumara prong.    Case 3:24-cv-06049-JD     Document 60     Filed 08/14/24     Page 14 of 1514 against, with  four factors neutral .  Samsara’s choice to litigate in this Court is to be given \nparamount consideration.  Motive , however, has shown that th is dispute is between companies \nheadquartered in California, about events that took place in California, featuring Californian \nemployee witnesses, under multiple counts of California law.  On top of that, the courts of Northern \nCalifornia are Samsara’s typical preferred venue per its TOS , and this action will ultimately be at \nleast partially – i f not fully – stayed in light of the parties ’ ongoing disputes in other venues .  \nEvaluating the factors together and giving each its appropriate weight, Motive has shown that the \nJumara factors weigh strongly in favor of transfer.    \nIV. CONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, Defendant’s  motion to transfer the case to the United States \nDistrict Court for the Northern District of California  pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1404(a) is \nGRANTED.  An appropriate order will follow. Case 3:24-cv-06049-JD     Document 60     Filed 08/14/24     Page 15 of 15",

    "summary": "1. **Summary**:\n   In the case of *Overjet, Inc. v. Videa Health, Inc.*, the court addressed Overjet's motion for a preliminary injunction to prevent Videa from allegedly infringing on its intellectual property and engaging in false advertising. Overjet, a dental AI company, utilizes AI to detect dental diseases by analyzing dental X-rays, and accused Videa of copying its color schemes and shapes for annotating X-rays, as well as falsely promoting its own AI capabilities. The court denied the preliminary injunction as Overjet failed to demonstrate a likelihood of success on the merits or irreparable harm.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**:\n   The key legal issue is whether Overjet's color, shape, and shades used in annotating dental X-rays are copyrightable, whether Videa engaged in false advertising under the Lanham Act, and if a preliminary injunction should be granted.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**:\n   The court denied Overjet's motion for a preliminary injunction, concluding that Overjet did not provide adequate evidence to show it was likely to succeed on its copyright and false advertising claims, or suffer irreparable harm absent an injunction.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**:\n   Imagine two tech companies, both making software for dentists to find cavities on X-rays. One company, Overjet, believes the other, Videa, is copying its special way of displaying colors and shapes on X-rays. Overjet asked a judge to stop Videa, claiming that this copying hurt its chances of winning work contracts and hurt its reputation. However, the judge decided there wasn't enough proof that Overjet would win the case or be seriously harmed, so she let Videa continue with its work while the court case goes on.",

BACKGROUND  \nA. Factual Background \nOverjet  is a dental artificial intelligence (“AI”) company  form ed in 2018 and \nheadquartered in Boston, Massachusetts.  [ECF No. 1 (“Complaint” or “ Compl. ”) ¶¶ 8 –10].  \nOverjet uses AI to scan dental radiographic X -rays and detect dental disease s.  [Id. ¶ 9].  \nSpecifically, Overjet uses an approach called segmentation , which outlines exact borders and \nshows the extent to which pathologies, or diseases , exist .  [ECF No. 10 (“Inam Declaration” or \n“Inam Decl.”) ¶¶ 6, 7].  In order to enable its segmentation capabilities, Overjet’s software \nannotate s diseases  and structures on dental X-rays.  [ Id. ¶ 8].  Th e annotation  allows clinicians to \nbetter detect diseases and devise treatment plans.  [Compl. ¶ 33]; see also  [ECF Nos. 11-4, 11-5, \n11-6].  Overjet’s software segmentation capability has been  cleared  by the United S tates Food \nand Drug Administration (“FDA”)2 and, presently, Overjet is the only dental AI company with \n \n \n2 On May 19, 2021: the FDA cleared the “Overjet Dental Assist” product, which “is a \nradiological semi-automated image processing software intended to aid dental professionals in \nthe measurements of mesial and distal bone levels associated with each tooth from bitewing and periapical radiographs.” [Compl. ¶ 15].    On May 10, 2022: the FDA cleared “Overjet Caries Assist” (“Caries Assist”) for segmentation of \ncaries on bitewing radiographs.  [Compl. ¶ 16].    On March 27, 2023: the FDA cleared a new iteration of Caries Assist, which “expanded the age \nrange and image type and improved model accuracy for caries,” approving the software for use on patients twelve years of age and older.  [Compl. ¶ 17].    On December 16, 2022: the FDA cleared\n  “Overjet Calculus Assist ,” “a radiological automated \nconcurrent- read computer assisted detection software” used to detect interproximal calculus \n Case 1:24-cv-10446-ADB     Document 50     Filed 07/19/24     Page 2 of 313 \n \n clearance for “performing dental detection and segmentation to outline exactly where \npathol\nogies exist.”  [Compl. ¶ 10].  Overjet ’s software is used by d ental practices, dental services \norganizations (“DSOs”), and insurance companies.  [ Id. ¶ 6].   \nOverjet  has developed several iterations of its software.   [Compl. ¶ 14].  Adopting the \nnaming convention “Overjet [X] Assist,” it has named its software products “Overjet Dental Assist,” “Overjet Caries Assist,” “Overjet Calculus Assist,” “Overjet Periapical Radiolucency Assist,” and “Overjet Charting Assistant .”  [Id.].  Since May 2021, Overjet has been using the \n“DENTAL ASSIST ” trademark to market and sell its software.  [ Id. ¶ 22].   \nOverjet employs “color schemes, shapes, and designs ” to help visualize detection and \nsegmentation of diseases on dental X-rays.  [Compl. ¶ 29].  In the fall of 2023, Overjet  launched \nits “Anatomical Structures Visualization Tool”  (“Visualization Tool”)  for Overjet Caries Assist , \nwhich introduced the coloring scheme and design at issue in the instant motion.  [ Id.].  The  tool \nannotates X -rays, using white to represent enamel, purple to denote the pulp of a tooth, bright \ngreen lines with circles at the end s to indicate measurements of bone levels,  and red and \ntranslucency to mark areas of decay.  [ Id. ¶ 30; Inam Decl. ¶ 24 ].  Overjet chose these colors and \nshapes in order to create a “contrast with the gray scale” of the X -rays and with the ultimate goal \nof assisting with “patient assessment, diagnosis, and treatment planning.”  [Compl. ¶¶ 33, 34].  It \n \n \ndeposits on bitewing and periapical radiographs, for patients eighteen years of age or older.  \n[Compl. ¶ 18].    On September 21, 2023: the FDA approved Overjet’s Periapical Radiolucency (“PARL”) Assist \nsoftware, “a radiological, automated, concurrent read computer- assisted detection software,” to \ndetect “periapical radiolucencies on permanent teeth captured on periapical radiographs.”  [Compl. ¶ 19].    On February 23, 2024: the FDA cleared “Overjet Charting Assist.”  [Compl. ¶ 18].   \n  Case 1:24-cv-10446-ADB     Document 50     Filed 07/19/24     Page 3 of 314 \n \n also selected  the de sign and colors to help with  brand identification; the purple, for example, \ncomplements Overjet’s purple brand color.  [ Id. ¶ 35].  Below is an example of an annotated X-\nray created by Overjet’s software using the segmentation approach.  [ Id. ¶¶ 35, 45].   \nVidea is a lso a dental AI company, [Compl. ¶ 55] ; see also  [ECF No. 22-1 ( “Hillen \nDecl.”) ¶ 1], and it is Overjet’s direct competitor , [Compl. ¶ 55; Inam Decl. ¶ 5 ; Hillen Decl.  \n¶ 24].  Founded in 2018, [Compl. ¶ 55; Hillen Decl. ¶ 2], Videa’s AI software program, VideaAI, \n“analyze[s]  radiographs and assist [s] clinicians in detecting and diagnosing oral diseases, ” \n[Hillen Decl . ¶¶ 4, 6].   \nVidea holds FDA clearance for  vari ous indications.  See [Compl. ¶ ¶ 66–69].  In \nDecember 2023, the FDA cleared “Videa Dental AI,” previously known as “Videa Dental Assist,”\n3 [Hillen Decl. ¶ ¶ 14, 26], for identifying and localizing a range of dental findings and  \nindications, including caries  or cavities  and periapical radiolucency,4 when analyzing bitewing, \n \n \n3 Videa used the term  “Dental Assist” from January to mid -March 2024.  [ECF No. 20 (“ Opp’n ”) \nat 10]. \n   \n4 In addition to dental indications, the FDA clearance also encompasses the identification and \nlocalization of historical treatments, such as a bridge, crown, or filling, and the detection of “normal anatomy.”  [ECF No. 11-7 (“ Videa 510(k) Premarket Notification ”) at 4].   \nCase 1:24-cv-10446-ADB     Document 50     Filed 07/19/24     Page 4 of 315 \n \n periapical , and panoramic X- ray s taken from patients three years of age and older.  [Videa \n510(k) Premarket Notification at 4].  If the software detects any indications, it “returns a set of \nbounding boxes representing the suspect dental finding.”  [ Id. at 7].  Unlike Overjet, VideaAI \noffers two views , or displays, of its software’s findings:  one for clinicians (the “Clinical View”)  \nand one for patients (the “Patient View”).  [Hillen Decl. ¶ 9].  The Clinical View is “primarily \nused to assist clinicians in detection and diagnosis ” and “uses boxes and lines with dots to \nquickly display these points of interest.”  [ Id.].  It is intended to be “an assistive tool.”  [ Id.].  The \nPatient View  provides a more accessible display “for added patient education and \ncomprehension,” and is designed to be a “communication tool for [] provider[s] .”  [Id.].  As \nsuch, unlike the Clinical View, it offers “a version of the results that are ‘segmented’ and \nhighlights the shape of the points of interest” by “show[ing] more than mere lines and boxes.”  \n[Id.].  See infra  examples of the Clinical and Patient View.  [ Id.; Compl. ¶ 88].  It is the Patient \nView that is at issue in the present case.  S ee infra.    \n \nAs noted above, the two companies are direct competitors in the dental AI space.  See  \nsupra.  As such, in the fall of 2023, both companies were considered for a lucrative partnership \nCase 1:24-cv-10446-ADB     Document 50     Filed 07/19/24     Page 5 of 316 \n \n with the country’s largest DSO, Heartland Dental  (“Heartland”) .  [Compl. ¶ 88].  On December \n5, 2023, Heartland announced that it had selected Videa as its dental AI partner.  [ Id. ¶ 90].5   \nB. Procedural History  \nOn February 23, 2024, Overjet initiated this action , [ECF No. 1], and filed the instant \nmotion for a preliminary injunction , [ECF No. 8].  Videa opposed the motion on March 19, \n2024, [Opp’n], and Overjet then filed a reply in support of its preliminary injunction motion on \nApril 2, 2024, [ECF No. 29 (“Reply”) ].  On April 9, 2024, Videa filed its sur- reply .  [ECF No. \n34 (“Sur -Reply”) ].  The Court heard oral argument on April 11, 2024.  [ECF No. 40].   \nII. DISCUSSION  \nA. Legal Standard  \nPreliminary injunctions function to “preserve the relative positions of the parties until a \ntrial o\nn the merits can be held.”  Univ. of Tex. v. Camenisch, 451 U.S. 390, 395 (1981).  As a \nresult, “findings of fact and conclusions of law made by a court granting a preliminary injunction are not binding at trial on the merits.”   Id. (citing Indus. Bank of Wash. v. Tobriner, 405 F.2d \n1321, 1324 (D.C. Cir. 1968)).  The granting of a preliminary injunction is “an ‘extraordinary and drastic remedy’ .  . . that ‘is never awarded as of right.’”  Voice of the Arab World, Inc. v. MDTV \nMed. News Now, Inc. , 645 F.3d 26, 32 (1st Cir. 2011) (quoting Munaf v. Geren, 553 U.S. 674, \n689–90 (2008)). \nWhen deciding whether to grant a motion for preliminary injunction, courts must \ncons\nider four factors:  \n(i) the movant’ s likelihood of success on the merits of its claims; (ii) whether and to what \nextent the movant will suffer irreparable harm if the injunction is withheld; (iii) the \n \n \n5 Independent of this contract, Overjet currently works with over 150 Heartland D ental offices.  \n[Compl. ¶ 88].   Case 1:24-cv-10446-ADB     Document 50     Filed 07/19/24     Page 6 of 317 \n \n balance of hardships as between the parties; and (iv) the effect, if any, that an injunction (or the withholding of one) may have on the public interest.  \nCorp. Techs., Inc. v. Harnett, 731 F.3d 6, 9 (1st Cir. 2013).  As the moving party, Overjet bears \nthe burden of satisfying each of these four elements.  See Nieves –Márquez v. P.R., 353 F.3d 108, \n120 (1st Cir. 2003). \nThe First Circuit has held that these four factors “are not entitled to equal weight in the \ndecisio\nnal calculus.”  Corp. Techs., 731 F.3d at 9.  Rather, the movant’s likelihood of success on \nthe merits “is the main bearing wall of the four -factor framework.”   Id. at 10.  “[P]roving \nlikelihood of success on the merits is the ‘sine qua non’ of a preliminary injunction.”  Arborjet, \nInc. v. Rainbow Treecare Sci. Advancements, Inc., 794 F.3d 168, 173 (1st Cir. 2015) (quoting \nNew Comm Wireless Servs., Inc. v. SprintCom, Inc., 287 F.3d 1, 9 (1st Cir. 2002)).  Therefore, \n“[i]f the moving party cannot demonstrate that [it] is likely to succeed in [its] quest, the \nremaining factors become matters of idle curiosity.”  Id. (quoting New Comm Wireless Servs. , \n287 F.3d at 9). \nB. Likelihood of Success on the Merits  \n1. Copyright Infringement  \nTo establish copyright infringement, a plaintiff must show: (1) ownership of a valid \ncopyright i\nn a work; and (2) a copying of constituent elements of the work that are original.  \nSoc’y of the Holy Transfiguration Monastery, Inc. v. Archbishop Gregory of Denver, Colo., 685 \nF. Supp. 2d 217, 225 (D. Mass. 2010), aff ’d sub nom. Soc’y of Holy Transfiguration Monastery, \nInc. v. Gregory, 689 F.3d 29 (1st Cir. 2012).  “A plaintiff bears the burden of proving that the \nwork, as a whole, is original and that it has ‘ complied with the applicable statutory formalities. ’”  \nId. (quoting Lotus Dev. Corp. v. Borland, Int’ l., Inc. , 49 F.3d 807, 813 (1st Cir. 1995) , aff’d, 516 \nU.S. 233 (1996) ).  A certificate of copyright registration is “ prima facie  evidence of Case 1:24-cv-10446-ADB     Document 50     Filed 07/19/24     Page 7 of 318 \n \n copyrightability, and shift s the bur den to the defendant” to establish the invalidity of the \ncopyright.  Id.   \nOverjet avers that it owns a valid copyright for its source code.  [ECF No. 9 at 15] ; see \ngenerally  [ECF Nos. 11-23, 11-24 ( collectively, “Source Code”)].  Further, i n selecting the \n“shades and shapes to label and organize results generated by its [] software,” [ECF No. 9 at 15], \nthe company made “artistic choices about the shapes and forms those colors would embody,” [id.], and thereby created “expressive organizational choices . . . protected by copyright law,” \n[Reply at 5].   \nOverjet alleges that Videa’s Patient View copies its protected coloring scheme, shades, \nand shape.  [\nECF No. 9 at 9–11, 15; Reply at 6]; see also  [ECF No. 11-38]; compare [ECF No. \n11-32 (“Overjet Approach”) with  [ECF No. 11-10 (“Videa Approach”)].  Overjet first became \naware of Videa’s alleged infringement at the Heartland  Dental Conference on December 9, 2023, \nwhen Videa presented the Patient View at its trade booth and Florian Hillen, the company’s CEO, gave a presentation displaying images that purportedly copied Overjet’s Visualization  \nTool.  [Compl. ¶ 94; ECF No. 9 at 11; Reply  at 6].\n6  Over jet appears to suggest that Videa \nobtained the Visualization Tool when Overjet  released it to all Heartland Clinics  on November \n15, 2023.7  See [ Reply  at 6].  \n \n \n6 Overjet further argues that Videa falsely advertises that VideaAI has segmentation capabilities, \nwhen, in fact, it has only obtained FDA- clearance for the bounded box approach.  See infra .  \n \n7 Overjet claims that it began developing its segmentation visualization display in  July 2023, \nfinaliz ed its color and highlighting scheme by mid-August 2023, and started distributing its \nVisualization Tool to clients for feedback  a few weeks later, on September 11, 2023.  [Reply at \n6].   Case 1:24-cv-10446-ADB     Document 50     Filed 07/19/24     Page 8 of 319 \n \n Videa counters that there has been no infringement.  [Opp’n at 17].  First, although Videa \ndoes not\n dispute the validity of Overjet’s Source Code copyright, it argues that Overjet ’s color \nscheme, shades, and shapes created by its software are not entitled to copyright protection \nbecause they merely serve a functional purpose.  [ Id. at 18–20; Sur-Reply at 4, 9–10].  Second, \nVidea claims  that it adopted  certain colors and shapes before Overjet did.  [Opp’n at 17–18].  A s \nearly as  April 2022, Videa began using color-coded lines to denote the level of radiographic bone \nloss (“RBL”) in its Clinical View.  [ Id. at 9].  S pecifically , it used green to indicate healthy gum \nlevels, yellow to mark that there is some risk, orange to denote an even greater risk, and red to highlight a “potential problem.”  [ Id.; Hillen Decl. ¶ 11].  “This ‘stoplight’ system . . . was \nadopted because [the company] believed it is intuitive for patients and clinicians.”  [Hillen Decl. ¶ 11].  At around the same time,  Videa also started using red boxes to indicate tooth decay, \n[Opp’n at 9], an “obvious color choice to indicate warning . . . and commonly used across industries,” [Hillen Decl. ¶ 12].  Moreover, at least as early as April 10, 2023, Videa “began developing its segmentation feature for Patient View.”  [Opp’n at 9] .  The Patient View \nsegmentation continued using the same color- coding as for RBL in its Clinical View and a lso \nincorporated “shades of red” to highlight decay, large measurements of gum recession, and periapical radiolucency; white to depict enamel; and blue for pulp.  [ Id.].  Third, Videa claims \nthat the decision to use white to indicate enamel and blue to demarcate pulp was made “without knowledge of Overjet’s scheme.”  [ Id. at 18].  Videa chose them  “because white is the color of \nenamel and blue provides contrast to render pulp more visible.”  [ Id.]; see generally  [ECF No. \n22-2 (“Clemens Decl.”) ].  According to Videa, these coloring decisions were  made as early as \nOctober 12, 2023, for the Clinical View, [Op p’n at 10], and launched in the Patient View by Case 1:24-cv-10446-ADB     Document 50     Filed 07/19/24     Page 9 of 3110 \n \n November 7, 2023, [id. at 18], which would have been before Overjet’s November 15 release, \n[id.].     \nThe Court first addresses  whether Overjet can show ownership of a valid copyright in  the \ncolors, shades, and shapes used to organize results generated by the software code, which turns \non whether those things are copyrightable.  Feist Pub l’ns, Inc. v. Rural Tel. Serv.

In order to assess non- literal infringement \nclaims, courts in this Circuit apply the three -step “abstraction -filtration -comparison” test.   See id. \nat *9; see also  Lotus, 49 F.3d at 815; Torah Soft Ltd. v. Drosnin, 136 F. Supp. 2d 276, 284 \n(S.D.N.Y. 2001) ( the three-step analysis of abstraction -filtration -comparison first abstracts the \nprogram, then filters out unprotectable elements, and, third, compares the remaining protectable elements to the alleged infringer’s work to assess whether substantial similarity exists ) (citing  \nComput.  Assocs. Int’l, Inc. v. Altai, Inc., 982 F.2d 693, 706 (2d Cir. 1992)).   Case 1:24-cv-10446-ADB     Document 50     Filed 07/19/24     Page 10 of 3111 \n \n i. Abstraction  \nThe abstraction step requires the Court to “dissect the allegedly copied program’s \nstructure and isolate each level of abstraction contained within it.”  Altai, 982 F.2d at 707.  \nBecause Overjet has already identified the alleged protectable “materials ,” namely the shapes, \ncolors, and shading used in the annotation of X-rays, [ECF No. 9 at 16–17; Opp’n at 19], “this \nCourt need not engage in the abstraction process,” Real  View,  LLC  v. 20- 20 Techs.,  Inc., 683 F. \nSupp. 2d 147, 154 (D. Mass. 2010).  \nii. Filtration  \nThe filtration analysis, step 2, requires courts to determine whether the material s \nidentified in step 1 are copyrightable, by “filter ing” the material identified in step 1 through \n“constitutional and statutory requirements of originality , the Copyright Act’s  distinction between \nexpression and ideas or processes, the doctrines of ‘ merger ’ and ‘ scènes à faire, ’ and the public \ndomain exception.”  Torah , 136 F. Supp. 2d at 284 (at this stage, “the court filters out those \nelements that are not protectable.”) .  \na. Functionality  \nPursuant to § 102(b),8 the Court must distinguish  between the annotated X -rays \n“expressive aspects,” which can be copyrightable, and the functional aspects, which are uncopyrightable.  See e- Steps , 2019 WL 9834429, at *2  (citing Oracle Am., Inc. v. Google Inc., \n750 F.3d 1339, 1357 (Fed. Cir. 2014)  (“anything that performs a function is necessarily \nuncopyrighta\nble”)).  Based on the record before the Court at this stage, it is not satisfied that \n \n \n8 “In no case does copyright protection for an original work of authorship extend to any idea, \nprocedure, process, system, method of operation, concept, principle, or discovery, regardless of \nthe form in which it is described, explained, illustrated, or embodied in such work.”  17 U.S.C. § 102(b) .    Case 1:24-cv-10446-ADB     Document 50     Filed 07/19/24     Page 11 of 3112 \n \n Overjet’s use of colors  and shapes is  merely expressive.  The underlying impetus of the color \nscheme and display is seemingly to aid clinicians in carrying out dental diagnostics.  See [Inam \nDecl. ¶ 25].  Thus, although there may not be industry-standards or guidelines specifying what \ncolors and shapes may be used on an X-ray, it nevertheless appears intuitive to use certain specific colors to indicate problem areas or create contrast in order to efficiently identify pathologies, suggesting that Overjet’s color, shape, and shading decisions were primarily driven \nby functionality.  See, e.g. , [Compl. ¶ 34 (“Overjet touts the Anatomical Structures Visualization \nTool to customers and potential customers as a tremendous aid in patient education when it comes to explaining dental anatomy, disease detection, and disease progression on radiographs, as well as the proximity to vital structures such as the pulp.  Highlighting enamel and pulp allows for a richer understanding of the nature and severity of disease progression and a visual that matches dentists’ quantified AI finding.”)].   \nb. Originality  \nWith respect to originality, in order to be copyrightable, “[a] work must possess more \nthan a de minimis  quantum of creativity.”  Torah , 136 F. Supp. 2d at 285 (citing Fei st, 499 U.S. \nat 362).   Overjet seemingly concedes that the individual colors and shades do not individually \nmeet a min\nimum level of creativity , [Mot. Hr’g Tr. 13:7–14:11, 54:4–5] ; see also  [ECF No. 9 at \n16], but contends that the “overall design choices involved with what colors to use, what transparency and translucency to use, how to shade it, how to do the borders, [and] how to  make \nit look as a whole [] is [what  makes it ] protectable.”  [Mot. Hr’g Tr. 54:5–9]. \nCourts have found that in certain instances the creativity involved in the “selection, \ncoordina \ntion, and arrangement ” of elements that are by themselves not protectable may \nnonetheless meet  the originality requirement.   Wilson v. Brennan, 666 F. Supp. 2d 1242, 1257 Case 1:24-cv-10446-ADB     Document 50     Filed 07/19/24     Page 12 of 3113 \n \n (D.N.M. 2009), aff’d, 390 F. App’x 780 (10th Cir. 2010) ; see al so Feist , 499 U.S. at 358 (“[T]he \nprincipal focus should be on whether the selection, coordination, and arrangement are \nsufficiently original to merit protection.”).   Here, however, the Court does not find that Overjet’s \ndecision s concerning the use and arrangement of particular colors , shades, and shapes  is likely to  \nbe found sufficiently creative to merit copyright protection.     \nThe case Overjet relies on, namely Coquico, Inc. v. Rodriguez -Miran da, 562 F.3d 62, 68–\n69 (1st Cir. 2009), see [Mot. Hr’g Tr. a t 14], involved more complex selections and \narrangements.  As noted by the court in that case, “any attempt to create a stuffed -animal \nrendering of the [real -life frog] will involve countless artistic decisions . . . concerning the \nprecise size, shape, posture, color juxtaposition of features, stitching, and adornment of the toy.”  Coquico, 562 F.3d at 69.  Here, the Court does not find the same array of  “countless artistic \ndecisions” among individual ly unprotectable elements.  Overjet’s decision -making focused on \nhow to indicate caries, pulp, enamel, and bone level  measurements  on radiographic imaging, \nmeaning it organized and arranged only four colors (red, white, purple, and green) and two \nshapes (a line with circles at the end ).  See [Compl. ¶ 30].  This relatively modest combination of \nunprotectable elements , even taken together, are unlikely to  be original enough to warrant \ncopyrightability.  See Satava v. Lowry, 323 F.3d 805, 811 (9th Cir. 2003) (holding “that a \ncombination of unprotectable elements is eligible for copyright protection only if those elements are numerous enough and their selection and arrangement original enough that their combination constitutes an original work of authorship.”) ; see also  United States v. Hamilton , 583 F.2d 448, \n451 (9th Cir. 1978) ( ruling that “trivial elements of compilation and arrangement [] are not \ncopyrightable since they fall below the threshold of originality.” ).   Case 1:24-cv-10446-ADB     Document 50     Filed 07/19/24     Page 13 of 3114 \n \n Similarly, in Wilson , the court considered whether, among other things, a plaintiff  who \nhad relied on pre-existing government maps and other public domain documents created \n“sufficiently original” maps based on how he “selected, coordinated, and arranged the expressive features of the map to depict its factual [non-copyrightable] content.”  666 F. Supp. 2d at 1254–55.  In finding that the plaintiff met the originality requirement, the court e mphasized the \nnumerous artistic decisions involved in generating the maps, including choosing the level of detail to depict, “what geographic features and roads to emphasize, what thickness of lines to use to delineate roads, how to indicate political boundaries, and many other details.”  Id. at 1257.  \nThe Court again notes the limited and fairly common elements at issue here  and cannot conclud e \nthat the same level of artistic decision -making informed Overjet’s choices.  See also  Silverstein \nv. Penguin Putnam , 522 F. Supp. 2d 579, 599 (“A compilation may lack the requisite creativity \nwhere . . .  the author made obvious, garden-variety, or routine selections.”) ; Real  View , 683 F. \nSupp. 2d at 15 7, 158 (noting the “numerous creative and expressive choices” when determining \nthat a screen display was copyrightable).  Because Overjet’s choice of colors, shades, and shapes Case 1:24-cv-10446-ADB     Document 50     Filed 07/19/24     Page 14 of 3115 \n \n is not sufficiently original, 9 it is unlikely to prevail on its copyright infringement claim  based \nupon the evidence before the Court at this stage.10  \n2. False Advertising U nder the Lanham Act  \nIn order to  prove a  claim for false advertising under the Lanham Act, a plaintiff  must \nshow that :   \n \n \n9 Videa also argues that the Copyright Office’s Compendium (“Compendium”) provides that \n“the enhancement of an x -ray is not something that would be protectable.”  [Mot. Hr’g Tr. 38:4–\n6]; see also  U.S. Copyright Office, Compendium of U.S. Copyright Office Practices § 313.4(K) \n(3d. ed. 2021).  Overjet counters that an X -ray, according to the Compendium may be \ncopyrightable if “used as a tool for an author’s creative expression . . . [and] if the resulting \nimage contains a sufficient amount of artistic expression ,” [Mot. Hr’g Tr. 15:1–5].  Specifically,  \nOverjet points to § 909.3(B), which provides that “types of technologies [such as X- rays] [that] \nwere created for diagnostic or other functional purposes, [] can conceivably be used in an artistic manner. ”  Compendium § 909.3(B) (“an application for an x- ray of a farm animal that has been \nmodified with bright red colors and original images of processed food products []  . . . may [be] \nregister [ed] [], because [of] the creative expression in the work as a whole .”).  At this juncture, \nthe Court is not convinced that the annotations at issue here are comparable to the Compendium’s description of artistic expressions.  Regardless, the Court need not determine this issue as it has found that the arrangement of shapes and colors does not satisfy  the originality \nrequirement.  See  supra.   \n \n10 Separately, the Court notes that , based on the current record, it cannot determine whether \nactual copying occurred.  Videa contends that it had started using color-coded lines and other \ncolor schemes as early as April 2022 in its Clinical View , [Opp’n. at 9; Hillen Decl. ¶ 11 ], that it \nstarted developing its segmentation view for the Patient View in April 2023, [Clemens Decl. ¶ \n6], and that by November 7, 2023, it had adopted the color scheme currently at issue, which \nwould have been before Overjet’s November 15 release.  See  supra ; see also  TMTV, Corp. v. \nMass Prods., Inc., 345 F. Supp. 2d 196, 209 (D.P.R. 2004), aff ’d, 645 F.3d 464 (1st Cir. 2011) \n(once ownership of a valid copyright has been established, courts then need to establish whether \nillicit copying occurred  and, in so doing, “must initially determine that the defendant copied the \nprotected work.”); see also  Rohm & Haas Elec. Materials, LLC v. Elec. Cir s. Supplies, Inc., 759 \nF. Supp. 2d 110, 125 n.107 (D. Mass. 2010) (when “courts are faced with affidavits at odds and \nmust make a credibility determination between them, courts generally do not issue a preliminary \ninjunction, but rather leave the issue for a jury to resolve.” ); Spencer Co. v. Armonk Indus., Inc., \n489 F.2d 704, 707 (1st Cir. 1973) (affirming the refusal to issue a preliminary injunction as an \nappropriate exercise of discretion in light of a “major factual dispute” between the parties that \ncalled into question whether [the plaintiff] would ever prevail on the merits”).    Case 1:24-cv-10446-ADB     Document 50     Filed 07/19/24     Page 15 of 3116 \n \n (1) the d efendant made a false or misleading description of fact or representation \nof fact in a commercial advertisement about his own or another ’s product; (2) the \nmisrepresentation is material, in that it is likely to influence the purchasing decision; (3) the misrepresentation actually deceives or has the tendency to deceive a substantial segment of its audience; (4) the defendant placed the false or \nmisleading statement in interstate commerce; and (5) the plaintiff has been or is \nlikely to be injured as  a result of the misrepresentation, either by direct diversion of \nsales or by a lessening of goodwill associated with its products.  \nHilsinger Co. v. Kleen Concepts, LLC, No. 14- cv-14714, 2017 WL\n  3841468, at *8 (D. Mass. \nSept. 1, 2017) (quoting Cashmere & Camel Hair Mfrs. Inst . v. Saks Fifth Ave., 284 F.3d 302, \n310–11 (1st Cir. 2002)) ; see also  15 U.S.C. § 1125(a).  “A plaintiff can succeed on a false \nadvertising claim by proving either that the defendant’ s advertisement is literally false or \nimplicitly false —that is, the advertisement is true or ambiguous yet misleading.”  Ca shmere, 284 \nF.3d at 311.  “ In assessing a Lanham Act claim for . . .  false advertising, a determination first \nmust be made as to what the statement by the defendant that grounds the claim communicates.”  \nAzurity Pharms., Inc. v. Edge Pharma, LLC, 45 F.4th 479, 486 (1st Cir. 2022) (citing Clorox Co. \nP. R. v. Proctor & Gamble Com. Co., 228 F.3d 24, 34 (1st Cir. 2000)).  Then, “[a] determination \nmust be made about whether that statement, given what it communicates, is either false and/or misleading.”  Id. (citing Clorox, 228 F.3d at 34 ).  This Circuit has recognized that a “literally \nfalse” statement may either be explicit or “convey[ed] by necessary implication,” meaning that a claim is considered false when, “considering the advertisement in its entirety, the audience would recognize the claim as readily as if it had been explicitly stated.”  Clorox, 228 F.3d at 34–\n35.  “Where the advertisement  is literally  false, a violation may be established without evidence \nof consumer deception.”   Cashmere, 284 F.3d at 311.  Where the advertisement is implicitly \nfalse, “an additional burden is placed upon the plaintiff to show that the advertisement . . . conveys a misleading message to the viewing public.”  Id. (quoting Cloro x, 228 F.3d at  33).  In \nthe context of preliminary injunctions, “a showing that the defendant’ s activities are likely to Case 1:24-cv-10446-ADB     Document 50     Filed 07/19/24     Page 16 of 3117 \n \n cause confusion or to deceive customers is sufficient to warrant [] relief .”  Id.;  see also  Quabaug \nRubber Co. v. Fabiano Shoe Co., 567 F.2d 154, 160 (1st Cir. 1977) (holding that “a showing that \nthe defendant’s activities are likely to cause confusion or to deceive customers suffices to \nwarrant relief, at least in cases where injunctive relief is requested.”).    \ni. False or Misleading Statements  \nOverjet avers that several statements in Videa’s promotional materials, including a \nLinkedIn post, videos, and blog posts, improperly state that (1) “Videa’s  software is safe and \neffective for various medical purposes,” even though it had not obtained the relevant FDA clearance, or (2) that it had “reached a technological milestone in AI development before Overjet, when exactly the reverse was true.”  [ECF No.  9 at 19–20].  Videa counters that none of \nthe statements are literally false or misleading, and, if anything, amount to “quintessential puffery.”  [Opp’n at 22–23].  The Court reviews each of the alleged misrepresentations .     \nStatement # 1 :  In\n  a LinkedIn post from December 2023, whic h has since been deleted, \n[Hillen Decl. ¶ 29], Videa stated , “[h]ear from the clinicians  who are experiencing firsthand \nVideaAI’s transformative power .”  [ECF No. 11-19].  Overjet alleges that the  X-ray \naccompanying the statement implied that Videa had FDA clearance for segmentation  when, in \nreality, the FDA had only cleared Videa’s “bounding box” approach.  See [ECF No. 9 at 7].   \nBecause Videa is in fact an AI platform, the  statement is not explicitly false.  The Court \ncannot, however,  without the benefit of the full LinkedIn post, assess the extent to which Videa’s \nstatement , in light of the accompanying X- ray, is misleading , and refrains from evaluating \nStatement # 1 under the first prong of the Lanham Act at this juncture .  \nStatement # 2:  In a blog post dated April 5, 2021, Videa represented  tha t its AI software \ncan “aid in the diagnosis and prediction of the progression of diseases such as caries or Case 1:24-cv-10446-ADB     Document 50     Filed 07/19/24     Page 17 of 3127 \n \n the actors involved and the considerable monetary value of potential contracts, the sales process \nis thorough a\nnd lengthy, with a heavy focus on the software’s actual capabilities , including \nrelevant FDA clearance.  The Court is therefore not persuaded that, at this stage, Overjet will \nprevail on the materiality element and need not continue its analysis under the Lanham Act.  \nEncompass Ins. Co. of MA v. Giampa, 522 F. Supp. 2d 300, 311 (D. Mass. 2007) (“ [F]ailure to \nallege factual support for any of the[] elements is fatal to a claim for false advertising under the \nLanham Act.”).  Nevertheless, fo r completeness, the Court finds that Overjet is  also unlikely to \nmake a sufficient showing  in relation to deception and injury.   \niii. Deception  \nWhen considering injunctive relief, consumer deception is presumed for literal falsity \nclaims .  See Cashmere, 284 F.3d at 314.  For the statements that are literally false, namely \nStatements # 5, 7–10, Overjet would not need to “ demonstrate actual consumer deception.”15  \nBalance Dynamics Corp. v. Schmitt Indus., Inc., 204 F.3d 683, 693 (6th Cir. 2000).  For \nStatement #11, which the Court has deemed impliedly false, Overjet would only need to show that it is  “likely to cause confusion or to deceive customers.”  Cashmere, 284 F.3d at 311.  \nOverjet is unlikely to meet that burden.16   \nThe crux of Overjet’s argument is that Videa “advertises software for use as a safe and \neffective medical device,” when it in fact lacks “the advertised indicia of safety and \n \n \n15 The Court notes that Videa has since cured all but two statements ( #5 and #11).  This weighs \nagainst a finding of irreparable harm.  See infra .     \n \n16 Separately, Overjet “would still be able to avail [itself]  of a presumption of consumer \ndeception” on the alternative ground that Videa “intentionally set out to deceive or mislead \ncostumers.”  Cashmere, 284 F.3d at 316.  B ecause Overjet did not allege facts establishing that \nVidea acted deliberately to deceive customers, the company is not entitled to this presumption.   Case 1:24-cv-10446-ADB     Document 50     Filed 07/19/24     Page 27 of 3128 \n \n effectiveness, and that it is even possible that Videa has not developed or included segmentation \ncap\nabilities in its software.”  [ECF No. 9 at 20].  Overjet , does not, however, articulate how the \nmisrepresentations tend to cause consumer deception.  As noted supra, both Videa and Overjet \noperate in a space with sophisticated customers.  It seems reasonable that discussions surrounding relevant FDA clearance—and verification thereof— are a critical component of the \nsales process.   A few promotional videos and blog posts, it appears, are unlikely to cause \nconsumer deception among the relevant pool of potential consumers.   \niv. Interstate Commerce  \nThere is no dispute that by posting the alleged misrepresentations online, including on \nVidea’s website, LinkedIn, and YouTube, Videa placed them into interstate commerce.  See \nMcGrath & Co., LLC v. PCM Consulting, Inc., No. 11- cv-10930, 2012 WL  503629, at *6 (D . \nMass. Feb 15, 2012) (“Courts have generally held that when one operates a website containing alleged false or misleading statements, the party causes those statements to enter interstate commerce through the internet.”).\n \nv. Injury  \nThe final element in the Lanham Act analysis requires Overjet to show that it has been or \nis likely to be injured because of  the alleged misrepresentations.  In the context of injunctive \nrelief, a “showing that the defendant’s activities are likely to cause confusion or to deceive customers is sufficient.”  Cashmere, 284 F.3d at 311 (by contrast, “a plaintiff seeking damages \nmust show actual harm to its business.”).  Specifically, when the advertisements are literally \nfalse,  “only a slight likelihood of injury need be shown to warrant injunctive relief.”  Camel \nHair, 799 F.2d at 15.   Case 1:24-cv-10446-ADB     Document 50     Filed 07/19/24     Page 28 of 3129 \n \n In light of the discussion above, the Court finds that Overjet is unlikely to meet its burden  \non this el\nement.  In relation to Overjet’s allegations of reputational harm, it “has presented \nnothing beyond mere conjecture with regard to the anticipated harm to [its] reputation.”  \nRiverdale Mills Corp. v. Cavatorta N. Am., Inc., 146 F. Supp. 3d 356, 362 (D. Mass. 2015).  It \nhas also not established that it suffered a loss of customers due to Videa’s actions, including that Heartland’s decision to partner with Videa,  [Compl. ¶ 90], was influenced  by the alleged \nmisrepresentations, see generally  [ECF No. 9; Reply].  Accordingly, the Court does not find that \nthere is  a likelihood of injury.  \n3. Unfair Competition  \nOverjet  further contends that Videa’s purported false and misleading advertisements \nviolate\n state law, specifically Mass. Gen. L. ch. 266, § 91 and ch. 93A, § 11.17  [ECF No. 9 at \n21–22].   These claims “rise[] or fall[] with the federal claim.”  Arborjet, Inc. v. Rainbow Treecare \nSci. Advancements, Inc. , 63 F. Supp. 3d 149, 157 (D. Mass.  2014) , rev’d in part on other \ngrounds, 794 F.3d 168 (1st Cir. 2015)  (quoting Am . Med. Sys., Inc. v. Biolitec, Inc., 774 F. \nSupp. 2d 375, 393 (D. Mass.  2011) ) (regarding ch. 266, § 91) ; Milk S t. Cafe, Inc. v. CPK Media, \nLLC , No. 16- cv-11416, 2017 WL 3425170, at *12 (D. Mass. Aug. 9, 2017) (regarding ch. 93A, \n§ 11).  Because the Court concludes that Overjet is unlikely to prevail on its federal claim, the company’s state claims are likely to fail, too.    \n \n \n17 Because the Court has determined that Overjet is unlikely to prevail on the false  \nadvertising claim under the Lanham Act, it need not consider the argument that Videa unfairly \ncompetes against  Overjet  by copying the company’s “playbook.”  [ECF No. 9 at 22].   Case 1:24-cv-10446-ADB     Document 50     Filed 07/19/24     Page 29 of 3130 \n \n C. Irreparable Harm  \n“[I]f the moving party cannot demonstrate that he is likely to succeed in his quest, the \nremain\ning factors become matters of idle curiosity.”  Arborjet , 794 F.3d at 173 (quoting New \nComm Wireless Servs. , 287 F.3d at 9).  The Court nonetheless notes, however, that Overjet also \nwould likely have been unable to make a sufficient showing of irreparable harm. \n“Plaintiffs seeking injunctive relief must make a ‘clear showing’ that substantial and \nimmedia\nte irreparable harm is ‘likely’ in the absence of an injunction.”  Oxford Immunotec Ltd. \nv. Qiagen, Inc., 271 F. Supp. 3d 358, 367 (D. Mass. 2017) (quoting Winter v. Nat. Res. Def. \nCouncil, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 22 (2008)).  “[E]conomic loss alone does not usually rise to the level \nof irreparable harm which a party must establish to obtain a preliminary injunction.”  Suero v. \nFed. Home Loan Mortg. Corp., No. 13- cv-13014, 2013 WL 6709001, at *7 (D. Mass. Dec. 17, \n2013) (quoting Hull Mun. Lighting Plant v. Mass. Mun. Wholesale Elec. Co., 506 N.E.2d 140, \n142 ( Mass. 1987)).  If, however, “the loss threatens the very existence of the movant’ s business,” \neconomic losses may be sufficient.   Id. \nOverjet’s  claims that it is likely to lose customers and future business and its first mover -\nadvantage, as well as suffer harm to its reputation and brand, are overly speculative.  The \ncompany has not substantiated these claims or provided any indication that it lost the Heartland contract because of Videa’s alleged wrongful actions.  See Spruce Env’t Techs., Inc., 2015 WL \n4038802, at *5 (concluding that because plaintiff alleged that at least one customer had been affected by defendant’s false advertisemen t it had “demonstrated a modicum of irreparable harm \nto its goodwill and reputation.” ).   \nFurther, i n relation to the false advertis ing c\n laim, all of the  misrepresentations  the Court \nhas deemed literally false, Statements # 5, 7–10, have been cured.  See supra.  This weighs Case 1:24-cv-10446-ADB     Document 50     Filed 07/19/24     Page 30 of 3131 \n \n significantly against a finding of irreparable harm, as it not only reduces the likelihood of injury \nto Ove\nrjet’s reputation, but also the loss of future business.  See Riverdale Mills Corp. , 146 F. \nSupp. 3d at  363.   \nIII. CONCLUSION  Accordingly, Overjet’ s mot\n ion for a preliminary injunction, [ECF No. 8], is  DENIED . \nOverjet  has failed to make a sufficient showing that it is likely  to succeed on the merits.  At this \ntime, Overjet has failed to demonstrate that the color, shape, and shades used in its Visualization Tool are copyrightable, that Videa has made materially false and misleading statements when advertising its products, or that it is likely to suffer irreparable harm.   \nSO ORDERED.    \n      \n             \nJuly 19, 2024 /s/ A llison D.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: In this case, Loop AI Labs, Inc., a startup developing artificial intelligence technology, filed a lawsuit against several defendants, including its former CEO Anna Gatti, accusing her of misappropriating trade secrets and engaging in unfair competition. The legal dispute centers around a subpoena issued to Orrick, a law firm that previously represented Loop and some defendants simultaneously, potentially raising issues regarding attorney-client privilege. The court granted Orrick's motion to quash the subpoena in part, ruling that most of the requested documents were protected by privilege, except for two emails involving an attorney no longer with Orrick.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: The central legal issue was whether Orrick's internal communications, claimed to be protected by attorney-client privilege, should be disclosed to Loop AI Labs, particularly in light of potential conflicting duties due to Orrick’s simultaneous representation of Loop and other defendants.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court held that the communications between Orrick and its internal legal team were protected by attorney-client privilege, even given the past concurrent representation. This was because the privileged communications pertained to internal assessments of legal obligations and the firm’s ethical duties. The privilege did not apply to communications that did not involve legal advice or that included third-party individuals no longer with the firm, such as two emails which were ordered for disclosure.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine you have a secret recipe and you hired a lawyer to help protect it. Now, if you find out that your lawyer was also helping someone else who might have stolen your secret, you'd want to know what your lawyer was talking about behind the scenes, right? This case is about whether you can see those private chats. The court said most of the lawyer's chats are like private advice between friends that shouldn’t be shared. But, if some messages weren’t really private advice or involved someone outside the firm, those could be shared.",

No. 169  \n \n Third party Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe LLP (“ Orrick ”) moves for an order quashing a \nsubpoena issued by Plaintiff Loop AI Labs, Inc. (“Loop”), or in the alternative, for an order \nprotecting Orrick from having to respond to requests in the subpoena to which it timely object ed.  \n[Docket No. 169.]  Loop  opposes the motion.  [Docket Nos. 176 (Pl.’s Opp’n) .]  The court \nconducted a hearing on December 10, 2015  and ordered Orrick to submit documents  withheld  on \nthe basis  of attorney -client privilege  for in camera review .  [Docket No. 323.]  Orrick timely \nlodged the documents.  For the following reasons,  Orrick’s motion is granted  in part .   \nI. BACKGROUND  \nLoop  filed this action in February 2015 against Defendants Almawave USA; Almaviva \nS.p.A. (“Almaviva”) and Almawave S.r.l. ( together,  the “Italian Almaviva Defendants”); Anna \nGatti; IQSystems LLC; and IQSystems , Inc.   Loop  is a startup company that develops artificial \nintelligence technology.  It alleges that Gatti, its former CEO, conspired with the Italian Almaviva \nDefendants to misap propriate Loop ’s trade secrets and sabotage its investor negotiations.   \nAccording to Loop , while pretending to work full time for Loop, Gatti took a concurrent CEO \nposition with Almawave USA.   In its second amended complaint, Loop  brings seventeen claims \nagainst some or all of the Defendants, including, inter alia , violations of the Racketeer Influenced \nand Corrupt Organizations Act (“RICO”), 18 U.S.C. § 1962 et seq ., violations of the Computer Case 4:15-cv-00798-HSG   Document 430   Filed 02/24/16   Page 1 of 10 \n2 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  Fraud and Abuse Act (“CFAA”), 18 U.S.C. § 1030 et seq ., misappropriation of trade secrets, \nunfair competition, and various torts.  [ See Docket No. 210 (2d Am. Compl.).]  \nThird party Orrick is a law firm that represented Loop from 2012 through  March 2015.   \nOrrick also represented the Italian Almaviva Defendant s and Almawave USA for a period of time \nthat overlapped with its representation of Loop.   In June 2015, Loop  attempted to serve Orrick  \nwith a subpoena requesting the production of 30 categories of documents.   Alderman Decl. Aug. \n13, 2015 , Ex. A (Subpoena).   The subpoena included requests for production of documents \n(“RFPs”) related to Orrick’s representation of and communications with the Italian Almaviva \nDefendants and Almawave USA.  Orrick disputed whether Loop  had properly served the \nsubpoena, and o n Jul y 7, 2015, Loop  moved for an order to show cause why a contempt citation \nshould not issue  based on Orrick’s failure to timely respond to the subpoena .  [Docket No. 124.]  \nAt the July 23, 2015 discovery management conference, the court denied Loop ’s motion without \nprejudice and deemed the subpoena served as of July 23, 2015.  The court ordered Orrick to serve \nresponses and/or objections to the subpoena by July 30, 2015, and ordered the parties to \nimmediately confer regarding any objections.  The court also o rdered the “Almawave Defendants \nand Orrick [to] file [any]  motion(s) for protective order” by August 13, 2015.  [Docket No. 156  \n(Minute Order) .]   \nOrrick provided responses to certain RFPs, and  also objected on the grounds that the y \nsought documents protected by the attorney -client privilege belonging either to Almawave S.r.l. or \nAlmaviva , or to Orrick  itself .  Orrick also objected that certain RFPs sought irrelevant information \nand/or were unduly burdensome.  Alderman Decl. ¶ 3, Ex. B (Orrick Responses and Objections).  \nTo the extent that the subpoena requested communications that could be subject to a claim of \nprivilege asserted by  Almawave S.r.l. or Almaviva , Orrick forwarded  those documents to counsel \nfor the Italian Almaviva  Defendants , (who also represent Almawave USA ,1) so that counsel  could \nmake any privilege determinations and object on those grounds.  Alderman Decl. ¶¶ 8, 9.  Orrick \n                                                \n1 Defendants Almawave USA, Almaviva, and Almawave S.r.l. are represented by the Venable  law \nfirm in this action.  \n Case 4:15-cv-00798-HSG   Document 430   Filed 02/24/16   Page 2 of 10 \n3 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  is withholding communications that it claims are protected by its own attorney -client pri vilege \nand/or work product protection , and asks the court to quash the subpoena as to these documents.  \nII. LEGAL STANDARDS  \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 45 governs discovery of nonparties by subpoena.  Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 45.  The Advisory Committee Notes to Rul e 45 state that “the scope of discovery through a \nsubpoena is the same as that applicable to Rule 34 and the other discovery rules,” which in turn is \nthe same as under Rule 26(b).  Advisory Committee Notes to 1970 Amendment; Fed. R. Civ. P. \n34(a) (“A party  may serve on any other party a request within the scope of Rule 26(b).”).  Rule \n26(b) allows a party to obtain discovery concerning  \n \nany nonprivileged matter that is relevant to any party’s claim or \ndefense and proportional to the needs of the case, consi dering the \nimportance of the issues at stake in the action, the amount in \ncontroversy, the parties’ relative access to relevant information, the \nparties’ resources, the importance of the discovery in resolving the \nissues, and whether the burden or expense of the proposed discovery \noutweighs its likely benefit.  \nFed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(1).  “Information within this scope of discovery need not be admissible in \nevidence to be discoverable.”  Id. \nRule 45 provides that “on timely motion, the court for the district where compliance is \nrequired must quash or modify a subpoena that . . . requires disclosure of privileged or other \nprotected matter, if no exception or waiver applies; or . . . subjects a person to undue burden.”  \nFed. R. Civ. P. 45(c)(3)(A) (iii), (iv).  “ [A] court determining the propriety of a subpoena balances \nthe relevance of the discove ry sought, the requesting party’ s need, and the potential hardship to the \nparty subject to the subpoena.”  Gonzales  v. Google , 234 F.R.D. 674, 680 (N.D. Cal. 2006)  \n(citation omitted).  The party who moves to quash a subpoena bears the “burden of persuasion” \nunder Rule 45(c)(3).  Moon v. SCP Pool Corp. , 232 F.R.D. 633, 637 (C.D.  Cal. 2005) (citations \nomitted).  \nIII. DISCUSSION  \nA. Whether Federal or State Law Governing Attorne y-Client Privilege Applies to \nThese Disputes  \nAs a preliminary matter, Loop  and Orrick dispute whether federal or state privilege law Case 4:15-cv-00798-HSG   Document 430   Filed 02/24/16   Page 3 of 10 \n4 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  applies to this dispute.  This court exercises federal question jurisdiction over Loop ’s federal \nRICO and CFAA claims pursu ant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331 , and supplemental jurisdiction over Loop ’s \npendent state law claims.  Federal privilege law generally applies in federal question cases.  Fed. \nR. Evid. 501, Advisory Committee Notes (“In nondiversity jurisdiction civil cases, federa l law \nprivilege will generally apply.”)  However, “[i]n civil actions and proceedings, where the rule of \ndecision as to a claim or defense or as to an element of a claim or defense is supplied by state law . \n. . state privilege law [applies].”  Id.  While the “interplay of these two principles has created \nsomewhat inconsistent case law regarding the application of federal privilege doctrine to pendent \nstate law claims in federal question cases,” Love v. Permanente Med. Grp. , No. C -12-05679  WHO \n(DMR ), 2013 W L 4428806, at *2 -4 (N.D. Cal. Aug. 15, 2013)  (discussing cases) , the Ninth \nCircuit has held that “[w]here there are federal question claims and pendent state law claims \npresent, the federal law of privilege applies.”  Agster v. Maricopa Cty. , 422 F.3d 836,  839 (9th Cir. \n2005) .   \nDespite clear Ninth Circuit authority that the federal law of privilege applies  here, Orrick \nargues that  Loop ’s claims are based overwhelmingly on state law .  It contends that  where a party \nseeks to obtain privileged documents from a non -party that invokes its own privilege, the court \nshould apply  California law .  Orrick offers no authority to support its position .  Applying state \nprivilege law to the instant dispute  while  potentially applying federal privilege law to other \ndisputes that may arise in this litigation  would be inconsistent and unworkable , as well as contrary \nto Agster .  Accordingly, the court applies federal privilege law.    \nThe attorney -client privilege prot ects from discovery “confidential communications \nbetween attorneys and clients, which are made for the purpose of giving legal advice.”  United \nStates v. Richey , 632 F.3d 559, 566 (9th Cir. 2011) (citation omitted ).  The privilege is “narrowly \nand strictly  construed,” and the party asserting it bears the burden of proving that it applies.  \nVasudevan Software, Inc. v. IBM Corp. , No. 09 -5897 -RS (PSG), 2011 WL 1599646, at *1 (N.D. \nCal. Apr. 27, 2011)  (citations omitted ); accord United States v. Bergonzi , 216 F .R.D. 487, 493 \n(N.D. Cal. 2003) (holding that party asserting privilege “must make a prima facie showing” that \nprivilege applies) (citing In re Grand Jury Investigation , 974 F.2d 1068, 1071 (9th Cir. 1992)); see Case 4:15-cv-00798-HSG   Document 430   Filed 02/24/16   Page 4 of 10 \n5 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  Richey , 632 F.3d at 566.  The privilege attaches when:  \n \n(1) legal advice of any kind is sought (2) from a professional legal \nadviser in his capacity as such, (3) the communications relating to \nthat purpose, (4) made in confidence (5) by the client, (6) are at his \ninstance permanently protected ( 7) from disclosure by himself or by \nthe legal adviser, (8) unless the protection be waived.   \nRichey , 632 F.3d at 566 (brackets and citation omitted).   \n The privilege extends to versions of electronic communications and preliminary drafts of \ncommunicated documents, Laethem Equip. Co. v. Deere & Co. , 261 F.R.D. 127, 139 -40 (E.D. \nMich. 2009) (citations omitted), as well as communications with “third parties who have been \nengaged to assist the attorney in providing legal advice.”  Richey , 632 F.3d at 566 (foo tnote \nomitted).  If the advice sought from the professional legal advisor is not legal advice, the privilege \ndoes not apply.  Id. at 566 . \nB. RFPs at Issue  \nOrrick objects to RFPs 23, 24, 26, and 29 to the extent that they seek documents protected \nby the attorney -client privilege and work product protection belonging to Orrick.  Those RFPs are \nas follows:  \nRFP 23:  Produce all documents and communications received or sent by any one at Orrick,  \nincluding John Bautista, from February 1, 2015 to the present, including from his personal email  \naddress johnvbautista@gmail.com regarding, discussing, addressing, referencing or containing a  \nreference or a discussion of any one of the follo wing: (A) TOPIC: any actual or potential  \nlitigation by Plaintiff, including, but not limited to, any discussion of litigation strategy, litigation,  \nfunding for Plaintiff or any similar topic, (B) TERMS: (1) gatti, (3) calafiore, (4) sandei, (5)  \nalmawave, ( 6) almaviva, except that communications also sent to gm@loop.ai or to  \nvaleria.healy@healylex.com need not be produced.  \nRFP 24:  Produce all of Orrick internal documents, correspondence and any other records, from  \nFebruary 1, 2015 to the present discussing, referencing or in any way addressing any conflicts or  \nother issue relating to Orrick’s representation of Plaintiff or Almaviva S.p.A., Almawave S.r.l., \nAlmawave USA Inc., Gatti, Valeria Sandei, including any correspondence with Orrick’s insurers  \nregarding Plaintiff or Almaviva S.p.A., Almawave S.r.l., Almawave USA Inc., Gatti, Valeria  Case 4:15-cv-00798-HSG   Document 430   Filed 02/24/16   Page 5 of 10 \n6 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  Sandei.  \nRFP 26: Produce all documents and communications within Orrick from February 1, 2015 to the  \npresent relating to, discussing or in any way mentioning the Lawsuit or Lit igation filed by  \nPlaintiff; as defined above.  \nRFP 29: Produce all documents and correspondence from February 1, 2015 to (and including)  \nMarch 11, 2015 between Larry Low and anyone else, including anyone inside Orrick, regarding,  \naddressing, concerning or i n any way referencing Plaintiff, the Lawsuit or Litigation (as defined  \nabove), Gatti, Almawave, Sandei, Venable, Healy LLC, or regarding, addressing, concerning or  \nin any way referencing the subject matter or contents of Mr. Low’s email filed in this actio n at \nDkt. No. 29 -1. \nC. Analysis  \n Orrick asks the court to enter a protective order and/or to quash the subpoena to the extent \nthat it seeks internal confidential communications between Orrick’s lawyers and its Chief Legal \nOfficer Larry Low or Claims Counsel W illiam Alderman, that “request or provide legal advice ” \nrelated to this lawsuit or to Loop’s subpoena to the firm .  Mot. at 3.  Orrick submits a declaration \nby Alderman in which he states that each of the withheld communications “was made in \nconfidence for the purpose of obtaining or giving legal advice in connection with this lawsuit or \nthe demands made of Orrick made by [Loop ] and its counsel.”  Alderman Decl. ¶ 10.  In a second \ndeclaration, Alderman  states that e ach of the withheld communications was dated on or after \nFebruary 27, 2015 , the date Orrick contends it first learned of this litigation.2  Orrick argues that as \nwith any other client, a law firm enjoys an attorney -client privilege covering confidential \ncommunications with its internal legal counsel.   Loop  does not dispute that the attorney -client \nprivilege applies to the withheld communications.  Instead, it notes that Orrick represented Loop \nfor almost three years, beginning in April 2012 and continuing u ntil March 11, 2015, when Orrick \nformally withdrew from any future r epresentation of the company.   Loop  argues that federal \n                                                \n2 On February 27, 2015, Orrick received an email from Loop’s counsel notifying Orrick of this \nlitigation and asking a series of questions  about  Orrick’s representation of the interested parties .  \nAlderman Decl. Sept. 3, 2015 (“2d Alderman Decl.”) ¶ 3.   Case 4:15-cv-00798-HSG   Document 430   Filed 02/24/16   Page 6 of 10 \n7 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  common law recognizes a “fiduciary ” or “current client ” exception to the attorney -client privilege, \nwhich would prevent  Orrick from  invoking its own attorney -client privilege against Loop for \ncommunications  that took place  during its representation of Loop.  \n As discussed above, federal common law governs here .  The attorney -client privilege  may \napply to a law firm’s communications with its own lawyers within  the firm.  See United States v. \nRowe , 96 F.3d 1294, 1296 -97 (9th Cir. 1996).  The Ninth Circuit recognizes a fiduciary exception \nto the attorney -client privilege.  United States v. Mett , 178 F.3d 1058, 1062 (9th Cir. 1999).   In the \ncontext of  a law firm’ s communications with its in-house counsel, one court has held that “a law \nfirm cannot assert the attorney -client privilege against a current outside client when the \ncommunications that it  seeks to protect arise out of self -representation that creates an \nimpermissible conflicting relationship with that outside client.”   In re SonicBlue, Inc. , No. 03 -\n51775, 2008 WL 170562, at *9 (Bankr. N.D. Cal. Jan. 18, 2008) .  Where conflicting duties exi st, \nthe law firm’s right to claim privilege “must give way to the interest in protecting current clients \nwho may be harmed by the conflict.”  Id.; see also  In re Sunrise Sec. Litig. , 130 F.R.D. 560, 597 \n(E.D. Pa. 1989).    \n Loop  states  that from 2012 to 201 5, Orrick represented Loop with respect to all critical \naspects of its business, including matters related to Gatti and her employment with Loop.  Loop  \nasserts  that Orrick was simultaneously working with Gatti and the Almaviva Defendants, and that \nOrrick h ad prepared an employment agreement between Almawave USA and Gatti, even though \nGatti continued to be employed by Loop.  Loop  contends that Orrick never advised Loop that it \nwas representing Almawave USA or the Italian Almaviva  Defendants, and never disclosed that it \nwas acting adversely to Loop ’s interests.   Loop  argues that until Orrick ceased its representation of \nLoop on March 11, 2015, Orrick had a fiduciary obligation not to act against Loop’s interests in \nany way and to d isclose all matters material to the representation, including the fact that Gatti had \nbeen acting in breach of her own obligations to Loop for more than a year.  Therefore, Loop  \nargues, Orrick should not be permitted to withhold any communications that pre -date Orrick’s Case 4:15-cv-00798-HSG   Document 430   Filed 02/24/16   Page 7 of 10 \n8 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  termination of its attorney -client representation of Loop.3 \n Loop cites two cases to support its argument that the fiduciary exception warrants \nproduction of the otherwise privileged documents.  Both Landmark Screens, LLC v. Morgan, \nLewis & Bockius LLP , No. C08 -02581 JF (HRL), 2010 WL 289858, at *1 -3 (N.D. Cal. Jan. 15, \n2010) and E-Pass Technologies, Inc. v. Moses & Singer, LLP , No. C09 -5967 EMC (JSC), 2011 \nWL 3794889, at *2 -3 (N.D. Cal. Aug. 26, 2011) are attorney malpractice cases in which the \nplaintiffs alleged that the defendant law firms had negligently represented them in patent cases.  In \nboth cases, the courts relied on a third case, Thele n Reid & Priest  LLP v. Marland , No. 06 -2071 \nVRW, 2007 WL 578989, at *8 (N.D. Cal. Feb. 21, 2007) .  In Thelen , the court held that where \nthere is a potential conflict of interest between a firm and its client, the firm may not withhold any \ncommunications  discussing  1) claims that the client might have against the firm, 2) known errors \nin its representa tion of the client, and 3) known conflicts between the firm and the client.   \nHowever, the court in Thele n also held that a firm need not disclose communications reflecting \nconsultations between the firm’s lawyers regarding  the firm’s legal and ethical obli gations to its \nclient, noting that “[a] rule requiring disclosure of all communications relating to a client would \ndissuade attorneys from referring ethical problems to other lawyers, thereby undermining \nconformity with ethical obligations.”  Id. at *7; see also SonicBlue , 2008 WL 170562, at *9 \n(noting that public policy that “encourages lawyers to consult with in -house counsel to understand \nand comply with their professional responsibilities and ethical restraints . . . favors allowing the \nprivilege to be asserted until such time as the firm has, or should have, determined that dual \nrepresentation of itself and an outside client should not continue without the informed consent of \nthe outside client.”).  \n For its part, Orrick challenges Loop’s central factual  assertion .  Orrick  points out that  Loop  \nhas not submitted any evidence to support its contention  that Orrick  knew that  Gatti  was working \nsimultaneously for its conflicting clients, Loop and Almawave USA .  Orrick  also argues that \n                                                \n3 At the hearing, Plaintiff conceded that it is not entitled to communications post -dating March 11, \n2015.  \n Case 4:15-cv-00798-HSG   Document 430   Filed 02/24/16   Page 8 of 10 \n9 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  Landmark  Screens  and E-PassTechnologies are distinguishable.  In those malpractice cases, the \nlaw firms knew that their clients had a legal claim against them.  By contrast, there is no evidence \nthat Loop had a “claim” against Orrick.  Orrick also notes that unlike in those cases, Orrick did not \nperform any wor k for Loop after it became aware of the potential conflict on February 27, 2015.  \nOrrick never simultaneously performed work for its conflicting clients, and instead, took \nimmediate steps to evaluate its ethical obligations, a nd promptly withdrew from representation \nwithin two weeks.    \n The court agrees that the cases cited by Loop  are distinguishable on their facts .  Orrick \nnotified Loop  that it was withdrawing from its representation on March 11, 2015, only twelve days \nafter learning of the conflict through a February 27, 2015  email from Loop’s counsel .  Orrick  did \nnot perform any work for Loop  during that two-week period .  There is no evidence that Orrick  was \naware of “ impending ethical issues” prior to  February 27, 2015 , and it appears that it promptly \nceased its representation of all parties with conflicting interests .  See, e.g.,  SonicBlue , 2008 WL \n170562, at *10 (finding that even though firm “had some inkling of impending ethical issues,” an \nactual conflict did not a rise until over a year later when the firm executed a tolling agreement with \nthe client; as of that date, firm’s ability to withhold intra -firm communications “became \nimpaired.”).   \n At the December 10, 2015 hearing, the court ordered Orrick to submit for in camera review \nall documents dated between February 27, 2015 and March 11, 2015  withheld  on the basis  of \nattorney -client privilege.  Orrick submitted approximately 650 documents.  The court has carefully \nreviewed the se documents , many of which are duplic ates or include chains of emails that appear in \nother documents.  With two exceptions, the documents contain  communications about Loop ’s \nsubpoena and this lawsuit, and subsequent internal communications about Orrick’s legal and \nethical obligations in conne ction with representing Loop , the Italian Almaviva Defendants and \nAlmawave USA .  The withheld documents do not contain communications  discussing claims that \nLoop might have against Orrick, errors in Orrick’s representation of Loop, or conflicts between \nOrrick and Loop.   The court adopts the reasoning set forth in Thelen  and SonicBlue , and therefore \nfinds that the fiduciary exception to attorney -client privilege does not apply  here.

These are emails dated March 3, 2015 from Peter \nSternberg to Orrick attorneys.  Peter Sternberg is a former Orrick attorney w ho works at the \nVenable firm, which represents the Italian Almaviva Defendants and Almawave USA.  It is not \nclear how the se communications  are protected by Orrick’s own attorney -client privilege, since \nthey involve an individual who no longer worked at Orr ick at the time of the communications, and \nwho does not represent Orrick.  Additionally, the communications were not made for the purpose \nof obtaining or giving legal advice in connection with this lawsuit or the Loop subpoena .  \nAccordingly, the document s bates -labeled OHS0000279 and OHS0000280 must be produced to \nLoop . \nIV. CONCLUSION  \nFor the foregoing reasons, Orrick’s motion for a protective ord er and/or to quash is \nGRANTED in part.  Orrick shall produce to Loop  documents bates -labeled OHS0000279 and \nOHS000 0280 within seven days of the date of this order.  \n \nIT IS SO ORDERED.  \nDated: February 24, 2016  \n______________________________________  \nDonna M. Ryu  \n  United States Magistrate Judge  \n                                                \n4 Loop  also argues that Orrick has wa ived its attorney -client privilege by advising the court in an \nearlier filing that it was unaware of its conflicted representation of Loop  and the Italian Almaviva \nDefendants, and that it resigned its representation immediately upon learning of this litiga tion and \nthe conflict.  [ See Docket No. 141 at 2 n.1.]  Loop  argues that if Orrick’s representation is true, it \ncould not have been seeking the advice of internal counsel regarding a conflict that it did not know \nexisted.  This argument is not persuasive, since the communications at issue took place only after \nLoop’s counsel notified Orrick of this litigation and put it on notice of the potential conflict.  \nAgain, Loop  offers no evidence that Orrick  attorneys were aware of Gatti’s employment by both \nLoop and Almawave USA prior to February 27, 2015.  \nUNITEDSTATESDISTRICTCOURT\nN\nORTHERNDISTRICTOFCALIFORNIAIT IS SO ORDERED\nJudge Donna M.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit vacated and remanded a decision by the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB), which had previously ruled that certain claims of a patent held by Clouding Corp. were not unpatentable due to obviousness. The technology in question involves an AI-based system for diagnosing and solving computer system issues. The court found that the PTAB made errors by not properly considering the combination of prior-art references that EMC Corporation argued rendered the claims obvious.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the combination of prior art references, Barnett and Allen, renders the contested claims (particularly the step involving saving the state of the computer system when a solution cannot be determined) of Clouding Corp.'s patent obvious under 35 U.S.C. § 103.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court vacated the PTAB's decision, finding that the PTAB erred by not considering arguments related to how the Allen reference, in combination with Barnett, could render the claims obvious, especially with respect to the condition that a solution to a problem cannot be determined. The court remanded the case for the PTAB to address whether the combination suggests saving the state of the computer system.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine if you were trying to bake a cake following a recipe but wanted to see if combining recipes from two different cookbooks might work better. EMC said the combined recipes (patents) showed how to solve a problem in a computer system kind of like saving your cake if you mess up the steps. The court told the PTAB it didn't correctly consider whether EMC was right in how these two recipes could come together to fix the computer problem when a solution couldn’t be found, so they need to go back and check again.",

CLOUDING CORP . 2 \n______________________ \n \nBefore P ROST , Chief Judge, N EWMAN and DYK, Circuit \nJudges.  \nPROST , Chief Judge . \nAppellants EMC Corporation, EMC International \nU.S. Holdings, Inc., and VMware, Inc. ( collectively, \n“EMC”) appeal from a  final written decision of the U.S. \nPatent and Trademark Office’s Patent Trial and Appeal \nBoard (“Board”), holding  that Petitioner EMC had not \nshown tha t claims 6, 8, and 14 of U.S. Patent No. \n5,944,839 (“’839 patent”) are invalid .  Because the Board \nmade two errors that  caused it to not address the princi-\npal issue before it, w e vacate and remand.  \nI \nClouding Corp. (“Clouding”) is the assignee of the ’839 \npatent, which generally relates to “a computer utility that uses a set of sensors in combination with [a] case base to \ndiagnose and solve computer system problems.”  \n’839 patent col. 1  ll. 57–59.  The ’839 patent discloses  \nsensors that gather information about various aspects of \nthe computer system and store this information in a \nknowledge database  where an artificial intelligence  (“AI”)  \nengine  can access it .  Id.  at col.  3 ll. 35–38.  The \nknowledge database also contains cases, questions, and \nactions.  Id . at col.  3 ll. 46–62.  The cases describe pote n-\ntial computer problems and solutions.  Id.  at col.  3 ll. 47–\n48.  The questions are used to evaluate cases in order to \ndiagnose problems , while the actions describe steps that \ncan be taken to solve the diagnosed problems.  Id.  at col.  3 \nll. 48–50, 58 –63.   \nIf the sensors gather information that  indicates a \nproblem with the computer system, then the AI  engine is \nactivated.  Id.  at col.  4 ll. 43–45.  The AI engine runs the \nproblem through the knowledge database, which involves Case: 16-1999      Document: 43-2     Page: 2     Filed: 05/01/2017EMC CORPORATION  v. CLOUDING CORP . 3 \nevaluating a series of cases and questions.  Id.  at col.  4 \nll. 46–48.  If more data are  necessary to evaluate a case or \nquestion, the AI engine directs the appropriate sensor to \ngather the required data.  Id.  at col.  4 ll. 61–63.  In some \ninstances, after all possible data has been gathered, the \nAI engine will still not have a solution to the computer \nproblem .  Id.  at col.  4 l. 66–col. 5 l. 3.  If the AI engine \nfails to find a solution in the knowledge database, the \nsystem saves the state of the computer system and \nknowledge database to a location where a human compu t-\ner expert can  examine them .  Id.  at col.  5 ll. 3–6.   \nClaim 6 of the ’839 patent, the sole i ndependent claim \nat issue, recites:  \nA method of optimizing a computer system, the \nmethod comprising the steps of:  \n[1] detecting a problem in the computer sy s-\ntem; \n[2] activating an AI engine in response to the \nproblem detection;  \n[3] utilizing, by the AI eng ine, selected ones of \na plurality of sensors to gather information about the computer system;  \n[4] determining, by the AI engine, a likely s o-\nlution to the problem from the gathered i n-\nformation; and  \n[5] when a likely solution cannot be dete r-\nmined, saving a state of the computer system.  \nId. at col.  5 l. 58 –col. 6 l. 4 (emphasis added).  \nEMC petitioned for inter partes review of claims 1, 2, \n6, 8, 14, 15 , and 17 of the ’839 patent on three grounds .  \nRelevant here, EMC petitioned the Board to review \nwhether U.S. Patent No. 5,664,093 (“Barnett”) in view of \nU.S. Patent No. 5,581,664 (“Allen”)  render claims 6, 8 and Case: 16-1999      Document: 43-2     Page: 3     Filed: 05/01/2017          EMC CORPORATION  v. CLOUDING CORP . 4 \n14 obvious under 35 U.S.C. §  103.  Claims 8 and 14 d e-\npend from independent claim 6.   \nWith respect to step 5 of claim 6, which is the only \nclaim limitation at issue, EMC  argued in its Petition to \nthe Board that “[t]he combination of Barnett and Allen \n’664 teaches this  [limitation] .”  J.A.  115.  Specifically, \nEMC relied on Barnett for teaching the claimed “AI engine,” id. (quoting Barnett col. 2 ll.  4–9), and relied on \nAllen as teaching the entire  “when a likely solution ca n-\nnot be determined, saving a state of the computer system” limitation,  J.A. 115–16 (quoting  Allen col. 8  ll. 21–36).  \nCiting to its expert declarant , EMC argued that “[o]ne \nskilled  in the art would have understood Barnett’s dia g-\nnostic system, as modified by Allen ’664, would invoke a rule to save a state of the computer system when a likely \nsolution to the identified faults cannot be determined, per \nthe teachings of Allen ’664.”  J. A. 116 n.16.    \nThe Board determined that EMC had demonstrated \nthat there was a reasonable likelihood that it would \nprevail in demonstrating that claims 6, 8, and 14 (“the \ninstituted claims”) are unpatentable  under 35 U.S.C. \n§ 103 for obviousness over the combination of Barnett and \nAllen  and instituted the subject inter partes review on \nthat ground .  EMC Corp.  v. Clouding Corp. , No. IPR2014-\n01309, 2015 WL 496349, at *8 ( P.T.A.B. Feb. 4, 2015).   \nThe Board did n ot institute on  EMC’s  other asserted \ngrounds of unpatentability .  Id.  at *16.  \nDuring the IPR Oral Hearing, the Board sought clari-\nfication on how EMC was using the prior art references for its obviousness arguments.  In particular, the Board \nexplained that “ the confusion here is that by the way it \nwas presented that it looks like you’ re taking alternative \npositions on each of these limit ations, that Barnett has \nthem, Allen has them, and somehow, a combination occurs here. ”  J.A.  334– 35 (16:25 –17:5) .  EMC cla rified  \nthat it was generally relying on Barnett as the primary Case: 16-1999      Document: 43-2     Page: 4     Filed: 05/01/2017EMC CORPORATION  v. CLOUDING CORP . 5 \nreference and  on Allen as adding support to that refe r-\nence.  J.A.  335 ( 17:17 –19).  Throughout the proceedings, \nEMC made clear that , particularly  for the disputed lim i-\ntation,  it was relying on the combination of Allen and \nBarnett.   See, e.g. , J.A. 335 ( 16:10 –15), 341 ( 23:22 –24), \n344 ( 26:1– 19), 345 ( 27:3– 24), 350–51 (32:8–33:1), 351–53 \n(33:18 –35:19 ), 355 ( 37:12– 20).   \nEMC also made two narrow concessions during the \nproceedings with respect to the  disclosure of the prior art \nreferences.  First , EMC conceded that although “[Allen’]s \nsolution, using an AI engine in conjunction with a rules -\nbased engine, is broadly applicable to multiple types of \nproblems ,” J.A. 331 ( 13:20 –23), “Allen itself does not \ndescribe using the AI engine [for] a problem in the co m-\nputer system itself ,” id. (13:15– 17) (emphasis added) ; see \nalso J.A. 339 ( 21:15 –19), 344 (26:9– 19), 345 ( 27:16 –24).  \nSecond, EMC reiterated a  previous state ment  from its \nPetition and Reply  to the Board  that “Barnett . . . is silent \nas to what the computer would do if it can’t identify a \nlikely solution, if it doesn’t identify a likely solution.”  J.A. 336 ( 18:6–9); s ee also  J.A. 337 ( 19:9–19), 340 ( 22:6–8), \n341 ( 23:8–12).  Additionally, both parties confirmed that \nthe disputed issue before the Board was whether the \ncombination of Barnett and Allen teaches “ saving a state \nof the computer system .”  See J.A. 350– 51 (32:11 –33:1) \n(EMC) ; Oral Hearing  Tr. 63:18– 64:4, EMC  Corp.  v. Clou d-\ning Corp. , No. IPR2014 -01309 (Oct. 20, 2015) , Paper No. \n32 (Tr.) (Clouding) ; J.A. 368–71 (50:17 –53:15) ( Clouding ).    \nThe Board  ultimately issued its  Final Written Dec i-\nsion concluding that Petitioner EMC had not shown by a preponderance of the evidence that any of the instituted \nclaims  are unpatentable.   EMC Corp.  v. Clouding Corp. , \nIPR2014 -01309, 2016 WL 380499, at *7 (Jan. 29, 2016) \n(Final Written Decision).    \nThe Boar d correctly identified that step 5 was the sole  \nclaim limitation at issue .  In its analysis, the Board only Case: 16-1999      Document: 43-2     Page: 5     Filed: 05/01/2017          EMC CORPORATION  v. CLOUDING CORP . 6 \naddresse d the first half of this step.  R ead in the context \nof the whole claim, the Board understood the first half of \nstep 5  to have two parts: (1)  the condition in which “a \nlikely solution cannot be determined,” and (2) that the \n“likely solution” is “to a problem in the computer system.”  \nSee Final Written Decision at *7.   The Board first deter-\nmined that EMC had  not argued that Allen teaches or \nsugg ests the first half of step 5 .  Id. at *7.  T o the extent \nthat EMC had relied on Allen  for this half of step 5 , the \nBoard determined “that reliance was withdrawn at oral \nargument .”  Id. at *8.   \nNext, h aving removed Allen  from its consideration , \nthe Board turned to Barnett .  The Board examined  \nwhether EMC had proven by a preponderance of the \nevidence that Barnett teaches or suggests the same half of \nstep 5 .  Id. at *9–14.  The Board concluded that EMC had \nnot.  Id.  at *14.  Having determined that EMC had not \nrelied on Allen  to teach the first half of step 5, and that it \nhad also failed to prove by a preponderance of the ev i-\ndence that Barnett taught the same limitation , the Board \nconcluded that EMC had not shown by a preponderance of the evidence that any of the instituted claims  are u n-\npatentable.  Id.  at *15.  The Board made no findings as to \nwhether Allen, Barnett, or the combination of the two, teach es or suggest s the second half of step 5 : “saving a \nstate of the computer system.”    \nEMC timely appealed the Board’s  decision to this \ncourt.   We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \n§ 1295(a)(4)(A).   \nII \nThe Board made two errors  in its analysis .  First, the \nBoard incorrectly determined that EMC had not argued \nthat Allen teaches or suggests the condition “when a likely solution [ to a problem in the computer system] \ncannot be determined.”  Final Written Decision at *7.  \nSecond, the Board incorrectly found that, to the extent Case: 16-1999      Document: 43-2     Page: 6     Filed: 05/01/2017EMC CORPORATION  v. CLOUDING CORP . 7 \nEMC  did rely on Allen for teaching th is limitation , that \nreliance was withdrawn at oral argument.  Id.  at *8.     \nA \n With respect to the first error, because EMC explicitly \nargued in its Petition  that Allen, in combination with \nBarnett, teaches or suggests “when a likely solution [to a \nproblem in the computer system] cannot be determined, ” \nwe disagree with the Board that EMC did not provide any \nargument that Allen teaches or suggests this limitation.     \nEMC addressed the first part of this limitation —the \ncondition in which “a likely solution cannot be dete r-\nmined” —in the claim chart in its  Petition.  J.A.  115–16 \n(citing  Allen col. 8  ll. 21–36).  Specifically, EMC cited to \nAllen for the following: “[i]n the case- matching step 202 or \nin the best -case step 203, t he inference engine 111 may \ndetermine that there is no case 105 which is a good match for the case template 312.”  J.A.  115 (citing  Allen col. 8  ll. \n21–24).  Additionally, in discussing  the prior art, EMC  \nstated that Allen discloses “a computerized case -based \nreasoning system and inference engine that can be int e-\ngrated into a rule -based system so new cases (including \nstates of the computer system) are saved whenever faults are detected, but a likely solution is not readily apparent .”  \nPet. for Inter Partes Review at 8, EMC Corp.  v. Clouding \nCorp. , No. IPR2014- 01309 (Aug. 16, 2014), Paper No. 1  \n(emphasis adde d); see also  id. at 10.   \nWith respect to the second part of the limitation —\nwhether the “likely solution” is “to a problem in the com-puter system”—EMC relied on the combined teachings of \nAllen and Barnett and argued in its Petition that “[o]ne \nskilled in the art would have understood Barnett’s dia g-\nnostic system, as modified by Allen ’664, would invoke a \nrule to save a state of the computer system when a likely \nsolution to the identified faults cannot be determined, per \nthe teachings of Allen ’664 .”  J.A.  116 n.16 (emphasis \nadded).  Case: 16-1999      Document: 43-2     Page: 7     Filed: 05/01/2017          EMC CORPORATION  v. CLOUDING CORP . 8 \nIndeed , Clouding  conceded—citing to the same portion \nof the Allen specification that EMC cited to in its Pet i-\ntion—that Allen d iscloses the condition in which “a likely \nsolution cannot be determined.”  See J.A. 243–44 (“Allen \n’664 teaches that when a likely solution to a detected \nproblem is not apparent, a new case is created using an \nexisting case template and, optionally, user-prescribed \nactions.”  (citing Allen col. 8  ll. 22–30)), 158 (“Allen ’6 64 \ndescribes a case -based reasoning system in which an \ninference engine may create a new case when no good match for a situation exists in a case base.”  (citing Allen \ncol. 4  ll. 17–23)); see also  J.A. 368 ( 50:19– 23) (“So I think \nAllen does explain what to do when it doesn’ t find a \n[“]best case [”].  And so that correlate [s] w ith the idea that \nthere is no perhaps -likely solution available. ”).  Clouding \nalso conceded that , “in the event a likely solution to a \nproblem cannot be fou nd (such as described by Allen \n’664),” “ the combination of Barnett and Allen ’ 664 su g-\ngests”  taking some action ( albeit a different action  than \nEMC puts forward).   J.A. 250; s ee also  J.A. 369 ( 51:1– 18). \nThe Board concluded that EMC had not provided any \nargument regarding Allen’s teachings  based on EMC’s \npurported silence in response to Clouding’s arguments that “Barnett does not ‘teach or suggest any outcome \nwhen the system cannot determine a likely solution  to a \nfault’ and that this is ‘a situation that is not truly co n-\ntemplated by Barnett .’”  Final Written Decision  at *7 –8 \n(quoting  Patent Owner ’s Resp . at 6 –7, EMC Corp.  v. \nClouding Corp. , No. IPR2014- 01309 (May 4, 2015), Paper \nNo. 22 ).  The Board faulted EMC for not contend ing in its \nReply  that it instead relied on Allen as teaching or su g-\ngesting  this limitation.  Id. at *8 (citing Pet ’r’s Reply at 5 –\n6, EMC Corp.  v. Clouding Corp. , No. IPR2014 -01309 \n(Aug. 4, 2015), Paper No. 25).  But Clouding was not \narguing in isolatio n that Barnett does not teach or su g-\ngest “when a likely solution cannot be determined.”  \nRather, Clouding  pointed to Barnett’s silence  on this Case: 16-1999      Document: 43-2     Page: 8     Filed: 05/01/2017EMC CORPORATION  v. CLOUDING CORP . 9 \nlimitation  in support of its only argument against obv i-\nousness, which is  that “the proposed co mbination of \nBarnett and Allen ’664 would not yield a solution that \ninvolves saving the state of a computer system  as required \nby claim 6.”  J.A.  245 (emphasis added).  In fact, Clouding \nitself conceded , later in the same section of its Response , \nthat “a person of ordinary skill in the art would, . . .  when \ncontemplating the teachings of Barnett and Allen ’ 664, \nfollow the directions of Allen ’ 664,” J.A. 246, and \n“[f]ollowing the teachings of Allen ’664, . . .  would adopt \nthe strategy proposed by Allen ’664 when it comes to \ndealing with problems for which no likely solution exists in its case base.”  J.A.  247 (emphasis added).   Accordingly, \nClouding’s Response only argued that the strategy Allen \nproposes does not entail saving the state of a computer \nsystem , as the second half of step 5 of claim 6  requires .\n1  \nId.   \nBecause EMC had already made these arguments in \nits Petition and  Clouding did not dispute them , we dis a-\ngree with the Board that  EMC was required to  explicitly \nargue in its Reply to the Board that it was relying on  \nAllen  to teach or suggest  “when a likely solution [to a \nproblem in the computer system]  cannot be determined. ”  \nEven so, EMC did  provide support in its Reply for  its \nreliance  on Allen, in combination with Barnett, as teac h-\n                                            \n1 Clouding also stated during oral a rgument before \nthis court that the only limitation missing from the co m-\nbination of Barnett and Allen is “ saving a state of the \ncomputer system. ”  Oral Argument 14:47– 15:01, available \nat http://oralarguments.cafc.uscourts.gov/mp3/2016 -\n1999.mp3 ( THE COURT : “You admit that you can co m-\nbine the references.  What’s missing when you combine \nreferences as to step 5?”  CLOUDING: “There is nothing that sugg ests saving the state of a computer system in \nthat combination.”).  Case: 16-1999      Document: 43-2     Page: 9     Filed: 05/01/2017          EMC CORPORATION  v. CLOUDING CORP . 10 \ning or suggesting this limitation .  For example,  in its \nrelated discussion of “sav ing a state, ” EMC argued that  \n“one of ordinary skill in the art would understand that \nwhen the ‘customer problem’ of Allen ’664 is a faulty computer system, the attributes of the ‘attribute -value \npair data from the case template’ [i.e. the ‘facts about the problem’] are gleaned from Barnett’s computer system \nand describe the state of the computer system.”  J.A.  278.  \nIn sum, while we appreciate what may have led the \nBoard to conclude as it did,  given EMC’s arguments and \nthe nature of Clouding’s arguments and concessions, we  \nconclude that the Board erred in fin ding that EMC did not \nargue  that Allen teaches or suggests “when a likely sol u-\ntion [to a problem in a computer system] cannot be d e-\ntermine d.”   \nB \nThe Board also erred when it concluded that EMC \nwithdrew  any reliance on Allen for teaching the claimed , \n“when a likely solution [ to a prob lem in the computer \nsystem] cannot be determined .” \nThe Board cites to a number of instances during the \nOral Hearing where EMC “concede[d] that Allen ’664 \n‘does not specifically say anything about solving a co m-\nputer problem in the terms of diagnosing a computer \nsystem or a computer error in the way that Barnett \nteaches.’”  F inal Written Decision *8  (quoting  Oral Hear-\ning Tr. 21:15 –18); see also  id. at *8 –9 (citing Oral Hearing  \nTr. 26:3–6, 27:9– 11, 27:16– 20, 38:19 –22, 72:21– 25).  We \nagree with the Board that EMC conceded this specific point;  however, EMC’s concession was a narrow one.  \nEMC merely conceded that Allen is silent as to whether the “likely solution” in Allen is specifically “to a problem in the computer system.”  From this concession, it does \nnot follow, however,  that EMC withdr ew its reliance on \nAllen  altogether , alone or in combination with Barnett, \nfor teaching this claim limitation.   Case: 16-1999      Document: 43-2     Page: 10     Filed: 05/01/2017EMC CORPORATION  v. CLOUDING CORP . 11 \nFor example,  as evidence of EMC’s concession,  the \nBoard cited to the following response : \n[EMC] : Sure.  Allen itself does not describe using \nthe AI engine to detect or respond to a problem in \nthe computer system itself.  The example Allen gives -- the specific example is one of kind of com-\ning up with insurance rates or insurance quotes.  \nJ.A. 331 ( 13:15 –20); see also  Final Written Decision at *8 \n(citing Oral Hearing  Tr. 13:15– 17, 13:19 –20).  The re-\nmainder of EMC’s response , however, clarified  that EMC \nwas relying on the combined teachings of Allen and \nBarnett .  EMC continued its response  as follows: \nBut [Allen’] s solution, using an AI engine in co n-\njunction with a rules -based engine , is broadly a p-\nplicable to multiple types of problems.  And what Barnett teaches is specifically using a rules -based \nengine to detect and monitor problems in a com-\nputer system.  So the combination of Barnett and \nAllen together give you -- using a AI engine  in \nconjunction with a rules -based engine to detect \nand monitor and and [sic] repair problems in the \ncomputer system.   \nJ.A. 331–32 (13:20 –14:4).  Moreover, other statements by \nEMC  clarified that the combination of Allen and Barnett  \nteaches step 5 of claim 6 .  See, e.g., J.A. 343–344 ( 25:7–\n26:3) (“But the answer is we are relying on the combin a-\ntion of Barnett and Allen together. ”), 345 ( 27:21 –24) \n(“Allen is not limited to how its system is being used.  But \nin combination with Barnett, it would be used to solve a -- \nit is a method for managing faulty [computer system]”) . \nEMC also explained its arguments for a final time at \nthe close of the proceedi ngs.  For example, EMC stated: \n“in Figure 3 -A and 3 -B of the Allen patent where you can \nsee the problem[,] which in the context of Allen -- I \nkn[o]w[,] Judge Lee[,] is not limited [to] a computer Case: 16-1999      Document: 43-2     Page: 11     Filed: 05/01/2017          EMC CORPORATION  v. CLOUDING CORP . 12 \nproblem like the ’839, but when combined with Barnett \nwould be diagnosing a computer failure.”  Oral Hear-\ning Tr. 69:25 –70:5.   EMC restated its argument with \nrespect to the full  step 5 limitation  as follows:   \nthat is  disclosed in Allen where it shows the prob-\nlem, information about the problem is being put \ninto the problem template in the attributes value \npair; and that that problem template, including that attribute value pair, is being saved if there’s \nnot a best match, there’s not a likely solution that’s identified .  So the combination of Allen and Ba r-\nnett, when you apply Allen to diagnosing and \ntreating a faulty computer system, you’ve got a \ncomputer problem .  You’ve got an attribute value \npair which is the state of the computer system.   \nIt’s information reflecting that computer problem.  \nIt’s stored in the problem template, and Allen teaches that problem template is solved if there’s \nno best match, if there’s no case that has an action \nto be described to address that, that problem.  \nId. at 71:3– 19 (emphase s added).  \nAccordingly , while we agree with the Board that  EMC \nconceded that Allen is silent as to whether the “likely \nsolution” is “to a problem in the computer system,” EMC \ndid not withdraw its reliance on Allen .  EMC clearly \nrelied on Allen for teaching the condition in which “a \nlikely solution cannot be determined,” and it clearly relied  \non Allen in  combination with  Barnett for teaching that \nthe “likely solution” is “to a problem in the computer \nsystem.”  \nIII \nClouding admitted that there would have been mot i-\nvation to combine Barnett and Allen and Clouding’s only \nargument to the Board in support of nonobviousness was \nthat EMC’s  proposed combination of Barnett and Allen Case: 16-1999      Document: 43-2     Page: 12     Filed: 05/01/2017EMC CORPORATION  v. CLOUDING CORP . 13 \nwould not yield a solution that involves “ saving the state \nof a computer system ,” as the se cond half of claim step 5 \nrequires .  Because the Board erred by not considering \nAllen, however, it  never reached this question.  We co n-\nclude that EMC properly argued, and Clouding did not \ndispute, that the combination of Barnett and Allen teac h-\nes the condi tion, “when a likely solution [to a problem in \nthe computer system] cannot be determined.”  Thus, since \nthere is no claim of secondary considerations, the only \nquestion remaining for the Board i s whether Barnett and \nAllen, considered in combination, would suggest to a \nperson of ordinary skill in the art “saving a state of the \ncomputer system.”  We remand for the Board to answer \nthis question.    \nVACATED AND REMANDED  \nCOSTS  \nThe parties shall bear their own costs.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: The case revolves around two separate lawsuits, Nazemian v. NVIDIA Inc. and Dubus v. NVIDIA Inc., in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. The court issued a protective order to manage the confidentiality of discovery material, particularly sensitive information related to NVIDIA's proprietary technology, which includes AI and machine learning components such as source code, non-public machine learning models, and algorithm specifications. The order outlines how such information can be shared to protect trade secrets while allowing for the litigation process to unfold.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: The primary legal issue concerns the protection of sensitive proprietary information during litigation, specifically how confidential AI and machine learning-related data and source code should be controlled and shared among parties involved in the lawsuits.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court ordered the implementation of a protective order that provides a framework for the deposition, storage, and usage of confidential information, particularly data related to AI and machine learning models. It details the procedures for designating information as confidential or highly confidential, outlines the access limitations to the protected material, and includes a prosecution bar to limit who can engage in related patent activities after accessing the materials.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine you have a secret formula for your lemonade stand that makes it super special. Now, you’re in a legal squabble with another stand, and you need to share your lemonade recipe to prove your side in court. This case is about the rules the court set up to keep your special recipe safe while the lawyers look into it. They have strict rules about who can see the recipe, how they should look at it, and making sure they don’t share it with anyone else—like selling it to other lemonade stands—so your secret stays mostly safe even though you have to share it a bit during the case.",

DURATION  \nEven after final disposition of this litigation, the confidentiality obligations imposed by this \nOrder shall remain in effect until a Designating Party agrees otherwise in writing or a court order \notherwise directs. Final disposition shall be deemed to be the later of (1) dismissal of all claims \nand defenses in this action, with or without prejudice; and (2) final judgment herein after the \ncompletion and exhaustion of all appeals, rehearings, remands, trials, or reviews of this action, \nincluding the time li mits for filing any motions or applications for extension of time pursuant to \napplicable law.  \n4. DESIGNATING PROTECTED MATERIAL  \n5.1 Exercise of Restraint and Care in Designating Material for Protection .  \nEach Party or Non -Party that designates information or items for protection under this \nOrder must take care to limit any such designation to specific material that qualifies under the \nappropriate standards. To the extent it is practical to do so, the Desig nating Party must designate \nfor protection only those parts of material, documents, items, or oral or written communications \nthat qualify – so that other portions of the material, documents, items, or communications for \nwhich protection is not warranted ar e not swept unjustifiably within the ambit of this Order.  \nMass, indiscriminate, or routinized designations are prohibited. Designations that are \nshown to be clearly unjustified or that have been made for an improper purpose (e.g., to \nunnecessarily encumber or retard the case development process or to impose unnec essary \nexpenses and burdens on other parties) expose the Designating Party to sanctions.  \nIf it comes to a Designating Party ’s attention that information or items that it designated \nfor protection do not qualify for protection at all or do not qualify for the level of protection \ninitially asserted, that Designating Party must promptly notify all other parties that it is \nwithdraw ing the mistaken designation.  \n5.2 Manner and Timing of Designations . Except as otherwise provided in this Order \n(see, e.g., second paragraph of section 5.2(a) below), or as otherwise stipulated or ordered, \nDisclosure or Discovery Material that qualifies for protection under this Order must be clearly so \ndesignated before the material is disclosed or produced.  Case 4:24-cv-02655-JST     Document 75     Filed 01/08/25     Page 5 of 21 \n6 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  Designation in conformity with this Order requires:  \n(a) for information in documentary form  (e.g., paper or electronic documents, but \nexcluding transcripts of depositions or other pretrial or trial proceedings), that the Producing Party \naffix the legend “CONFIDENTIAL ” or “HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL – ATTORNEYS ’ EYES \nONLY ” or “HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL – SOURCE CODE ” to each page that contains protected \nmaterial. If only a portion or portions of the material on a page qualifies for protection, the \nProducing Party also must clearly identify the protected portion(s) (e.g., by making appropriate \nmarkings in the m argins) and must specify, for each portion, the level of protection being asserted.  \nA Party or Non -Party that makes original documents or materials available for inspection \nneed not designate them for protection until after the inspecting Party has indicated which material \nit would like copied and produced. During the inspection and befor e the designation, all of the \nmaterial made available for inspection shall be deemed “HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL – \nATTORNEYS ’ EYES ONLY. ” After the inspecting Party has identified the documents it wants \ncopied and produced, the Producing Party must determine whic h documents, or portions thereof, \nqualify for protection under this Order. Then, before producing the specified documents, the \nProducing Party must affix the appropriate legend ( “CONFIDENTIAL ” or “HIGHLY \nCONFIDENTIAL – ATTORNEYS ’ EYES ONLY ” or “HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL – SOURCE \nCODE) to each page that contains Protected Material. If only a portion or portions of the material \non a page qualifies for protection, the Producing Party also must clearly identify the protected \nportion(s) (e.g., by making app ropriate ma rkings in the margins) and must specify, for each \nportion, the level of protection being asserted.  \n(b) for testimony given in deposition or in other pretrial or trial proceedings , that the \nDesignating Party identify on the record, before the close of the deposition, hearing, or other \nproceeding, all protected testimony and specify the level of protection being asserted. When it is \nimpractical to identify separately each portion of  testimony that is entitled to protection and it \nappears that substantial portions of the testimony may qualify for protection, the Designating Party \nmay invoke on the record (b efore the deposition, hearing, or other proceeding is concluded) a right \nto have up to 21 days to identify the specific portions of the testimony as to which protection is Case 4:24-cv-02655-JST     Document 75     Filed 01/08/25     Page 6 of 21 \n7 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  sought and to specify the level of protection being asserted. Only those portions of the testimony \nthat are appropriately designated for protection within the 21 days shall be covered by the \nprovisions of this Stipulated Protective Order.  Alternatively, a Designating Party may specify, at \nthe deposition or up to 21 days afterwards if that period is properly invoked, that the entire \ntranscript shall be treated as “CONFIDENTIAL ” or “HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL – \nATTORNEYS ’ EYES ONLY. ” \nParties shall give the other parties notice if they reasonably expect a deposition, hearing or \nother proceeding to include Protected Material so that the other parties can ensure that only \nauthorized individuals who have signed the “Acknowledgment and Agreement to Be Bound ” \n(Exhibit A) are present at those proceedings.  The use of a document as an exhibit at a deposition \nshall not in any way affect its designation as “CONFIDENTIAL ” or “HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL \n– ATTORNEYS ’ EYES ONLY. ” \nTranscripts containing Protected Material shall have an obvious legend on the title page \nthat the transcript contains Protected Material, and the title page shall be followed by a list of all \npages (including line numbers as appropriate) that have been des ignated as Protected Material and \nthe level of protection being asserted by the Designating Party. The Designating Party shall inform \nthe court reporter of these requirements. Any transcript that is prepared before the expiration of a \n21-day period for des ignation shall be treated during that period as if it had been designated \n“HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL – ATTORNEYS ’ EYES ONLY ” in its entirety unless otherwise \nagreed. After the expiration of that period, the transcript shall be treated only as actually \ndesignated.  \n(c) for information produced in some form other than documentary and for any other \ntangible items , that the Producing Party affix in a prominent place on the exterior of the container \nor containers in which the information or item is stored the legend “CONFIDENTIAL ” or \n“HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL – ATTORNEYS ’ EYES ONLY ” or “HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL – \nSOURCE CODE. ” If only a portion or portions of the information or item warrant protection, the \nProducing Party, to the extent practicable, shall identify the protected por tion(s) and specify the \nlevel of protection being asserted.  Case 4:24-cv-02655-JST     Document 75     Filed 01/08/25     Page 7 of 21 \n8 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  5.3 Inadvertent Failures to Designate . If timely corrected, an inadvertent failure to \ndesignate qualified information or items does not, standing alone, waive the Designating Party ’s \nright to secure protection under this Order for such material. Upon timely correction of a \ndesignation, the Receiving Party must make reasonable efforts to assure that the material is treated \nin accordance with the provisions of this Order.  \n5. CHALLENGING CONFIDENTIALITY DESIGNATIONS  \n6.1 Timing of Challenges . Any Party or Non -Party may challenge a designation of \nconfidentiality at any time. Unless a prompt challenge to a Designating Party ’s confidentiality \ndesignation is necessary to avoid foreseeable, substantial unfairness, unnecessary economic \nburdens, or a significant disruption or delay of the litigation, a Party does not waive its right to \nchallenge a confidentiality designation by el ecting not to mount a challenge promptly after the \noriginal designation is disclosed.  \n6.2 Meet and Confer . The Challenging Party shall initiate the dispute resolution \nprocess by providing written notice of each designation it is challenging and describing the basis \nfor each challenge. To avoid ambiguity as to whether a challenge has been made, the written \nnotice must recite that the challenge to confidentiality is being made in accordance with this \nspecific paragraph of the Protective Order. The parties shall attempt to resolve each challenge in \ngood faith and must begin the process by confe rring directly (in voice to voice dialogue; other \nforms of communication are not sufficient) within 14 days of the date of service of notice. In \nconferring, the Challenging Party must explain the basis for its belief that the confidentiality \ndesignation wa s not proper and must give the Designating Party an opportunity to review the \ndesignated material, to reconsider the circumstances, and, if no change in designation is offered, to \nexplain the basis for the chosen designation. A Challenging Party may procee d to the next stage of \nthe challenge process only if it has engaged in this meet and confer process first or establishes that \nthe Designating Party is unwilling to participate in the meet and confer process in a timely \nmanner.  \n6.3 Judicial Intervention . If the Parties cannot resolve a challenge without Court \nintervention, the Designating Party shall file and serve a motion to retain confidentiality under Case 4:24-cv-02655-JST     Document 75     Filed 01/08/25     Page 8 of 21 \n9 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  Civil Local Rule 7 (and in compliance with Civil Local Rule 79 -5, if applicable) within 21 days of \nthe initial notice of challenge or within 14 days of the parties agreeing that the meet and confer \nprocess will not resolve their dispute, whichever is earli er. Each such motion must be \naccompanied by a competent declaration affirming that the movant has complied with the meet \nand confer requirements imposed in the preceding paragraph. Failure by the Designating Party to \nmake such a motion including the requir ed declaration within 21 days (or 14 days, if applicable) \nshall automatically waive the confidentiality designation for each challenged designation. In \naddition, the Challenging Party may file a motion challenging a confidentiality designation at any \ntime if there is good cause for doing so, including a challenge to the designation of a deposition \ntranscript or any portions thereof. Any motion brought pursuant to this provision must be \naccompanied by a competent declaration affirming that the movant has com plied with the meet \nand confer requirements imposed by the preceding paragraph.  \nThe burden of persuasion in any such challenge proceeding shall be on the Designating \nParty. Frivolous challenges and those made for an improper purpose (e.g., to harass or impose \nunnecessary expenses and burdens on other parties) may expose the Challengin g Party to \nsanctions. Unless the Designating Party has waived the confidentiality designation by failing to \nfile a motion to retain confidentiality as described above, all parties shall continue to afford the \nmaterial in question the level of protection to  which it is entitled under the Producing Party ’s \ndesignation until the Court rules on the challenge.  \n6.

UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURE OF PROTECTED MATERIAL  \nIf a Receiving Party learns that, by inadvertence or otherwise, it has disclosed Protected \nMaterial to any person or in any circumstance not authorized under this Stipulated Protective \nOrder, the Receiving Party must immediately (a) notify in writing the D esignating Party of the \nunauthorized disclosures, (b) use its best efforts to retrieve all unauthorized copies of the Protected \nMaterial, (c) inform the person or persons to whom unauthorized disclosures were made of all the \nterms of this Order, and (d) re quest such person or persons to execute the “Acknowledgment and \nAgreement to Be Bound ” that is attached hereto as Exhibit A.  \n12. INADVERTENT PRODUCTION OF PRIVILEGED OR OTHERWISE \nPROTECTED MATERIAL  \nWhen a Producing Party gives notice to Receiving Parties that certain inadvertently \nproduced material is subject to a claim of privilege or other protection, the obligations of the \nReceiving Parties are those set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26 (b)(5)(B). This \nprovision is not intended to modify whatever procedure may be established in an e -discovery order \nthat provides for production without prior privilege review. Pursuant to agreement of the parties, \nthe inadvertent production of material subj ect to a claim of privilege or other protection shall not \nconstitute a waiver of that privilege or other protection under Federal Rule of Evidence  502(d).  \n13. MISCELLANEOUS  \n14.1 Right to Further Relief . Nothing in this Order abridges the right of any person to \nseek its modification by the Court in the future.  \n14.2 Right to Assert Other Objections . By stipulating to the entry of this Protective \nOrder no Party waives any right it otherwise would have to object to disclosing or producing any \ninformation or item on any ground not addressed in this Stipulated Protective Order.

Protected Material may only be filed \nunder seal pursuant to a court order authorizing the sealing of the specific Protected Material at \nissue. Pursuant to Civil Local Rule 79 -5, a sealing order will issue only upon a request \nestablishing that the Protected Material at issue is privileged, protectable as a trade secret, or \notherwise entitled to protection under the law.

    "summary": "1. Summary: In the case of Admiin Inc. d/b/a Paro Inc. v. Luke Kohan and FirmKey Solutions LLC, Paro sought a temporary restraining order (TRO) against its former employee Kohan and his new company, FirmKey, alleging breach of a non-compete agreement and potential misappropriation of trade secrets. Paro, being an AI-powered finance and accounting solutions marketplace, claimed Kohan used confidential information unfairly; however, the Court denied the TRO, finding that Paro did not sufficiently demonstrate a likelihood of success on the merits.\n\n2. Key Legal Issue: Whether Paro is entitled to a temporary restraining order based on allegations that Kohan breached a non-compete agreement and that Paro's trade secrets were at risk of misappropriation through inevitable disclosure.\n\n3. Court's Holding: The Court denied the TRO request, finding that Paro did not adequately demonstrate a likelihood of success on its claims, including breach of the non-compete agreement and trade secrets misappropriation via inevitable disclosure. The Court highlighted issues with the scope of the non-compete as potentially overbroad and noted a lack of actual misappropriation evidence.\n\n4. ELI5 Explanation: Paro, which uses AI to help businesses with their finances, was afraid that one of its former employees, who started a new competing company, might use the company's special secrets. They asked the court to quickly stop him, hoping to prove later that rules were broken. The court said no because Paro didn't show enough proof that they would definitely win, as they couldn't show the employee had actually taken or used their secrets.",

Valderrama  \n \nMEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER  \n \nPlaintiff Admiin Inc. d/b/a Paro Inc. (Paro) moves this Court to enter a n \nemergency temporary  restraining  order (TRO) against its former employee, \nDefendant Luke Kohan (Kohan) and the  company  he co -founded , Defendant FirmKey \nSolutions LLC (FirmKey), pursuant to Fed eral Rule of  Civil Procedure  65(b). For the \nreasons stated below, the Court denies Paro’s  request for an emergency  temporary  \nrestraining  order. \nBackground  \n Paro , a Delaware Corporation with its principal place of business in Chicago, \nIllinois,  is “an artificial intelligence -powered marketplace”  providing “various finance \nand accounting solutions to businesses through a combination of expert fractional \ntalent, data -driven tools and guiding insight s.” R. 1,  Compl. ¶¶ 2, 10.1 Through its \n“AI-powered platform, Paro matches clients with the best -fit expert to solve problems \n \n1Citations to the docket are indicated by “R.” followed by the docket number and, where \nnecessary, a page or paragraph citation.

Paro’s carefully curated expert community provides a range of \nfinancial services to clients, from basic bookkee ping and accounting to highly \nspecialized corporate development and strategic advisory services.”  Id. ¶ 10. Paro \nassigns employees to different client accounts. Id. ¶ 11. Paro has devoted substantial \nmoney, time, and resources in developing its clients, an d maintains their contact \ninformation, names of client contacts, types of services purchased throughout the \nclient relationship, and fee information. Id. ¶ 13. Paro also has a roster of experts. Id. \n¶ 16. Paro maintains this information is kept confidentially, along with other \nconfidential information as defined in the Employment Agreement (Confidential \nInformation) . Id. To safeguard this information , Paro protects it with computer \npasswords, limits em ployee access, restricts access to non -employees, requires certain \nemployees (like Kohan ) to sign Non- Competition, Non -Solicitation, Non -Disclosure \nand Invention Assignment Agreements, which, among other things, prohibit the \ndownload, transfer, or duplicat ion of Confidential Information, and requires Paro \nemployees to return all Confidential Information when they leave employment. Id. \n¶ 17.  \nKohan, a citizen of New York,  is a former Paro Senior Account Executive. \nCompl. ¶ 18. As a Senior Account Executive, Kohan was responsible for converting \nleads from Paro’s marketing team into long -term clients, managing full sales cycle \nfrom new leads to closing deals, building relationships with clients, and supporting \nParo team members. Id. In this role, he had direct client contact and expert contact, \nand knowledge of Paro’s Confidential Information. Id. ¶ 19. At the hearing  held on Case: 1:23-cv-04430 Document #: 17 Filed: 07/19/23 Page 2 of 30 PageID #:<pageID> \n 3 July 17, 2023 (TRO hearing) , Paro described Kohan’s employment as being \nresponsible for the “white label client suite” at Paro, which is how Paro describes their \nbiggest and most valuable clients. Kohan voluntarily resigned his employment with \nParo in March 2023, and co -founded FirmKey in April 2023. Id.  ¶¶ 28– 29. FirmKey \nis engaged in the business of providing  various finance and accounting solutions to \nbusinesses. Id. ¶ 4. FirmKey is a Minnesota limited liability corporation. Id.  \nWhen he began his employment  with Paro on October 3, 2020, Kohan  signed a  \nNon- Competition, Non -Solicitation, Non -Disclosure and Invention Assignment \nAgreement (Employment Agreement ). Compl. ¶ 20; R. 1 -1, Exh. A  (Agmt.) . In the \nEmployment Agreement , Kohan agreed not to disclose, use, or misappropriate Paro’s \nConfidential Informa tion. Id. ¶ 21. The Employment Agreement  also provided that \nKohan could not, for a period of 12 months after leaving his employment  (the \nRestricted Period) , (1) compete directly or indirectly with Paro, (2) solicit any of Paro’s \nclients and employees, or (3) interfere with Paro’s client and employee relationships. \nId. ¶ 22. The non-competition restriction is contained in Section 4 of the Employment \nAgreement (Non -Compete) and provides : \nI agree that during the period of my  employment with  the Company  I will not \nengage  in any other employment, occupation  or consulting  arrangement  \nanywhere  in the world,  nor will I engage  in any other activities  that conflict  \nwith  my obligations  to the Company.  During  the Restricted Period (as defined \nbelow), I will not, anywhere  in the Restricted Territory  (as defined  below), \nwithout  the Company’s  prior written  consent,  directly  or indirectly,  alone  or \nas a partner,  member, manager,  owner,  joint  venturer,  officer,  director,  \nemployee, consultant,  agent,  contractor,  stockholder or in any other capacity  \nof any company  or entity,  engage  in the Business,  have  any financial interest \nin any company  or entity  engaging  in the Business or make  any loans  to \nany company  or entity  engaging  in the Business.  For purposes  of this \nAgreement, the term  “Business” means  (a) the provision  of outsourced Case: 1:23-cv-04430 Document #: 17 Filed: 07/19/23 Page 3 of 30 PageID #:<pageID> \n 4 financial services,  including  bookkeeping and accounting,  financial analysis  \nand CFO  strategy  services,  or (b) the provision,  development, marketing,  \nsale or maintenance  of products  or services  which  are substantially  \nsimilar  to those developed, marketed,  distributed,  sold,  maintained  or \notherwise provided by, or actively  planned  to be developed, marketed,  \ndistributed,  sold,  maintained  or otherwise provided by the Company  during  the \nterm  of my employment with  the Company.  Notwithstanding  the foregoing, \nmy ownership  of not more  than one percent  (1%) of the outstanding  shares  of \nstock  of any corporation  having  a class  of securities  actively  traded on a \nnational  securities  exchange  or on the NASDAQ  Stock Market  shall not be \ndeemed, in and of itself,  to violate  the provisions  of this Section  4. I agree  \nand acknowledge  that the restrictions  in this Section 4 shall apply  \nthroughout  the Restricted Territory,  and that the geographic  scope  of the \nrestriction  is necessary  and reasonable  because  the Company  conducts  \nbusiness at least  nationally,  and the restriction  is necessary  to protect  the \nlegitimate  business  interests of the Company.  I further  agree  and \nacknowledge  that the restrictions in this Section 4  shall apply to self -\nemployment by me.  \n \nAgmt.  ¶ 4.  \n \nThe Non-C ompete not only includes being an employee of a competitor, but also \nan owner of a competitor.  Agmt. ¶ 4.  Based on Paro’s TRO Motion, and the \nconfirmation of counsel at the TRO hearing , Paro is only alleging breach of the Non-\nCompete restrictive covenant, and no other provisions of the Employment Agreem ent. \nThe “Restricted Territory” for purposes of the  Non-Compete includes “the \nUnited States and each other country, province, state, city, or other political \nsubdivision in which the Company carries on, had carried on the Business during the \nterm of [his] employment and/or the Restricted Period.” Agmt.  ¶ 8(f).  \n The Employment Agreement also includes a modification or “blue -pencil” \nprovision which states:  \nIf any provision or term in Sections 2, 4, and/or 7 of this Agreement is declared \ninvalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, the invalid and \nunenforceable portion shall be reformed to the maximum time, geographic Case: 1:23-cv-04430 Document #: 17 Filed: 07/19/23 Page 4 of 30 PageID #:<pageID> \n 5 scope, activity -related restrictions and/or limitations permitted by applicable \nlaw, so as to be valid and enforceab le. \n \nAgmt. ¶ 8(d). \nIn terms of bad acts by Kohan and FirmKey, Paro alleges as follows:  \n(1) Kohan founded and began working for FirmKey, a direct competitor to \nParo, in April 2023, in violation of the  Non-Compete (Compl. ¶ ¶ 29–30); \n \n(2) Kohan “viewed Paro as a trai ning ground, and he is now using, or will use, \nConfidential Information he learned at Paro” in violation of his Non -\nCompete (Compl. ¶ 30); \n  \n(3) Kohan “will not be able to compartmentalize his knowledge of Paro’s \nConfidential Information while operating FirmKe y” and will “consciously \nor unconsciously, inevitably draw upon his vast and intimate knowledge of \nParo’s Confidential Information” (Compl. ¶ 31);  \n \n(4) Kohan’s knowledge of Paro’s Confidential Information will assist him in \nperforming his responsibilities at FirmKey, and in targeting Paro’s clients \nand experts , and Kohan “cannot help but draw upon this knowledge in \nperforming his duties for FirmKey”  (Compl. ¶ 32);  and \n \n(5) Kohan’s “inevitable disclosure and use of Paro’s Confidential Information \nwill allow FirmKey to gain a substantial unfair advantage with Paro” \n(Compl. ¶ 34).  \n \nParo also generally alleges that Kohan “has threatened to misappropriate or \nwill inevitably misappropriate trade secrets and confidential information maintained \nby Paro in this district .” Compl. ¶ 8. Regarding FirmKey, Paro alleges that FirmKey \ndoes business in this D istrict, has also “threatened to misappropriate or will \ninevitably misappropriate trade secrets and confidential information maintained by  \nParo in this district.” Id. ¶ 9. \nParo attaches information from FirmKey’s website, as well as Kohan’s \nLinkedIn page,  to its Verified Complaint . In those attachments, FirmKey is described Case: 1:23-cv-04430 Document #: 17 Filed: 07/19/23 Page 5 of 30 PageID #:<pageID> \n 6 as “targeting industries, services, and nuanced projects that align with our partners’ \nrespective backgrounds, interests, and bandwidth.” R. 1 -3, Kohan LinkedIn Post.  \nNow Paro brings this lawsuit , through a Verified Complaint for Injunctive and \nOther Relief,  assert ing the following claims  against Kohan and FirmKey : (1) Breach \nof the Employment Agreement (Kohan) (Count I); (2) Violation of the Illinois Trade \nSecrets Act (Kohan and FirmKey) (Count II); (3) Violation of the Defend Trade \nSecrets Act (Kohan and FirmKey) (Count III); and (4) Tortious Interference with \nContract (FirmKey) (Count IV).  \nParo filed its Verified Complaint on July 10, 2023. The same day , Paro filed an \nEmergency Rule 65 Motion for Temporary Restraining Order and Preliminary \nInjunction ( TRO Motion), R. 7, Mot. TRO , and Memorandum of Law in support o f its \nMotion. R. 8, Memo.  TRO.  Through its TRO  Motion, Paro seeks to: (i) enjoin Kohan \nfrom working for FirmKey, and FirmKey from employing Kohan, (ii) enjoin Kohan \nand FirmKey from soliciting Paro’s clients or experts, (iii) enjoin Kohan and FirmKey \nfrom misappropriating Paro’s Confidential Information and trade secret information, \n(iv) enjoin FirmKey from interfering with Kohan’s contractual obligations to Paro, (v) \nrequire Kohan and FirmKey to return Paro’s Confidential Information and trade \nsecret information.  Mot. TRO, Proposed Order.  Paro also seeks its attorneys’ fees and \ncosts. Id. Paro also filed a Motion for Expedited Discovery. R. 9, Mot. Discovery.  \nKohan and FirmKey filed a response opposing the TRO and preliminary \ninjunction, supported by Kohan’s Declaration. R. 13, Resp.; R. 13 -1, Decl. Kohan.  Case: 1:23-cv-04430 Document #: 17 Filed: 07/19/23 Page 6 of 30 PageID #:<pageID> \n 7 The Court heard oral argument on the TRO2 on July 17, 2023. R. 15.  \nLegal Standard  \nA TRO is “an extraordinary and drastic remedy, one that should not be granted \nunless the movant, by a clear showing, carries the burden of persuasion.”  See \nGoodman v. Ill. Dep ’t of Fin. & Prof’ l Regulation , 430 F.3d 432, 437 (7th Cir.  2005) \n(quoting Mazurek v. Armstrong , 520 U.S. 968, 972 (1997)).  \nThe standard for obtaining a TRO is the same as that is required to issue a \npreliminary injunction. See Merritte v. Kessel , 561 Fed. Appx. 546, 548 (7th Cir.  2014). \nTo obtain a TRO, a movant must demonstrate: (1) a lik elihood of success on the \nmerits; (2) that it has no adequate remedy at law; and (3) that it will suffer \nirreparable harm if the relief is not granted. See Right Field Rooftops, LLC , 80 F.  \nSupp.  3d at 832 (citing Smith v. Executive Dir. Of Ind. War. Mem’ls Comm’n , 742 F. \n3d 282, 286 (7th Cir. 2014)).  \nIf the moving party meets this three -element threshold showing, the court \n“must weigh the harm that the plaintiff will suffer absent an injunction against the \nharm to the defendant from an injunction[.] ” GEFT Outdoors, LLC v. City of \nWestfield , 922 F.3d 357, 364 (7th Cir. 2019) (quoting Planned Parenthood, of Ind. & \nKy., Inc. v. Comm’r of Ind. State Dep’t of Health , 896 F.3d 809, 816 (7th Cir. 2018)). \n“Specifically, the court weighs the irreparable harm that th e moving party would \nendure without the protection of the preliminary injunction against any irreparable \n \n2The Court will schedule a preliminary hearing, and rule on the preliminary injunction once \nit receives the full presentation of facts and law . See Right Fi eld Rooftops, LLC v. Chicago \nBaseball Holdings, LLC , 80 F.  Supp.  3d 829, 832 (N.D.  Ill. 2015) . Case: 1:23-cv-04430 Document #: 17 Filed: 07/19/23 Page 7 of 30 PageID #:<pageID> \n 8 harm the nonmoving party would suffer if the court were to grant the requested \nrelief.” Girl Scouts of Manitou Council, Inc. v. Girl Scouts of the U.S.A., Inc. , 549 F.3d \n1079, 1086 (7th Cir. 2008) (citing Abbott Labs. v Mead Johnson & Co. , 971 F.2d 6, \n11–12 (7th Cir. 1992)).  \n The Seventh Circuit has described this balancing test as a “sliding scale”: “if \na plaintiff is more likely to win, the balance of harms can weigh less heavily in its \nfavor, but the less likely a plaintiff is to win[,] the more that balance would need to \nweigh in its favor.” GEFT Outdoors , 992 F.3d at 364 (citing Planned Parenthood , 896 \nF.3d at 816). Finally, in balancing the harms, the court must consider the interests \nof non -parties in granting or denying the requested relief. Ty, Inc., v. Jones Grp., Inc. , \n237 F.3d 891, 895 (7th Cir. 2001).  \n In resolving a motion for TRO, the Court reviews the record from a “neutral \nand objective viewpoint” without accepting Paro’s allegations as true, nor drawing \nreasonable inferences in Paro’s favor.  Doe v. Uni versity of Chicago , 2022 WL \n16744310, at *2 (N.D. Ill. Nov. 7, 2022) (citing  Doe v. Univ. of S. Indiana , 43 F.4th \n784, 791 (7th Cir. 2022)). The Court must “make factual determinations on the basis \nof a fair interpretation of the evidence before the court”  at this stage. Darryl H. v. \nColer, 801 F.2d 893, 898 (7th Cir. 1986). However , the findings are only preliminary, \nand “do not bind the district court as the case progresses.” Mich. v. U.S. Army Corps \nof Eng ’rs, 667 F.3d 765, 782 (7th Cir. 2011).  Case: 1:23-cv-04430 Document #: 17 Filed: 07/19/23 Page 8 of 30 PageID #:<pageID> \n 9 Analysis  \nI. Choice of Law  \nBefore addressing whether Paro has met its burden for a temporary \nrestraining order, the Court must determine what law governs.  \n The Employment Agreement contains a choice of law provision specifying that \nIllinois law applies to disputes arising out of the Agreement. Agmt. ¶ 11(a).  \nParagraph 11(a) of the Employment Agreement specifically states:  \nThis Agreement will be governed by the laws of the State of Illinois. I hereby \nexpressly consent to the personal jurisdiction of the state and federal courts \nlocated in Chicago, Illinois for any lawsuit arising from or relating to this \nAgreement, and agree that such courts shall be the sole and exclusive venue \nfor any such lawsuits (excepts with respect to post -judgment enforcement \nproceedings) filed by either party, in regard to claims or actions arising from \nor relating to this Agreement; provided, however, that nothing in this Section \n11(a) shall restrict the Company from bringing a lawsuit in another venue to \nthe extent the Company is also bringing a lawsuit against a third party who is \nnot subject to jurisdiction in Chicago, Illinois.  \n \nAgmt. ¶  11(a).  \n \nBased upon the briefs and the representations of the parties at the TRO \nhearing, all parties agree that Illinois law applies to the state law claims alleged by \nParo.3 Neither Paro nor Kohan argue that any other law applies.  \n The law is clear that where a valid contract has been formed, a court should \nenforce the choice of law provision contained within that contract unless it violates \nthe forum state’s public policy, and the forum state has a materially greater interest \nin the litigation than the chosen state. See, e.g., Demitropoulos v. Bank One \n \n3At the TRO hearing, the parties both took the position that even if New York applied to the \nstate law claims, the Court would reach the same result.  Case: 1:23-cv-04430 Document #: 17 Filed: 07/19/23 Page 9 of 30 PageID #:<pageID> \n 10 Milwaukee, N.A. , 915 F. Supp. 1399, 1413 (N.D. Ill. 1996) (following § 187 of the \nRestatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws where “as here, the parties to a contract \nhave included an express choice of law provision in their contract”). Further, a court \nwill only overrule a choice of law contained in a contract if “(1) the chosen state has \nno substantial relationship to the parties or the transaction and there is no other \nreasonable basis for the parties’ choice, or (2) its application would be contrary to a \nfundamental policy of a state which has a materially greater interest than the chosen \nstate in the determination of the particular issue.” Old Republic Ins. Co. v. Ace \nProperty and Cas. Ins. Co. , 906 N.E. 2d 630, 636 (Ill. App. Ct.  2009) (clean ed up).4 \nHere, the Court finds Paro, as a business headquartered in Illinois, has made \na sufficient showing that Illinois has a substantial relationship to the parties and the \ndispute. See Aon Risk Services Companies, Inc. v. Alliant Insurance Services, I nc., 415 \nF. Supp.  3d 843, 848 (N.D. Ill. 2019) (applying Illinois law to restrictive covenant \ndispute involving an employment agreement with a choice of law provision specifying \nIllinois).  \nThe Court having determined that Illinois law governs  this dispute, now turns \nto whether Paro has met its burden for the issuance of a TRO.  \nII. TRO Factors   \nThe Court begins with the likelihood of success . Paro insists that it has shown \na likelihood of success on the merits for all of its claims. For the reason s that follow, \n \n4This Opinion uses (cleaned up) to indicate that internal quotation marks, alterations, and \ncitations have  been omitted from quotations. See  Jack Metzler, Cleaning Up Quotations, 18 \nJournal of Appellate Practice and Process 143 (2017).  Case: 1:23-cv-04430 Document #: 17 Filed: 07/19/23 Page 10 of 30 PageID #:<pageID> \n 11 the Court finds that Paro has not demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits \nof its claims.  \na. Likelihood of Success  \ni. Breach of Contract  (Count I)  \nCount I of the Verified Complaint assert s a claim for breach of the Non-\nCompete restrictive covenant  contained in the Employment Agreement. Memo. TRO \nat 3–4. As stated above, a t the TRO hearing, Paro confirmed it was only alleging a \nbreach of this restrictive covenant by Kohan, and not any other  restrictive covenants \ncontained in the Employment Agreement. Accordingly, the Court only analyzes the \nNon-C ompete restrictive covenant.   \nIn relevant part, Paro’s Non-C ompete covenant prohibits Kohan, during the \nRestricted Period, from engaging in the Bus iness, and defines “Business” as:  \n(a) the provision of outsourced financial services, including bookkeeping and \naccounting, financial analysis and CFO strategy services, or (b) the provision, \ndevelopment, marketing, sale or maintenance of products or serv ices which are \nsubstantially similar to those developed, marketed, distributed, sold, \nmaintained or otherwise provided by, or actively planned to be during the term \nof [his] employment with the Company.   \n \nAgmt.  ¶ 4.  \n \nBefore address ing whether the restrictive covenant is reasonable, the Court  \nmust satisfy itself that (1) the Non-C ompete is ancillary to a valid contract and (2) is \nsupported by adequate consideration.  Allied Waste Services of North America, LLC v. \nTibble , 177 F.  Supp.  3d 1103, 1107 (N.D. Ill. 2016) (citing Fifield v. Premier Dealer \nServices, Inc. , 993 N.E.2d 938, 942 (Ill. App. Ct. 2013)). Here, Paro has demonstrated \nthat the Employment Agreement is a valid contract , that Kohan received a salary, Case: 1:23-cv-04430 Document #: 17 Filed: 07/19/23 Page 11 of 30 PageID #:<pageID> \n 12 commissions, bonuses, and thousands of shares in stock options, and he was employed \nby Paro for over two years. Kohan and FirmKey do not challenge the validity of the \nEmployment Agreement itself, and instead argue that based on his original salary of \n$75,000, the Non-C ompete would not be enforceable if a recently passed Illinois law —\nthe Illinois Freedom to Work Act —applied retroactively. See  820 ILCS 90/10. \nHowever, that law became effective on January 1, 2022, and does not have retroactive \neffect. 820 ILCS 90/5. Thus, the Court fin ds at this preliminary stage , the challenged \nrestrictive covenant is ancillary to a valid contract , and supported by adequate \nconsideration.   \n The Court now turns to the reasonableness of the restrictive covenant in \nquestion. Before enforcing a restrictive covenant, the Court must determine whether \nit is reasonable.  W. Capra Consulting Group, Inc. v. Snyder, 2019 WL 3935045, at *9 \n(N.D. Ill. Aug. 20, 2019). Under Illinois law, “[a] restrictive covenant  . . . is reasonable \nonly if the covenant: (1) is no greater than is required for the protection of a legitimate \nbusiness interest of the employer -promisee; (2) does not impose undue hardship on \nthe employee- promisor, and (3) is not injurious to the public.” Reliable Fire Equip. \nCo. v. Arredondo , 965 N.E.2d 393, 396 (Ill. 2011).  In analyzing whether a restrictive \ncovenant is, in fact, for a “legitimate business interest,” the Court must examine “the \ntotality of the facts and circumstances of the individual case. Factors to be considered \nin this analysis include, but are not limited to, the near -permanence of customer \nrelationships, the employee’ s acquisition of confidential information through his \nemployment, and time and place restrictions. No factor carries any more weight than Case: 1:23-cv-04430 Document #: 17 Filed: 07/19/23 Page 12 of 30 PageID #:<pageID> \n 13 any other, but rather its importance will depend on the specific facts and \ncircumstances of the individual case.” Id. at 403.  \nParo argues  that Paro and FirmKey are direct competitors, and that Kohan \nhas access to and knowledge of Paro’s Confidential Information when he was an \nemployee of Paro’s, and is a co -founder of  FirmKey. Memo. TRO at 4. Paro did not \naddress the near -permanence of its client relationships, or the time and restrictions \nplaced on the  Non-Compete restrictive covenant , in its brief. However, at the TRO \nhearing Paro, when asked, explained that although it is not an old company, Paro has \nlongstanding clients which are the res ult of countless people hours and other “sweat \nequity” to secure those client relationships. Paro also represents that it does business \nin all 50 states, and some business in Europe, such that the geographic scope of the \nNon-C ompete is reasonable. Finally, Paro describes Paro’s business as “niche” and \ncontends that the definition of “Business” in the Employment Agreement captures \nthe protection of a legitimate business interest of Paro, namely “the provision of \noutsourced financial services” and “substantially similar” services to those offered by \nParo. Paro defends the breadth of the Non-Compete restrictive covenant by \nreiterating that Kohan agreed to it  when he signed the Employment Agreement, and \nby maintaining that this restrictive covenant would not prohibit Kohan from finding \nemployment in the financial services industry generally.   \nIn response, Kohan and FirmKey insist  that FirmKey is not a competitor of \nParo’s. Specifically,  argue Kohan and FirmKey, u nlike Paro, FirmKey matches \ncompanies with accounting help , which differs from Paro’s business because Paro is Case: 1:23-cv-04430 Document #: 17 Filed: 07/19/23 Page 13 of 30 PageID #:<pageID> \n 14 a matchmaking  service  for big accounting firm s that need help. Resp. at 3 –4. Kohan \nand FirmKey maintain that these are different businesses with different clients. I d. \nHowever, Kohan and FirmKey concede that FirmKey’s business, like Paro’s, is \na matchmaking business connecting clients with experts or vendors. See Resp. at 4. \nAt this preliminary stage, and without the benefit of evidence from the parties on the \nrespect ive businesses of either company , the Court accepts that Paro and FirmKey \nare competitors.  \nNext, and most importantly,  Kohan and FirmKey contend that the restrictive \ncovenant is too broad as to  both the prohibited activit y and the geographic scope, and \nalso because it is “insolubly ambiguous.” Resp. at 4 –6. Specifically, Kohan and \nFirmKey argue that the definition of “Busi ness” is overly broad and ambiguous . Id. \nat 4–5. Kohan and FirmKey argue  that, “if enforced, ” this restrictive covenant “would \nprevent Mr. Kohan from taking virtually any job in his chosen area of expertise.” Id. \nat 5 ( citing  cases).   \nThe Court agrees with Kohan and FirmKey that the scope of the restrictive \ncovenant is problematic.  Specifically, the Court finds “the provision of outsourced \nfinancial services” to be overbroad. The Court confirmed at the TRO hearing that the \nterm is not defined in the Employ ment Agreement. Breaking  down  the phrase  \noutsourced financial services , “outsource” is commonly defined as “(of a company or \norganization) to purchase (goods) or subcontract (services) from an outside supplier \nor source. ” Outsource, Dictionary.com , https://www.dictionary.com/browse/outsource \n(last visited July 18, 2023) . “Financial services” has an indefinite number of Case: 1:23-cv-04430 Document #: 17 Filed: 07/19/23 Page 14 of 30 PageID #:<pageID> \n 15 meanings, and can include banking, brokerage, mortgages, credit cards, payment \nservices, real estate, taxes, accounti ng, bookkeeping, investments, and on and on. \nThis is corroborated by Paro’s Verified Complaint, which describes the financial \nservices it provides to clients as “from basic bookkeeping and accounting to highly \nspecialized corporate development and strategic advisory services.” Compl. ¶ 10. \nThus, the language in the Non-C ompete is capable of many meanings.  \nFurther, the definition of “Business”  articulated in the Employment \nAgreement also includes “the provision, development, marketing, sale or \nmaintenance o f products or services which are substantially similar ” to Paro’s. Agmt. \n¶ 4 (emphasis added). In its TRO Motion, Paro focuses on Kohan’s alleged breach of \nthe Non-Compete. But, as discussed above, the Court’s first inquiry must be whether \nthe restrictive covenant itself is reasonable. Notably, in its TRO Motion, Paro has not \nsupported the breadth of this specific Non-C ompete clause, or comparably broad \nclauses, with any case law. Conversely, Kohan and FirmKey identify several cases , \nincluding AssuredPartners, Inc. v. Schmitt, 44 N.E.3d 463, 471 (Ill. App. Ct. 2015)  \nwhich they contend support the proposition that scope of the challenged Non-\nCompete is overbroad. Resp. at 5 –6.  \nIn A ssuredPartners, the court found unreasonable a non- compete restri ctive \ncovenant which prohibited the employee, a wholesale insurance broker specializing \nin lawyers’ professional liability insurance, from working in professional liability \ninsurance anywhere in the United States or its territories. 44 N.E.3d at 472. The \ncourt focused on the fact there was no qualification in the restrictive covenant that Case: 1:23-cv-04430 Document #: 17 Filed: 07/19/23 Page 15 of 30 PageID #:<pageID> \n 16 the restrictions were limited to the employee’s activities relating to the specific \nprofessional liability insurance practice he had developed during his prior \nemployment, but rather applied to all liability insurance practices. Id. Additionally, \nthe court was troubled by the broad geographic scope, which restricted the em ployee \nfrom working in his chosen field in the United States and its territories. This \nrestriction observed the court, would place an undue burden on him by forcing him to \nleave the country to work in the same field. Id. at 473. While there are differences  \nbetween the covenant in Assured Partners and the Non-C ompete in this case—\nnamely the length of the restriction being 28 months instead of 12 months —\nAssuredPartners supports the general proposition that restrictions on activities must \nbe narrowly tailored to protect only against activities that threaten the employer’s \ninterest. Id. Here, it is Paro’s position that Kohan worked on “the white label suite of \nclients,” which is primarily the larger companies and accounting firms, suggesting a \nlegitimate interest in protecting Paro against Kohan contacting or soliciting that \nsuite of customers, yet the Non-C ompete is a wholesale restriction on Kohan working \nat a competing business in any capacity for a period of one year. Notably, Paro has \nnot identified for the Court any case where a one- year, nationwide non- compete \nrestrictive covenant  has been upheld as enforceable.  \nThe Court also finds similarities between the covenant at issue in this case and \nthe covenant at issue in Oce N. Am. , Inc. v. Brazeau . 2009 WL 6056775 (N.D. Ill. Sept. \n4, 2009) , report and recommendation  adopted,  2010 WL 5033310 (N.D. Ill. Mar. 18, \n2010). In Oce, employees employed in non -sales or non -service capacities were Case: 1:23-cv-04430 Document #: 17 Filed: 07/19/23 Page 16 of 30 PageID #:<pageID> \n 17 restricted from becoming “associated with, through ownership, employment, s elf-\nemployment, consultancy, contract or otherwise, any Competing Business.” Id.  at *4.  \nThe covenant was nationwide for a period of 12 months. Id. at *3. The court found the \ncovenant was not enforceable under Illinois law, noting that Illinois law disfavor s \nnon-competition clauses, which are closely examined, and the subject covenant was \noverly broad to secure any of the company’s protectable interests. Id. at *8. Further, \nthe court identified several cases where one- year, nationwide non-competition \nagreements  were found to be invalid, and noted that the plaintiff did  not point to any \ncase where a similar covenant had been upheld. Id. at *8 n.79 (collecting cases). \nFinally, the court stated  that “if the temporal and geographic restrictions on an \nemployee’ s conduct are broad, as they are here, the agreement ’s activity restrictions \nshould be correspondingly narrowly drawn to protect the employee ’s ability to be \nemployed in his chosen field.” I d.; see also Cambridge Engineering, Inc. v. Mercury \nPartners 90 BI, Inc. , 879 N.E.2d 512, 526, (Ill. App. Ct. 2007) (finding a “blanket bar \non all activities for competitors” to be excessive and unreasonable as a matter of law).   \nSo too here. Enforcement of the Non-C ompete would, in effect, preclude Kohan \nfrom working in any capacity in the industry in which Paro does business anywhere \nin the  United States, or other parts of the world where Paro has conducted business. \nAs counsel for  Paro stated during the  TRO hearing, it is Paro’s position that it plays \nin the entire “outsourced financial services” sandbox, marketing to companies of all \nsizes, including mom -and-pop shops, Fortune 500 companies, and some of the largest \naccounting firms in the United States.  Paro, however, concedes that Kohan was Case: 1:23-cv-04430 Document #: 17 Filed: 07/19/23 Page 17 of 30 PageID #:<pageID> \n 26 following a bench trial. Id. In other words, like PepsiCo , the district court had the \nbenefit of an evidentiary record.  \nFurther, the Court notes that at least one other court in this District  has found \nthat for a claim under the Defend Trade Secrets Act, an inevitable disclosure theory \nis insufficient because the statute requires that the trade secret information actually \nbe misappropriated. Aon PLC v. Alliant Insurance Services, Inc. , 2023 WL 3914886, \nat *5 (N.D. Ill. June 9, 2023). Specifically, “[t]he civil remedies provision of [the \nDefend Trade Secrets Act]  precludes the imposition of injunctive relief for actual or \nthreatened misappropriation based ‘merely on the information the person knows.’” \nId. (quoting  18 U.S.C. § 1836(b)(3)(A)(i)(I)). Here, Paro concedes that it is no t \nproceeding on a  theory of actual misappropriation. Thus, for this independent reason, \nParo has not established a likelihood of success on its Defend Trade Secrets Act  claim.  \nAccordingly, at this early sta ge, the Court finds Paro has not established a \nlikelihood of success on the merits of its trade secrets claims. Paro concedes it is not \ncontending Kohan improperly accessed trade secrets at any point  during his \nemployment with Paro , or held on to that info rmation in violation of his Employment \nAgreement. Paro does not allege that Kohan or FirmKey has, in fact, used, disclosed, \nor relied upon any trade secret of Paro’s. Paro does argue that Paro and FirmKey are \ndirect competitors, and that Kohan cannot opera te or function in his new position \nwithout relying upon Paro’s trade secrets. In response, Kohan or FirmKey affirm, \nthrough a sworn Declaration of Kohan, that they do not possess any of Paro’s trade \nsecrets or confidential information. Kohan Decl. ¶ 8. Thi s is in sharp contrast to the Case: 1:23-cv-04430 Document #: 17 Filed: 07/19/23 Page 26 of 30 PageID #:<pageID> \n 27 cases where ex -employees have downloaded or accessed trade secrets or confidential \ninformation from their ex -employer, and the ex -employer has proof of that action, \nwhich usually drives the filing of a lawsuit and seeking emer gency relief from the \nCourt. See, e.g., Aon Risk Services Companies, 415 F.Supp.3d at 848 (finding a \nlikelihood of success on trade secret claims where employees took trade secrets prior \nto leaving the company). Paro’s speculation that Kohan and FirmKey wi ll, at some \npoint, use the trade secrets is not sufficient at this emergency TRO  stage, and Paro \nhas not identified cases to support that such a finding of inevitable disclosure can be \nmade at the TRO  stage.  \nThus, at this preliminary stage, the Court finds Paro has not met its burden to \nshow a reasonable likelihood of success on the merits with respect to Count II or III \nof its Verified Complaint.  \niii. Tortious Interference with Contract Against FirmKey \n(Count IV)  \n \nParo also asserts a claim for tortious interference with contract (the \nEmployment Agreement between Paro and Kohan) against FirmKey only. To prove \ntortious interference with contract under Illinois law, Paro must show “(1) the \nexistence of a valid and enforceable contract between the plaintiff and another; (2) \nthe defendant's awareness of the contract; (3) the defendant ’s intentional and \nunjustified inducement of a breach of the contract; (4) a subsequent breach by the \nother, caused by the defendant ’s conduct; and (5) damages.” Hess v. Kanoski & \nAssociates, 668 F.3d 446, 454 (7th Cir. 2012).  Case: 1:23-cv-04430 Document #: 17 Filed: 07/19/23 Page 27 of 30 PageID #:<pageID> \n 28 Paro maintains that FirmKey has tortiously interfered with the Employment \nAgreement by employing Kohan, and via the formation of the company itself , in \nviolation of Section 4 of the Employment Agreement. Memo. TRO at 10. As confirmed \nwith Paro at the TRO hearing, FirmKey is not subject to the Employment Agreement. \nThus, to the extent Paro is alleging FirmKey will solicit Paro’s clients or experts, or \nthreatens to interfere with Paro’s client or expert relationships, or will \nmisappropriate Paro’s Confidential Information itself, those allegations are not based \nupon tortious interference with Kohan’s contract with Paro, and are not cognizable \nunder this theory.  \nIn response,  Kohan and FirmKey argue, without citation to any authority, that \na company cannot tortiously interfere with a contract. While it is true that an entity \ncannot be liable for interfering with its own contract, an entity can tortiously interfere \nwith contracts, and that is not a claim that can only be stated against an individual. \nSee Cox v. Calumet Public Schools District 132 , 180 F.  Supp.  3d 556, 564 (N.D. Ill. \n2016).  \n Nevertheless, based upon the Court’s finding that Paro has not demonstrated \na likelihood of success as to Counts I –III of its Verified Complaint, it follows that Paro \nhas also failed to meet its burden for Count IV. Specifically, the Court’s finding with \nrespect to the Non-C ompete restrictive covenant forecloses a likelihood of success on \nthe merits for the tortious interference claim. That is because, as confirmed by Paro \nat the TRO hearing, it is pursuing this theory based on Section 4 of the Employment \nAgreement.  Case: 1:23-cv-04430 Document #: 17 Filed: 07/19/23 Page 28 of 30 PageID #:<pageID> \n 29 Thus, at this preliminary stage, the Court finds Paro has not met its burden t o \nshow a reasonable likelihood of success on the merits with respect to Count IV of its \nVerified Complaint.  \nAs Paro is required to establish a likelihood of success on the merits of its \nclaims to obtain injunctive relief, the analysis of the remaining req uirements for \ninjunctive relief is unnecessary. See, e.g., Abbott , 971 F.2d at  11 (“If the moving party \ncannot establish … these prerequisites, a court's inquiry is over and the injunction \nmust be denied.”) At this emergency TRO juncture, and on this recor d, Paro has not \nmet its burden regarding the first requirement for obtaining injunctive relief. \nHowever, this ruling is not a suggestion that Paro will not be able to satisfy that \nburden at a preliminary injunction hearing after the parties have the opport unity to \nobtain discovery, which is addressed below . See, e.g., U.S. Army Corps of Eng’rs, 667 \nF.3d at 782.  \nII. Expedited Discovery  \n Last, the Court addresses Paro’s motion for expedited discovery. In its \nexpedited discovery motion, Paro requests that it be permitted to engage in discovery \nin connection with the emergency relief it is seeking. The Court agrees that certain \nexpedited discovery is appropriate in light of the scheduling a preliminary injunction \nhearing, so the  Court and the parties will have a fuller evidentiary record for that \nhearing. See Nobel Biocare USA, Inc. v. Lynch , 1999 WL 958501, at *4 (N.D.  Ill. Sept. \n15, 1999). However, this proposed discovery will be limited , and the Court will require Case: 1:23-cv-04430 Document #: 17 Filed: 07/19/23 Page 29 of 30 PageID #:<pageID> \n 30 \nthe parties to submit a proposed discovery schedule in advance of commencing \ndiscovery .   \nConclusion \nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court resolves Paro’s motion [7] as foll ows: the \nCourt denies Paro’s request for an emergency temporary restraining order, and \nenters and continues Paro’s request for a preliminary injunction, to be resolved after \nlimited discovery and an evidentiary hearing, if necessary. The Court grants \nPlain tiff’s motion for expedited discovery [9], subject to the Court’s review of a \nproposed discovery schedule.  \nThe Court directs the parties to file a joint status report by July 24, 2023 \naddressing (i) proposed dates for an in -person preliminary injunction h earing, (ii) the \nanticipated length of a preliminary injunction hearing, (iii) the number of witnesses \nper side, and (iv) a proposed expedited discovery schedule, including the anticipated \nnumber of depositions per side, proposed number of interrogatories,  number of \nrequests to admit, and requests for production.  \n \n \nDated: July 19, 2023     \n____________________________________ \nUnited States District Judge  \nFranklin U.

    "summary": "**1. Summary:**\nLoop AI Labs Inc. filed a lawsuit against several defendants, including its former CEO Anna Gatti, alleging misappropriation of trade secrets and other claims. Gatti was accused of conspiring with the Italian Almaviva Defendants to sabotage Loop AI’s investor relations and use its AI trade secrets unlawfully. In this procedural matter, the court addressed discovery disputes related to subpoenas issued to a third-party recruiter, Russell Reynolds Associates (RRA), regarding their communications and involvement in placing Gatti with a competing company.\n\n**2. Key Legal Issue:**\nThe key legal issue is whether the subpoenas issued to RRA for documents and depositions and the terms of a protective order concerning confidential information should be enforced and, if so, to what extent the requests are reasonable or overly burdensome.\n\n**3. Court's Holding:**\nThe court decided to narrow the scope of the subpoena requests to focus on documents related directly to Gatti's employment and interactions with Loop AI and the Almaviva Defendants, while considering the burdens on RRA. It also established procedures for handling the deposition, including division of deposition time and the management of translation needs for Italian language documents. The court further resolved disputes over the proposed protective order's terms, rejecting several of the plaintiff's additional requests but requiring a provision on secure transmission of sensitive materials.\n\n**4. ELI5 Explanation:**\nThis court case is about a disagreement between a company called Loop AI and some former employees and competitors. Loop AI says its secrets were stolen by a former leader who used them to help herself and others unfairly. They wanted information from a company called RRA, which was involved in headhunting, to understand what happened. The judge said, \"Okay, you can ask RRA for some stuff, but don't overwhelm them with too many demands. Also, let's be fair about who can ask questions when talking to people from RRA and how we handle secret information.\"",

No. 172  \n \nOn August 17, 2015, Plaintiff Loop AI Labs, Inc. (“Loop AI”), Defendants Almawave \nUSA, Inc. (“Almawave”), Anna Gatti, IQSystem, Inc., IQSystems LLC, and third party Russell \nReynolds Associates (“RRA”) filed a joint discovery letter regarding their disputes  about Loop \nAI’s subpoenas to RRA  and a protective order in this case .  [Docket No. 172 (Joint Letter).]  The \ncourt finds that this matter may be decided without a hearing pursuant to Local Rule 7 -1(b) and \nenters the following order.  \nI. BACKGROUND  \nA. Factual Bac kground  \nPlaintiff filed this action on February 20, 2015 against Defendants Almawave ; Almaviva \nS.p.A. (“Almaviva”)  and Almawave S.r.l.  (the “Italian Almaviva Defendants”); Gatti; and  \nIQSystem, Inc., and IQSystems LLC  (“IQSystem Defendants”) .  Plaintiff is a startup that develops \nartificial intelligence technology.  It alleges that Gatti, its former CEO, conspired with the Italian \nAlmaviva Defendants to misappropriate Plaintiff’s  trade secrets and sabotage its investor \nnegotiations.  Specifically, Plainti ff alleges that it hired Gatti to assist in raising venture capital \nand establish business partnerships, but that she lied about her true credentials and experience .  \nAccording to Plaintiff, while Gatti pretended to work full time for Loop AI , she was \nsimu ltaneously providing advisory services for multiple  competing  startups  and took a concurrent Case 4:15-cv-00798-HSG   Document 203   Filed 09/18/15   Page 1 of 19 \n2 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  CEO position with Defendant Almawave.  [Docket No. 45 (Am. Compl. ¶¶ 5, 8-10, 14).]  Gatti \nalso allegedly established Almawave on behalf of the Italian Almaviva De fendants and domiciled \nthe new startup at her home in San Francisco.1  (Am. Compl. ¶¶ 15, 16.)  According to Plaintiff , \nAlmaviva intended to use Gatti’s assistance to buy Loop AI for a “bargain price” or to hire away \nits key employees and obtain access to its proprietary technology and trade secrets.  (Am. Compl. \n¶ 17.)  Plaintiff alleges that a principal component of Gatti’s scheme involved sabotaging its \naccess to funding, including venture capital.  (Am. Compl. ¶¶ 26 -28.)  Gatti also allegedly shared \nPlaintiff’s proprietary information and other property with the other defendants, and used \nPlaintiff’s time, property, and other resources to conduct business on behalf of the Almaviva \nDefendants.  (Am. Compl. ¶ 18.)  Plaintiff brings claims for, inter alia , RICO violations, fraud, \nbreach of contract, theft of corporate opportunity, misappropriation o f trade secrets, and \nconversion .   \nB. Discovery Disputes  and Procedural Posture  \nIn June 2015, Plaintiff served a Rule 45 subpoena on third party RRA, seeking the \nproduction of thirteen categories of documents.  It also served a subpoena demanding the \nappearance of Mario Pepe, an RRA employee, for deposition.  The subpoenas sought compliance \nin New York City, where RRA is located.  On July 10, 2015, Plaintiff moved to compel RRA’s \ncompliance with the subpoena for documents in the U.S. District Court, Southern District of New \nYork (“SDNY”).  Three days later, Almawave and RRA filed a discovery letter before the \nundersigned regarding their disputes with Plaintiff about both Pepe’s deposition and Plaintiff’s \ndemand for documents from RRA.  [Docket No. 128.]  \nOn July 23, 2015, the undersigned held a discovery management conference  regarding \nnumerous discovery disputes, including the disputes about the RRA subpoenas .  At the hearing, \nRRA and Pepe consented to this court’s jurisdiction for purposes of adjudication and enforcement \nof the subpoenas, and Plaintiff agreed to withdraw its motion to compel pending in the SDNY. \nThe court ordered the parties to meet and confer regarding their outstanding disputes about the \n                                                 \n1 Plaintiff alleges that Defendant Almaviva is the parent company of Almawave S.r.l. and \nAlmawave (collectively, the “Almaviva Defendants”).  ( See Am. Compl. ¶¶ 40 -42.)

[Docket No. 156 (Minute Order ).]  The court also \nordered the parties to negotiate a protective order and to submit any remaining disputes in the joint \nletter.  \nOn August 11, 2015, Plaintiff filed an administrative motion seeking permission to exceed \nthe eight -page limit for the joint l etter due on August 13, 2015 , to which RRA filed an opposition .  \n[Docket No s. 162 , 164 .]  On August 12, 2015, the court denied Plaintiff’s administrative motion , \nstating in its order that it “uses an eight -page joint letter process to force the parties to focus on \nthose arguments that are the most important to discovery disputes.”  The court granted  the parties  \nan extension to August 17, 2015 to file the joint letter.  [Docket No. 165.]  \nThe parties and RRA filed their joint letter on August 17, 2015.  Plain tiff did not provide \nfull argument on several of the remaining disputes  presented  in the joint letter.  Instead, Plaintiff \nrequested leave to fully brief its position on a protective order, and submitted additional pages of \nargument in the form of a redlin e version of Defendants’ proposed protective order and one page \nof annotations  explaining its changes .  (Joint Letter Ex. B.)  Plaintiff also  asked for leave to brief \nits arguments regarding the subpoena for documents to RRA, or in the alternative, Plainti ff asked \nthe court to incorporate by reference its previous motion to compel RRA’s compliance with its \nsubpoena for documents  filed in the SDNY  and RRA’s opposition thereto.  (Joint Letter 6 n.17.)  \nAs to the protective order dispute, the court ordered Defe ndants to file a one -page response \nto Plaintiff’s annotated arguments by August 31, 2015.  [Docket No. 175 (Aug. 25, 2015 Order).]  \nConcluding that the filings in the SDNY could be helpful to resolving the disputes about the RRA \nsubpoena for documents, the  court also ordered RRA to file a statement by August 28, 2015 \nindicating whether it had changed its positions on any of the objections briefed in its July 20, 2015 \nopposition to the motion to compel and explaining any such changes.  It ordered Plaintiff t o file a \nreply to RRA’s arguments by September 2, 2015.  (Aug. 25, 2015 Order.)  The parties and RRA \ntimely filed the submissions.

DISCUSSION  \nA. Subpoena to RRA  for Mario Pep e’s Deposition  \nRRA is “an executive leadership and search firm and advises its clients on recruiting \nsenior -level executives. ”  (Wah Decl. in Support of RRA’s Opp’n to SDNY Mot. to Compel, July \n20, 2015 , ¶ 2.)  RRA asserts that it has received two “talent search assignments” from “Almaviva \nand/or Almawave.”  (Wah Decl. ¶ 3.)  One of the assignments involved RRA’s employee, Mario \nPepe, placing Gatti in a position with Almawave. 2  (Wah Decl. ¶ 3.) \nAccording to Valeria Sandei, Almawave’s  Chairman and President, “a headhunter” with \nRRA introduced Gatti to Sandei by email in February 2014.  Sandei states that she offered Gatti \nthe position of CEO of Almawave in April 2014 “through the headhunter.”  (Sandei Decl. in \nSupport of Opp’n to Pl.’s  Mot. for TRO, March 9, 2015, ¶¶ 6, 10.)   \nPlaintiff disputes RRA’s characterization of its actions as “simply placing a candidate with \none or another company.”  (Pl.’s SDNY Mot. to Compel 5 n.4.)  According to Plaintiff, RRA \nplayed a substantial role in a ssisting Gatti and the Almaviva Defendants in the alleged wrongdoing \nat issue in this case.  Plaintiff asserts that RRA, through its director s, Mario Pepe  and Giulia \nBelloni , helped place Gatti in various other positions while she continued to work as Loop  AI’s \nCEO, including assisting with Almawave’s employment of Gatti as CEO .  (Pl.’ s SDNY Mot. to \nCompel 6.)  Plaintiff also alleges that RRA assisted the Almaviva Defendants “in soliciting Loop \nAI’s employees, contractors, and investors, and aided Gatti in promulgating her misstatements \nabout her academic and employment background.”  (Pl.’s SDNY Mot. to Compel 6 (citing Am. \nCompl. ¶ 57).)    \nPlaintiff served RRA with a Rule 45 subpoena demanding that it produce Mario Pepe for  \ndeposition .  Although Pepe lives in Washington, D.C., RRA  has agree d to produce him for \ndeposition in New York on a mutually convenient date.  [Docket No. 155.]  Th e following \ndisputes regarding Pepe’s deposition remain.  \n                                                 \n2 The other assignment “involved placing a position at Almawave,” but Joyce Wah, RRA’s \nContracts & Legal Affairs Coordinator, states that the assignment “did not involve Anna Gatti or \nany of the other parties” to this action.  Wah also states that she identified two search assignments \nfor a Brazilian affiliate of Almawave, but neither involved  Gatti or any other parties in this action.  \n(Wah Decl. ¶ 3.) Case 4:15-cv-00798-HSG   Document 203   Filed 09/18/15   Page 4 of 19 \n5 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  1. Allocation of Time  \n First, the parties dispute the allocation of tim e among the parties  to question Pepe at his \ndeposition.  Although Plaintiff issued the subpoena for Pepe’s deposition , Defendants assert that \nthey also have the right to question Pepe .  They propose that the  presumptive seven hours for \nPepe’s deposition be  split evenly be tween Plaintiff and Defendants, with the Defendants allocating \ntheir collective 3.5 hours amongst themselves.  \n Plaintiff argues that Defendants are not entitled to 3.5 hours of Plaintiff’s deposition time.  \nAccording to Plaintiff, RRA and A lmawave have been working jointly in this litigation, and \nPlaintiff argues that Almawave has not explained why it needs “such extensive deposition time \nwith a witness that is cooperating with it and filing motions jointly with it.”  (Joint Letter 2.)  \nPlaintiff states that Almawave would not independently depose Pepe, “ its own cooperating \nwitness ,” and suggests that Almawave is using “the excuse of a purported need for examination to \nimpede” Plaintiff’s deposition.  (Joint Letter 2.)   It also argues that Ru le 30 requires a party to \nnotice a deposition that the party wishes to take, and that compliance with this rule is important \nbecause the deposition counts against a party’s maximum number of depositions allowed while \naffording that party seven hours in whi ch to question a witness.  Finally, Plaintiff argues that Rule \n26(b)(2) permits a court to grant additional time for a deposition where necessary, and c ontends \nthat if Almawave wishes to depose Pepe, it may serve RRA with a subpoena and move the court \nfor additional time  for Pepe’s deposition .  Plaintiff has no objection to Pepe’s deposition lasting \nmore than seven hours.  \nRRA contends  that neither RRA nor Pepe “are cooperating witnesses to either party .”  \n(Joint Letter 2.)  It opposes any request for Pepe’s  deposition to exceed the presumptive seven -\nhour limit under Federa l Rule of Civil Procedure 30(d) , arguing that the parties have not \ndemonstrated good cause for additional time.  \nAlthough Plaintiff served a Rule 45 subpoena for Pepe’s deposition, Rule 30 g overns the \nprocedures for taking depositions by oral examination.  “Unless otherwise stipulated or ordered by \nthe court, a deposition is limited to 1 day of 7 hours.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 30(d)(1).  According to Rule \n30(c)(1) , “[t]he examination and cross -exam ination of a deponent proceed as they would at trial Case 4:15-cv-00798-HSG   Document 203   Filed 09/18/15   Page 5 of 19 \n6 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  under the Federal Rules of Evidence .”  Moreover, “[t]here is no formal requirement for a party \nseeking to cross -examine a deponent to serve a notice.”  F.C.C. v. Mizuho Medy Co. Ltd ., 257 \nF.R.D. 679, 682  (S.D. Cal. 2009 ).  Therefore, “[i]n a multi -party lawsuit, one party may notice the \ndeposition and other parties may attend and cross -examine the deponent without also having to \nnotice the deposition.”  Id.; accord  Longino v. City of Cincinna ti, No. 1:12 -CV-424, 2013 WL \n831738, at *5 (S.D. Ohio Mar. 6, 2013)  (Rule 30(c)(1) “ means that counsel for both parties of a \ncivil action are permitted to question witnesses during depositions, regardless of which party \nnoticed the deposition. ”).  Therefore, Defendants  may question Pepe at his deposition without \nhaving to separately notice his deposition or serve a subpoena.    \nThe court notes that  none of the parties ask the court to grant additional time for Pepe’s \ndeposition ; therefore, it will not presently consider  whether more time is necessary “for a fair \nexamination” of Pepe.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 30(d)(1) (“[t]he court must allow additional time \nconsistent with Rule 26(b)(2) if needed to fairly examine the deponent”).  Although Plaintiff \ncontends  that Pepe and RRA are “cooperating” with Almawave, Plaintiff does not cite evidence to \nsupport this, and RRA denies  that they are cooperating.  Additionally, Plaintiff does not explain \nwhy it needs the full seven hours to depose Pepe , a non -party .  Accord ingly, the court grants \nDefendants two hours of the total seven hours allowed  for Pepe’s deposition, to be allocated \namong all Defendants.  Plaintiff is entitled to the remaining five h ours.  If, at the conclusion of the \nseven hours of Pepe’s deposition, a ny party seeks more time to examine him, it must meet and \nconfer with RRA  before seeking court intervention .      \n2. Use of  Italian Language and  Italian -Language Documents at Deposition  \nNext, the parties disagree about the use of Italian -language documents at  Pepe’s  \ndeposition , as well as the language in which the deposition will be conducted.  Litigation counsel \nfor Almawave, Gatti, and the IQSystem Defendants  do not speak Italian, nor does counsel for \nPepe .  Therefore, Defendants assert that they need to be able to contemporaneously review any \nexhibits that are used in the deposition  and fully understand the questions and answers  in order to \nmeaningfully participate in the deposition .  According to Defendants, they will be unable to do so \nif exhibits are only  in Italian.  Defendants make two proposals to address this issue: 1) Plaintiff Case 4:15-cv-00798-HSG   Document 203   Filed 09/18/15   Page 6 of 19 \n7 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  can prepare English -language translations of any Italian -language exhibits it will use at deposition, \nand as it introduces an exhibit, simultaneously introduce the English -language translation of the \ndocument at the deposition; or 2) Plaintiff can provide all parties in advance any Italian -language \ndocuments it intends to use at the deposition, and Defendants can have translations prepared at \ntheir expense in advance of the depo sition.  (Joint Letter 3.)   In addition, Defendants assert that \nPepe speaks fluent English.  Therefore, Defendants ask that Plaintiff commit to speaking only \nEnglish at the deposition.   \n Plaintiff argues that “Almawave’s purported language issues are manu factured,” because \nthe law firm representing Almawave empl oys Italian -speaking attorneys who could appear at the \ndeposition.  (Joint Letter 4.)  Plaintiff rejects Defendants’ proposals  for translations of deposition \nexhibits, a rguing that either proposal would violate its work product protections, impose \nunwarranted and unjustified translation obligations upon Plaintiff, and/or disrupt Plaintiff’s \ndeposition of Pepe.  It asserts that “Italian will only be used as necessary to specify certain words \nin Italia n-language documents relevant to Mr. Pepe’s deposition.”  While Plaintiff’s counsel’s \nquestions will be articulated in English, they may contain Italian words “only to the extent \nparticular words in particular documents are in Italian and require questioni ng on the record as to \nthe specific meaning of certain words.”  Therefore, “[t]he only Italian words at the deposition will \nbe read from documents.”  (Joint Letter 4.)  In response, Defendants state that their concerns about \nthe use of Italian at the depos ition will be obviated if the parties can reach an agreement on the \npre-deposition translation of Italian -language documents and Plaintiff commits to using Itali an \nonly when quoting a document, as it appears to do in the joint letter.  \n Plaintiff’s proposed  solution is insufficient.  Regardless of whether there are Italian -\nspeaking attorneys at the firm representing Almawave, the use of Italian language documents at \ndeposition is problematic because the judge and jury in this matter will need to be able to r ead and \nunderstand the exhibits.  There is also no indication in the letter about whether RRA or any of the \nother Defendants have access to Italian -speaking counsel.  Given the potential for confusion, t he \ncourt finds that translations of the Italian -langu age exhibits Plaintiff introduces at Pepe’ s \ndeposition are necessary.  The court notes that Plaintiff does not indicate how many Italian -Case 4:15-cv-00798-HSG   Document 203   Filed 09/18/15   Page 7 of 19 \n8 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  language exhibits it plans to introduce at Pepe’s deposition.  Therefore, it is unable to assess the \nburden of translat ing the exhibits in advance.   \n The court notes that Defendants offered two reasonable proposals regarding translations, \nincluding a proposal that Defendants bear the cost of translating exhibits.  Because Plaintiff \nrejected both proposals, and in sists on protecting  its work product  by refusing to identify \ndocuments in advance so that Defendants can translate them , the court orders  that Plaintiff shall  \nprepare certified translations of any Italian -language exhibits it will use at deposition.  As it \nintroduces an exhibit, it shall simultaneously introduce the English -language  translation of the  \ndocument.  Plaintiff is not required to furnish the translations in advance of the deposition.  As to \nthe language of the deposition itself, Plaintiff may use Italian only when reading from a document, \nas Plaintiff itself proposes , as long as Plaintiff ha s provided a certified translation of the document \nin accordance with this order .   \nB. Plaintiff’s Demand for Documents from RRA  \nAs noted, Plaintiff’s Rule 45 document subpoena to RRA seeks the production of thirteen \ncategories of documents , described further  below .  They include requests for documents showing \nthird parties with whom RRA communicated on behalf of Gatti from January 1, 2010 to the \npresent ( no. 2), all contracts between RRA and any of the Defendants ( no. 6), all documents \nrelated to Gatti or Pla intiff from January 1, 2010 the present ( no. 9), and all documents provided \nby RRA to Gatti or any of the Defendants ( no. 11).  (Healy Decl. in Support of Pl.’s SDNY Mot. \nto Compel, July 10, 2015, Ex. A.)   \nRRA timely lodged objections to the document dema nds.  (Healy Decl. Ex. C.)  Generally, \nRRA objects to the demands as overbroad as to time and scope  and unduly  burdensome.  It also \nobjects that they call for the production of information protected from discovery by the attorney -\nclient privilege, work pro duct doctrine, and third party rights to privacy.  RRA argues that Plaintiff \nseeks all documents related to any of the Defendants in this case, regardless of whether the \ndocuments are related to the claims and defenses at issue in th e action , and asks the court to \nnarrow the scope of the documents sought by Plaintiff.   It represents that to date, it has produced \n315 responsive documents.  (Joint Letter 6 ; Graham Decl. in Supp. of RRA’s Opp’n to SDNY Case 4:15-cv-00798-HSG   Document 203   Filed 09/18/15   Page 8 of 19 \n9 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  Mot. to Compel, July 20, 2015, ¶ 7.) \n1. Legal Standard  \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 45 governs discovery of nonparties by subpoena.  Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 45.  The Advisory Committ ee Notes to Rule 45 state that “ the scope of discovery through a \nsubpoena is the same as that applicable to Rule 34 and the other disc overy rules, ” which in turn is \nthe same as under Rule 26(b).  Advisory Committee Notes to 1970 Ame ndment; Fed. R. Civ. P. \n34(a) (“ A party may serve on any other party a request within the scope of Rule 26(b). ”).  Rule \n26(b) allows a party to obtain discove ry concerning “ any nonprivileged matter that is relevant to \nany party ’s claim or defense. ”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(1).  “Relevancy, for the purposes of \ndiscovery, is defined broadly, although it is not without ultimate and necessary boundaries. ”  \nGonzales v . Google, Inc. , 234 F.R.D. 674, 679 -80 (N.D. Cal. 2006).   \n Rule 45 provides that “ on timely motion, the court for the district where compliance is \nrequired must quash or modify a subpoena that . . . subjects a person to undue burden. ”  Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 45( c)(3)(A)(iv).  “ [A] court determining the propriety of a subpoena balances the relevance \nof the discove ry sought, the requesting party’ s need, and the potential hardship to the party subject \nto the subpoena. ”  Gonzales , 234 F.R.D. at 680 (citation omitted) .  The party who moves to quash \na subpoena bears the “burden of persuasion ” under Rule 45(c)(3).  Moon v. SCP Pool Corp. , 232 \nF.R.D. 633, 637 (C.D. Cal. 2005) (citations omitted).  \n2. Discussion  \n As noted above, RRA presents evidence that it has been retained by Almaviva , Almawave , \nor their affiliates for four executive searches.  One of those searches involved Pepe coordinating \nan introduc tion between Gatti and Almawave, resulting in Almawave hiring Gatti as CEO.   The \nother three searches did not involve Gatti  or Plaintiff, and two of the three were search \nassignments for Almawave’s Brazilian affiliate.  (Wah Decl. ¶ 3.)  RRA acknowledges that Pepe’s \nintroduction of Gatti to Almawave “is directly at issue in the instant case,” but argues that the \nremaining thre e searches bear no relation to this action other than the fact that they were for \nAlmaviva.  Accordingly, RRA asks the court to narrow the scope of the subpoena to “documents  \nthat relate to Loop and Anna Gatti ( separately and jointly ), and the search it performed for the Case 4:15-cv-00798-HSG   Document 203   Filed 09/18/15   Page 9 of 19 \n10 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  position a t Almawave that resulted in  the hire by Almawave of Anna Gatti.”   (Joint Letter 7.)  \n RRA makes other arguments in support of its objections to the subpoena.  First, it argues \nthat as written, Plaintiff’s requests call for the d isclosure of private matters occurring in multiple \ncountries between RRA’s clients and individuals who are candidates for employment.  These \ncandidates had a reasonable expectation that RRA would maintain the confidential ity of  their \npersonal information.  Further, RRA argues that the subpoena poses “an incredible financial \nburden” which it should not have to bear, given its status as a third party.  It has run electronic \nsearches using various search terms, including the names of the parties of this case, resulting in \nover 30,000 hits.  RRA represents that many of the documents returned by the searches are in \nItalian , and explains it must translate these documents prior to production in order to determine if \nthey are responsive and/or raise privacy or privi lege issues.  RRA estimates the cost for such \ntranslation at more than $100,000.3  (Joint Letter 7.)  According to RRA, it has already incurred \nfees in excess of $20,000 associated with this matter.  (RRA’s Statement 2.)  RRA asks the court \nto 1) ensure a protective order is in place prior to RRA’s production; 2) shift the financial burden \nof translating the documents to Plaintiff; and 3) order Plaintiff to “bear the burden of any costs \nassociated with having to produce 30,000+ documents, should this Court find that the proper \nscope includes such a vast production.”  (Joint Letter 7 -8.) \n In response, Plaintiff contends that RRA is a critical participant in  some of the material \nevents at issue in this case.   Plaintiff cites a number of documents that it claim s support “the \nsubstantial extent of RRA’s involvement with Gatti” in connection with the Defendants and with \nassisting Gatti in finding additional positions while she was employed by Plaintiff.  These \ndocuments include emails between RRA and the Italian A lmaviva Defendants , and RRA and \nGatti.  For example, in one email from April 2014, Gatti forwarded to RRA a discussion between \nGatti and Almaviva regarding Almaviva’s payments to the IQSystem Defendants.  (Pl.’s Reply 1.)  \nPlaintiff also describes correspo ndence between Gatti and RRA in which she discussed “granular \n                                                 \n3 The court notes that in its opposition to Plaintiff’s SDNY motion to compel, RRA asserted that \nthe cost of translating approximately 31,000 documents would be more than $50,000.  (Graham \nDecl.  ¶ 10.)  It is not clear if the new $100,000 figure includes the estimated cost of attorney \nreview time for the translated documents.  Case 4:15-cv-00798-HSG   Document 203   Filed 09/18/15   Page 10 of 19 \n11 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  details of the plans and activities with Almawave” and RRA’s work to place Gatti in other \npositions.  (Pl.’s Reply 1 n.4.)   \n These emails appear to indicate that RRA was in close contact with G atti about matters \nrelated to Almaviva and Almawave during the time period at issue in this case .  However, they do \nnot support, and Plaintiff does not explain its position that documents related to all of RRA’s \nexecutive searches for Almaviva or Almawave  are relevant , regardless of whether they involved \nGatti or Plaintiff.  Nor do they support Plaintiff’s position that documents related to RRA’s \ncontacts with any of the Defendants are relevant, regardless of whether they relate to Gatti, \nPlaintiff, or any of the issues in this action.  Plaintiff states that Almaviva’s past practices with \nRRA are relevant to show whether Almaviva was in the habit of receiving legal advice from RRA \nfor other search assignments, but does not explain what this means or why this  is relevant.  \nMoreover, it appears that RRA’s proposal to narrow the scope to “documents that relate to Loop \nand Anna Gatti (separately and jointly), 4 and the search it performed for the position at Almawave \nthat resulted in the hire by Almawave of Anna Gatti,” (Joint Letter 7 (emphasis added)), would \nreturn documents relevant to the claims at issue in this action.  Specifically, under RRA’s \nproposal, RRA would produce all documents and communication s with or pertaining to Gatti  \nand/or Loop AI , as requested by Plaintiff.   Accordingly, the court adopts RRA’s proposal to \nnarrow the scope of each of the thirteen categories of documents demanded in the subpoena.  The \ncourt will address any remaining objections to the demands below.  \n Request No. 1 , docum ents that identify RRA’s employees who communicated with, or \nprovided services to the Defendants ; Request No. 3 , the dates upon which RRA began performing \nservices for any of the Defendants ; Request No. 4 , the dates, locations, and substance of all \nmeeting s between RRA and any of th e Defendants; and Request No. 5,  email addresses and \ntelephone numbers RRA employees used to communicate with Defendants : As to  these four \nrequests,  RRA argues that it would be less burdensome to produce the requested information  \n                                                 \n4 Plaintiff describes RRA’s proposed compromise as producing “only documents that jointly relate  \nto Anna Gatti and the Def endants,” (Pl.’s Reply 3), and claims that this is inadequate, but this is an \ninaccurate representation of RRA’s offer.   Case 4:15-cv-00798-HSG   Document 203   Filed 09/18/15   Page 11 of 19 \n12 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  during Pepe’s deposition.

Timing  and Expe nse of Production  \nRRA asks the court to shift the financial burden of translating responsive documents to \nPlaintiff.  “ Rule 45(d)(2)(B)(ii) requires the dist rict court to shift a non -party’ s costs of compliance \nwith a subpoena, if those costs are significa nt.”  Legal Voice v. Stormans Inc. , 738 F.3d 1178, \n1184 (9th Cir. 2013) .  First of all , the court has significantly narrowed the scope of the document \ndemands .  Moreover, it appears that RRA assumes  that it will have prepare certified translations of \nevery document returned by its search  in order to determine whether it is responsive and should be \nproduced , but this is a faulty assumption .  Since not every document will be responsive or used in \nthe case, there is no need to obtain certified translat ions of all Italian language documents  in \nRRA’s possession that are  potentially responsive to the subpoena.   Instead, RRA can employ other \nreasonable and presumably less expensive means to decide whether an Italian -language document \nshould be produced.  This includes, for example, hiring an Italian -speaking paralegal or contract \nattorney to review documents and provide counsel with something short of a certified translation \nso that counsel can determine what should be produced.  RRA shall perform its review and make \nresponsive documents available to Plaintiff for inspection and copying .  Plaintiff shall  translate \ndocuments at its own expense .  The court does not know if the 315 responsive documents already \nproduced by RRA included certified translations.  If they did , RRA may not seek reimbursement \nfor those translation costs.   \nThe court orders RRA to produce documents in accordance with this order within 21days  Case 4:15-cv-00798-HSG   Document 203   Filed 09/18/15   Page 13 of 19 \n14 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  of the date of this order .     \nC. Protective Order  for the Case  \nFinally, the parties dispute the terms of a protective order governing the production of  \ndocuments and information in this case.  Defendants ask the court to enter the Northern District of \nCalifornia’s Model Protective Order for trade secret cases with changes they describe as \n“minimal .”  (Almawave’s Statement.)   \nPlaintiff submitted  a red-line of proposed changes to Defendants’ final draft .  It states that \nthe protective order is “crucial” for Plaintiff , since Defendants plan to  provid e Plain tiff’s \ndocuments and information to the Italian Almaviva Defendants, who dispute this court’s \njurisdiction over them.  RRA maintains that a protective order must be executed prior to \ncompleting any document production in response to Plaintiff’s subpoena , and it appears that RRA \nagrees with Defendants’ proposed version of the Model P rotective Order.  The court will address \neach of Plaintiff’s proposed annotations in turn.  \n Annotation 1 , § 1, “Purposes and Limitations” : Plaintiff seeks to add a provision that \nrequires that each party and any of its employees, “wherever located in the world, are subject to \nthe personal jurisdiction” of this court or any other United States District Court that may be asked \nto enforce the p rotective order.  According to Plaintiff, this provision is necessary so that it may \nhave a means of enforcing the protective order against the Italian Almaviva Defendants.   In \nresponse, Almawave argues that this provision requires that all parties waive p ersonal jurisdiction \nobjections, even though the Italian Almaviva Defendants seek dismissal from this action on that \nbasis.  \n On September 2, 2015, the Honorable Haywood S. Gilliam denied without prejudice the \nItalian Almaviva Defendants’  motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction.   [Docket No. \n183.]  Judge Gilliam granted Plaintiff leave to conduct jurisdictional discovery on the subject of \n“whether the causes of action alleged in the [Amended Complaint] ‘arise out’ of” the Italian \nAlmaviva Defenda nts’ contacts in California.  [Docket No. 183 at 6.]  Therefore, whether the \nItalian Almaviva Defendants are subject to personal jurisdiction in this court is still an open \nquestion.   Case 4:15-cv-00798-HSG   Document 203   Filed 09/18/15   Page 14 of 19 \n15 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California   The court is mindful of Plaintiff’s concerns about enforcement of the protective order \nagainst the foreign Defendants.  However, Plaintiff’s proposal is unnecessary.  Pursuant to section \n7.2(b) of the Model Protective Order, “a Receiving Party may disclose any information or item \ndesignated ‘CONFIDENTIAL’ only to . . . (b) t he officers, directors, and employees (including \nHouse Counsel) of the Receiving Party to whom disclosure is reasonably necessary for this \nlitigation and who have signed the ‘Acknowledgement and Agreement to be Bound’ (Exhibit \nA).”5  An individual who exec utes the “Acknowledgement and Agreement to be Bound” expressly \nagrees “to submit to the jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the Northern District of \nCalifornia for the purpose of enforcing the terms of this Stipulated Protective Order, eve n if such \nenforcement proceedings occur after termination of this action.”  Therefore, the Italian Almaviva \nDefendants may not disclose Plaintiff’s confidential information to their employees unless  the \nemployees sign an agreement acknowledging this court’ s jurisdiction over them for purposes of \nenforcing the protective order.  Since this provision already addresses Plaintiff’s concerns about \nenforcement, the court denies the request to add Plaintiff ’s provision to the protective order.  \n Annotation 2 , § 2.10, “House Counsel” definition : Defendants’ proposed protective \norder defines “House Counsel” to mean “attorneys who are employees of a party to this action ,” \nconsistent with the Model Protective Order.   Plaintiff seeks to revise this definition to mean \n“individuals who are licensed to practice law by any State in the United States and who are \nemployees of a party to this action. ”  According to Plaintiff , attorneys in Italy are required to \nresign from the Bar before taking on positions as house counsel, and  therefore their duties and \nethical responsibilities differ from their American counterparts.  Almawave responds that all of the \nAlmaviva Defendants “have only Italian house counsel ,” so they would be excluded from the \ndefinition.   (Almawave’s Statement.)  \n Plaintiff does not explain how Italian attorneys’ duties and ethical responsibilities differ \nfrom American attorneys, or how such differences would impact Italian attorneys’ obligations \n                                                 \n5 Plaintiff proposes some changes to this provision of Defendants’ proposed protective order, as \nwell as changes to the Acknowledgemen t and Agreement to Be Bound.  However, a s discussed \nfurther below, Plaintiff did not provide any explanation or argument to support the proposed \nchanges and the court f inds that they are unnecessary.  Case 4:15-cv-00798-HSG   Document 203   Filed 09/18/15   Page 15 of 19 \n16 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  under the protective order.  In particular, it appears that the Itali an attorneys who are employees of \na party would also fall under the protective order’s definition of a “Party,” which includes \nemployees, and thus would be permitted to access protected information under certain \ncircumstances under Defendants’ version of t he Model Protective Order.  ( See Defs.’ Proposed \nProtective Order § 7.2(b).)  Therefore, in the absence of a sufficient explanation of why Italian in -\nhouse counsel should be excluded from the definition of “House Counsel,” the court denies \nPlaintiff’s request to revise this definition and adopts Defendants’ proposed definition.  \n Annotation 3 , § 2:12, “Outside Counsel of Record” definition : Plaintiff seeks to expand \nthe definition of “Outside Counsel of Record” to include “any person retained by, consult ing for, \nor working under the supervision or acting at the direction of counsel of record to assist counsel of \nrecord in any aspect of the prosecution, defense, or preparation for trial of this action.”  Plaintiff \nclaims that this change is necessary to en sure that its information “is sufficiently protected to the \nextent” that “vendors and service providers, such as document management software vendors” \nhandle it.  However, such vendors and service providers are already included in the definition of \n“Profes sional Vendors” at section 2.15 , and Defendants’ version of the Model P rotective Order \nprovides that Professional Vendors may receive information designated “Confidential” or “Highly \nConfidential” only if disclosure is reasonably necessary for this litigat ion and only if they have \nsigned the “Acknowledgement and Agreement to be Bound.”  ( See Defs.’ Proposed Protectiv e \nOrder § 7.2(e); 7.3(e).)  Plaintiff’s request to expand this definition is denied.  \n Annotation 4 , § 3, “Scope” : Plaintiff seeks to add extens ive language to the provision \ndefining the scope  of the protective order.  Plaintiff proposes adding  that the protective order “is \nnot intended to be used to discover a Party’s Outside Counsel of Record work -product \ninvestigation of the subject matter of t his action,” and that “[a] Party or its Outside Counsel of \nRecord is not permitted to interfere with another Party’s formal or  informal  investigation of the \nsubject matter of this case by directing a Non -Party to refuse to respond to . . . requests for \ncooperation or investigation by a Party . . . or by making unilateral claims of confidentiality that \npurportedly bar the Non [-]Party from cooperating with the investigation or formal discovery of the \nsubject matter of the case.”  Plaintiff states that this pr ovision is necessary because the Almaviva  Case 4:15-cv-00798-HSG   Document 203   Filed 09/18/15   Page 16 of 19 \n17 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  // \n// \nDefendants have “made it a practice to interfere with Loop AI’s third party subpoenas.”   \n The court denies Plaintiff’s request to expand the scope of the protective order.  To the \nextent that Plaintiff contends th at any party has violated the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure  or \nthe court’s Civil Local Rules  in discovery , it may seek relief from the court in accordance with its \nStanding Order.  To the extent Plaintiff contends that a party might make improper claims  of \nconfidentiality to shield information or documents from discovery, the Model Protective Order \ncontains a provision in section 6 to challenge such designations . \n Annotation 5 , § 7.1, “Basic Principles” : Plaintiff seeks to add a provision to the “Basic \nPrinciples” subsection of Section 7, Access To and Use of Protected Material, that prohibits \nparties from transmitting by email any Protected Material designed “Attorneys ’ Eyes Only. ”  \nPlaintiff  proposes that such information be electronically transferred b y a system other than email \nthat “permits the logging and easy deletion from one place of the Protected Materials, and that \ndoes not disseminate the Protected Materials in a manner that (like electronic emails) may be \ndifficult to trace, log, and destroy f ollowing the conclusion of this action.”  Plaintiff argues that \nthis provision is necessary to ensure that all copies of protected materials are destroyed at the \nconclusion of the action, noting counsel’s experience that “when protected materials are permi tted \nto be disseminated by email, it becomes extremely difficult, if not impossible” to ensure \ndestruction.  \n Defendants do not object to the inclusion of this provision.  Given Plaintiff’s concerns \nabout the successful destruction of protected materials, the court grants Plaintiff’s request to \ninclude this revision to the protective order.    \n Annotation 6, § 8, “Prosecution Bar” : Defendants seek to include a prosecution bar that \napplies to any individual who receives access to “Highly Confidential,” “Attor neys’ Eyes Only,” \nor “Highly Confidential -Source Code Information.”  The proposed prosecution bar provides that \nany such individual shall not be involved in the prosecution of patents or patent applications \nrelated to artificial intelligence, including the  patents or patent applications at issue in this action  Case 4:15-cv-00798-HSG   Document 203   Filed 09/18/15   Page 17 of 19 \n18 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  // \n// \nand any patent or application claiming priority to or otherwise related to the patents asserted in this \naction, for two years after final termination of this action.   \n Plaintiff objects to the inclus ion of the prosecution bar in the protective order, expressing \nconcerns that it would prevent a Loop AI attorney from attempting to protect Plaintiff’s own \nmisappropriated intellectual property in any proceedings before the United States Patent and \nTradema rk Office .  Defendants seek the inclusion of the prosecution bar but did not provide any \nsupport for it.  Given Plaintiff’s concerns and Defendants’ failure to support the provision, the \ncourt strikes the prosecution bar from the proposed protective order.  \nOther Proposals : As to Plaintiff’s remaining changes to Defendants’ proposed protective \norder, Plaintiff did not provide any explanation or argument to support their implementation.  The \ncourt has reviewed the proposed changes and finds that they are unne cessary.  See Karl Storz \nEndoscopy -Am., Inc. v. Stryker Corp. , No. 14 -CV-00876 -RS (JSC), 2014 WL 6629431, at *2 \n(N.D. Cal. Nov. 21, 2014)  (“[i]n the ordinary course, the court treats the [Northern District’s] \nmodel protective order as setting forth presumptively reasonable conditions regarding the \ntreatment of highly confidential information. ” (citation omitted)).  Finally, although the procedure \nfor judicial intervention was not addressed in the letter, the court orders the parties to revise \nSection  6.3, “Judicial Intervention,” to reflect the court’s Standing Order regarding resolution of \ndiscovery disputes.  Challenges to confidentiality designations shall be presented to the court for \nadjudication using the joint letter procedure.   \n The court ord ers the parties to create a final version of the protective order in accordance \nwith its rulings set forth above, and to submit it for court approval within seven days of the date \nof this order.   \nIII. CONCLUSION  \nMario Pepe’s deposition shall proceed on a date m utually convenient to the parties and in  \naccordance with this order.  RRA shall produce documents responsive to Plaintiff’s subpoena \nwithin 21 days of the date of this order.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: In this case, Autonomy, Inc. filed a declaratory judgment action in the Northern District of California seeking to invalidate a patent held by Adiscov, LLC, which relates to using artificial intelligence for electronic discovery. Adiscov moved to dismiss the case, arguing that the California court lacks personal jurisdiction over them. The court agreed with Adiscov, ruling that Autonomy failed to establish that Adiscov had sufficient contacts with California to warrant personal jurisdiction, thus granting the motion to dismiss.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the court in California has personal jurisdiction over Adiscov, LLC to entertain a declaratory judgment action regarding the validity and enforceability of a patent.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court held that it does not have personal jurisdiction over Adiscov, LLC, since Autonomy failed to demonstrate that Adiscov engaged in activities sufficiently directed at the state of California. As a result, the motion to dismiss the case was granted.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine you live in California, and someone in Virginia is claiming you owe them money for a tool you say they invented. You go to a local court in California to argue that you don't owe them anything because the tool isn't even legally theirs. The court, however, says it can't help you because the person in Virginia hasn't done enough in California to give the court the power to make decisions about them. The court tells you to go fight this case closer to where the person in Virginia is, as it doesn't think it has the right to judge them from so far away.",

(“ Autonomy”) filed the instant decl aratory judgment action in this \nCourt against Adiscov, LLC, and its sole member, Albert B.

THE PARTIES  \nPlaintiff Autonomy is a corpor ation organized under the la ws of New Jersey and has \nCalifornia as its principal place of business.  Am. Compl. ¶ 2, Dkt. 16 .  Defendant Adiscov, \nLLC, is a Virginia limited liability company whic h holds the rights to the ‘760 patent, \nentitled Method and System for Providing El ectronic Discovery on Computer Databases \nand Archives Using Artificial Intelligence to  Recover Legally Relevant Data.  Id.  ¶¶ 1, 3; \nsee also  Compl. Ex. A, Dkt. 1.  Mr. Krachman resi des in Virginia, and is alleged to be the \nowner and alter ego of Adiscov, LLC.  Am. Compl. ¶¶ 4-5.   \nB. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS  \nOn May 17, 2010, Adiscov commenced a patent infringement lawsuit against \nAutonomy and two other entitie s, FTI Consulting, Inc. (“ FTI”) and Recommind, Inc. \n(“Recommind”), in the Eastern District of  Virginia, Alexandria Division.  See  Adiscov, \nLLC v. Autonomy Corp. , No. C 10-00218 RBS (E.D. Vir.); Def.’s Mot.  Ex. A, Dkt. 12-1.1  \nIn its amended complaint filed on May 21, 20 10, Adiscov alleged th at Autonomy, FTI and \nRecommind manufactured, used and sold produc ts that infringe the ‘760 patent.  See  C 10-\n00218 RBS, Dkt. 3 ¶¶ 15-17.  On December 21,  2010, Autonomy, later joined by the other \ndefendants, filed a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss.  The Virgin ia district court granted the \nmotion on January 27, 2011, and dismissed the action.  Id. , Dkt. 68.  The court did not grant \nAdiscov leave to amend, but dismissed the claims without  prejudice.  Id.  \nOn January 28, 2011, the day after the Ad iscov’s Virginia action was dismissed, \nAutonomy commenced th e instant action in this Court  against Adiscov seeking a \ndeclaration of invalidity, unen forceability and non-in fringement as to the ‘760 patent.  \nDkt. 1.  Autonomy filed an amended comp laint on February 10 , 2011.  Dkt. 16. \n                                                 \n1 The Court may properly take judicial notice of the proceedings in the Eastern \nDistrict of Virginia.  See  Bennett v. Medtronic, Inc. , 285 F.3d 801, 803 n.2 (9th Cir. 2002) \n(noting that a district court “‘may take noti ce of proceedings in ot her courts, both within \nand without the federal judicial  system, if those proceedings  have a direct relation to \nmatters at issue.’”). Case 4:11-cv-00420-SBA   Document 52   Filed 06/03/11   Page 2 of 9 \n- 3 - \n \n  1 \n2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 \n10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 In the meantime, on February 2, 2011, Adis cov filed a second lawsuit in the Eastern \nDistrict of Virginia, Alexandria Division,  against Autonomy, FTI and Recommind.  See  \nAdiscov, LLC v. Autonomy Corp. , No. C 11-00116 GBL (E.D. Va .), Dkt. 1.  On March 22, \n2011, Autonomy filed a Rule 12(b )(6) motion to dismiss.  Id. , Dkt. 12, 13.  Instead of ruling \non the motion, on April 7, 2011, the district court transferred the action under 28 U.S.C. \n§ 1404(a) to the Norfolk Division of th e Eastern District of Virginia.  Id. , Dkt. 21. \nC. MOTION BEFORE THE COURT  \nNow before this Court is Adiscov’s mo tion to dismiss for lack of personal \njurisdiction.  Dkt. 22.  In its  motion, Adiscov claims that Au tonomy lacks th e substantial, \ncontinuous and systematic contacts necessary for general jurisdiction, and the requisite \nminimum contacts for specific jurisdiction.  Dk t. 28, 30.  Adiscov alternatively contends \nthat the instant action sh ould be dismissed under the first- to-file rule, which permits a court \nin a later-filed action to dismiss, transfer or stay the action in the interests of judicial \nefficiency.  To the extent the Court declines to dismiss the action, Adiscov seeks to have \nthe action transferred to the Eastern District of  Virginia for the convenience of the parties \nand witnesses, pursuant to  28 U.S.C. § 1404(a).   \nAutonomy does not contend that the Court ha s general jurisdiction over Adiscov, but \ninstead, argues that specific jurisdiction is  present based Adis cov allegedly having \n“systematically targeting Auto nomy and other companies in the legal software industry, \nseeking to license the ‘760 patent .”  Pl.’s Opp’n at 1, 6-7, Dkt.  34.  As to the first-to-file \nrule, Autonomy points  out that there was no action pendi ng in the Eastern District of \nVirginia when it commen ced the instant declaratory judgment  action in this Court.  Finally, \nAutomony argues that the relevant convenien ce factors germane to § 1404(a) transfer \nanalysis weigh in favor of main taining the action in this forum.   As will be set forth below, \nthe Court finds that Autonomy has failed to ca rry its burden of demonstrating a prima facie Case 4:11-cv-00420-SBA   Document 52   Filed 06/03/11   Page 3 of 9 \n- 4 - \n \n  1 \n2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 \n10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 case of specific jurisdiction over Adiscov.  As such, the Court does not reach Adiscov’s \nalternative arguments for dismissal or transfer.2 \nII. LEGAL  STANDARD  \nDistrict courts have the authority to dismiss an action for lack of personal \njurisdiction.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(2).  Federal Circuit law governs the issue of personal \njurisdiction in a patent-related case.  Nuance  Commc’ns, Inc. v. Abbyy Software House , \n626 F.3d 1222, 1231 (Fed. Cir. 2010).  “To survive a motion to  dismiss in the absence of \njurisdictional discovery, [a plain tiff] need only make a prima fa cie showing of jurisdiction.”  \nId.  “Without discovery and a r ecord on jurisdiction, this c ourt must resolve all factual \ndisputes in the plaintiff’s favor.”  Id.   In addition, where the factual allegations are not \ndirectly controverted, they are accepted as true  for purposes of determining jurisdiction.  Id.  \nIII. DISCUSSION  \n“Determining whether personal jurisdiction exists over an out-of-state defendant \ninvolves two inquiries:  whether a forum state’ s long-arm statute permits service of process, \nand whether the assertion of personal jurisd iction would violate due process.”  Inamed \nCorp. v. Kuzmak , 249 F.3d 1356, 1 359 (Fed. Cir. 2001).   “[B] ecause California’s long-arm \nstatute is coextensive with the limits of due pr ocess, the two inquiries collapse into a single \ninquiry:  whether jurisdiction co mports with due process.”  Id.  (citing Cal. Code Civ. P. \n§ 410.10).  The exercise of jurisdiction over non-re sident defendants violates due process \nunless those defendants have “minimum contacts” with the forum state so  that the exercise \nof jurisdiction “does not offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.”  Int’l \nShoe Co. v. Washington , 326 U.S. 310, 316 (1945).  The minimum contacts must be such \n                                                 \n2 Autonomy also contends that the Court should deny Adiscov’s motion based on the \nfailure of its counsel to meet and confer prior to filing the instant motion, as required by the \nStanding Orders of this Court.  See  Dkt. 15.  The Court doe s not countenance Adiscov’s \ncounsel’s failure to comp ly with the Court’s meet and confer  requirement.  Nonetheless, the \nCourt will proceed with the adjudication of the motion to avoid delay, and since the motion \nhas been fully briefed and the issues are ripe for adjudication.  Separately, the Court notes \nthat Adiscov filed a surreply, without first seek ing and obtaining leave of Court to do so, in \nviolation of Local Rule 7-1(d ).  The Court will not consider  Adiscov’s improper surreply, \nwhich is otherwise inapposite to the issues now presented. Case 4:11-cv-00420-SBA   Document 52   Filed 06/03/11   Page 4 of 9 \n- 5 - \n \n  1 \n2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 \n10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 that a defendant “should reasona bly anticipate being haled into court” in the forum state.  \nWorld-Wide Volkswagen Corp. v. Woodson , 444 U.S. 286, 297 (1980).   \n“Depending on their nature  and number, a defendant’s contacts with a forum can \nprovide a court with general jurisdiction or spec ific jurisdiction.”  Synthes (U.S.A.) v. G.M. \nDos Reis Jr. Ind. Com de Equip. Medico , 563 F.3d 1285, 1297 (Fed . Cir. 2009).  General \njurisdiction exists when a de fendant maintains “c ontinuous and systematic” contacts with \nthe forum state even if  the cause of action has no relation to those contacts.  Helicopteros \nNacionales de Colombia, S.A. v. Hall , 466 U.S. 408, 414 (1984).  Where a defendant is not \nsubject to general jurisdiction in the forum st ate, a district court may nonetheless exercise \nspecific jurisdiction over the defe ndant if the cause of action “ar ises out of” or “relates to” \nthe defendant’s in-state  activity.  Burger Ki ng Corp. v. Rudzewicz , 471 U.S. 462, 472-73 \n(1985).  “In order to satisfy due process requi rements for establishing specific jurisdiction \nover a defendant, the plaintiff must show that the defendant purposely directed its activities \nat residents of the forum and that the plain tiff’s claim arises from or relates to those \nactivities.  In addition, the pl aintiff must satisfy the court that the assertion of personal \njurisdiction under the circumstances is reas onable and fair.”  Radio Sys. Corp. v. \nAccession, Inc. , 638 F.3d 785, 789 (Fed. Cir. 2011).  \n“Because declaratory judgment actions ra ise non-infringement,  invalidity, and/or \nunenforceability issues central to enforcement of the patent s in question, [the Federal \nCircuit has] looked be yond the ‘arises out of’ inquiry and have found jurisdiction where \nsuch ‘other activities’ in some identifiable way ‘relate to ’ enforcement of those patents in \nthe forum.”  Avocent Huntsville Corp. v. Aten Int’l Co., Ltd.  552 F.3d 1324, 1333 (Fed. \nCir. 2008).  Under this standard, the act of th reatening a party with an infringement lawsuit \nis, standing alone, insufficient to es tablish personal jurisdiction.  Id.   Rather, the plaintiff \nmust show that the patentee enga ged in “‘other activities’ that relate to the enforcement or \nthe defense of the validity of the relevant patents[.]”  Id.   The “other activ ities” identified in \nAvocent  include “initiating judicial or ex tra-judicial patent enforcement within the forum , \nor entering into an exclusive  license agreement or othe r undertaking which imposes Case 4:11-cv-00420-SBA   Document 52   Filed 06/03/11   Page 5 of 9 \n- 6 - \n \n  1 \n2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 \n10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 enforcement obligations with a party residing or  regularly doing business in the forum.”  Id.  \n(emphasis added). \nThough Autonomy does not a llege that the Court has general jurisdiction over \nAdiscov, it avers that the Court has specific jurisdiction based on Adiscov’s conduct in \ndirecting its patent enforcement activities at Autonomy in California, as well as other \ncompanies which are based in or that do busine ss in California.  However, the actions cited \nby Automony are far too attenuated to support a showing of personal ju risdiction.  The only \nspecific activity relating to the ‘760 patent and Automony supported by the record is a \nmeeting held at the office of Au tonomy’s counsel in Palo Alto, California, on November 3, \n2010, to discuss the potential settlement of Adiscov’s infringe ment claims, and Adiscov’s \nsubsequent lawsuit against Autonomy in Virginia.  See  Am. Compl. ¶ 9; Pl.’s Opp’n at 7.  \nFederal Circuit precedent is clear, however, that discrete acts of threatening legal action are \ninsufficient to show speci fic jurisdiction.  See  Avocent , 552 F.3d at 1333 (noting that for \n“policy considerations unique to the patent context ... letters threatening suit for patent \ninfringement sent to the alleged infringer by themselves do not suffice to create personal \njurisdiction.”) (internal citations omitted) ; Red Wing Shoe Co., Inc. v. Hockerson-\nHalberstadt, Inc. , 148 F.3d 1355, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 1 998) (“A patentee should not subject \nitself to personal jurisdiction in  a forum solely by  informing a party who happens to be \nlocated there of susp ected infringement.”). \nAutomony contends that Ad iscov’s contacts with th e forum extend beyond its \nmeeting in Palo Alto, and that the Court also should take into  account Adiscov’s efforts to \nenforce the ‘760 patent agains t companies with headquarters in San Francisco, such as \nAutonomy and Recommind.  Pl.’s  Opp’n at 6-7.  Though not entirely clear from its papers, \nAutomony appears to be referri ng to the lawsuit originally  brought by Adiscov against \nAutonomy and others in the East ern District of Virginia.  T hough acknowledg ed by neither \nparty, this Court has previously found that patent litigation commenced  outside the forum is \nnot probative of purposeful availment.  In  Juniper Networks, Inc. v. SSL Servs., LLC , No. \nC 08-5758 SBA, 2009 WL 3837266 (N.D. Cal. Nov. 16, 2009), aff’d , 2010 WL 5140471 Case 4:11-cv-00420-SBA   Document 52   Filed 06/03/11   Page 6 of 9 \n- 7 - \n \n  1 \n2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 \n10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 (Fed. Cir. Dec. 13, 2010) (unpublished), the Court rejected plaintiff’s contention the \npatentee’s patent infringement lawsuit agains t filed in a Texas federal court constituted \nenforcement activity w ithin the forum.  The Court explained: \nHere, the enforcement activ ity involving the Citrix \nentities transpired in Texas, not California. Tellingly, Juniper cites no authority to support its novel argument that the act of filing a lawsuit against an alleged California resident—in a Texas district court—is sufficient to make a prima facie showing that it has purposefully availed “itself of the privilege of conducting activities within th e forum State, thus invoking \nthe benefits and protections  of its laws.” Avocent\n, 552 F.3d at \n1329 (internal quotation and c itation omitted).  Nor does such \nan argument make any logical sens e. Under Juniper’s theory of \npersonal jurisdiction, a defenda nt would automatically be \nsubject to personal jurisdiction in a forum where it previously \nsued an entity that happened to conduc t business in that \nparticular state, even where the lawsuit was filed in an entirely \ndifferent state. \nId. at *4.  Thus, for the same reas ons expressed in Juniper Networks , the Court finds that \nthe fact that Adiscov su ed Autonomy and Recommind in Virginia  does not show \nenforcement activity within this forum.3 \nNext, Autonomy attempts to make much of the fact that Adiscov issued a patent \nlicense to Kroll Ontrack, Inc., (“Kroll”), “a competitor of Autonomy … that competes with \nAutonomy for busine ss in California from its offices in California.”  Pl.’s Opp’n at 6-8.  \nHowever, such allegations, even if true, are of  marginal relevance to the issue of personal \njurisdiction.  As noted, the salient question is presented is whether Adiscov purposefully \ndirected its activities at “resid ents of the forum.”  Inamed , 249 F.3d at 1359.  Kroll is not a \nresident of California; rather, it is incorporat ed and headquartered in Minnesota.  Reply Ex. \nA, Dkt. 39.  Moreover, Auto nomy cites no authority for th e proposition that issuing a non-\nexclusive  license to any competitor of the plaintiff constitutes enforcement act ivity in the \n                                                 \n3 As an ancillary matter, Autonomy also contends th at Adiscov’s “purposeful \ncontacts” are shown by “foreclosing competiti on through the assertion of sham patent \nlitigation” based on the ‘760 patent, allegedly to the detriment of California consumers.  \nPl.’s Opp’n at 7.  Though again not entirely clear from its papers, Au tonomy again appears \nto be making reference to the lawsuit in itiated by Adiscov against Autonomy, Recommind \nand Stolz in the Eastern District of Virginia .  However, as discussed above, the patentee’s \nfiling a lawsuit against a resident of the forum in another state is insufficient to establish \npersonal jurisdiction over patentee. Case 4:11-cv-00420-SBA   Document 52   Filed 06/03/11   Page 7 of 9 \n- 8 - \n \n  1 \n2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 \n10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 forum.  If that were the case, a patentee wo uld be subject to personal jurisdiction in any \nstate where that licensee has a physical presence.  See  Red Wing Shoe , 148 F.3d at 1361 \n(holding that the fact that the patentee co nducted business with a li censee that conducted \nbusiness in the forum state was “insuffici ent to submit [the patentee] to personal \njurisdiction in the state,” and that to conc lude otherwise would “s ubject a defendant to \nnationwide personal jurisdiction if it decides to do business with a company that does \nbusiness nationwide.”). \nFinally, Autonomy’s attempt to analogize this action to Akro Corp. v. Luker , 45 \nF.3d 1541 (Fed. Cir. 1995) is mi splaced.  In that case, plai ntiff Akro Corporation (“Akro ”) \nbrought a declaratory judgment action in an Ohio  federal district court seeking a declaration \nof non-infringement, invalidity and unenforcea bility against the patentee of a floor mat \ndesign.  Akro was an Ohio corporation ba sed in Ohio, while th e patentee resided in \nCalifornia.  On appeal, the Federal Circuit re versed the district court’s dismissal of the \naction for lack of personal jurisdiction.  In  finding that the patentee had purposefully \ndirected his activities at Ohio, the court specifically focused on the fact that the patentee \nhad initiated contact with Akro  in Ohio, initially by sending a warning letter and later by \nengaging in by three years of negotiations , which included five additional letters \nthreatening litigation.  Id.  at 1542, 1546.  In addition, th e court emphasized that the patentee \nhad entered into an exclusive  licensing agreement with another Ohio corporation  regarding \nthe same patent, which created “continuing obligations” between  the patentee and the Ohio-\nbased competitor, and eliminated  any possibility of a licensing agreement with Akro.  Id.   \nThis, the court concluded, was sufficient to s how that the patentee “directed activities at \nresidents of Ohio within the meaning of the due process inquiry mand ated by Burger King  \nand International Shoe .”  Id.  \nThis case is readily di stinguishable from Akro .  In Akro , the patentee’s purposeful \ndirection was established by the fact the lawsuit was preceded by several years of \nnegotiations and six letters sent by the pate ntee threatening litigation, as well as the \npatentee’s execution of an exclusive patent license agreement with another corporation Case 4:11-cv-00420-SBA   Document 52   Filed 06/03/11   Page 8 of 9 \n- 9 - \n \n  1 \n2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 \n10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 based in the forum.  Here, there was a singl e meeting between Auto nomy and Adiscov, and \nno subsequent negotiations, letters or threats of litigation.  In addition, Kroll is not \nincorporated or based in California nor was the licensing agreement Adiscov entered into \nwith Kroll exclusive.  Thus , the factors which the Akro  court found compelling in terms of \nthe patentee’s continuing obligations with th e forum simply are ab sent from this case. \nIV. CONCLUSION  \nFor the reasons set forth above, \nIT IS HEREBY ORDE RED THAT Adiscov’s motion to dismiss for lack of personal \njurisdiction is GRANTED.  Adiscov’s alterna tive motion to transfer is DENIED as moot. \nThe Clerk shall close the file a nd terminate any pending matters. \n IT IS SO ORDERED. \nDated:  June 2, 2011     _____________ __________________ \nSAUNDRA BROWN ARMSTRONG \nUnited States District Judge   \nCase 4:11-cv-00420-SBA   Document 52   Filed 06/03/11   Page 9 of 9",

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: In the case of *Blue Spike, LLC v. Google Inc.*, Blue Spike alleged that Google's products infringed on five of its patents related to electronic content comparison. The court granted Google's motion for judgment on the pleadings, finding the asserted claims invalid as they embodied an unpatentable abstract idea under Section 101 of the Patent Act. The patents involved described a computer-implemented system and method for generating \"abstracts\" or digital fingerprints from signals for comparison purposes, but this was deemed an idea too abstract to be patented. \n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the asserted patents, which broadly cover computer-based content comparisons, are invalid as they embody an unpatentable abstract idea under Section 101 of the Patent Act.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court held that the patents were directed to an abstract idea, specifically the concept of \"comparing one thing to another,\" and lacked any inventive concept to transform this abstract idea into patent-eligible subject matter.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine you made a really cool way to compare things like music, pictures, or videos using a computer, by turning them into tiny summaries that a computer could compare quickly. You thought this new way was so cool you wanted to get a patent on it so no one else could use your idea without permission. But the court said, \"Sorry, that's just too close to the basic idea of comparing things; anyone could think of doing it this way, so it's not special enough to get a patent.”",

No. 59  \n \nDefendant Google Inc. (“Google”) moves for judgment on the pleadings, arguing the \nasserted claims of the patents -in-suit—which broadly cover  computer -based content \ncomparisons —are invalid as embodying an unpatentable “abstract idea” under Section 101 of the \nPatent Act.  (Dkt. No. 59 (“Mot .”).)  Plaintiff Blue Spike, LLC (“Blue Spike”) opposes the \nmotion.  (Dkt. No. 63 (“Oppo.”).)  Having carefully considered the papers submitted, the patent s-\nin-suit, the record in this case, and the arguments of counsel  at the June 30, 2015 hearing , and \ngood cause shown, the Court GRANTS  the motion . \nI. BACKGROUND  \nThe plaintiff asserts five patents in this lawsuit: U.S. Patent Nos. 7,346,472 (the “’472 \nPatent ”), 7,660,700 (the “’700 Patent ”), 7,949,494 (the “’494 Patent ”), 8,214,175 (the “’175 \nPatent ”), and 8,712,728  (the “’728 Patent ”).1  Other than the first, each is a continuation of the \n                                                 \n1 The plaintiff filed copies of each patent as attachments to its initial complaint.  (Dkt. No. \n1.)  The defendant filed additional copies, with the asserted claims highlighted, as exhibits to the \ninstant motion.  (Dkt. No. 60.)  The asserted claims are as follows: 1 -4, 8, and 11 of the ’472 \nPatent; 1, 10 -12, 18, 21, 27, 40, and 51 of the ’700 Patent; 11, 15, 17, and 29 o f the ’494 Patent; 1, \n8, 11, 12, 16, and 17 of the ’175 Patent; and 1, 4, 5, 16, 25, and 26 of the ’728 Patent.  (See Mot. at \n4; Oppo. at 3 n.2.)  The parties dispute whether claim 30 of the ’728 Patent remains at issue .  \nHowever, as the motion was not dir ected to that claim , neither is this Order.   (See Oppo. at 3 n.2; \nDkt. No. 64 (“Reply”) at 15 n.9.)  Case 4:14-cv-01650-YGR   Document 75   Filed 09/08/15   Page 1 of 18 \n2 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  preceding application.  All five are entitled “Method and Device for Monitoring and Analyzing \nSignals”  and share the same specification.   The patents include both met hod and system claims.  \nGenerally, the patents address  the creation of “abstract s” (essentially digital fingerprints , hashes, \nor the like ) from various “signals” (electronic versions of human -perceptible works in formats \nsuch as audio, visual, audiovisual,  or text)  based on perceptible qualities inherent to those signals .2  \nThe abstracts of “reference signals” are added to a reference database.  Thereafter, new signals \n(“query signals”) can be similarly  processed , the resulting abstract checked against the database to \ndetermine whether the new signal matches any earlier analyzed signal.  At a high level, the patents \ncontemplate determining whether one piece of content —e.g., a picture, a song , or a video —\nmatches another , or the extent to which they are simil ar.  The plaintiff accuses Google’s “products, \nsystems and/or services ,” including ContentID and YouTube , of infringement .  (Dkt. No. 47 \n(“FAC ”) ¶ 28.)   The plaintiff also contends the patents cover a wide array of comparison \ntechnologies, including biomet ric systems  such as iris scanners.  ( See Oppo. at 20.)  \nThe Court finds that c laim 1 of the ’472 Patent is generally representative of all asserted \nclaims for purposes of this motion.3  It reads as follows:  \n \nA method for monitoring and analyzing at least on e signal \ncomprising:  \n \nreceiving at least one reference signal to be monitored;  \n \ncreating an abstract of said at least one reference signal \nwherein the step of creating an abstract of said at least one \n                                                 \n2 The specification contrasts this approach of relying on perceptual qualities inherent in the \nsignal with what it calls the “traditional” or prior art app roach of employing an “additive signal” \n(e.g., adding something to the signal, such as a title or watermark, to facilitate future identification \nand comparison).  See ’728 Patent at 4:53 -55, 4:66 -5:4, 5:15 -25. \n3 Plaintiff did not stipulate to the use of th is or any other representative claim(s) for \npurposes of this motion.  Therefore, the Court must consider every claim at issue.  Nevertheless, \nbecause 31 claims spanning five patents are asserted , and in light of the fact that each is \n“substantially similar  and linked to the same abstract idea,” the Court finds the following approach \nto resolving this motion justified: addressing first, in detail, a single, broadly representative claim \n(claim 1 of the ’472 Patent), and then explaining briefly why any materia l distinctions or \nadditional limitations in each of the other claims are irrelevant to the ultimate conclusion of \ninvalidity.

See Blue Spike, LLC v. \n                                                 \n4 This is an obvious typographical error.   While the parties have not raised the issue of \nwhether this is an error, the Court assumes for purposes of ruling on this this motion that the ’472 \nPatent should read “least” instead of “feast. ”  The Court may only correct an obvious \ntypographical error w hen, from the perspective of a person of ordinary skill in the art, “(1) the \ncorrection is not subject to reasonable debate based on consideration of the claim language and the \nspecification and (2) the prosecution history does not suggest a different inte rpretation of the \nclaims.”  Ultimax Cement Mfg. Corp. v. CTS Cement Mfg. Corp ., 587 F.3d 1339, 1352 -53 (Fed. \nCir. 2009) (citing Novo Industries, L.P. v. Micro Molds Corp. , 350 F.3d 1348, 1354 (Fed. Cir. \n2003)).  The Court therefore corrects this obvious ty pographical error for purposes of this motion, \nsubstituting “least” for “feast.”  See Ultimax , 587 F.3d at 1353 (reversing district court’s finding of \nclaim indefiniteness where the district court should have instead inserted a missing comma into a \nchemica l formula in a claim because a person of ordinary skill would have recognized and fixed \nthe error).

At the hearing, Google stipulated to the adoption of those \nconstructions solely for purposes of resolving its motion  for judgment on the pleadings .5  Most \ncritically in terms of the plaintiff’s argument, the Texas court construed “abstract” as “ a data -\nreduced repre sentation of a signal that retains a perceptual relationship with the signal and \ndifferentiates the data -reduced representation from other data -reduced representations .”  (Id. at \n*14.)  \nThe Court further notes that the specification does not teach the spec ifics of \nimplementation —it includes no source code, detailed  algorithms or formulas, or the like.  \nII. LEGAL STANDARD  \nUnder Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(c), judgment on the pleadings may be granted \nwhen, accepting as true all material allegations contain ed in the nonmoving party ’s pleadings, the \nmoving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.  Chavez v. United States , 683 F.3d 1102, \n1108 (9th Cir. 2012).  The applicable standard is essentially identical to the standard for a motion \nto dismiss und er Rule  12(b)(6).  United States ex rel. Cafasso v. Gen. Dynamics C4 Sys., Inc. , 637 \nF.3d 1047, 105 4 n.4 (9th Cir. 2011).  Thus, although the Court must accept well -pleaded facts as \ntrue, it is not required to accept mere conclusory allegations or conclusions of law.  See Ashcroft v. \nIqbal , 556 U.S. 662, 678 –79 (2009) . \nIn ruling on a motion for judgment on the pleadings, the Court “need not . . . accept as true \nallegations that contradict matters properly subject to judicial notice or by exhibit ” attached to the \ncomplaint.  Sprewell v. Golden State Warriors , 266 F.3d 979, 988 (9th Cir. 2001) (citation \nomitted).   A challenge  under Section 101 of the Patent Act may be brought as a motion for \njudgment on the pleadings.  See Open Text S.A. v. Box, Inc. , No. 13 -CV-04910 -JD, 2015 WL \n269036, at *2 (N.D. Cal. Jan. 20, 2015)  (citing buySAFE, Inc. v.

The Court sees no reason to depart from the Prior Construction in the case of \nthe ’728 Patent in light of the similarity of all five patents at issue, which, as noted above, share \nthe same specification.  Case 4:14-cv-01650-YGR   Document 75   Filed 09/08/15   Page 4 of 18 \n5 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  1352 (Fed.  Cir. 2014) ).  A court may decide such a motion prior to claim construction.  See \nBancorp Servs., L.L.C. v. Sun Life Assur. Co. of Canada (U.S.) , 687 F.3d 1266, 1273 -74 (Fed. Cir. \n2012)  (“[C] laim construction is not an inviolable prerequisite to a val idity determination under § \n101.  We note, however, that it will ordinarily be desirable —and often necessary —to resolve \nclaim construction disputes prior to a § 101 analysis, for the determination of patent eligibility \nrequires a full understanding of the basic character of the claimed subject matter .”). \nIII. DISCUSSION  \nA. Legal Framework  \nThe scope of subject matter eligible for patent protection is defined in Section 101 of the \nPatent Act: “ Whoever invents or discovers any new and useful process, machine, manufact ure, or \ncomposition of matter, or any new and useful improvement thereof, may obtain a patent therefor, \nsubject to the conditions  and requirements of this title .”  35 U.S.C. § 101.   The Supreme Court has \n“long held that this provision contains an important  implicit exception: Laws of nature, natural \nphenomena, and abstract ideas are not patentable.”  Alice Corp. Pty. v. CLS Bank Int’l , 134 S. Ct. \n2347, 2354 (2014)  (“Alice ”) (quoting Ass’n for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics, Inc. , 133 \nS. Ct. 2107, 21 16 (2013)).  In applying this exception, courts “must distinguish between patents \nthat claim the building blocks of human ingenuity and those that integrate the building blocks into \nsomething more.”  Alice , 134 S. Ct. at 2354 (internal quotat ions and alterations omitted); see also  \nMayo Collaborative Servs. v. Prometheus Labs., Inc. , 132 S.  Ct. 1289, 1301 (2012) .   \nThus, i n determining whether claims are patent -ineligible, a court  must first determine \nwhether they are directed to a patent -inelig ible concept, such as an abstract idea.   See Diamond v. \nChakrabarty , 447 U.S. 303, 309 (1980).   “A principle, in the abstract, is a fundamental truth . . . \n[which] cannot be patented.”  Gottschalk v. Benson , 409 U.S. 63, 67 (1972) (internal citations and \nquotatio ns omitted) .  “Phenomena of nature, though just discovered, mental processes, and \nabstract intellectual concepts are not patentable, as they are the basic tools of scientific and \ntechnological work.”  Id.; see also CyberSource Corp. v. Retail Decisi ons, Inc. , 654 F.3d 1366, \n1371 (Fed. Cir. 2011) (“[M]ental processes are not patent -eligible subject matter because the \n‘application of [only] human intelligence to the solution of practical problems is no more than a Case 4:14-cv-01650-YGR   Document 75   Filed 09/08/15   Page 5 of 18 \n6 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  claim to a fundamental principle.’”).   To determine whether patent claims are directed to an \nabstract idea , the Court must  “distill[] the gist of the claim[s].”  Open Text S.A , 2015 WL 269036, \nat *2 (citing Bilski v. Kappos , 561 U.S. 593 , 611 -12 (2010) ). \nIf the claims are directed to an abstract idea , a court must then consider whether the y \nnevertheless involve an “inventive concept” such that “the patent in practice amounts to \nsignificantly more than a patent upon the [ineligible concept] itself.”  Alice , 134 S. Ct. at 2355 \n(quoting Mayo , 132 S.  Ct. at 1294) ; see also DDR Holdings, LLC v. Hotels.com, L.P. , 773 F.3d \n1245, 1255 (Fed. Cir. 2014)  (“Distinguishing between claims that recite a patent -eligible invention \nand claims that add too little to a patent -ineligible abstract concept can b e difficult, as the line \nseparating the two is not always clear .”).  “For the role of a computer in a computer -implemented \ninvention to be deemed meaningful in the context of this analysis, it must involve more than \nperformance of ‘well-understood, routine , [and] conventional activities previously known to the \nindustry .’”  Content Extraction & Transmission LLC v. Wells Fargo Bank, Nat. Ass ’n, 776 F.3d \n1343, 1347 -48 (Fed. Cir. 2014)  (alteration in original);  see also  buySAFE, Inc. v. Google, Inc. , 765 \nF.3d 1350, 1354 (Fed. Cir. 2014)  (“The Court in Alice  made clear that a claim directed to an \nabstract idea does not move into section 101 eligibility territory by ‘merely requir[ing] generic \ncomputer implementation. ’”) (alteration in original).  \nThe burden of establishing invalidity rests on the movant.  See Microsoft Corp. v. i4i Ltd. \nP’ship, 131 S. Ct. 2238, 2245  (2011)  (citing 35 U.S.C.A. § 282 ).  However, on a motion for \njudgment on the pleadings for invalidity, where no extrinsic evidence is considered, th e “clear and \nconvincing” standard for weighing evidence in determining a patent’s validity is inapplicable.  See \nShortridge v. Found. Constr. Payroll Serv. , LLC, No. 14 -CV-04850 -JCS, 2015 WL 1739256, at \n*7 (N.D. Cal. Apr. 14, 2015)  (citing Modern Telecom S ys. LLC v. Earthlink, Inc. , No. 14 -CV-\n0347 -DOC, 2015 WL 1239992, at *8 (C.D. Cal.

Cir. 2014) .  \n Patents covering a method for optical character recognition in connection with \nscanning  hard copy documents were directed to an abstract idea and, even if limited \n“to a particular technological environment,” were invalid because “[s]uch a \nlimitation has been held insufficient to save a claim in this context.”  Content \nExtraction  & Transmission LLC v. Wells Fargo Bank, Nat. Ass ’n, 776 F.3d 1343, \n1348 (Fed.

Case 4:14-cv-01650-YGR   Document 75   Filed 09/08/15   Page 7 of 18 \n8 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  Notably, however, in DDR Holdings, LLC v. Hotels.com, L.P. , the Federal Cir cuit upheld a \nfinding of validity as to a patent with claims “ directed to systems and methods of generating a \ncomposite web page that combines certain visual elements of a ‘host’ website with content of a \nthird -party merchant. ”  773 F.3d 1245, 1248 (Fed. Cir. 2014)  (“For example, the generated \ncomposite web page may combine the logo, background color, and fonts of the host website with \nproduct information from the merchant .”).  The Federal Circuit found the patent “ address [es] a \nbusiness challenge (retaining website visitors)  . . . particular to the Internet ,” but cautioned “ that \nnot all claims purporting to address Internet -centric challenges are eligible for  patent.”  Id. at \n1257 -59.  \nB. Analysis  \n1. Abstract Idea  \nAs a threshold ma tter, the Court must determine whether the asserted claims are directed to \nan abstract idea.  The Court finds that the claims at issue are generally directed to the abstract \nconcept of c omparing one thing to another.   \nThe patents seek to “model,” on a computer, “the highly effective ability of humans to \nidentify and recognize a signal.”  ( See ’728 Patent at 4:4 7-48.)  By their own terms, therefore, the \npatents simply seek to cover a general purpose computer implementation of an abstract idea long \nundert aken within the human mind.  See Content Extraction & Transmission LLC v. Wells Fargo \nBank, Nat. Ass ’n, 776 F.3d 1343, 1347 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (“The concept of data collection, \nrecognition, and storage is undisputedly well -known.  Indeed, humans have alwa ys performed \nthese functions.”).  Despite the opinion of plaintiff’s expert, on their face the patents do not \npurport to recognize aspects of the compared works that only a computer —but not a human —\ncould reasonably detect.  The specification itself emphasizes  the goal of modeling human capacity.  \nNothing in the claim language suggests the patents were not intended to encompass computerized \ncontent comparisons based on human -perceptible characteristics.  To the contrary, the Prior \nConstruction of “ab stract” (a key term at issue in every asserted claim ) states that the abstract has \na “perceptual relationship” to the signal, and the Prior Construction for related term s reveals  the Case 4:14-cv-01650-YGR   Document 75   Filed 09/08/15   Page 8 of 18 \n9 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  patents are generally directed to hu man-observable aspects of signals.6 \nThe method by which the claims contemplate enabling these comparisons mirrors the \nmanner in which the human mind undertakes the same task.  Perceptible characteristics of an item \n(e.g., a photograph) are used as a heuris tic to compare that item to others.  For instance, to borrow \nan example from the specification, one might compare paintings of sunsets by focusing on \n“perceptual characteristics related to the sun,” e.g., its color or position.  ’728 Patent at 14:52 -60; \nsee also id.  (“The present invention  . . . involves the scanning of an image involving a sun, \ncompressing the data to its essential characteristics (i.e., those perceptual characteristics related to \nthe sun) and then finding matches in a database of other vi sual images (stored as compressed or \neven uncompressed data).  By studying the work of other artists using such techniques, a novice, \nfor example, could learn much by comparing the presentations of a common theme by different \nartists. ”).  One might also identify a criminal by comparing a police artist sketch to various suspect \nphotographs .  Id. at 14:61 -64.  True, certain asserted claims involve only a subset of the mental \nprocess —e.g., creating the “abstract,” but not necessarily using it for anything.  That these claims \ncover only a part of the broader abstract idea does not rescue them from falling within the realm of \nthe abstract.  \nBlue Spike argues, with the support of an expert declaration, that its claims cover an \ninvention that can accomplish compa risons beyond a human’s capabilities.  ( See Papakonstantinou \nDecl., Dkt. No. 63 -11, at ¶¶ 13 -17 (opining that the creation of an abstract as contemplated in the \npatents -in-suit “requires use of a computing device configured to utilize data -reduction \ntechni ques” which a human “would not be capable” of mentally performing , particularly where \n“accuracy (down  to even a single bit) .  . . is essential”).)  Even if credited, t his premise is legally \nfalse ; the claims may be abstract even if they contemplate use of “a computer that processe[s] \nstreams of bits.”  See Content Extraction & Transmission LLC v. Wells Fargo Bank, Nat. Ass ’n, \n                                                 \n6 For instance, pursuant to the stipulation of the parties in that case, including plaintiff Blue \nSpike, the order construed “perceptual quality” as being a “quality perceived by a person ” and \n“recognizable characteristic” as a “characteristic visually or aurally perceived by a person .”  See \nPrior Construction  at *30 (emphasis supplied ). Case 4:14-cv-01650-YGR   Document 75   Filed 09/08/15   Page 9 of 18 \n10 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  776 F.3d 1343, 1347 (Fed. Cir. 2014)  (citing Alice , 134 S.  Ct. at 2358 ). \nBlue Spike further disputes Google’s contention that a paten t that seeks to mirror human \nperception and analysis on a computer is abstract  with a “slippery slope” argument,  contending \nsuch a finding would also render future breakthroughs in artificial intelligence technology un -\npatentable.  To the extent artificial  intelligence inventions —or the present “invention” —involve \nan inventive concept , they could be patentable even if they have, at their core, an abstract concept.  \nThe Court thus turns to the question of whether the asserted claims include an inventive concept. \n2. Inventive Concept  \n  As noted, the patents are directed to an abstract idea —the idea of comparing one thing to \nanother.  Blue Spike contends the claims would cover a nearly limitless scope of signals for \ncomparison —ranging from irises to songs.  However, the claims do not involve any “inventive \nconcept .”  See Alice , 134 S.  Ct. at 2355.  Instead , they merely discuss using routine computer \ncomponents and methods (e.g., general purpose computers, compression, and databases) to \naccomplish this task wi th, in certain circumstances, greater efficiency than a human mind could \nachieve.  See Kroy IP Holdings, LLC v. Safeway, Inc. , No. 2:12 -CV-800-WCB, 2015 WL \n3452469, at *13 (E.D. Tex. May 29, 2015)  (“The greater efficiency with which the computer can \nperfor m tasks that a human could perform does not r ender the inventions patentable .”); Bancorp \nServices, L.L.C. v. Sun Life Assur. Co. of Canada (U.S.) , 687 F.3d 1266, 1278 (Fed. Cir. 2012) \n(“[T]he use of a computer in an otherwise patent -ineligible process for no more than its most basic \nfunction —making calculations o r computations —fails to circumvent the prohibition against \npatenting abstract ideas and mental processes.”) .  Merely adding limitations involving the use of \ngeneral purpose computer components  to an otherwise abstract concept does not constitute an \ninventive concept  sufficient to sa ve a claim from invalidity .  See Planet Bingo, LLC v. VKGS LLC , \n576 F. App ’x 1005, 1008 (Fed. Cir. 2014)  (finding claims lack ed an “inventive concept,” despite \nbeing limited to computer -aided methods and systems, where the steps at issue could be “carried \nout in existing computers long in use” and “done mentally”) (quoting Gottschalk v. Benson , 409 \nU.S. 63, 67 (1972) ).  The mere fact that the claims may cover a computer implementation that \nsurpasses in scope or complexity what a human mind is capable of accomp lishing is irrelevant Case 4:14-cv-01650-YGR   Document 75   Filed 09/08/15   Page 10 of 18 \n11 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  where the claims are not limited to such complex activities, but also encompass more basic \napproaches.  Id.  Here, to the extent the asserted claims do encompass comparisons that a human is \nnot readily capable of undertaking —an argume nt belied by the specification —they nevertheless \nalso cover and preempt a wide range of comparisons that humans can and, indeed, have \nundertaken from time immemorial.   Accordingly, given the patent s claim  an abstract idea  but lack  \nany inventive concept, they fail to meet the legal standard for patentability.  \n3.  Additional Claims  \nThe foregoing two -step analysis , largely focused on claim 1 of the ’472 Patent,  applies \nwith equal force to all claims at issue.  The only material distinctions, e.g., inclusion of generic \ncomputer components, do not save those claims from invalidity.  See, e.g. , Cogent Med., Inc. v. \nElsevier Inc. , 70 F.  Supp.  3d 1058 , 1066  (N.D. Cal. 2014)  (finding certain “ system and computer \ncomponent claims rise and fall with the method claims ” where they merely involve “generic \ncomputer components configured to implement the [abstract] idea”).  The Court addresses each of \nthe remai ning claims in turn:  \na. ’472 Patent  \n Claim 2  is a dependent claim, taking the method of claim 1 (the representative \nclaim) but generating abstracts of only portions of signals, instead of signals in \ntheir entirety.  The claim still encompasses the abstract i dea discussed above and \nthis limitation does not constitute an inventive concept .  \n Claim 3  covers largely the same ground as the representative claim, but includes \nincremental counting steps —namely, a method for tracking the number of matches  \ndetected by the comparison process.  This basic computer -based counting  fails to \nrescue the claim from the realm of the abstract.  See Ultramercial, Inc. , 772 F.3d at \n712, 715 (characterizing a step of “recording [a] transaction event to [an] activity \nlog, . . . including updating the total number of times” the event has occurred, as \n“routine, conventional activity” ). \n Claim 4  is dependent on claim 3 and merely adds routine steps for recording each \nmatch and generating a report identifying the  matched signals.  See Alice , 134 S.  Case 4:14-cv-01650-YGR   Document 75   Filed 09/08/15   Page 11 of 18 \n12 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  Ct. at 2359 (mere “ use of a computer to create electronic records, track multiple \ntransactions, and issue simultaneous instructions ” does not constitute an inventive \nconcept ). \n Claim 8  mirrors, in substance, the representative claim, with the further \nlimitation —immaterial to this analysis —that more than one reference signal is \nused, and also including an incremental counter for matches.  \n Claim 11  is a system claim, involving generic com puter components and routines \n(“a computerized system,” “a processor,” “a reference database,” and “input[s]”) to \naccomplish the basic method of the representative claim.  Unlike the earlier \ndiscussed claims, this claim is not limited to detecting an exact  “match,” but instead \ncompares the two abstracts to generate “an index of relatedness.”  The abstract idea \ndiscussed above is “comparison” —whether to find exact matches, or to determine \nthe extent of similarity.  Further, as noted, a system claim that mere ly incorporates \ngeneric computer components to implement the abstract idea of the method claim \nfails along with the method claim.   Finally, t he limitation of selecting certain \ncriteria to consider in comparing things falls squarely within the heuristic app roach \nthe human mind takes to solving the same problem.  It therefore does not rescue the \nclaim from abstraction, nor does it constitute an inventive concept . \nb. ’700 Patent  \n Claim 1  covers “[a]n electronic system,” similar to claim 11 of the ’472 patent, but \nlimited to matching instead of broader comparisons.  It similarly fails.  \n Claim 10  depends on claim 1, but includes the limitation that “a cryptographic \nprotocol” is applied to one or more of the abstracts at issue.  The claims do not \ndiscuss a novel cryptographic method, but merely contemplate “‘well -understood, \nroutine, conventional activity.’”  See Intellectual Ventures II LLC v. JP Morgan \nChase & Co. , No. 13 -CV-3777 AKH, 2015 WL 1941331, at *14 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. \n28, 2015)  (citing Mayo , 132 S.  Ct. at 1298 ).  Thus, the inclusion of this limitation \ndoes not constitute an inventive concept . Case 4:14-cv-01650-YGR   Document 75   Filed 09/08/15   Page 12 of 18 \n13 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California   Claim 11  depends on claim 10, but is further limited to the use of a cryptographic \nprotocol that has “at least a hash or digital signature,” and th e storage of the \nencrypted abstract.  The patents do not explain a novel method for generating \nhashes or digital signatures —they merely call for the use of these conventional \ncryptographic methods.  \n Claim 12  depends on claim 1, but adds “an  embedder to embed uniquely \nidentifiable data into at least one” of the signals.  As the specification itself notes, \nhowever, such watermarking (or use of “additive signals”) was in the prior art, and \nits inclusion here does not constitute an inventive concept.  See, e.g. , ’700 Patent at \n4:44-53, 13:37 -40 (“Traditionally, monitoring is accomplished by embedding  some \nidentifier  into the signal, or affixing the identifier to the signal, for later analysis \nand determination of royalty payments.”)  (emphasis  supplied ). \n Claim 18  is a method claim, apparently for a digital rights management (“DRM”) \nor other routine data transmission  system .  The claim  notes the match determination \nis undertaken “to enable authorized transmission or use of the query signal.”  As to \nthe data transmission  issue, the claim does no more than present this basic \nrecitation of purpose , but does not present an inventive method to facilitate data \ntransmission .  The claim is otherwise similar to the representative claim, but is \nfurther l imited to generation of abstracts based on “signal characteristic parameters \nconfigured to differentiate between a plurality of versions of the data signal.”  This \nis not a unique approach; indeed, as noted above, humans also focus on discrete \ncharacterist ics to facilitate comparisons between two similar things, e.g., paintings \nof sunsets.  These additional limitations do not save the claim.  \n Claim 21  is dependent on claim 18, but limited to abstracts “derived from one of a \ncognitive feature or  a perceptible characteristic” of the signals.  This broad \n“limitation” (covering use of any aspect of a signal that a human could perceive) is \nnot meaningful for purposes of the preceding analysis.  \n Claim 27  is dependent on claim 18, but invo lves comparison instead of matching.  Case 4:14-cv-01650-YGR   Document 75   Filed 09/08/15   Page 13 of 18 \n14 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  As noted above, this is a distinction without a difference in regards to the claim’s \nvalidity.  \n Claim 40  covers a process similar to the representative claim, but again is focused \non certain parameters and  directed to similarity comparison instead of direct \nmatching.   \n Claim 51  is dependent on claim 40, but includes an additional step: “distributing at \nleast one signal based on the comparison step.”  This is, again, apparently directed \nto the purpose  of DRM or access control —but its inclusion does not constitute an \ninventive step sufficient to sa ve the claim.  \nc. ’494 Patent  \n Claim 11  is a system claim similar to claim 11 of the ’472 Patent, but using \n“perceptible characteristics representative of  parameters to differentiate between \nversions of the reference signal” to generate abstracts (instead of “selectable \ncriteria”).  This limitation is not materially distinct from the similar limitation \ndiscussed above regarding claim 18 of the ’700 Patent.   \n Claim 15  is dependent on claim 11, but includes the further limitation that “the \nstored abstracts comprise a self -similar representation of at least one reference \nsignal.”  In light of the specification, this limitation simply appears to contemplate \ngenerating a ha sh or compression of the signal to serve as the abstract.  See ’494 \nPatent at 7:49 -54.  As noted above, the addition of this well  understood, routine \nactivity does not save the claim.  \n Claim 17  depends on claim 11, and includes the limitation that “at least one \nabstract comprises data describing a portion of the characteristics of its associated \nreference signal.”  As with claim 2 of the ’472 Patent, generating an abstract based \non only a portion of the characteristics of the signal, instead of  the signal in its \nentirety, still falls squarely within the realm of the abstract  concept discussed \nabove .   \n Claim 29  covers a system materially similar to that of claim 11, but focuses on Case 4:14-cv-01650-YGR   Document 75   Filed 09/08/15   Page 14 of 18 \n15 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  matching instead of comparisons and requires the use  of more than one reference \nsignal.  Again, none of these minor variations saves the claim.  \nd. ’175 Patent  \n Claim 1  covers  a system similar to many of the preceding claims, contemplating \nthe use of generic computer components, such as “non transitory memory, ” \n“processor[s],” and “database[s].”  As with some of the preceding claims, for \ninstance c laim 15 of the ’494 Patent , the abstract must be “similar” to the signal \nfrom which it is derived, but reduced in size  (e.g., a hash) .  The key distinction is \nthat th is claim contemplates the creation  of two databases of distinct abstracts for \nthe reference signals, and does not include a comparison step.   This claim is \ntherefore directed to accomplishing a subset of the abstract idea discussed above, \nbut twice for eac h signal and in a different manner each time.   The former aspect \nbroadens, rather than limits, the claim’s scope.  Neither constitute s an inventive \nconcept sufficient to save the claim.   \n Claim 8  is structured similarly to claim 1, but involve s only a single database and \nfocuses on facilitating possible comparisons “of different versions of a visual work \nand a multimedia work” by generating abstracts based on “signal characteristic \nparameters that differentiate between” different versions of th e works.  Limiting its \nscope to broad categories of possible signals —visual and multimedia works —does \nnot save the claim.  As noted above as to claim 18 of the ’700 Patent, neither does \nthe use of “signal characteristic parameters.”  \n Claim 11  is similar to claim 8, but does not require the use of signal characteristic \nparameters and includes a comparison step with a query signal, as do many of the \nearlier addressed claims.  \n Claim 12  depends on claim 11, with the additional limitati on that the compare \nprocess indicates the absence of a match between the query signal abstract and the \nreference signal abstracts stored in a database.  This additional routine limitation \ndoes not save the claim . Case 4:14-cv-01650-YGR   Document 75   Filed 09/08/15   Page 15 of 18 \n16 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California   Claim 16  is dependent on clai m 12, but includes the further limitation that the \nprocessor generating and storing the abstracts “is programmed or structured to use \nan algorithm to generate” the abstracts.   This generic reference to the use of an \nunspecified “algorithm ” hardly limits the scope of claim 12, if at all, and certainly \ndoes not save the claim  from invalidity .  See Digitech Image Technologies, LLC v. \nElectronics for Imaging, Inc. , 758 F.3d 1344, 1351 (Fed. Cir. 2014)  (“Without \nadditional limitations, a process that employs mathematical algorithms to \nmanipulate existing information to generate additional information is not patent \neligible .”). \n Claim 17  is similar to claim 11, but the comparison component is absent and the \nclaim instead includes a requirement that  the system be “programmed or structured \nto apply at least one of psycho -acoustic model and psycho -visual model to \ngenerate” the reference abstracts.  The specification notes that psycho -\nacoustic/psycho -visual -focused compression is in the prior art and ex plains the \napproach is intended to “mimic[] human perception.”  See, e.g. , ’175 Patent at \n7:40-49; see also  id. at 14:41 -44 (“Similar to the goals of a psychoacoustic model, \na psychovisual model attempts to represent a visual image with less data, and yet \npreserve those perceptual qualities that permit a human to recognize the original \nvisual image.”); id. at 7:42 -43 (“ Most compression is either lossy or lossless and is \ndesigned with psychoacoustic or psychovisual parameters.   That is to say, the \nsignal is compressed to retain what is ‘humanly -perceptible. ’”); id. at 4:18 -21 \n(referencing prior art data reduction techniques based on “perceptual models” such \nas AAC, MP3, JPEG, GIF, or MPEG encoding) .  This approach falls squarely \nwithin the prior art and/or th e abstract concept discussed above, and introduces no \ninventive concept . \ne. ’728 Patent  \n Claim 1  describes a method for using an “electronic system” to create “data Case 4:14-cv-01650-YGR   Document 75   Filed 09/08/15   Page 16 of 18 \n17 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  reduced,”7 “self -similar” abstracts of one reference signal, doing the same for one \nquery sig nal, and comparing the two to determine whether the abstracts match.  \nThis claim’s scope is similar to that of the representative claim; the additional \nlimits of creating a hash -based (or similar) abstract, and of using an “electronic \nsystem,” do not save the claim for the reasons previously explained.   \n Claim 4  depends on claim 1, but also involves the creation of a second abstract, \nfrom a second reference signal.  This does nothing to save the claim.  \n Claim 5  depends on claim 4,  but discusses “changing selected criteria” for \ngenerating the reference signal abstracts.  The limitation of enabling the abstract \ngeneration to be based upon selectable criteria does not save the claim for the \nreasons discussed above . \n Claim 16  depends on claim 1, but includes a match counter.  For the reasons \ndiscussed above, including as to c laim 3 of the ’472 Patent , this limitation does not \nsave the claim.  \n Claim 25  essentially describes a system for implementing claim 1, with a recitation \nof generic components (e.g., a “receiver” and a “processor”).  This claim therefore \nfalls along with the method claim.  \n Finally, claim 26  depends on claim 25, with the additional limitation that the \n“system is configured to a pply at least one spectral transform” to the reference \nsignal during the abstract -generation process.  As with the unspecific reference to \nuse of “algorithms” discussed above, the reference to use of “spectral \ntransforms” —acknowledged by the specification to be a mathematical method to \n                                                 \n7 This language appears redundant in light of the Prior Construction of the term “abstract,” \nwhich describes the abstract as “data -reduced.”   Admittedly, “[i]t is settled law that when a patent \nclaim does not contain a certain limitation and another claim do es, that limitation cannot be read \ninto the former claim in determining either validity or infringement .”  VMWare, Inc. v. Connectix \nCorp. , No. C 02 -3705 CW, 2005 WL 6220090, at *12 (N.D. Cal. Mar. 25, 2005)  (quoting SRI \nInt’l v. Matsushita Elec. Corp. of Am., 775 F.2d 1107, 1122 (Fed.  Cir. 1985) ).  Nevertheless,  the \nCourt adopts the Prior Construction for purposes of this motion  despite this apparent redundancy  \nin light of the plaintiff ’s reliance thereon and defendant ’s stipulation thereto . Case 4:14-cv-01650-YGR   Document 75   Filed 09/08/15   Page 17 of 18 \n18 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  process signals, maintaining “some cognitive or perceptual relationship with the \noriginal analog waveform” —falls within the realm of the abstract.  See ’728 Patent \nat 11:25 -31.  The specification suggests “spectral transforms ” refer to prior art; \ncertainly, the patent does nothing to teach a person having ordinary skill in the art \nhow to perform a spectral transform, taking for granted that such a process would \nbe well understood at the time the patent was filed .  See id. at 4:20-26.  Moreover, \nthe Federal Circuit has held that system claims directed to describing mathematical \ntransformations undertaken in connection with digital image processing were not \ndirected to patent -eligible subject matter where they did not “require an y physical \nembodiment.”  See Digitech Image Technologies, LLC v. Electronics for Imaging, \nInc., 758 F.3d 1344, 1350 (Fed. Cir. 2014) .  This claim, similarly, appears directed \nto application of a mathematical model to data in a digital environment with no \nresulting physical embodiment.  \nThus, all claims at issue are not patent -eligible.  \nIV. CONCLUSION  \nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court GRANTS  the defendant’s motion for judgment on the \npleadings , finding the asserted claims listed in the motion to be invalid .  In light of the rulings \nherein, the plaintiff’s request for leave to amend is denied as futile.   See Foman v.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: This case involves Loop AI Labs Inc., who allege that their former CEO, Anna Gatti, conspired with other defendants to misappropriate Loop's trade secrets, sabotaging their investor negotiations. The defendants moved to compel Loop to provide a specific trade secret disclosure as required by California procedures. The court granted this request in part but denied a stay on all discovery, highlighting the involvement of AI since Loop AI Labs develops artificial intelligence technology, implying their trade secrets pertain to this domain.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the plaintiff, Loop AI Labs, is required under California law to identify their alleged trade secrets with particularity before discovery in a federal court action and whether all discovery should be stayed until the plaintiff complies with this requirement.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court ruled that while Loop AI Labs must provide a more detailed trade secret disclosure to comply with Section 2019.210 of the California Code of Civil Procedure, not all discovery should be stayed pending this disclosure. Discovery unrelated to the trade secret misappropriation claim can proceed.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine you have a secret recipe, and someone might have stolen it. If you want to sue them, you need to tell the court exactly what parts of the recipe are secret, but you don't have to stop finding out more about what else they did wrong in the meantime. This case decided that Loop AI Labs has to clearly say what their \"secret recipe\" is, but they can still investigate other bad things the defendants might have done while figuring this out.",

No. 232  \n \nDefendant IQSystem s, Inc. (“IQS”) filed a motion to compel Plaintiff Loop AI Labs, Inc. \n(“Loop”) to provide a particularized trade secret disclosure and to stay discovery until Plaintiff \nprovides such disclosure.  [Docket No. 232.]  The court has determined that this matter is suitable \nfor resolut ion without a hearing pursuant to Civil Local Rule 7 -1(b).  For the following reasons, \nIQS’s motion is granted in part and denied in part.  \nI. BACKGROUND  \nPlaintiff filed this action in February 2015 against Defendants IQS; Almawave  USA, Inc. ; \nAlmaviva S.p.A. ( “Almaviva”)  and Almawave S.r.l. ( together, the “Italian Almaviva \nDefendants”) ; Anna Gatti; and IQSystems LLC.  Plaintiff is a startup company that develops \nartificial intelligence technology.  It alleges that Gatti , its former CEO, conspired with the Italian \nAlmaviva Defendants to misappropriate Plaintiff’s trade secrets and sabotage its investor \nnegotiations.  Specifically, Plaintiff alleges that it hired Gatti to assist in raising venture capital \nand establish bus iness partnerships, but that she lied about her true credentials and experience.  \nAccording to Plaintiff, while Gatti pretended to work full time for Loop AI, she was \nsimultaneously providing advisory services for multiple competing startups and took a con current \nCEO position with Almawave  USA .  \nGatti allegedly established Almawave USA on behalf of the Italian Almaviva Defendants Case 4:15-cv-00798-HSG   Document 331   Filed 12/21/15   Page 1 of 8 \n2 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  and domiciled the new startup company at her home in San Francisco.   According to Plaintiff, the \nItalian Almaviva  Defendants  intended to use Gatti’s assistance to buy Loop for a “bargain price” \nor to hire away its key employees and obtain access to its proprietary technology and trade secrets.  \nPlaintiff alleges that a principal component of Gatti’s scheme involved sabotaging Loop’s  access \nto funding, including venture capital.  Gatti also allegedly shared Plaintiff’s proprietary \ninformation and other property with the other defendants, and used Plaintiff’s time, property, and \nother resources to conduct business on behalf of the Italian Almaviva  Defendants.  Further,  \nPlaintiff alleges that Gatti created IQS and IQSystems LLC  in order to funnel compensation she \nreceived from the Italian Almaviva Defendants  for the unlawful scheme.   In its second amended \ncomplaint, Plaintiff brings seventeen  claims against some or all of the Defendants, including, inter \nalia, RICO violations, computer fraud and abuse, misappropriation of trade secrets, unfair \ncompetition , and various business  torts.  [See Docket No. 210 (2d Am. Compl.).]  \nPlaintiff  assert s its claim for  misappropriation of trade secrets against all Defendants .  The \nclaim  is based upon Defendants’  alleged violation of California Civil Code section 3426, \nCalifornia’s Uniform Trade Secrets Act (“CUTSA”).  IQS now moves to compel Plaintiff to \ncomply with California Code of Civil Procedure section 2019.210 by identify ing its alleged trade \nsecrets with particularity .  IQS also asks the court to stay all discovery in this case until Plaintiff \nprovides a proper trade secret disclosure.  \nPlaintiff  opposes IQS’s motion on the ground that section 2019.210 is a state procedural \nrule that does not apply in this action.  It also argues that to the extent that section 2019.210 does \napply, Loop  has already complied with the statute by providing a detailed  explanation of the trade \nsecrets at issue  in its pleadings  and other submissions .  Finally, Plaintiff argues that a stay of all \ndiscovery in this case is unwarranted and unsupported where  the majority of its claims do not arise \nout of or implicate CUTSA  in any way . \nII. DISCUSSION  \nA. Applicability of Section 2019.210  \nCalifornia Code of Civil Procedure section 2019.210 provides that in any action alleging \nmisappropriation of trade secrets under CUTSA, “before commencing discovery relati ng to the Case 4:15-cv-00798-HSG   Document 331   Filed 12/21/15   Page 2 of 8 \n3 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  trade secret, the party alleging the misappropriation shall identify the trade secret with reasonable \nparticularity  subject to any orders that may be appropriate under Section 3426.5 of the Civil \nCode. ”  Cal. Civ. Proc. Code § 2019.210.  Section 3426.5 allows a court to ent er appropriate \norders, including protective orders, to ensure the confidentiality of a plaintiff’s trade secrets \nidentified in accordance with section 2019.210.   As one court explained, the early identification of \ntrade secrets serves four purposes:  \n \nFirst, it promotes well -investigated claims and dissuades the filing \nof meritless trade secret complaints.  Second, it prevents plaintiffs \nfrom using the discovery process as a means to obtain the \ndefendant’s trade secrets.  Third, the rule assists the court in  framing \nthe appropriate scope of discovery and in determining whether \nplaintiff’s discovery requests fall within that scope.  Fourth, it \nenables defendants to form complete and well -reasoned defenses, \nensuring that they need not wait until the eve of tria l to effectively \ndefend against charges of trade secret misappropriation.  \nComputer Economics, Inc. v. Gartner Grp., Inc. , 50 F. Supp. 2d 980, 988 -92 (S.D. Cal. 1999).  \nThe Ninth Circuit has not decided whether section 2019.210 applies to actions in federal \ncourt .  Courts within this circuit have reached differ ent conclusions.  Compare  Social Apps, LLC \nv. Zynga, Inc. , No. 4:11 -CV-04910 YGR, 2012 WL 2203063, at * 1-2 (N.D. Cal. June 14, 2012) \n(“Section 2019.210 does not conflict with any Federal Rule of Civil Procedure but rather assists \nthe court and parties in defining the appropriate scope of discovery”; collecting cases) , with \nFuncat Leisure Craft, Inc. v. Johnson Outdoors, Inc. , No. S -06-0533 GEB GGH, 2007 WL \n273949, at *2 (E.D. Cal. Jan. 29, 2007)  (“application of § 2019.210 would serve to prevent \napplication of Rule 26”) .  Plaintiff argues that section 2019.210 governs the commencement of \ndiscovery in California state court f or claims aris ing out of CUTSA, while the commencement of \ndiscovery in federal court is expressly addressed and governed by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \n26(d) .  That provision , the “Timing and Sequence of Discovery ,” permits the parties to commence \ndiscovery after “c onfer[ing] as required by Rule 26(f).”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(d)(1).  Therefore, \nPlaintiff argues, since the timing of  discovery is already governed by Rule 26, and since Judge \nGilliam already entered a scheduling order allowing discovery to commence, ( see Docket No. 105 \n(June 2015 Scheduling Order setting discovery cutoff deadlines) ), any state procedural rule Case 4:15-cv-00798-HSG   Document 331   Filed 12/21/15   Page 3 of 8 \n4 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  addressing the same question is inapplicable.1  Pl.’s Opp’n at 12 -14 (citing Shady Grove \nOrthopedic Assocs., P.A. v.

If it does, it governs . . . unless it \nexceeds statutory authorization or Congress’s rulemaking power.” (citation omitted) ).) \nThis court agrees with the reasoning of cases finding that a federal court may properly \napply  section 2 019.210 in federal  suits alleging CUTSA claims.

Apr. 9, 2010) (ordering plaintiffs to comply with section 2019.210; \nnoting that the court “finds it appropriate to require identification of trade secrets as a case \nmanagement tool” prior to disco very into “opponents’ proprietary information.”) .  Additionally, \nthe application of section 2019.210 to CUTSA claims brought in federal court deters  forum \nshopping, for “[a] plaintiff with a weak trade secret claim would have ample reason to choose \nfederal  court if it offered a chance to circumvent the requirements of [section 2019.210].”  \nComputer Economics , 50 F. Supp. 2d at 992.   Accordingly, the court applies  section 2019.210 in \nthis case.  \n                                                 \n1 The court notes that Plaintiff’s current position is inconsistent with  its prior representations.  For \nexample, in its second amended complaint,  Plaintiff states in connection with its CUTSA claim \nthat “A complete list of trade secrets misappropriated by the Defendants will also be provided to \nthem before discovery in accordance with California law.”  (2d Am. Compl. ¶ 339.)  Further, \nduring the July 23, 2015 discovery hearing, Gatti’s counsel raised section 2019.210 and Plaintiff’s \ncounsel responded  “we are perfectly aware of our obligations in respect to the trade secrets, and \nwe are in the process of producing a trade secret list.”  [Docket No. 157  (July 23, 2015  Hr’g Tr. at \n96-97).]  Plaintiff does not explain th ese inconsistenc ies. Case 4:15-cv-00798-HSG   Document 331   Filed 12/21/15   Page 4 of 8 \n5 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  B. Sufficiency of Plaintiff’s Trade Secret Disclosure  \nWhile Plainti ff admits that it has not filed or served a list of the trade secrets at issue in this \ncase, it argues that it has already provided a detailed explanation of the trade secrets in its second \namended complaint , and in three declarations filed in support of P laintiff’s April 2015 motion s for \nclarification and for leave to file a motion for reconsideration .  Plaintiff identifies the specific \nparagraphs therein that it asserts contain clear descriptions of the trade secrets at issue.  Pl.’s \nOpp’n at 6-7.2  There fore, Plaintiff  argues, it has satisfied the requirements of section 2019.210.    \nUnder section 2019.210, a plaintiff is required “to identify or designate the trade secrets at \nissue with ‘sufficient particularity’ to limit the permissible scope of discover y by distinguishing \nthe trade secrets ‘from matters of general knowledge in the trade or of special knowledge of those \npersons . . . skilled in the trade.”  Advanced Modular Sputtering, Inc. v. Superior Court , 132 Cal. \nApp. 4th 826, 835 (2005) (quoting IMAX Corp.  v. Cinema Techs., Inc. , 152 F.3d 1161, 1164 -65 \n(9th Cir. 1998) (citation omitted) ).  California Civil Code section 3426.1 defines a trade secret as \nfollows:  \n“Trade secret” means information, including a formula, pattern, \ncompilation, program, d evice, method, technique, or process, that:   \n \n(1) Derives independent economic value, actual or potential, from \nnot being generally known to the public or to other persons who can \nobtain economic value from its disclosure or use; and   \n \n(2) Is the subject o f efforts that are reasonable under the \ncircumstances to maintain its secrecy.    \n \nCal. Civ. Code § 3426.1(d).  While the particularity mandated by section 2019.210 “does not \nmean that the party alleging misappropriation has to define every minute detail of  its claimed trade \nsecret at the outset of the litigation,” a plaintiff “must make some showing that is reasonable, i.e., \nfair, proper, just and rational.”  Advanced Modular , 132 Cal. App. 4th at 935 -36.  “What is \nrequired is not absolute precision, but ‘r easonable particularity[,]’” the degree of which “will \n                                                 \n2 Plaintiff claims that  the following paragraphs co mprise  its identification of the trade secrets at \nissue in this case: amended complaint (Docket No. 45), paragraphs 137 -192; second amended \ncomplaint, (Docket No. 210) paragraphs 155 -200; April 9, 2015 declaration of Gianmauro \nCalafiore (Docket No. 49), paragrap hs 68 -83; April 7, 2015 declaration of Patrick Ehlen (Docket \nNo. 50), paragraphs 35 -50; and April 7, 2015 declaration of Bart M. Peinter (Docket No. 51), \nparagraphs 41 -51. Case 4:15-cv-00798-HSG   Document 331   Filed 12/21/15   Page 5 of 8 \n6 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  differ, depending on the alleged trade secrets at issue in each case.”  Id. at 836.   “The identification \nis to be liberally construed, and reasonable doubts concerning its sufficiency are to be resolve d in \nfavor of allowing discovery to commence.”  Brescia v. Angelin , 172 Cal. App. 4th 133, 152 (2009) \n(citing Advanced Modular , 132 Cal. App. 4th at 835).  \n The paragraphs  identified  in Plaintiff’s complaints and declarations consist  largely  of \ndetailed  allegations of Gatti’s wrongdoing, including her improper acquisition of Plaintiff’s \n“confidential and proprietary information and trade secrets.”  (See, e.g ., 2d Am. Compl. ¶¶ 162 -\n183.)  Plaintiff’s second amended complaint also includes the identification o f broad categories of \ntrade secrets, including “Technical Information,” “Business Development/Investor Information,” \nand “Financial/Legal Information.”  (2d Am. Compl. ¶¶ 159 -161.)  In his declaration, Patrick \nEhlen, Head of Deep Learning at Loop, describe s examples of “misappropriated confidential \ninformation and trade secrets” in the form of specific pieces of information Gatti was provided or \ngiven access to by Plaintiff, but he also includes the disclaimer that these descriptions are “only a \nfew [of] so me of the examples of the confidential information and trade secrets that [Plaintiff] \nbelieve[s] the Defendants improperly acquired” through Gatti, and that “[i]t is not intended to be \nan exhaustive list.”  (Ehlen Decl . ¶ 47.)  Gianmauro Calafiore (Loop’s founder and CEO) and Bart \nM. Peintner (Loop’s Chief Technology Officer and Chief Scientist ), make similar disclaimer s in \ntheir declaration s.  (See Calafiore Decl. ¶ 68; Peintner Decl. ¶¶ 41, 51.)   \nPlaintiff’s ersatz “trade secret disclosure” is insufficient to meet the requirements of \nsection 2019.210.  See, e.g., Brescia , 172 Cal. App. 4th at 150 (affirming trial court’s \ndetermination that section 2019.210 disclosure consisting of descriptions in cross -complaint and \nidentification of documents in discovery was “inadequate”).  Plaintiff’s  “disclosure” through \ndesignation  of certain  paragraphs in pleadings and declarations is no substitute for specifically \nidentifying and describing the actual claimed trade secrets in o rder “to permit [Defendants] to \nascertain at least the boundaries within which the secret[s] lie[].”  See id . at 147 (emphasis \nremoved) (quoting Diodes v. Franzen , 260 Cal. App. 2d 244, 253 (1968)).   For example, Peintner \nstates that he provided Gatti with  files and communications containing “highly technical details” \nregarding Plaintiff’s technology, asserting that “[a]ll of these documents are highly confidential, Case 4:15-cv-00798-HSG   Document 331   Filed 12/21/15   Page 6 of 8 \n7 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  and many contain our trade secrets.”  (Peintner Decl. ¶ 43.)  Since Plaintiff identifies no specific \ndocuments that contain trade secrets, this statement is vague and lacks the “reasonable \nparticularity” sufficient to enable Defendants to prepare their defenses.  See Computer Economics , \n50 F. Supp. 2d at 985 (noting that one of the purposes of se ction 2019.210 is to “ enable [] \ndefendants to form complete and well -reasoned defenses, ensuring that they need not wait until the \neve of trial to effectively defend against charges of trade secret misappropriation. ”).   \n Plaintiff shall file and serve a st atement identifying the specific trade secrets at issue within \n21 days of the date of this order.  Plaintiff’s identification of trade secrets must  be thorough and \ncomplete.  Any future amendment to the disclosure will only be permitted upon a showing of g ood \ncause.  See Neothermia Corp. v. Rubicor Med ., Inc. , 345 F. Supp. 2d 1042, 1045 (N.D. Cal. 2004) \n(holding that any amendment to trade secret identification must be supported by good cause, \nconsistent with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and the Northern District’s Patent Local \nRules).  However, the co urt denies IQS’s motion to stay all discovery in this case until Plaintiff \nhas complied with section 2019.210.  Section 2019.210 only supports a stay of “discovery relating \nto the trade secret[s].”  Cal. Civ. Proc. Code § 2019.210.  Only one of Plaintiff’s  seventeen claims \nis for misappropriation of trade secrets, and Plaintiff expressly alleges that its claims for fraud, \nintentional interference with prospective economic advantage, tortious interferenc e, unfair \ncompetition, unjust enrichment, and conversio n are not based on any allegations of \nmisappropriation of trade secrets.  ( See 2d Am. Compl. at n.5 -n.10.)  Accordingly, discovery is \nstayed as to Plaintiff’s CUTSA claim, and Plaintiff may proceed with such discovery upon filing a \nstatement identifying with reasonable particularity the trade secrets at issue  in this lawsuit . \nIII. CONCLUSION  \nFor the foregoing reasons, IQS’s motion to motion to compel Plaintiff to provide a \nparticularized trade secret disclosure and to stay discovery until Plaintiff provides such  disclosure \nis granted in part and denied in part.  Plaintiff shall file a statement identifying the trade secrets at \nissue within 21 days of the date of this order.  \n \nIT IS SO ORDERED.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: This case involves a dispute over patent infringement related to five U.S. patents, owned by Emmanuel C. Gonzalez, which pertain to methods and systems for labeling websites with digital labels for more efficient internet searching. The court's opinion primarily focuses on the interpretation of various terms and phrases within the patents' claims, with particular attention paid to terms like \"digital label\" and \"stored websites.\" The case involves AI as the patents describe host websites with artificial intelligence capabilities to improve label-based searches over traditional word-matching techniques.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: The key legal issue is the construction of specific terms within the patent claims, which affects the determination of patent infringement. This involves interpreting whether certain terms, such as \"digital label,\" \"stored websites,\" and \"Host Website's computer,\" are used consistently with their agreed-upon meanings in the context of the patents.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court construes the disputed terms based on their plain and ordinary meaning within the context provided by the patent specifications. The court finds that the term “stored websites” has a plain and ordinary meaning and that “Host Website’s computer” should be interpreted with a correction to reflect contextual consistency throughout the claims. The court rejects the defendants' arguments of indefiniteness regarding these terms.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine you invented a new way for computers to search the web better and faster, using a unique \"digital label\" system that tags websites with specific symbols to tell what they’re about. These tags would help computers find the right websites without needing to read their content word for word. In this court case, someone says you're using their invention without permission. The judge is like a referee making sure everyone understands what \"digital label\" means and looks at the rules (patent claims) to decide if you’re actually copying or if you're playing fair with your own version.",

BACKGROUND \nPlaintiff alleges infringement of five re lated U.S. Patents:  No. 7,558,807 (the “’807 \nPatent”), No. 7,647,339 (the “’339 Patent”) , No. 7,873,665 (the “’665 Patent”), No. 8,065,333 \n(the “’333 Patent”), and N o. 8,296,325 (the “’325 Patent”) (c ollectively, the “Asserted \nPatents”).2 The Asserted Patents are directed to me thods and systems for labeling websites or a \nwebsite’s owner (the subscriber) with informati on about the website, the we bsite’s owner, or the \nwebsite’s content.  \nThe patents describe “digital labels” that can be used to improve the efficacy of Internet \nsearches over word-match or category-selection Internet searches. A label-based search is an \nimprovement over other Internet searches because a label-based search identifies qualities that \nare associated with a particular website or subs criber, as opposed to simply identifying the words \nin the content of a website or the cate gory to which a website has been assigned. See, e.g. , ’665 \nPatent col.7 ll.48–54, co l.9 l.34 – col.10 l.3.3 The abstracts of the ’ 339 and ’807 Patents provide: \n                                                 \n2 All of the Asserted Patents are related to a provisional app lication filed on October 4, 2000. \nThe Asserted Patents name a si ngle inventor, Emmanuel C. Gonzal ez. The ’339 Pate nt issued on \nJanuary 12, 2010 from an applicat ion filed on February 22, 2001. Th e ’807 Patent, issued on July \n7, 2009 from an application filed on May 18, 2004. The ’807 Patent claims priority to the \napplication that issued as the ’339 Patent. Th e ’665 Patent issued on January 18, 2011 from an \napplication filed on November 23, 2009. The ’665 Pate nt issued from a continuation-in-part of \nthe application that issued as  the ’339 Patent. The ’333 Pate nt issued on November 22, 2011 \nfrom an application filed on December 10, 2010. The ’333 Patent issued from a divisional of the \napplication that issued as the ’665 Patent. The ’325 Patent issued on Oc tober 23, 2012 from an \napplication filed on December 10, 2010. The ’325 Pa tent issued from a divisional of the \napplication that issued as the ’665 Patent. The Asserted Patents share a substantially identical \nspecification, other than the claim sets and matter added to the ’665  Patent that is  also found in \nthe ’333 Patent and the ’325 Patent. \n3 The parties represent that the disclosure of the ’665 Pa tent through column 19 line 22 is \nsubstantially identical to the di sclosures of the priority patent  (the ’339 Patent) and the other \nAsserted Patents. See Dkt. No. 94 at 4 n.1; Dkt. No. 96 at 8 n.5. As such, the Court follows the \nparties’ convention; i.e., cites to  the ’665 Patent indicate text that  appears in all the patents unless \notherwise noted.

LEGAL PRINCIPLES \n“It is a ‘bedrock principle’ of patent law that  ‘the claims of a pate nt define the invention \nto which the patentee is entitled the right to exclude.’” Phillips v. AWH Corp. , 415 F.3d 1303, \n1312 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (en banc) (quoting Innova/Pure Water Inc. v. Safari Water Filtration Sys., \nInc., 381 F.3d 1111, 1115 (Fed. Cir. 2004 )). To determine the meaning of the claims, courts start \nby considering the intrinsic evidence. See id . at 1313; see also C.R. Bard, Inc. v. U.S. Surgical \nCorp. , 388 F.3d 858, 861 (Fed. Cir. 2004); Bell Atl. Network Servs., Inc. v. Covad Commc’ns \nGroup, Inc. , 262 F.3d 1258, 1267 (Fed. Cir. 2001). The intrinsic evidence includes the claims \nthemselves, the specification, and the prosecution history. See Phillips , 415 F.3d at 1314; C.R. \nBard , 388 F.3d at 861. Courts give claim terms their ordinary and accustomed meaning as \nunderstood by one of ordinary skill in the art at th e time of the invention in the context of the \nentire patent. Phillips , 415 F.3d at 1312–13; accord Alloc, Inc. v. Int’l Trade Comm’n , 342 F.3d \n1361, 1368 (Fed. Cir. 2003). \nThe claims themselves provide substantia l guidance in determining the meaning of \nparticular claim terms. Phillips , 415 F.3d at 1314. First,  a term’s context in the asserted claim \ncan be very instructive. Id. Other asserted or unasserted claims can aid in determining the claim’s \nmeaning because claim terms are typically used consistently throughout the patent. Id. \nDifferences among the claim terms can also assist in understandi ng a term’s meaning. Id. For \nexample, when a dependent claim adds a limitation to an independent claim, it is presumed that \nthe independent claim does not include the limitation. Id. at 1314–15. \n“[C]laims ‘must be read in view of the specification, of which they are a part.’” Id. at \n1315 (quoting Markman v. Westview Instruments, Inc. , 52 F.3d 967, 979 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (en \nbanc)). “[T]he specification ‘is always highly relevant to the claim construction analysis. Case 2:14-cv-00906-JRG     Document 109     Filed 09/21/15     Page 5 of 43 PageID #: \n<pageID> \n6 \n Usually, it is dispositive; it is the single best  guide to the meaning of a disputed term.’” Id. \n(quoting Vitronics Corp. v. Conceptronic, Inc. , 90 F.3d 1576, 1582 (Fed. Cir. 1996)); accord \nTeleflex, Inc. v. Ficosa N. Am. Corp. , 299 F.3d 1313, 1325 (Fed. Cir. 2002). This is true because \na patentee may define his own te rms, give a claim term a different meaning than the term would \notherwise possess, or discla im or disavow claim scope. Phillips , 415 F.3d at 1316. In these \nsituations, the inventor’s lexicography governs. Id. The specification may also resolve the \nmeaning of ambiguous claim terms “where the or dinary and accustomed meaning of the words \nused in the claims lack sufficien t clarity to permit the scope of th e claim to be ascertained from \nthe words alone.” Teleflex , 299 F.3d at 1325. But, “[a]lthough the specification may aid the court \nin interpreting the mean ing of disputed claim language, part icular embodiments and examples \nappearing in the specification will not generally be read into the claims.” Comark Commc’ns, \nInc. v. Harris Corp. , 156 F.3d 1182, 1187 (Fed. Cir. 1998) (quoting Constant v. Advanced \nMicro-Devices, Inc. , 848 F.2d 1560, 1571 (Fed. Cir. 1988)); accord Phillips , 415 F.3d at 1323. \nThe prosecution history is another tool  to supply the proper context for claim \nconstruction because a patent applicant may al so define a term in prosecuting the patent. Home \nDiagnostics, Inc., v. Lifescan, Inc. , 381 F.3d 1352, 1356 (Fed. Cir. 2004 ) (“As in the case of the \nspecification, a patent applicant may define a term  in prosecuting a patent.”). “[T]he prosecution \nhistory (or file wrapper) limits the interpretation of  claims so as to exclude any interpretation that \nmay have been disclaimed or disavowed during prosecution in order to obtain claim allowance.” \nStandard Oil Co. v. Am. Cyanamid Co. , 774 F.2d 448, 452 (Fed. Cir. 1985).  \nAlthough extrinsic evidence can be  useful, it is “less significan t than the intr insic record \nin determining the legally operativ e meaning of claim language.” Phillips , 415 F.3d at 1317 \n(citations and internal quotation marks omitted). Technical dictionaries and treatises may help a Case 2:14-cv-00906-JRG     Document 109     Filed 09/21/15     Page 6 of 43 PageID #: \n<pageID> \n7 \n court understand the underlying t echnology and the manner in which one skilled in the art might \nuse claim terms, but technical dictionaries and treatises may provide definitions that are too broad or may not be indicative of how  the term is used in the patent. Id. at 1318. Similarly, \nexpert testimony may aid a cour t in understanding the underlying technology and determining \nthe particular meaning of a term in the pertin ent field, but an expert’s  conclusory, unsupported \nassertions as to a term’s definition  are entirely unhelpful to a court. Id. Generally, extrinsic \nevidence is “less reliable than the patent and its prosecution history in determining how to read \nclaim terms.” Id. The Supreme Court recently explained the role of extrinsic evidence in claim \nconstruction:  \nIn some cases, however, the district cour t will need to look beyond the patent’s \nintrinsic evidence and to consult extrin sic evidence in order to understand, for \nexample, the background science or the meaning of a term in the relevant art during the relevant time period. See, e.g., Seymour v. Osborne , 11 Wall. 516, 546 \n(1871) (a patent may be “so interspersed w ith technical terms a nd terms of art that \nthe testimony of scientific witnesses is indispensable to a correct understanding of \nits meaning”). In cases where those subsid iary facts are in dispute, courts will \nneed to make subsidiary factual findings about that extrinsic evidence. These are \nthe “evidentiary underpinnings” of claim construction that we discussed in \nMarkman , and this subsidiary f actfinding must be review ed for clear error on \nappeal. \nTeva Pharm. USA, Inc. v. Sandoz, Inc. , 135 S. Ct. 831, 841 (2015).  \nThe “determination of claim indefiniteness is a legal conclusion that is drawn from the \nCourt’s performance of its duty as the construer of patent claims.” Exxon Research & Eng’g Co. \nv. United States , 265 F.3d 1371, 1375 (Fed. Cir. 2001). Section 112 entails a “delicate balance” \nbetween precision and uncertainty:  \nOn the one hand, the definiteness requirement  must take into account the inherent \nlimitations of language. Some modicum of  uncertainty, the Court has recognized, \nis the price of ensuring the appropriate incentives for innovation. . . . At the same \ntime, a patent must be precise enough to afford clear notice of what is claimed, \nthereby apprising the public of what is still open to them. Otherwise there would \nbe a zone of uncertainty which enterpri se and experimentation may enter only at \nthe risk of infringement claims. And ab sent a meaningful definiteness check, we Case 2:14-cv-00906-JRG     Document 109     Filed 09/21/15     Page 7 of 43 PageID #: \n<pageID> \n8 \n are told, patent applicants face powerful in centives to inject ambiguity into their \nclaims. . . . Eliminating that temptation is in  order, and the patent drafter is in the \nbest position to resolve the ambiguity in patent claims. \nNautilus Inc. v. Biosig Instruments, Inc. , 134 S. Ct. 2120, 2128–29 (2014) (citations omitted). \nTherefore, in order for a patent  to be definite under § 112, ¶ 2,4 “a patent’s claims, viewed in \nlight of the specification and pros ecution history, [are required to] inform those skilled in the art \nabout the scope of the inventi on with reasonable certainty.” Id. at 2129. The determination of \n“definiteness is measured from the viewpoint of a person skilled in the ar t at the time the patent \nwas filed.” Id. at 2128 (emphasis in original, ci tations omitted). “The definiteness \nrequirement . . . mandates clarity, while recognizi ng that absolute precision is unattainable.” Id. \nat 2129. This standard reflects rulings that have found that “the certainty which the law requires \nin patents is not greater than is reasonabl e, having regard to their subject-matter.” Id. at 2129. \nWhen a term of degree is used in a claim, “the court must determine whether the patent provides \nsome standard for measuring that degree.” Biosig Instruments, Inc. v. Nautilus, Inc. , 783 F.3d \n1374, 1378 (Fed. Cir. 2015) (quotation marks omitted). Likewise, when a subjective term is used \nin a claim, “the court must determine whether the patent's specification supplies some standard \nfor measuring the scope of the [term].” Datamize, LLC v. Plumtree Software, Inc. , 417 F.3d \n1342, 1351 (Fed. Cir. 2005); accord  Interval Licensing LLC v. AOL, Inc. , 766 F.3d 1364, 1371 \n(Fed.

CONSTRUCTION OF AGREED TERMS \nThe parties have agreed to the following c onstructions set forth in their Joint Claim \nConstruction Chart Pursuant to Pate nt Local Rule 4-5(d) (Dkt. No. 101): \nTerm5 Agreed Construction \n“search engine’s own computer” \n ’339 Patent Claim 1 \n ’333 Patent Claim 1 Plain and ordinary meaning (subject to \nconstruction of “search engine”). \n“providing the right of access to the search \nengine’s or Host Website’s computer” \n ’333 Patent Claim 1 Plain and ordinary meaning (subject to \nconstruction of “search  engine” and “Host \nWebsite’s computer”). \nHaving reviewed the intrinsic and extrinsic ev idence of record, the Court agrees with and \nhereby adopts the parties’ agreed constructions. \nIV. CONSTRUCTION OF DISPUTED TERMS \nPlaintiff submits that the person having ordina ry skill in the art, from whose perspective \nthe claims are interpreted, is:  \na person with an advanced  college degree and some business experience. The \nperson would further possess at least a basic knowledge of Internet search \nconcepts, as well as at least some fu ndamental computer programming skills.  \nDkt. No. 94 at 8 (citing Declar ation of Ryan M. Garlick, Ph.D. (“Garlick Decl.”) ¶ 32 (Plaintiff’s \nEx. F, Dkt. No. 94-7 at 8)).  Defendants do not oppose Plain tiff’s submission and have not \nsubmitted a competing definition of the person of ordi nary skill in the art. Accordingly, the Court \nadopts Plaintiff’s proposal.  \n \n                                                 \n5 For all term charts in this or der, the claims in which the term  is found are listed with the term \nbut: (1) only the highest level term in each depe ndency chain is listed, and (2) only asserted \nclaims, as identified by Plaintiff in his ope ning brief (Dkt. No. 94 at 5), are listed.  Case 2:14-cv-00906-JRG     Document 109     Filed 09/21/15     Page 9 of 43 PageID #: \n<pageID> \n10 \n A. “digital label” / “label” / “labels” \nDisputed Term Plaintiff’s Proposed \nConstruction Defendants’ Proposed \nConstruction \n“digital label” \n ’807 Patent Claims 1, 3 \n ’665 Patent Claim 1, 55 \n ’325 Patent Claim 7 “Symbols or designations in \nelectronic form representing qualitative or descriptive data or characteristics” Plain and ordinary meaning. \n“label” / “labels” \n ’665 Patent Claims 1, 55 \n ’333 Patent Claim 1 \n ’325 Patent Claim 7 “Symbols or designations in \nelectronic form representing qualitative or descriptive data or characteristic” Plain and ordinary meaning. \nBecause the parties’ arguments and proposed constructions with re spect to these terms \nare related, the Court addre sses the terms together.  \nThe Parties’ Positions \nPlaintiff submits that the terms “label” and “digital label,” as used in the claims, have the \nsame meaning. Dkt. No. 94 at 19–21. Plaintiff su bmits that the terms were defined in the \nAsserted Patents and prosecuti on history as “symbols” that  “convey unambiguous qualitative \ndata about an item, its maker, or its owner, in digital form.” Id. at 9–10. Plaintiff argues that his \nproposed construction captures this definition and that Defendants’ proposed construction \nthreatens to encompass prior art such as meta-tag s that Plaintiff distingui shed from his invention \nduring prosecution. Id. at 10–11.  \nIn addition to the claims, Plaintiff cites the following intrinsic and extrinsic evidence in \nsupport of his position. Intrinsic evidence : ’665 Patent col.3:13–41, col.4 ll.16–23, col.4 l.54 – \ncol.5 l.3, col.5 l.46 – col.6 l.9, col.7 l.47 – col.8 l.25, col.11 l.63 – col.12 l.26, col.12 ll.35–55, \ncol.15 ll.6–9; ’339 Patent File Wrapper December 29, 2003 Amendment (excerpt) (Plaintiff’s Ex.

Nos. 94-12 and 94-\n13). Extrinsic evidence : Garlick Decl. (Plaintiff’s Ex. F, Dkt. No. 94-7). \nDefendants, in response, partially agree with Pl aintiff. Defendants agree that “labels” are \nin electronic form because: (1) a “digital label” is “digital;” and (2) the other claim language \nshows that the “label”/“l abels” are in electronic  form. Dkt. No. 96 at 12. But Defendants disagree \nwith the remainder of Plaintiff’s proposed cons truction. Defendants submit that “label” is an \nordinary English word that is used in the Asse rted Patents according to its plain and ordinary \nmeaning. It does not have a special definition according to Defendants. Id. at 13.  \nDefendants argue that Plaint iff’s proposed construction im properly: (1) renders other \nclaim language superfluous, id. at 13–14; (2) excludes exemplary embodiments, specifically \n“hybrid digital labels” a nd “quantitative” labels, id. at 14–15; and (3) ignor es the fact that the \nordinary meaning of “label” is used in the Asserted Patents and the prosecution history, id. at 15–\n16. In addition, Defendants argue that Plaintiff’s proposed constructions w ould render the claims \nindefinite as it would be uncertain whether meta -tags would fall within the scope of the “label” \nlimitation. Id. at 17–19. Finally, Defendants argue that und er the plain and ordinary meaning of \n“label,” the claims are not limited to the “label s” which Plaintiff invented. That renders the \nclaims invalid. Id. at 19–20.  \nIn addition to the claims, Defendants cite the following intrinsic and extrinsic evidence to \nsupport their position.

Extrinsic evidence : Merriam-Webster Dictionary, “label”, \navailable at http://www.merriam -webster.com/dictionary/label. \nPlaintiff replies that Defendants’ proposed construction does not account for the fact “that \nthe entirety of the intrinsic record is direct ed to describing the unique ness and novelty of the \nclaimed ‘digital labels.’” Dkt. No. 98 at 3. First , with respect to superfluous claims language, \nPlaintiff argues that his proposed  construction does not conflict with other claim language and \nthat any redundant language would be minimal and not confusing. For example, Plaintiff argues \nthat the jury will understand the proposed constructi on of label and still unde rstand that the label \ncan further represent a separately claimed label w ith specific qualitative or descriptive data or \ncharacteristics. Id. at 3–4. Second , with respect to potentially excluded exemplary embodiments, \nPlaintiff argues that the “ hybrid digital label” is a combination of digital labels and the prior-art \nword search. The claims, according to Plaintiff, are directed to the digital label portion of a \n“hybrid digital label,” and are not  directed to the prior-art word  search portion of that label. \nPlaintiff also argues that “qua ntitative” labels are encompasse d under the proposed construction \nas representing “descriptive data.” Id. at 4–5. Third , with respect to “label” being used according \nto its common meaning to describe the prior art, su ch use is distinct from the use of “label” to \ndescribe the claimed digital labels. Id. at 5–6. Finally , with respect to whether the claims are \nindefinite under the proposed construction, they are not—meta-tags are not within the meaning \nof “digital label” because  they are not symbolic. Id. at 6. Plaintiff cites further intrinsic evidence  \nto support his position: ’665 Patent col.6 ll.28–32, 60–64; ’339 Patent File Wrapper May 21, \n2004 Response/Amendment (Defendant s’ Ex. 11, Dkt. No. 96-12).  Case 2:14-cv-00906-JRG     Document 109     Filed 09/21/15     Page 12 of 43 PageID #: \n<pageID> \n13 \n Analysis \nThe parties agree that the “labels” in th e claimed invention are electronic, whether \ninherently or in the context of the entire claim,  and therefore all claimed “labels” are “digital \nlabels.” The parties dispute (1) whether “label s” are necessarily symbolic, and (2) whether \n“labels” are necessarily limited to representing quali tative or descriptive da ta or characteristics. \nThe Court is not convinced that the claim term s are understandable without construction. Nor is \nthe Court convinced that Plaint iff’s proposed construction properl y captures the scope of these \nterms.  \nAs stated in the Asserted Patents, Plaintiff, the sole inventor of the Asserted Patents, \nbelieved that Internet content, specifically websites,  could not be identified in a search except by \ninspection of their content. ’665 Patent col.1 ll.31–44. Thus, he noted, searches at the time of \ninvention connected conten t publishers with their audience (surfers) by searching the Internet \ncontent for words or phrases that matched the wo rds or phrases in a surfer’s query (the “word \nmatch” searches). Id. at col.1 ll.33–59. Plaintiff noted s hortcomings in these word-match \nsearches, namely that they “ only give clues as to a site’s nature, not unambiguous information \nabout a site or its publisher . As a result, searches generally yi eld[ed] a large number of matches, \nmost of which [did] not answer the surfer’s needs.” Id. at col.1 ll.59–62 (emphasis added). And \nPlaintiff noted the way in whic h the industry dealt with these shortcomings: it used humans to \nmanually assemble sites according to categories to  create listings similar to “Yellow Pages” \nlistings. Id. at col.2 ll.11–24.  \nThe inventor criticized these prior-art appro aches and proposed a different solution: label \nthe websites and use the labels, not the content,  to identify websites relevant to the surfer’s \nquery. Id. at col.1 l.59 – col.3 l.57. In explaining the invention, Plaintiff liken ed the state of the Case 2:14-cv-00906-JRG     Document 109     Filed 09/21/15     Page 13 of 43 PageID #: \n<pageID> \n14 \n art of the Internet to an unorganized library in  which a reader located information in a book by \nreading all of the books in the lib rary. He explained that his i nvention improved the Internet by \norganizing it in a way akin to organizing the books  in the library by category and then searching \nfor information in the books by reference to in formation about the books codified on index cards: \nThere is provided a Host Website system  and method in which subscribers label \ntheir own products and services and in  which similarly labelled objects and \nservices are stored in common locations w ith hierarchical multi-parameter labels.  \nThe system includes Inte rnet-related data-gatheri ng, labelling, storing and \nsearching methods. The system and met hod can best be appreciated by metaphor: \nconsider the Internet as a library whose books (websites) are not only scattered at \nrandom but also indistinguishable from each other except upon actually being opened. Internet portals are like librarians who are resign ed to the fact that the \nbooks (websites) are in disarray, but purpor t to help readers by speed-reading. The \npresent invention creates or der in the library by esta blishing discrete sections \nwhere books (websites) can be organized by category, and by codifying information about each book (website) on index cards so that readers can more easily identify the books (w ebsites) they need.  \nId. at col.2 ll.51–67. The “lab els” of the Asserted Patents are akin to the index cards of the \nmetaphorical library.  \nThe labels are described as “evidencing [] identified qualitative characteristics” of the \nwebsite or the labelling-service s ubscriber that are identified in re sponse to a series of questions \nposed “with a view to determin ing qualitative characteristics.” Id. at col.3 ll.12–33 (stating an \nexample of labeling: “If A [e.g., subscriber clicked a box sayi ng it offers scholarships for \nminorities], then B [instruction to computer to write an appropriate code, e.g., ‘mnsch’, and \nassociate it with this listing]”).  \nThe Asserted Patents define the “labels” of the invention:  \nAs discussed above, subscribers label thei r websites and the labels are digitized. A \n“label” is something which identifies contents, or provides information about \nthe subscriber or his website . Generally, the labels are multi-parameter digital \nlabels. That is, a plur ality of labels, each one  conveying unambiguous qualitative \ndata about an item, its maker, or its owner , in digital form are created. This \npermits an item to be identified by com puters according to the presence, absence, Case 2:14-cv-00906-JRG     Document 109     Filed 09/21/15     Page 14 of 43 PageID #: \n<pageID> \n15 \n or configuration of the labels. An example of two-parameter labelling is to label a \nlist of people. In computer field “A”, place a “0” or a “1” to indicate if a person is \nmale or female, respectively. In field “B”,  place a 0 to indicate  a college graduate, \nand a blank (null entry) otherwise. Shoul d one want to identify males who are not \ncollege graduates, the computer would s earch Field A for 0s, and Field B for null \nentries. The conjunction of the two sets would yield the desired list of males. \nId. at col.4 l.54 – col.5 l.3 (emp hasis added). That is, the “lab els” of the invention convey \n“unambiguous qualitative data about an  item, its maker, or its owner.”  \nWith reference to the library metaphor, the “l abels” serve as index cards to Internet \ncontent in that they contain information about websites that allows one to identify a desired \nwebsite without examining the content of the website: \nAt any [time after creation of the labels],  any subscriber coul d be searched for \nthrough the Host Website on the basis of a ny configuration of di gital labels, e.g., \nstate-sponsored universities in Calif ornia which offer minority-eligible \nscholarships. To perform this search, a Host Website comput er would scan its \ndatabase for listings which have the “mnsch” label as well as the particular labels for the other characteristics of being a school, more precisely a university, state-\nsponsored, in California. \nSearches within a Host Website, with a defined scope, can therefore be more \nprecise and direct than is  possible under any currentl y-used search method on the \nInternet. Most important, from the viewpoint of the subscriber, the multi-\nparameter digital labelling and the Host We bsite together provide assurance that it \nwill be found by its target audience—not the case for most websites today. For \nexample, a hypothetical Chinese restaurant, if it had a website, would be unlikely \nto be found through a portal unless one kne w its exact name; whereas if it were \nlisted on a hypothetical Host Website on Ne w York City, it would surely be found \nby many persons under varying circumstances  and search parameters. Moreover, \nwhen found through a Host Website, a webs ite would be in a high-relevance list \nand on the first few pages of hits, not the case with portal search results, in which \nthe valid answers if any are often hidden in a sea of irrelevance. \nId. at col.3 ll.34–57.  \nThe Court does not understand Plaintiff’s propo sed construction of “label” to clarify the \nmeaning of the term. The Asserted  Patents make clear that a labe l is a symbol because the label \nis symbolic of a qualitative characte ristic about the subject being labeled. See, e.g. , id. at col.4 \nll.16–23 (contrasting labels as “symbols” with word -matches “which are mere character-strings Case 2:14-cv-00906-JRG     Document 109     Filed 09/21/15     Page 15 of 43 PageID #: \n<pageID> \n16 \n of unknown significance”), col.7 ll.48–54 (contrasti ng labels as “symbols” from “[w]ord-\nmatching and category-listing activit ies [that] are not symbolic in structure”). It is not clear how \na “symbol” is distinct from a “designation” under  Plaintiff’s construction. Nor is it clear how \nqualitative data is distinct from qualitative charac teristics, or how a qualitative characteristic is \ndistinct from a descriptive characteristic. Pl aintiff’s construction fa ils to account for the \nunambiguous nature of the label, i. e., the nature of the particular quality asso ciated with the label \nis unambiguous.  \nThe “symbolic” nature of labels does not excl ude “hybrid digital labels” from the scope \nof the claims. The “hybrid digital label” denotes a particular characteristic  of the subject because \nit is symbolic of qualitative data pertaining to the subject and also includes a particular instance \nof that characteristic. As explaine d in the Asserted Patents, “[a]  hybrid digital la bel is one in \nwhich the field is unambiguously digitally defined as a certain kind of field, but the subscriber \nentry in the field is a character string.” Id. at col.6 ll.33–34. The patents provide an illustrative \nexample in which the field (i.e., characteristic of  the subject) is “wine merchant stock list” and \nthe entry is a particular wine ca rried by the subject wine merchant. Id. at col.6 ll.35–64. Thus, the \nhybrid digital label is a hybrid of the digital la bel (symbolic of a char acteristic of the wine \nmerchant, its stock list) and textua l content (the name of the stocke d wines set forth in text). The \nAsserted Patents explain this in contrast to the name of particular wine appearing haphazardly in \nInternet content, in which the appearance of the name has no m eaningful significance until read \nin context of the website in which it appears. See id . at col.6 ll.46–60. \nThe Court does not understand “qualitative dat a” as used in the Asserted Patents to \nexclude numerical, or “quantitative,” informati on as Defendants propose. Dkt. No. 96 at 15. \nWhat Defendants characterize as “quantitativ e” characteristics, and conclude are not Case 2:14-cv-00906-JRG     Document 109     Filed 09/21/15     Page 16 of 43 PageID #: \n<pageID> \n17 \n “qualitative” characteristics, namely height, weight, age, sales, profits, and number of \nemployees, are simply qualities of a subject entity that may be expressed numerically and that can be used to identify the subject. The patent sets  forth examples of “qualitative characteristics” \nthat expressly include numerical data that ca n be used to identify a particular subject: \nIn the process of creating its  listing online, each subscr iber is asked questions by \nthe Host Website computer, with a view to determining qualitative characteristics, such as: general nature (e.g., school); more  specific nature (e.g., university); an \nenumeration of its activities,  services, or products (e.g.,  medicine, law, business, \netc.); its price range  or an indicator thereof (e.g., state-sponsored); its \nheadquarters and/or operating location(s) (e.g., Los Angeles,  Santa Barbara, etc.); \nits payment and credit practi ces (e.g. scholarship for mi norities); and similar data \ndepending on the nature of the subscriber. \nThe Host Website computer poses quest ions automatically, takes account of \nprevious answers, and avoids asking in applicable questions. When the data-\ngathering sequence is concluded (a proce ss of about 10 minutes), it converts the \nanswers into a plurality of digital la bels evidencing each of the identified \nqualitative characteristics. This can be  effected with almost any programming \nlanguage capable of handling instructions  in the form “If A [e.g., subscriber \nclicked a box saying it offers scholarships for minorities], then B [instruction to computer to write an appropr iate code, e.g., “mnsch”, a nd associate it with this \nlisting]. \n’665 Patent col.3 ll.13–33 (emphasis added); see also , ’339 File Wrapper November 9, 2007 Fax \nat 4 (“qualitative data” means “data that can be us ed to differentiate one website from another in \na meaningful way”) (Defendants’ Ex. 2, Dkt. No. 96-3 at 5).) \nFinally, the Court expressly re jects Defendants’ invalidity arguments based on 35 U.S.C. \n§ 112, ¶ 2. First, the Court reject s Defendants’ argument based on Allen Eng’g Corp. v. Bartell \nIndus. , 299 F.3d 1336 (Fed. Cir. 2002). In Allen , the Federal Circuit held that certain claims were \ninvalid because the patent’s description of the invention was contrary to the plain and \nunambiguous meaning of the language in the cl aims. The patent described the invention as \nessentially having two feat ures that could not pivo t perpendicularly to each  other, yet the claims \ndescribed two features that could only pivot perpendicularly to each other. Id. at 1349. Unlike the Case 2:14-cv-00906-JRG     Document 109     Filed 09/21/15     Page 17 of 43 PageID #: \n<pageID> \n39 \n Court rejects Defendants’ inde finiteness argument and determin es that the term has its inclusive  \nplain and ordinary meaning . \nH. “stored websites” \nDisputed Term Plaintiff’s Proposed \nConstruction Defendants’ Proposed \nConstruction \n“stored websites” \n ’339 Patent Claim 1 Plain and ordinary meaning. \nAlternative : “a website stored \nwithin a computer system \naccessible to the search engine.” \nA “website” is: “a file or \nrelated group of files available on the Internet.” Indefinite. \nThe Parties’ Positions \nPlaintiff submits that the plain meaning of “s tored websites,” when read in the context of \nthe claims, means that the websites are stored on a computer system, and that computer system is \naccessible to the search engine. Dkt. No. 94 at  24–25. In addition to the claims themselves, \nPlaintiff cites the following extrinsic evidence  to support his position: Garlick Decl. (Plaintiff’s \nEx. F, Dkt. No. 94-7); D ouglas A. Downing et al., Dictionary of Computer  and Internet Terms  \n(7th ed. 2000) (Plaintiff’s Ex. N, Dkt. No. 94-15) . Defendants respond that there is no antecedent \nbasis for “stored websites,” therefore, the claims are indefinite. Dkt. No. 96 at 33.  \nAnalysis \nThe dispute here is whether “stored websites” in the last clause of Claim 1 of the ’339 \nPatent (reproduced below and annotat ed by the Court) requires an an tecedent basis for the claims \nto be definite. The Court is not persuaded th at Defendants have prove n by clear and convincing \nevidence that any claim is indefinite b ecause of the “stored websites” term.   Case 2:14-cv-00906-JRG     Document 109     Filed 09/21/15     Page 39 of 43 PageID #: \n<pageID> \n40 \n Defendants’ indefiniteness argument fails for lack of a valid premise. Their argument is \nentirely premised on the contention that “sto red website” is not understandable because the term \nlacks an antecedent basis. This contention is false on its face. Claim elements and steps are always introduced for the first time in the claim without an antecedent basis in the claim. The claim language at issue, “stored websites,” is not preceded by a definite article such as “the” or “said.” As such, th e indication is that “stored \nwebsites” was introduced for the first time in the final clause of the claim. And the inde finite articles that are typically used to introduce a new element, \n“a” or “an,” are not appropriate as “stored websit es” is plural. As such, there is no lack of \nantecedent basis because there is no antecedent reference.  \nThere can be no real dispute over whether a website is “stored.” The claims do not \nrequire that websites be stored in  any particular fashion or in any particular memory—only that \nthey be stored. Because the claim is entirely si lent on the issue, the Court rejects Defendants’ \ncontention that the search engine of the claim do es not store websites. Whether the search engine \ndoes or does not store websites is irrelevant so long as the websites are stored. The Court also \nrejects Plaintiff’s position that the websites must be stored on a computer system accessible to the search engine, again because the claim is silent on that issue. In the context of the claim language, it is clear that the claimed method provi des public access to a mechanism to search for \nstored websites based on the labels. So the stor ed websites are identified by or through the labels. \nBut it is not clear to the Court that the stored websites must be accessible to the search engine. \nThe websites need only be identifiable by “searches based on the labels.”  \n’339 Patent Case 2:14-cv-00906-JRG     Document 109     Filed 09/21/15     Page 40 of 43 PageID #: \n<pageID> \n41 \n Defendants have not proven by clear and convi ncing evidence that the “stored websites” \nlanguage renders the claims indefi nite. Accordingly, the Court reje cts Defendants’ indefiniteness \nargument and determines that the term has its plain and ordinary meaning  without need for \nfurther construction.  \nI.  “Host Website’s computer” \nDisputed Term Plaintiff’s Proposed \nConstruction Defendants’ Proposed \nConstruction \n“Host Website’s computer” \n ’333 Patent Claim 1 Plain and ordinary meaning. \nAlternative : “a computer \nsystem on which a Host Website platform is running.” Indefinite. \nThe Parties’ Positions \nPlaintiff submits that the term “Host Website” refers to “a website for creating and \nstoring digital labels” as expr essly defined in the Asserted  Patents and “Host Website’s \ncomputer” carries its plain and ordinary meani ng. Dkt. No. 94 at 30–31. In addition to the claims \nthemselves, Plaintiff cites the following intrinsi c and extrinsic evidence to support his position. \nIntrinsic evidence : ’665 Patent col.3 ll.1–7, col.5 ll.19–22, 58–60, col.10 l.55 – col.11 l.12, \ncol.15 ll.6–9, 36–47, col.16 ll.6–14, col.17 ll.42–47;  ’339 Filer Wrapper October 25, 2004 \nAmendment (excerpt) (Plaintiff’s Ex. S, Dkt. No. 94-20). Extrinsic evidence : Garlick Decl. \n(Plaintiff’s Ex. F, Dkt. No. 94-7). \nDefendants respond that “Host Website’s comput er” appears to be an erroneous addition \nto the claim and has no antecedent basis, and ther efore the claims are indefinite. Dkt. No. 96 at \n33–34. Plaintiff replies that the claim includes an  obvious clerical error and that “or Host \nWebsite” should be read into the claim immediately following the first recitation of “search engine.” Dkt. No. 98 at 11. Case 2:14-cv-00906-JRG     Document 109     Filed 09/21/15     Page 41 of 43 PageID #: \n<pageID> \n42 \n Analysis \nThe parties appear to agree that  there is an error in Claim 1 of the ’333 Patent but they \ndisagree as to the nature of the error. Defenda nts argue that “Host Webs ite’s” was erroneously \nincluded in the claim, Dkt. No. 96 at 33–34, wh ereas Plaintiff argues that “Host Website” was \nerroneously omitted from the claim, Dkt. No. 98 at 11. Based on the record, the Court determines that “Host Website” was erroneously omitted, that  the nature of the error is not subject to \nreasonable debate, and the Court has authority to co rrect the error to clarif y that “Host Website’s \ncomputer” has an antecedent basis and th erefore the claim is not indefinite.   \nThe Court may correct an obvious error in \nclaim language in a patent infringement suit when “(1) the correction is not s ubject to reasonable debate \nbased on consideration of the claim language and the \nspecification and (2) the pr osecution history does not \nsuggest a different interpretation of the claims.” CBT \nFlint Partners, LLC v. Return Path, Inc. , 654 F.3d \n1353, 1358 (Fed. Cir. 2011). In the claims of the ’333 \nPatent that depend from  Claim 1 and reference a \n“search engine,” the claims universally reference “search engine” in conjunction with “Host Website” (Claims 1 through 3 are reproduced he re and annotated by the Court). See ’333 Patent col.23 \nll.47–48, 50, 52, 59–60, col.24 ll.14–15, 24–25, col.26 ll.12–13. Thus, it is apparent from the \nface of the patent that the fi rst recital of “search engine” erroneously omitted “or Host \n’333 Patent Case 2:14-cv-00906-JRG     Document 109     Filed 09/21/15     Page 42 of 43 PageID #: \n<pageID> \n43 \n Website’s” and the Court construes the claims to in clude “or Host Website’s” inserted into Claim \n1 at column 23 line 37 after “search engi ne’s” and before “own computer.”  \nDefendants have not proven by clear and conv incing evidence that the “Host Website’s \ncomputer” language renders the claims indefin ite. Accordingly, the Court rejects Defendants’ \nindefiniteness argument and determines that the term has its plain and ordinary meaning and \nClaim 1 of the ’333 Patent is corre cted (in underline) as follows: \n1. A method of labelling at least one of Inte rnet websites and reco rds accessible through \nthe Internet, comprising:  \ncreating and encoding of data on the searchab le content of the website or accessible \nrecord according to an agreed convention, so  as to produce a plurality of labels for \neach website or record, or each of the plur ality of websites or records, each label \nrepresenting a particular  item of said data;  \nincorporating the created labels in a f ile resident on the we bsite or record;  \ncopying and storing the labels on a search engine’s or Host Website’s own computer;  \nproviding the right of access to the search  engine’s or Host Website’s computer \nthrough the Internet for purposes of editing the records; and  \nfacilitating searches and record retrieva ls based on the labels, by a plurality of \nauthorized parties each with defined and limited scope or nature of access, for \nsaid websites or records. \nV. CONCLUSION \nThe Court adopts the above cons tructions set forth in this opinion for the agreed and \ndisputed terms of the Asserted Pa tents. The parties are ordered that  they may not refer, directly \nor indirectly, to each other’s claim construction positions in the presence of the jury. Likewise, the parties are ordered to refr ain from mentioning any portion of  this opinion, other than the \nactual definitions adopte d by the Court, in the presence of the jury. Any reference to claim \nconstruction proceedings is limited to informing the jury of the definitions adopted by the Court.

    "summary": "1. **Summary:**\n   In the case of Thaler v. Vidal, the court addressed whether an artificial intelligence (AI) system can be recognized as an inventor under the United States Patent Act. Stephen Thaler, who developed an AI system named DABUS, sought patents listing DABUS as the inventor; however, the United States Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) denied these applications based on the Patent Act's definition that restricts inventors to natural persons, i.e., humans. Ultimately, the court upheld the PTO's decision, affirming that under the current statutory scheme, only human beings can be recognized as inventors.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue:**\n   Whether an artificial intelligence (AI) system can be considered an \"inventor\" under the U.S. Patent Act, which defines an inventor as an \"individual.\"\n\n3. **Court's Holding:**\n   The court held that under the Patent Act, an \"inventor\" must be a human being, i.e., a natural person, and therefore, an AI system cannot be listed as an inventor on a patent application. The court affirmed that the statutory language is clear and unambiguous in requiring inventors to be individuals, meaning human beings.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation:**\n   Imagine you create a really smart robot that builds new gadgets without your input. You want to name the robot as the inventor of these gadgets when applying for a patent. However, the law says only humans can officially be called inventors on patents. So, the court told you that you can't name your robot as an inventor because it’s not a person. The judge made it clear: only people can be inventors, not robots or computers – no matter how smart they are!",

Specifically, we are asked to decide if an arti-\nficial intelligen ce (AI) software system can be listed as the  \ninventor on a patent application.  At first, it might seem \nthat resolving this issue would involve an abstract  inquiry \ninto the nature of invention or the  rights, if any, of AI  sys-\ntems .  In fact, however, we do not need to ponder these met-\naphysical  matters.  Instead, our task  begins  – and ends  – \nwith consideration of the applicable definition in the rele-\nvant statute . \nThe United States Patent and T rademark Office (PTO) \nundertook the same analysis and concluded that the P atent \nAct defines “ inventor” as limited to natural persons; that \nis, human beings.  Accordingly, the PTO denied Stephen \nThaler’s patent applications , which  failed to list any hu-\nman a s an inventor.   Thaler challenged that conclusion in \nthe U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia , \nwhich agreed with the PTO and granted it  summary judg-\nment.  We , too, conclude that the Patent Act requires an \n“inventor”  to be  a natural person  and, therefore,  affirm.  \nI \nThaler represents that he develops and runs AI  sys-\ntems that generate patentable inventions.  One such sys-\ntem is his “Device for the Autonomous Boots trapping of Case: 21-2347      Document: 60     Page: 2     Filed: 08/05/2022THALER  v. VIDAL  3 \nUnified Science ,” which Thaler calls “DABUS.”   Thale r has \ndescribed DABUS as “a collection  of source code or pro-\ngramming and a software program.”  Supp. App. at 781.  \nIn July 2019, Thaler sought patent protection for  two \nof DABUS’ putative inventions  by filing t wo patent appli-\ncations  with the PTO: U.S. Appli cation Nos. 16/524,350 \n(teaching a “Neural Flame”) and 16/524,532 (teaching a \n“Fractal Container”).1  He listed  DABUS as the sole inven-\ntor on both applications.  Thaler  maintains that he did not \ncontribute to the conception of these inventions and that \nany person having skill in the art could have taken \nDABUS’ output and reduced the ideas in the applications to practice.\n2  \nIn lieu of an inventor’s last name, Thaler wrote on the \napplications that  “the invention [was] generated by artifi-\ncial intelligence .”  App. at 28, 69.   He also  attached several \ndocuments relevant to inventorship .  First, to satisfy 35 \nU.S.C. §  115’s requirement that inventors submit a  sworn \noath or declaration when applying for a patent, Thaler \n \n1  The administrative records for both application s \nare materially identical.  \n2  W hile inventorship involves underlying questions \nof fact,  see Dana- Farber Cancer Inst., Inc. v. Ono Pharm. \nCo., 964 F.3d 1365, 1370 (Fed. Cir. 2020), cert. denied, 141 \nS. Ct. 2691 (2021) , for purposes of this litigation the PTO \nhas not challenged Thaler’s representations , see D. Ct. Dkt. \nNo. 25, at 11.   Accordingly,  our analysis must be consistent \nwith the  undisputed  facts in the administrative record, \ndrawin g inferences in favor of the non -moving party .  See \nSafeguard Base Operations, LLC v. United States, 989 F.3d \n1326, 1349 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (discussing when it is appropri-\nate to supplement administrative record and noting “[t]he focal point for judicial revi ew should be the administrative \nrecord already in existence ”) (quoting Camp v. Pitts , 411 \nU.S. 138, 142 (1973)).  Case: 21-2347      Document: 60     Page: 3     Filed: 08/05/2022THALER  v. VIDAL  4 \nsubmitted a statement on DAB US’ behalf.  Second, Thaler  \nprovided a supplemental  “Statement on Inventorship” ex-\nplaining that DABUS was “a particular type of connection-\nist artificial intelligence ” called a “Creativity Machine.”  \nApp. at 198 -203, 483- 88.  Third , Thaler filed a document \npurporting to assign  himself  all of D ABUS ’ rights as an in-\nventor. \nThe PTO concluded both applications lacked a valid in-\nventor and were , hence , incomplete.  Accordingly, it sent \nThaler a “Notice to File Missing Parts of Nonprovisional Application” for each application  and requested that Tha-\nler identify  valid inventor s.  In respo nse, Thaler petitioned \nthe PTO director to vacate the Notice s based on his  State-\nment s of Inventorship.  The PTO denied Thaler’s  petitions \non the ground that “a machine does not qualify as an in-ventor.”  App. at 269 -71, 548- 50.  Thaler sought reconsid-\neration, which  the PTO denied, explaining again t hat \ninventors on a patent application must be natural persons . \nThaler then pursued judicial review of the PTO’s final \ndecisi ons on his  petitions , under the Administrative Proce-\ndure Act (APA) .  See 5 U.S.C. §§ 702-704, 706.\n3  The parties \nagreed to have the District Court  adjudicate the challenge \nbased on the administrative record made before the PTO \nand filed cross -motions for summary ju dgment.  After  brief-\ning and oral argument, the Court granted the PTO’s motion for summary judgment and denied Thaler’s request to re-instate his applications.  The District Court concluded that \nan “inventor” under the Patent Act must be an “individual” \n \n3  The District Court had jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \n§ 1331.   See also  5 U.S.C. § 702 (“A person suffering legal \nwrong because of agency action, or adversely affected or ag-grieved by agency action within the meaning of a relevant \nstatute, is entitled to judicial review thereof.”) . Case: 21-2347      Document: 60     Page: 4     Filed: 08/05/2022THALER  v. VIDAL  5 \nand the plain meaning of “individual” as used in the statute \nis a natural person.  \nThaler appealed.   We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \n§ 1295.   See Odyssey Logistics & Tech. Corp. v. Iancu , 959 \nF.3d 1104, 1108 (Fed. Cir. 2020)  (explaining that Federal \nCircui t has jurisdiction over appeals from d istrict court de-\ncisions raising APA claims against  PTO regarding pa-\ntents).  \nII \nWe review grants of summary judgment according to \nthe law of the regional circuit, in this case the Fourth Cir-\ncuit.  S ee Supernus Pharms., Inc. v. Iancu , 913 F.3d 1351, \n1356 (Fed. Cir. 2019).   In the Fourth Circuit, a d istrict \ncourt’s grant of summary judg ment  is reviewed de novo .  \nSee i d. (citing Gallagher v. Reliance Standard Life Ins. Co. , \n305 F.3d 264, 268 (4th Cir. 2002) ).  Challenges to PTO pe-\ntition decisions are governed by the APA  and pertinent ad-\nministrative law standards.  Thus, we  may set aside the \njudgment resulting from  an administrative adjudication \nonly if the agency’s decision is “arbitrary , capricious, an \nabus e of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with \nlaw” or if the agency’s  actions are “in excess of statutory \njurisdiction, authority, or limitations.”  5 U.S.C. § 706 .  \n“Statutory interpretation is an issue of law that we review de novo.”  Facebook, Inc. v. Windy City Innovations, LLC , \n973 F.3d 1321, 1330 (Fed. Cir. 2020) . \nA \nThe sole issue on appeal is whether an AI software sys-\ntem can be an “inventor” under the Patent  Act.  In resolv-\ning disputes of statutory interpretation , we “begin[] with \nthe statutory text, and end[] there as well if the text is un-ambiguous .”  BedRoc Ltd.  v. United States , 541 U.S. 176, \n183 (2004).   Here, there is no ambiguity: the Patent Act \nrequires that inventors must be natural persons ; that is,  \nhuman beings.   Case: 21-2347      Document: 60     Page: 5     Filed: 08/05/2022THALER  v. VIDAL  6 \nThe Patent Act expressly provides t hat inventors are \n“individuals.”  Since 2011, with the passage of the Leahy -\nSmith America Invents Act, the Patent Act has defined an \n“inventor” as “the i ndividual  or, if a joint invention, the in-\ndividuals  collectively who invented or discovered the sub-\nject matter of the invention.”  35 U.S.C. §  100(f) (emphasis \nadded).  The Act  similarly defines “joint inventor” and \n“coinventor” as “any 1 of the individual s who invented or \ndiscovered the subject matter of a joint invention.”  § 100(g ) \n(emphasis added).  I n describing the statements required \nof an inventor when apply ing for a patent, the statute  con-\nsistently refers to inventors and co- inventors as “ individu-\nals.”  See § 115.  \nThe Patent Act does not define “individual .”  However, \nas the Supreme Court has explained , when used  “[a]s a \nnoun, ‘ individual’ ordinarily means a human being, a per-\nson.”   Mohamad v. Palestinian Auth. , 566 U.S. 449, 454  \n(2012)  (internal alteration and quotation marks omitted ).  \nThis is in accord with “how we use the word in everyday parlance”: “We say ‘the individual went to the store,’ ‘the \nindividual left the room,’ and ‘the individual took the car,’ \neach time referring unmist akably to a natural person.”  Id.   \nDictionaries confirm that this is the common  understand-\ning of the word .  See, e.g. , Individual,  Oxford English Dic-\ntionary (2022) (giving  first definition of “individual” as “[a] \nsingle human being ”); Individual , Dictionary.com (last vis-\nited July 11,  2022), https://www.dictionary.com/browse/in-\ndividual (giving “a single human being , as distinguished \nfrom a group” as first definition for “individual”).   So, too, \ndoes the Dictionary Act, which provides that legislat ive use \nof the words “person” and “whoever” broadly include (“un-less the context indicates otherwise”) “corporations, compa-\nnies, associations, firms, partnerships, societies, and joint \nstock companies, as well as individuals .”  1 U.S.C. § 1  (em-\nphasis added).  “ With the phrase ‘ as well as, ’ the definition \nmarks ‘individual’ as distinct from the list of artificial enti-\nties that precedes it ,” showing that Congress understands Case: 21-2347      Document: 60     Page: 6     Filed: 08/05/2022THALER  v. VIDAL  7 \n“individual” to indicate natural persons unless otherwise \nnoted.  Mohamad , 566 U.S. a t 454.  \nConsequently , the Supreme Court has held  that, when \nused in statutes, the word “individual” refers to human be-ings unless there is “ some indication Congress intended” a \ndifferent reading .  Id. at 455 (emphasis omitted) .\n4  Nothing \nin the Patent Act indicates Congress intended to deviate from the default meaning.  To the contrary , the rest of the \nPatent Act supports the conclu sion that  “individual”  in the \nAct refers to human beings . \nFor instance, the Act  uses personal pronouns  – “him-\nself” and “herself”  – to refer to an “individual. ”  § 115(b)(2).   \nIt does not also use “itself,” which it would have done if \nCongress intended to permit non -human inventors.  The \nPatent Act also requires inventors (unless deceased, inca-\npacitated, or unavailable) to submit an oath or declaration.  \nSee, e.g. , id. (requiring oath or declaration from inventor \nthat “such individual believes himself or herself to be the original inventor or an original joint inventor of a claimed \ninvention in the applicati on”).  While we do not decide \nwhether an AI system can form beliefs, nothing in our rec-\nord shows that one can, as reflected in the fact that Thaler \nsubmitted the requisite statements himself, purportedly on DABUS’ behalf.  \nThaler  directs us to  several provi sions of the Patent Act \nas supposed support for his position that “inventor” should \nbe broadly read to include AI software, but each  fails to \npersuade.  First, Thaler points to the use of “whoever” in \n \n4  While Mohamad interpreted a statute other than \nthe Patent Act, the Court’s reasoning is directly applicable \nhere.  See generally  Legal Def.  Fund v. Dep’t of Agric. , 933 \nF.3d 1088, 1093- 94 (9th Cir. 2019)  (concluding that “indi-\nvidual” refers to human being s and not animals , based in \npart on Mohamad ). Case: 21-2347      Document: 60     Page: 7     Filed: 08/05/2022THALER  v. VIDAL  8 \n35 U.S.C. §§ 101 and 271.  Section 101  provides that “[w] ho-\never invents or  discovers any new and useful process, ma-\nchine, manufacture, or composition of matter, or any new \nand useful improvemen t thereof, may obtain a patent \ntherefor, subject to the conditions and requirements of this title. ”  As this very section makes clear, however, patents \nmust satisfy the “conditions and requirements of” Title 35 \nof the U.S. Code, including its definition of  “inventor.”  Sec-\ntion 271,  in setting out what constitutes infringement, re-\npeatedly uses “whoever” to include  corporations and other \nnon-human entities .  That non- humans may infringe pa-\ntents does not tell us anything about whether non- humans \nmay also be in ventors of patents.  T he question before us \ninevitably leads back to the Patent Act’s definition of “in-\nventor,” which uses the word “individual” – and does not \nuse “whoever.”\n5  Furthermore, as we noted already, the \nDictionary Act establishes that Congress  uses “whoever” as \na much broader term than “individual.”  See 1 U.S.C. § 1.  \nSecond, Thaler contends that AI software programs \nmust qualify as inventors becau se otherwise patentability \nwould depend on “the manner in which the invention was made ,” in contra vention of 35 U.S.C. § 103.  Section 103 is \nnot about inventorship.   Instead, it  provid es, in relevant \npart, that inventions may still be nonobvious even if they are discovered during “routine” testing or experimentation.  See Honeywell Int’l Inc. v. Mexichem Amanco Holding S.A.  \nde C.V. , 865 F.3d 1348, 1356 (Fed. Cir. 2017); see also Gra-\nham v.  John Deere Co. , 383 U.S. 1, 15 (1966) (explaining \nthat second sentence of § 103 was intended to clarify that  \n“flash of creative genius” is unnecessary for patentability).   \nThis statutory provision relat es to how an invention is \n \n5  While the PTO also initially relied on the use of \n“whoever” in § 101 of the Patent Act , the PTO has also con-\nsistently explained that “individual” i s limited to natural \npersons , a position we now uphold .   Case: 21-2347      Document: 60     Page: 8     Filed: 08/05/2022THALER  v. VIDAL  9 \nmade and does not trump a  provision that specifically ad-\ndresses who may be an inventor.  \nThird, Thaler emphasizes that the term  “inventor” \nmust be interpreted with attention to the “context in which \nthat language is used[] and the broader context of the stat-\nute as a whole.”  Yates v.  United States, 57 4 U.S. 528 , 537 \n(2015) ( internal quotation marks omitted) .  We have under-\ntaken precisely this task.  F or the reasons explained above, \nthe Patent Act, when considered  in its entire ty, confirms \nthat “inventors” must be human beings.  \nB \nOur holding today that an “inventor” must be a human \nbeing is supported by our own precedent .  See Univ. of Utah \nv. Max -Planck -Gesellschaft zur Forderung der Wissen-\nschaften E.V. , 734 F.3d 1315, 1323 (Fed. Cir. 2013)  \n(“[I]nventors must be natural persons and cannot be corpo-\nrations or sovereigns.” ) (emphasis added) ; Beech Aircraft \nCorp. v. EDO Corp. , 990 F.2d 1237, 1248 (Fed. Cir. 1993)  \n(“[O]nly natural persons can be ‘inventors.’”).   While these \nopinions addressed different questions – concluding that \nneithe r corporations nor sovereigns can be inventors – our \nreasoning did not depend on the fact that institutions are \ncollective entities.  The two cases confirm that the plain \nmeaning of “inventor” in the Patent Act is limited to natu-ral persons.  \nC \nStatutes ar e often open to multiple reasonable  read-\nings.  Not so here.  This is a case in which  the question of \nstatutory interpretation begins  and ends  with the plain \nmeaning of the text .  See Bostock v. Clayton Cnty. , 140 S. \nCt. 1731, 1749 (2020) ( “This Court has explained many \ntimes over many years, when the meaning of the statute’s terms is plain, our job is at an end .”).  In the Patent Act, \n“individuals” – and, thus, “inventors” – are unambiguously \nnatural person s.  Accordingly , we have no need to consider Case: 21-2347      Document: 60     Page: 9     Filed: 08/05/2022THALER  v. VIDAL  10 \nadditional tools of statutory  construct ion.  See Matal v. \nTam , 137 S. Ct. 1744, 1756 (2017) (“[I]nquiry into the \nmeaning of the statute’s text ceases when the statutory \nlanguage is unambiguous and the statutory scheme is co-\nherent and consistent.” ) (internal  quotation marks omit-\nted). \nIII \nWe briefly address Thaler’s additional arguments.  \nThaler  argues that inventions generated by AI should \nbe patentable in order to encourage innovation and public disclosure.  Thaler’s policy arguments are speculative and \nlack a basis in the text of the Patent Act and in the record.  \nIn any event, t he text before us  is unambiguous, and we \nmay not “elevate vague invocations of statutory purpose over the words Congress chose.”  Sw. Airlines Co. v. Saxon , \n142 S. Ct. 1783, 1792- 93 (2022) .  Moreover, we are not con-\nfronted today with the question of whether inventions  \nmade  by human beings  with the assistance  of AI are eligi-\nble for patent protection.  \nThaler invokes the canon of constitutional avoidance.  \nIn Thaler’s  view, permitting AI programs to be inventors \nwould support the constitutional purpose of patents “[t]o \npromote the progress of science and the useful arts.”  U .S. \nConst. art. I, § 8, cl. 8.  It follows, Thaler continues, that not recognizing AI as an inve ntor undermine s such pro-\ngress, raising potential constitutional concerns we should \nbe careful to avoid.  Thaler is incorrect.  T he constitutional \nprovision  he cites  is a grant of legislative power to Con-\ngress ; Congress has chosen to act pursuant to that po wer \nby passing the Patent Act.  Thaler does not (and cannot) \nargue that limiting inventorship to human beings is uncon-\nstitutional.  Therefore , the canon of constitutional avoid-\nance is simply inapplicable.  See Veterans4You LLC v. \nUnited States, 985 F.3d 850, 860- 61 (Fed. Cir.  2021) (ex-\nplaining that this canon may be helpful when there is  seri-\nous question regarding  statute ’s constitutionality) ; see also Case: 21-2347      Document: 60     Page: 10     Filed: 08/05/2022THALER  v. VIDAL  11 \nWarger v. Shauers, 574 U.S. 40, 50 (2014) (noting that \ncanon of constitutional avoidance “has no ap plication in the \nabsence of . . . ambiguity” ) (internal quotation marks omit-\nted). \nThaler also notes that South Africa has granted pa-\ntents with DABUS as an inventor.  This foreign patent of-\nfice was not interpreting our  Patent Act.  Its determination \ndoes not alter our conclusion.  \nWe have considered Thaler’s additional arguments and \nfind they do not merit discussion.    \nIV \nWhen a statute unambiguously and directly answers \nthe question before us, our analysis does not st ray beyond \nthe plain text.  Here, Congres s has determined that only a \nnatural person can be an inventor, so AI  cannot be.  Accord-\ningly, the decision of the district court is affirmed.  \nAFFIRMED  \nCOSTS  \nCosts shall be assessed against Appellant.

The fly (Omilia) says it isn’t part of the web and shouldn’t have to stay there. But the spider (court) notices that the fly kept flying over the web and even sat on it sometimes, so it makes sense that the web can catch it if it’s causing trouble.

(“Nuance”) brings this action \nagainst Omilia Natural Language Solutions, Ltd. (“Omilia”) \nalleging infringement of eight patents belonging to Nuance.  The \npatents concern automated speech recognition and interactive \nvoice response systems commonly used in call centers around the \nworld. Omilia, a Cypriot corporation,  moves to dismiss the \ncomplaint for lack of personal jurisdiction.  In the alternative, \nOmilia asks the Court to transfer the case to the Northe rn Case 1:19-cv-11438-PBS   Document 46   Filed 12/16/19   Page 1 of 152 \n District of Illinois.1 Omilia also moved to dismiss for improper \nservice but since has waived that argument . Nuance opposes all \nrelief sought by Omilia.   \nAfter hearing, the Court DENIES Omilia’s motion  to dismiss  \n(Dkt. No. 14).  \nFACTUAL BACKGROUND  \nOn a motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction, a \nplaintiff “need[] only to make a prima facie showing that the \ndefendants were subject to personal jurisdiction.”  Silent Drive, \nInc. v. Strong Indus., Inc. , 326 F.3d 1194, 1201 (Fed. Cir. \n2003) (in ternal quotation marks omitted).2 The “court must accept \nthe uncontroverted allegations in the plaintiff’s complaint as \ntrue and resolve any factual conflicts in the affidavits in the \nplaintiff’s favor.”  Elecs. for Imaging, Inc. v. Coyle , 340 F.3d \n1344, 13 49 (Fed. Cir. 2003).  Accordingly, the following factual \nbackground comes from Nuance’s complaint along with  the \n \n1  Omilia concedes that it has sufficient minimum contacts \nwith the Northern District of Illinois for the exercise of \npersonal jurisdiction.  \n2  Federal Circuit law governs personal jurisdiction in this \npatent case.  See Momenta Pharm., Inc. v. Amphastar Pharms., \nInc., 841 F. Supp. 2d 514, 518 n.2 (D. Mass. 2012) (“Federal \nCircuit law governs the issue of personal jurisdiction in a \npatent infringement case.”); see also  Avocent Huntsville Corp. \nv. Aten Int’l Co ., 552 F.3d 1324 , 1328 (Fed. Cir. 2008) (noti ng \nFederal Circuit law governs personal jurisdiction analysis in \npatent case s “because the jurisdiction al issue is ‘intimately \ninvolved with the substance of the patent laws.’” (quoting Akro \nCorp. v. Luker , 45 F.3d 1541, 1543 (Fed. Cir. 1995))).  Case 1:19-cv-11438-PBS   Document 46   Filed 12/16/19   Page 2 of 153 \n affidavits and exhibits submitted by both parties . The facts are \nassumed to be true, either because they are affirmatively \nalleged by Nuance or because they are otherwise uncontradicted.  \nI. Relevant Technology and Alleged Infringement  \n Nuance is a Delaware corporation with its principal place \nof business in B urlington, Massachusetts. Nuance designs \nautomated speech recognition and transcription technology , \nincluding the Conversational Interactive Voice Response system.  \nCall centers use these systems  around the world and  in multiple \nlanguages.  Nuance owns paten ts covering its technologies and \nalleges that Omilia infringed eight of its patents. \nOmilia is based in Cyprus and entered the North American \nmarket in 2015.  Omilia released a “Conversational Virtual Agent \nsolution” for Royal Bank of Canada in 2016.  Dkt. No. 22 at 7.  \nOmilia also produces an “Omni -Channel Conversational Platform” \ncalled DiaManT , which includes “Artificial Intelligence and \nNatural Language Understanding,” “Conversation al Virtual \nAgents,” “Natural Language UI,” “an intelligent Dialog \nManagement platform,” and a “Natural Language Understanding \nengine.”  Id. Nuance and Omilia have a past business relationship \nwith each other.  Omilia licensed speech verification software \nfrom Nuance for use in its products overseas for an un specified \namount o f time. The relationship between the two companies ended \n“years ago. ” Dkt. No. 1 at 2.  Case 1:19-cv-11438-PBS   Document 46   Filed 12/16/19   Page 3 of 154 \n  On October 9, 2018, after discovering Omilia’s allegedly \ninfringing technology, Nuance sent a letter notifying  Omilia of  \nits infringement.  Omilia responded to Nuance st ating that it \nwould examine the patents and provide a response addressing \nNuance’s concerns.  Four months late r, on February 12, 2019, \nNuance received a follow -up email in which Omilia’s CEO said \nthat Omilia’s attorneys were looking into the matter, and Omi lia \nintended to respond to Nuance. On March 12, 2019, Nuance \nreceived another email from Omilia stating only that “Omilia \ndoes not infringe the Nuance patents,” and referring to “prior \nart publications that are relevant to the Nuance patent claims.”  \nId. at 8. On March 15, 2019, Nuance requested further details \nand a substantive response regarding the alleged infringement \nbut never received any response from Omilia.  On June 28, 2019, \nNuance filed a complaint for patent infringement in this Court.  \nII. Omilia’s Contacts with Massachusetts  \n From January 2015 to October 2018 -- the month in which  \nNuance notified Omilia of its alleged infringement -- Omilia \nidentified Boston as its “North America Office” on its website . \nDkt. No. 22 at 7 -8. On its website, Omilia claimed to be working \nwith financial institutions in the United States to offer the \nallegedly infringing platform to customers. The website also \nlisted a Boston address and phone number.  During that period the  \nwebsite listed Quinn Agen  (“Agen”)  as its contact for its North Case 1:19-cv-11438-PBS   Document 46   Filed 12/16/19   Page 4 of 155 \n America Office in Boston.  Omilia states that Agen “was a \nfreelance, independent contractor consultant to Omilia,” and not \nan agent.  Dkt. No. 15 at 7.  Until 2017,  however,  Omilia held \nAgen out as joining “Omilia in 2012 as employee number 6 and \nsince then has seen the company evolve from a small team in \nGreece to  large-scale global operation with a Virtual Assistant \nplatform,” and “return[ing] to the United States in 2015 to \nspearhead Omilia’s entry into the North American market.”  Dkt. \nNo. 22 at 8.  Omilia’s CEO and founder, Dimitris Vassos, \nindicated on his Linke dIn profile that he worked for “Omilia – \nConversational Intelligence” in “Boston USA.”  Id. Further, \nOmilia hired an intern who went to school at Massachusetts \nInstitute of Technology.  The intern, Theo Sechopoulos, worked \nfor Omilia in Athens from June 6, 2 017 to July 7, 2017, and \nnever worked for Omilia in Boston.   \n Omilia maintained an office at 51 Melcher Street, 1st \nFloor, Boston, Ma 02210  (“Melcher Stree t”). Melcher Street is \nthe same address that Omilia listed on its website as its “North \nAmerican Offi ce.” Id. at 7-8. Omilia did not own the building \nnor solely occupy it.  Rather, Omilia used Melcher Street , a \nWeWork facility, for receipt of mail and for access to hourly \nconference room rental s. No Omilia employees regularly worked at \nMelcher Street . Omilia made neither sales of  products , nor Case 1:19-cv-11438-PBS   Document 46   Filed 12/16/19   Page 5 of 156 \n offers to sell products from Melcher Street . Omilia’s \narrangement with WeWork terminated in November 2017.   \n Omilia sponsored and attended a conference in Boston in \n2017.3 At the American Banker Conference , Agen and \nrepresentatives from Royal Bank of Canada, an important Omilia \ncustomer in North America, gave a presentation about Royal Bank \nof Canada’s use of Omilia’s interactive voice recognition \nplatform.  Representatives from numerous financial institution s \nattended.  A reception for the attendees directly followed the \npresentation by Omilia and Royal Bank of Canada.   \nANALYSIS  \n In addition to moving to dismiss on personal jurisdiction \ngrounds, Omilia also moved to dismiss for improper service.  At \nthe hearing , Omilia waived that argument  because it conceded \nthat it had been properly served by Nuance subsequent to the \nfiling of the motion to dismiss . Accordingly, this analysis only \naddresses the issue of personal jurisdiction.  \nI. Legal Standard  \n In a patent case, “[d]etermining whether person al \njurisdiction exists over an out -of-state defendant involves two \ninquiries: whether a forum state’s long -arm statute permits \n \n3  Nuance did not raise this fact in the initial complaint  but \nin their opposition to Omilia’s motion to dismiss.  An affidavit \nsubmitted with the opposition attests to this fact, however, and \ntherefore may be considered on this motion to dismiss.   Case 1:19-cv-11438-PBS   Document 46   Filed 12/16/19   Page 6 of 157 \n service of process, and whether the assertion of personal \njurisdiction would violate due process. ” Avocent Huntsville \nCorp. v. Aten In t’l Co., 552 F.3d 1324, 1329 (Fed. Cir. 2008) \n(quoting Inamed Corp. v. Kuzmak , 249 F.3d 1356, 1359 (Fed. Cir. \n2001)). The Court first determines whether it can exercise \njurisdiction under the long -arm statute “and, if so, whether \njurisdiction can be maintained consistent with due process.”  \nAkro Corp. , 45 F.3d at 1544.  “[T]he burden of proof is on the \nplaintiff to establish ‘minimum contacts.’”  Inamed Corp. , 249 \nF.3d at 1360.   \nII. Discussion  \nA. Massachusetts’s Long -Arm Statute  \n Omilia conceded at the hearing that the Massachusetts long -\narm statute permits the Court to exercise jurisdiction over it. \nThe Massachusetts long -arm statute allows a court to exercise \npersonal jurisdiction over a defendant when a defendant \n“caus[es] [a] tortious injury by an act or omission in this \ncommonwealth .” Mass. Gen. Laws. ch. 233A, § 3(a). Here, Omilia’s \nalleged infringement of Nuance’s patents constitutes a “tortious \ninjury . . . in this commonwealth.” See Skyworks Solutions, Inc. \nv. Kinetic Techs. HK L td., No. 13 -cv-10655, 2015 WL 461920, at \n*2 (D. Mass. Feb. 4, 2015) (“An allegation of patent \ninfringement may be considered a tortious injury.” ); Hologic, \nInc. v. Lunar Corp. , No. 95 -cv-10008, 1995 WL 661238, at *7 (D. Case 1:19-cv-11438-PBS   Document 46   Filed 12/16/19   Page 7 of 158 \n Mass. Aug. 4, 1995) (concluding  that patent infringement claim \nshould be treated as tortious injury under Massachusetts long -\narm statute) . Accordingly , the Court may exercise personal \njurisdiction over Omilia if such exercise is consistent with Due \nProcess.  \nB. Due Process  \nDue process requires a defendant to “have certain minimum \ncontacts with [the forum state] such that the maintenance of the \nsuit does not offend traditional notions of fair play and \nsubstantial justice.”  Int’l Shoe Co. v. Washington , 326 U.S. \n310, 316 (1945 ) (internal quotation marks omitted).  For minimum \ncontacts to exist, a “defendant’s conduct and connection with \nthe forum State” must be “such that he should reasonably \nanticipate being haled into court there.”  World-Wide Volkswagen \nCorp. v. Woodson , 444 U.S. 286, 297 (1980).  The Court may \nexercise specific jurisdiction over a defendant “when the cause \nof action at issue ‘arises out of or relates to’” the \ndefendant’s contacts with the forum state, “even if those \ncontacts are ‘isolated and sporadic.’”  Red Wing Shoe Co. v. \nHockerson -Halberstadt, Inc. , 148 F.3d 1355, 1359 (Fed. Cir. \n1998) (citing Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz , 471 U.S. 462, 472 -\n73 (1985)).  “[S]pecific jurisdiction over a nonresident \ndefendant focuses on the relationship among the defendant, the \nforum, and the litigation.”  Walden v. Fiore , 571 U.S. 277, 284 Case 1:19-cv-11438-PBS   Document 46   Filed 12/16/19   Page 8 of 159 \n (2014) (internal quotation marks omitted).  The Federal Circuit \nutilizes a three -part analysis to determine if sufficient \ncontacts exist to exercise specific personal jurisdiction : \npurposeful availment, relatedness, and reasonableness.  See \nSynthes (U.S.A.) v. G.M. Dos Reis Jr. Ind. Com. De Equip. \nMedico, 563 F.3d 1285, 1297 (Fed. Cir. 2009).  \na. Purposeful Availment  \n The purposeful availment inquiry has two focal points: \nvoluntariness  and foreseeability.  See Avocent, 552 F.3d at 1329 \n(noting purposeful availment requirements “ensure[] that a \ndefendant will not be haled into a jurisdiction solely as a \nresult of random, fortuitous, or attenuated contacts, or  of the \nunilateral activity of another party or a third person.” \n(quoting Burger King Corp. , 471 U.S. at 475)).  To this end, the \nCourt must review the totality of the defendant’s claim -related \ncontacts with the forum.  See Elecs. for Imaging, Inc. , 340 F.3d \nat 1351. \n Voluntariness is satisfied if the defendant’s contacts with \nthe forum state are not based on “the unilateral activity of \nanother party or a third person.”  Avocent, 552 F.3d at 1329 \n(quoting Burger King Corp. , 471 U.S. at 475).  Here, Omilia’s \ncontacts with Massachusetts are voluntary.  Omilia maintained a \nMassachusetts address, listed Melcher Street  on its website as \nits North American location, and attended a conference promoting Case 1:19-cv-11438-PBS   Document 46   Filed 12/16/19   Page 9 of 1510 \n its products in Boston ; all are voluntary acts on the part of \nOmilia.  \n The foreseeability element is satisfied when the \ndefendant’s contacts with the forum state are such that it \nshould reasonably anticipate being haled into court there.  \nAvocent, 552 F.3d at 1330.  Omilia argues that its contacts with \nMassachusetts are insuff icient to demonstrate purposeful \navailment.  Specifically, Omilia argues that Melcher Street  is of \nlittle significance because it “was essentially a glorified \nmailbox for Omilia  NLS, which it never used.”  Dkt. No. 15 at 15. \nAccordingly , Omilia contends  that maintaining Melcher Street  and \nlisting it as its North American office  on its website does not \ndemonstrate purposeful availment.  Omilia does not discuss how \nits attendance at the American Banker Conference impacts the \npurposeful availment analysis.  \n Three of Omilia’s contacts with Massachusetts are important \nto the purposeful availment analysis: Melcher Street , Omilia’s \nwebsite, and Omilia’s attendance of the American Banker \nConference.  Omilia maintained Melcher Street , albeit a shared \nworkspace, for at least two years  and listed it on its website \nas its North American office . Maintaining an office, by itself, \nmay demonstrate purposeful availment.  See Reid-Ashman Mfg. , Inc. \nv. Swanson Semiconductor Serv., L.L.C. , No. 06-cv-04693, 2006 WL \n3290416, at *4 (N.D. Cal. Nov. 13, 2006) (finding defendant Case 1:19-cv-11438-PBS   Document 46   Filed 12/16/19   Page 10 of 1511 \n “purposefully directed its activities at residents of the forum \nby maintaining an office in this district”); Tomar Elecs., Inc. \nv. Whelen Techs., Inc. , 819 F. Supp. 871, 876 (D. Ariz. 1992) \n(finding that “[o]perating [an] office for ten months amounts to \nminimum contacts.”).  Moreover, Omilia listed Agen as the agent \nat Melcher Street. The fact that he was  independent contractor \ndoes not matter for the purpose of a minimum contacts analysis.   \nOmilia also attended  the 2017 American Banker Conference  in \nBoston, Massachusetts , where Agen engaged in networking . Other \ncourts have found that attending trade shows or industry \nconferences  buttresses a finding of purposeful availment . See \nElan Microelec s. Corp. v. Pixcir Microelec s. Co., No. 2:10 -cv-\n00014, 2012 WL 523695, at *6 (D. Nev. Feb. 16, 2012) (finding \npurposeful direction when employee participated in trade show in \nforum state as “part of an international sales effort to drum up \ninterest in ” infringing product); Reid-Ashman Mfg., Inc. , 2006 \nWL 3290416, at *4 (acknowledging its conclusion that personal \njurisdiction existed was “reinforced by [defendant’s] \nparticipation in [industry] conference, in San Francisco.”); see \nalso Synthes (U.S.A.) , 563 F.3 d at 1297 -98 (finding attendance \nat trade shows sufficient to find minimum contacts with United \nStates as a whole under Rule 4(k)(2)).   \nTaken together, Omilia’s pattern of contacts with \nMassachusetts demonstrate that Omilia could “reasonably Case 1:19-cv-11438-PBS   Document 46   Filed 12/16/19   Page 11 of 1512 \n anticipate[d] being haled into court [in Massachusetts].”  \nAvocent, 552 F.3d at 1330.   \nb. Relatedness  \nThe Federal Circuit’s interpretation of relatedness is more \npermissive than the “proximate cause” or “but for” analyses used \nin other circuits. Avocent, 552 F.3d at 1337. The Federal \nCircuit notes that “it is significant that the constitutional \ncatch-phrase is disjunctive in nature, indicating an added \nflexibility and signaling a relaxation of the applicable \nstandard from a pure ‘arise out of’ standard.” Id. at 1330 \n(quoting Inamed, 249 F.3d at 1362). Under this flexible \nstandard, Nuance’s claim relates to  Omilia’s contacts with \nMassachusetts . Maintaining Melcher Street and listing it  as its \nNorth American address demonstrate s Omilia’s attempt to market \nits products  -- including the allegedly infringing products  -- \nto customers in Massachusetts.  Omilia’s att endance at the 2017 \nAmerican Banker Conference  reinforces this conclusion . See Elan \nMicroele cs. Corp., No. 2:10 -cv-00014, 2012 WL 523695, at *6 \n(finding relatedness where defendant attended tradeshow with \npurpose of marketing allegedly infringing product).  Accordingly, \nNuance’s claim satisfies  the “arise out of or related to” \ninquiry.  \n  Case 1:19-cv-11438-PBS   Document 46   Filed 12/16/19   Page 12 of 1513 \n c. Reasonableness  \n To determine whether the exercise of personal jurisdiction \nis reasonable and fair, the Federal Circuit considers five \nfactors: “(1) the burden on the defendant, (2) the forum’s \ninterest in adjudicating the dispute, (3) the plaintiff’s \ninterest in obtaining conv enient and effective relief, (4) the \ninterstate judicial system’s interest in obtaining the most \nefficient resolution of controversies, and (5) the shared \ninterest of the states in furthering fundamental substantive \nsocial policies.”  Synthes (U.S.A.) , 563 F.3d at 1299 . \nOmilia concedes “that Massachusetts generally has an \ninterest in protecting its companies,” but argues that all other \nfactors weigh in its favor.  \n The “plaintiff’s interest and the state’s interest in \nadjudicating the dispute in the forum [must be] so attenuated \nthat they are clearly outweighed by the burden of subjecting the \ndefendant to litigation within the forum” for the burden on the \ndefendant to weigh in Omilia’s favor.  Xilinx, Inc. v. Papst \nLicensin g GMBH & Co. KG , 848 F.3d 1346, 1356 (Fed. Cir. 2017) \n(quoting Akro Corp ., 45 F.3d at 1549). The interests of both \nNuance and Massachusetts are clearly not attenuated  in this case  \nas Massachusetts is Nuance’s principal place of business.  \nFurther, Omilia’s argument that it is burdened simply because it \nis a foreign corporation without an office here is unconvincing, Case 1:19-cv-11438-PBS   Document 46   Filed 12/16/19   Page 13 of 1514 \n especially considering it previously maintained an office and \nattended a conference in the state.  See Breckenridge Pharm., \nInc. v. Metabolite Labs., Inc. , 444 F.3d 1356, 1367 (Fed. Cir. \n2006) (holding defendant’s “general assertion of hardship, \nwithout supporting evidence, as unpersuasive” when analyzing \nburden posed by e xercise of personal jurisdiction).   \n When analyzing the plaintiff’s interest in obtaining \n“convenient and effective relief,” the “inquir y requires the \ncourt to focus on the convenience and effectiveness of relief \nfrom the plaintiff’s  perspective.”  Id. at 1367-68 (emphasis \nadded). Nuance is bringing this claim where it is headquarter ed, \ndemonstrating that Massachusetts is a convenient and effective \nforum for Nuance.  See id. at 1368(“[I]t is clearly more \nconvenient for a Florida corporation with its base of operations \nin Florida to obtain relief in Florida.”).  Regarding efficiency, \nthis district is particularly experience d with handling patent \ncases, especially with the recent adoption of Local Rule 16.6.  \nThere is no thing in the record to suggest  the Northern District \nof Illinois  would provide a more efficient resolution of the \ncase. Finally, there  is the “shared interest of the states  in \nfurthering fundamental social policies .” But there are no forum \nspecific interests imp licated in this patent case because it is \ncontrolled by federal law and Federal Circuit precedent applies.   Case 1:19-cv-11438-PBS   Document 46   Filed 12/16/19   Page 14 of 1515 \n  Considering all of these factors together, exercise of \npersonal jurisdiction by the Court over Omilia is fair and \nreasonable.   \nORDER \nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court DENIES Omilia’s motion \nto dismiss (Dkt. No. 14).  \nSO ORDERED.  \n \n/s/ PATTI B. SARIS      \n                Patti B.

    "summary": "1. Summary:\nIn this case, Plaintiff P. Stephen Lamont accused several defendants, including Kevin J. Conner and Google Ventures, of misappropriating his trade secrets concerning his software product designs, in violation of the Defend Trade Secrets Act. However, the court dismissed Lamont's claims due to lack of personal jurisdiction over the Conner Defendants and Catherine Stephanie Straggas, and insufficiently pleaded allegations regarding Google Ventures. The case involved an allegation of unauthorized disclosure of innovative ideas related to artificial intelligence (AI) solutions, though the court found no substantiated connection between Lamont's claims and Google Ventures' activities.\n\n2. Key Legal Issue:\nThe principal legal issue was whether the Plaintiff adequately established personal jurisdiction over the defendants and sufficiently stated a claim for trade secret misappropriation under the Defend Trade Secrets Act.\n\n3. Court's Holding:\nThe court held that it lacked personal jurisdiction over Conner Defendants and Straggas, thus dismissing the claims against them with prejudice. The court also dismissed the claim against Google Ventures due to insufficiently detailed allegations but allowed Lamont the opportunity to amend this part of his complaint.\n\n4. ELI5 explanation:\nImagine someone claims their secret recipe was stolen by a chef they met at a restaurant, and they want to sue both the chef and the restaurant's owner for a lot of money. However, the court couldn't see enough connection between the actions of the chef or owner and where the lawsuit was filed. Also, the person didn't provide enough details about how the recipe was shared or stolen. So, the court decided the claims against the chef and an assistant involved should be dropped for good, but the person gets another chance to explain or prove their case against the restaurant's owner.",

Nos. 36, 50, 60  \n \nPlaintiff P.

(collectively “Conner \nDefendants”); (2) David Krane and Google Ven tures (collectively “GV Defendants”); and (3) \nCatherine Stephanie Straggas (collectively “Defendants”).    \nPlaintiff asserts Defendants misappropriat ed his trades secrets, in violation  of the Defend \nTrade Secrets Act, 18 U.S.C. § 1836, and various state law  claims , arising out of an alleged \nmeeting in Menlo Park, California in October 2016.  Dkt. No. 1  (“Compl.”) .  Presently before the \ncourt are motions to dismiss the complaint for lack of personal jurisdiction and failure to plead \nviable claims.  Dkt. Nos. 36, 50, 60.  For the reasons set forth below, Ms. Straggas’ motion to \ndismiss is GRANTED, Conner Defendants’ motion to dismiss is GRANTED, and GV \nDefendants’ motion to dismiss is GRANTED.  This court has initial subject matter jurisdiction \nunder federal qu estion and supplemental jurisdiction over the remaining state law claims.  28 \nU.S.C. §§ 1331, 1367(a).

BACKGROUND1 \nPlaintiff is Chairman and Chief Executive Officer o f iviewit  Holdings, Inc., d/b/a  Arumai \nTechnologies, Inc.  Compl.  ¶ 5.  As the alleged “only true inventor and designer” of “four \ninnovative software product designs” including “Proprietary Streaming Video Protocol, Cloud \nBased Transcoding and Streaming System for Media Companies, OTT Platform with Social \nMedia Layers for OEMs, and Multiscreen OTT Video Stack for Operators,” Plaintiff “owns all \nrights, title, and interest” of the “compromised assets.”  Id. ¶¶ 42, 53, 60.  Plaintiff currently \nresides at a self -identi fied “confidential” address in Santa Clara, California.  \nPlaintiff’s relationship with Conner Defendants began  in 2014  with an agreement  between \nthe parties for accounting services that required  the accounting firm  Conner & Associates  to \nprovide a “compilation” of information such as annual and quarterly balance sheets along with tax \nreturn preparations for Plaintiff’s Company  Arumai Technologies, Inc .  Compl.  ¶ 1, Ex. A.  The \naccounting firm is located in Newtown, Pennsylvania.  Compl.  ¶¶ 6-7.     \nUnrelated to Plaintiff and Conner Defendants’ tax -related relationship, Plaintiff and Mr. \nConner, CPA and Managing Partner of Conner & Associates , engaged in email correspondence in \nOctober of 2016  that included a request from Mr. Conner to Plaintiff t o “send Arumai’s \nSeptember 2016 Business Plan for his upcoming trip to Silicon Valley.”  Compl. ¶  12.  Mr. \nConner told Plaintiff that he would be “having dinner and cocktails at the Rosewood on Sand Hill \nRoad.”  Compl. , Ex. B.  Mr. Conner requested that Pl aintiff send him “a clean, fully updated \nbusiness plan” so that he could have it in his bag.  Id.  Plaintiff emailed  Mr. Conner his Business \nPlan with “Proprietary and Confidential” marked on each page along with a Non -Disclosure \nAgreement for signature in  prepar ation for Mr. Conner’s dinner.  Compl.  ¶ 12.  Two days later,  \nMr. Conner emailed Plaintiff —with “Google” in the subject line —stating “I had dinner with the \nhead of Google ventures – a hombre of a college roommate.  He now has you on his radar.  I am \ncharging you for 2 hours of my time  . . .”  Compl. , Ex. D.  Plaintiff responded to Mr. Conner’s \n                                                 \n1 The background is a summary of the allegations in the Complaint (Dkt. No. 1) that are relevant \nto Defendants’ motions to dismiss.

E.  In response, Mr. Conner replied  that “[t]hey will do a review of the Business Plan and the \nIP; then they will get back to me as whether they are interested.  Simple as that.”  Compl. , Ex. E.   \nPlaintiff states that o n October 7, 2016, Plaintiff emailed Mr. Conner his one page \noverview of the  September 2016 Business Plan  and that Mr. Conner then sent it to Google \nVentures.  Comp.  ¶ 16.  The overview  included “the entire patent prosecution strate gy” for his \npatents numbered  “09/587,730, 09/587,026, and 09/630/939” and was also marked “Proprietary \nand Confidential.”  Compl.  ¶ 16.  Plaintiff later emailed Mr. Conner, with “Overview” in the \nsubject line, for confirmation that the Overview was sent to  Mr. Conner’s “contact.”  Compl. , Ex. \nG.  Mr. Conner replied, “YES” to Plaintiff’s email.  Id.   \nOn November 4, 2016, Mr. Conner emailed Plaintiff in regards to the response he received \nfrom his contact.  Compl.  ¶ 17.  Plaintiff requested Mr. Conner’s Goog le Venture contact \ninformation to pursue the response on his own.  Mr. Conner declined to provide the information.  \nId. ¶ 18.  Plaintiff  learn ed shortly thereafter that “Google Inc. had made a move to artificially \nintelligent solutions in its Cloud platfor m and that Google invested $4.5M on artificial intelligence \nresearch in Montreal,” Plaintiff then “noticed Conner” of this information.  Id. ¶ 21.  Mr. Conner \ndid not reply.   Plaintiff requested from Conner Defendants “an explanation and restitution of the  \nexposition of $95 million in the unauthorized disclosure of patent and product ideas” allegedly \ngiven to Google Ventures at the meeting in California.  Dkt. No. 60 -1, Decl. Conner  ¶ 22.   \nOn November 11, 2016, Ms. Straggas, counsel for Conner Defendants,  responded to \nPlaintiff’s email notice to Mr. Conner .  Ms. Straggas informed Plaintiff  that no meeting between \nMr. Conner and Google Ventures had taken  place and that at no time did anyone from Conner & \nAssociates provide Plaintiff’s information to anyone at Google V entures.  Compl. , Ex. I.  Ms. \nStraggas is also located in P ennsylvania.  Dkt. No. 36 at 3.  Mr. Conner has since admitted he was \nuntruthful when he gave Plaintiff the impression that he had met with the “head ” of Google \nVentures while in Silicon Valley.  Dkt. No. 60 -1, Decl. Conner  ¶ 14.  Mr. Conner also stated he \nwas not actually “in the State of California on October 4, 2016” nor did he mee t with David Krane Case 5:18-cv-04327-EJD   Document 100   Filed 03/26/19   Page 3 of 15 \nCase No.: 5:18-cv-04327 -EJD \nORDER GRANTING MOTIONS TO DISMISS  \n 4 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  or any representative from Google Ventures.  Id. ¶¶ 11, 12.   \nPlaintiff  states that  he received communication in June of 2018 from Daphne Change, \nGeneral Counsel of GV, and David Kramer, an attorney, that a meeting with Mr. Krane from GV  \ndid not take place.  Compl . ¶ 25.  Mr. Krane, Chief Executive Officer of Google Ventures, \nsubmitted a signed affidavit that stated “I do not know and have never met any of the parties to \nthis action.  I did not meet with Mr. Conner, on October 4, 2016 or otherwise, and have never \ncommunicated with him.”  Dkt. No. 70 -1 at 6.   \nBased on these allegations, Plaintiff asserts claims for: (1) violation of the Defend Trade \nSecrets Act of 2016 against all Defendants predicated upon Mr. Conner’s failure to obtain a  signed \nnon-disclosure agreement when he delivered Plaintiff’s business plan to a Google Venture contact; \n(2) negligence against Conner Defendants and Ms. Straggas  under the same theory ; (3) tortious \ninterference against Conner Defendants for not forwardin g GV contac t information to Plaintiff ; \nand (4) breach of fiduciary duties against Conner Defendants by going “outside the normal role of \nan independent accountant” by disseminating Plaintiff’s proprietary and confidential information \nwithout the non -disclo sure agreement.  All Defendants subsequently filed motions to dismiss \nPlaintiff’s claims.  \nII. LEGAL STANDARDS  \nA. Motion to Dismiss  \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a) requires a plaintiff to plead each claim with sufficient \nspecificity to “give the defendant fai r notice of what the  . . . claim is and the grounds upon which \nit rests.”  Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly , 55 U.S. 544, 555 (2007) (internal quotations omitted).  \nA complaint which falls short of the Rule 8(a) standard may be dismissed if it fails to state  a claim \nupon which relief can be granted.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6).  “Dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) is \nappropriate only where the complaint lacks a cognizable legal theory or sufficient facts to support \na cognizable legal theory.”  Mendiondo v. Centinela  Hosp. Med. Ctr. , 521 F.3d 1097, 1104 (9th \nCir. 2008).  Moreover, the factual allegations “must be enough to raise a right to relief above the \nspeculative level” such that a claim “is plausible on its face.”  Twombly , 550 U.S. at 555, 570 . Case 5:18-cv-04327-EJD   Document 100   Filed 03/26/19   Page 4 of 15 \nCase No.: 5:18-cv-04327 -EJD \nORDER GRANTING MOTIONS TO DISMISS  \n 5 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  When deciding wh ether to grant a motion to dismiss, the court generally “may not consider \nany material beyond the pleadings.”  Hal Roach Studios, Inc. v. Richard Feiner & Co. , 896 F.2d \n1542, 1555 n.19 (9th Cir. 1990).  The court must accept as true all “well -pleaded factu al \nallegations.”  Ashcroft v. Iqbal , 556 U.S. 662 (2009).  The court must also construe the alleged \nfacts in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.  Love v. United States , 915 F.2d 1242, 1245 (9th \nCir. 1998).  “[M]aterial which is properly submitted as  part of the complaint may be considered.”  \nHal Roach Studios, 896 F.2d at 1555 n.19.  But “courts are not bound to accept as true a legal \nconclusion couched as a factual allegation.”  Twombly , 550 U.S. at 555.  \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(2) allows a party to file a motion to dismiss when \nthere is a lack of personal jurisdiction.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(2).  There are two limitations that \nrestrict a court’s power to exercise personal jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant: the \nconstitutional principles of due process and the applicable state personal jurisdiction rule.  Sher v. \nJohnson , 911 F.2d 1357, 1360 (9th Cir. 1990).  The Ninth Circuit has held that because \nCalifornia’s pers onal jurisdictional ru le is “co extensive with the outer limits of due process,” \npersonal jurisdictional inquiries under California law are constrained solely by constitutional \nprinciples.  Id. at 13 61; Cal. Civ. Proc. Code § 410.10.  \nThe Supreme Court has held that constitutiona l due process is met when a nonresident \ndefendant has sufficient minimum contacts with the forum state “such that maintenance of the suit \ndoes not offend ‘traditional notions  of fair play and substantial justice. ’”  Int’l Shoe Co. v. \nWashington , 326 U.S. 3 10, 316 (1945).  In applying the minimum contacts analysis, a court may \nexercise either general or specific jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant.  Doe v. Unocal Corp. , \n248 F.3d 915, 923 (9th Cir. 2001).  When the defendant’s activities in the forum st ate are \nsubstantial, continuous and systematic, a court may exercise general jurisdiction over the \ndefendant, even if the cause of action is unrelated to defendant’s contacts with the forum.  Id. at \n923.  A defendant may also be subject to specific jurisdi ction if the defendant “has sufficient \ncontacts with the forum state in relation to the cause of action.”  Sher, 911 F.2d at 1361 (citations \nomitted).  Case 5:18-cv-04327-EJD   Document 100   Filed 03/26/19   Page 5 of 15 \nCase No.: 5:18-cv-04327 -EJD \nORDER GRANTING MOTIONS TO DISMISS  \n 6 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  When faced with a personal jurisdiction challenge by the defendant, the plaintiff bears the \nburden of pro of to show that jurisdiction is appropriate.  Love v. Associated Newspapers, Ltd. , 611 \nF.3d 601, 608 (9th Cir. 2010).  When a motion to dismiss is based on written materials without an \nevidentiary hearing, a plaintiff need only make a prima facie showing o f jurisdictional facts.  Id.  \nIn this context, a prima facie showing means that the plaintiff has produced sufficient admissible \nevidence, that if believed, would establish personal jurisdiction.   China Tech. Global Corp. v. \nFuller, Tubb, Pomeroy & Stokes , No. 05 -CV-1793 -JW, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 46137, 2005 WL \n1513153, at *1 , *3 (N.D. Cal. June 27, 2005) (citations omitted).   The Ninth Circuit has also held \nthat a district court shall accept as true uncontroverted allegations in the complaint and draw all \nreasonable inferences in favor of the plaintiff.  Love , 611 F.3d at 608; Sher, 911 F.2d at 1361.   In \ndoing so however, the court need not assume the truth of mere conclusory allegations .  China \nTech. Global Corp. , 2005 U.S. Dist. LEX IS 46137, 2005 WL 15131 53, at *5  (citing Nicosia v. De \nRooy , 72 F. Supp. 2d 1093, 1097 (N.D. Cal. 1999)).  \nB. Leave to Amend  \nIf the court concludes that the complaint should be dismissed, it must then decide whether \nto grant leave to amend.  “[A] district court should grant leave to  amend even if no request to \namend the pleading was made, unless it determines that the pleading could not possibly be cured \nby the allegation of other facts.”  Lopez v. Smith , 203 F.3d at 1130  (quoting Doe v. United States , \n58 F.3d at 497 ).  Leave to amen d can be properly denied where the amendment of the complaint \nwould cause the opposing party undue prejudice, is sought in bad faith, constitutes an exercise in \nfutility, or creates undue delay.  Foman v. Davis , 371 U.S. 178, 182 (1962); Janicki Logging Co. \nv. Mateer , 42 F.3d 561, 566 (9th Cir. 1994).   \nIII. DISCUSSION  \nA. Ms. Straggas’ Motion to Dismiss i s Granted  with  Prejudice  \nMs. Straggas moves to dismiss Plaintiff’s three claims against her under Rule 12(b)(2) for \nlack of personal jurisdiction  and Rule 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim upon which relief may \nbe granted.  Dkt. No. 36 .  The complaint alleges that Ms. Straggas’  letter , on behalf of Conner Case 5:18-cv-04327-EJD   Document 100   Filed 03/26/19   Page 6 of 15 \nCase No.: 5:18-cv-04327 -EJD \nORDER GRANTING MOTIONS TO DISMISS  \n 7 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  Defendants , denying the meeting in Menlo Park ever took place,  “subjected h er[] to a claim  of \nnegligence ” and a violation of the Defend Trade Secrets Act.  Compl.  at 8-12.  Plaintiff withdrew \nhis opposition and otherwise did not respond to Ms. Straggas’ motion to dismiss.  The motion is \ngranted on a lack of response alone.   However , the court  will review  the personal jurisdiction \nargument.  \nPlaintiff initially alleged personal jurisdiction is met “because all factual allegations derive \nfrom violations of 18 U.S.C. § 1836” and the court has supplemental jurisdiction over the \nnegligence claim.  Compl.  ¶ 2.   \nMs. Straggas’ action in writing a letter as counsel, on behalf of Conner Defendants, to \nPlaintiff at his New York address, does not meet the standard of “substan tial, continuous and \nsystematic ” as required under personal jurisdiction standards .  Addition ally, Ms. Straggas is \ndomiciled and employed in Pennsylvania.  Dkt. No. 36 at  3.  Thus, no general jurisdiction exists.  \nUnder specific jurisdiction, Plaintiff relies on Ms. Straggas’  letter , informing Plaintiff  the event in \nCalifornia did not take  place.  In viewing the facts most favorable to Plaintiff, it cannot be said that \nMs. Straggas consummated any transaction or purposefully directed any of her activities toward \nthe forum.  Under these facts, Plaintiff has failed to establish personal juris diction.  \nSchwarzenegger  v. Fred Martin Motor Co. , 374 F.3d 797, 802 (9th Cir. 2004)  (“If the plaintiff \nfails to satisfy either of these prongs, personal jurisdiction is not established in the forum state.”) . \nPlaintiff initially filed a response to Ms. Straggas’ motion to dismiss (Dkt. No. 37) on \nAugust 22, 2018 ; however, Plaintiff subsequently filed a motion to withdraw Plaintiff’s response \n(Dkt. No. 71) which this court granted (Dkt. No. 72).  Thus, Plaintiff does not oppose Ms. \nStraggas’ motion to dismiss.   \nAccordingly, Plaintiff has not met his burden in satisfying either prong of the personal \njurisdiction analysis .  Plaintiff’s claims against Ms. Straggas are DISMISSED with  prejudice.  \nB. Conner Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss is Granted with Prejudice  \nConner Defendants seek dismissal of all claims  against them for lack of  personal  \njurisdiction , general and specific, and  forum non conveniens.  Dkt. No. 60.  Plaintiff responds by Case 5:18-cv-04327-EJD   Document 100   Filed 03/26/19   Page 7 of 15 \nCase No.: 5:18-cv-04327 -EJD \nORDER GRANTING MOTIONS TO DISMISS  \n 8 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  stating that  personal jurisdiction exists because the inju ry of misappropriation  took place in Menlo \nPark, California.  Dkt. No. 65 ¶  13.  The court agrees with Conner Defendants.      \n1. General Jurisdiction  \n“General jurisdiction applies where a defendant’s activities in the state are ‘substantial’ or \n‘continuous and systematic,’ e ven if the cause of action is unrelated to those  activities.”  Sher, 911 \nF.2d at 1361  (citations omitted) .  “[T]he plaintiff must demonstrate that the defendant has \nsufficient contacts to ‘constitute the kind of continuous and systematic general business contacts \nthat approximate physical presence. ’”  In re W. States Wholesale Nat. Gas Antitrust Litig. , 715 \nF.3d 716, 741 (9th Cir. 2013).  \nHere, Plaintiff’s allegations are conclusory and without factual support.  Plaintiff alleges \nthat Conner Defendants have “substantial contacts with the District” when th ey travel to Silicon \nValley and spend $1,000 per night at a hotel.  Dkt. No. 65  ¶ 13.  Plaintiff’s statements are mere \nspeculation.  Plaintiff argues Conner Defendants have seven clients in the district which amounts \nto “significant contact” given the firm  has only one licensed practitioner.  Id. ¶ 14.  Conner \nDefendants respond by stating they do have clients with California addresses, however, services \nprovided for them by the corporation is conducted in Pennsylvania.   Dkt. No. 60 -1, Decl. Conner \n¶ 9.  Co nner Defendants are also not at home in California.  Mr. Conner resides in Pennsylvania \nand Conner & Associates, P.C. is a Pennsylvania corporation.  Dkt. No. 60 -1, Decl. Conner ¶¶  2-3.  \nNeither owns any personal property in California.  Id. ¶¶ 5-6.  Mr. Conner holds no bank accounts \nor an office in California.  Id. ¶ 10.   \nGiven Plaintiff has not ple d sufficient  facts to support exercising  general jurisdicti on over \nConner Defendants, the c ourt looks next to whether specific jurisdiction exists.  \n2. Specific Jurisdiction  \nThe Supreme Court has held that a court may exercise specific personal jurisdiction over a \ndefendant when the suit “arises out of or relates to actions by the defendant himself that are \npurposefully directed toward forum residents, an d where jurisdiction would not otherwise offend \n‘fair play and substantial justice.’” Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz , 471 U.S.  462, 476 (1985) Case 5:18-cv-04327-EJD   Document 100   Filed 03/26/19   Page 8 of 15 \nCase No.: 5:18-cv-04327 -EJD \nORDER GRANTING MOTIONS TO DISMISS  \n 9 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  (citations omitted).  The Ninth Circuit has established a three -part test to determine specific \njurisdiction: (1)  the defendant must purposefully direct his activities to the forum or to a resident \nthereof, or must purposefully avail himself of the privilege of conducting activities in the forum, \ninvoking the benefits and protections of its laws; (2) the claim must a rise out of or relate to \ndefendant’s forum -related activities; and (3) the exercise of jurisdiction must be reasonable.  \nCollegeSource, Inc. v. AcademyOne, Inc. , 653 F.3d 1066, 1076 (9th Cir. 2011) (citations omitted).  \nPlaintiff  bears the burden to meet  the first two prongs,  then the burden shifts to the defendant to \nmake a compelling showing that an exercise of jurisdiction is unreasonable.  Id.; Sher, 911 F.2d at \n1361.  \nHere, Plaintiff argues he has satisfied the first two prongs because Conner & Associat es’ \nhas seven clients  that are located in California and that “[i]t would be oxymoronical for the Conner \nFederal defendants to state that they jumped on a flight, traveled 3,000 miles against the easterly \nflowing tail winds, stayed at the Rosewood Sand Hil l at a cost of $1,000 per night just to go to one \nmeeting where they tagged the GV defendants. ”  Dkt. No. 65 ¶  17.  Plaintiff’s arguments are  \nspeculati ve and lack substance .  Given Conner Defendants’ declaration that the meeting never \ntook place, Plaintiff  has not met his burden in showing that specific personal jurisdiction exists \nunder these circumstances.    \ni. Purposeful Direction  \nThe first prong refers to methods of purposeful availment and purposeful direction.  A \ncourt typically applies a “purposeful av ailment” analysis in cases of contract dispute, asking \nwhether the def endant has performed some act  in the forum state “thereby invoking the benefits \nand protections of its laws.”  Schwar zenegger , 374 F.3d at 802.  In cases of tortious conduct, a \ncourt typically applies a “purposeful direction” analysis, considering the effects of the defendant’s \nconduct.  Schwarzenegger , 374 F.3d at 802 .  Here, because Plaintiff’s causes of acti on are tortious \nin nature, the c ourt will apply a purposeful direction analysis.  \n“A showing that a defendant purposefully directed his conduct toward a forum state . . . \nusually consists of evidence of the defendant’s actions outside the forum state that are directed at Case 5:18-cv-04327-EJD   Document 100   Filed 03/26/19   Page 9 of 15 \nCase No.: 5:18-cv-04327 -EJD \nORDER GRANTING MOTIONS TO DISMISS  \n 10 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  the forum, such as t he distribution in the forum state of goods originating elsewhere.”  \nSchwarzenegger , 374 F.3d at 803.  The Ninth Circuit evaluates purposeful direction under a three -\npart test traceable to the Supreme Court’s decision in Calder v. Jones , 465 U.S. 783, 104 S. Ct. \n1482,  79 L. Ed. 2d 804 (1984).  The Calder effects test “requires that the defendant allegedly have \n(1) committed an intentional act, (2) expressly aimed at the forum state, (3) causing harm that the \ndefendant knows is likely to be suffered in the f orum state.”  Schwarzenegger , 374 F.3d at 803 .  \nAs to the first prong, “an intentional act is an external manifestation of the actor’s intent to \nperform an actual, physical act in the real world, not including any of its actual or intended \nresults.”  Washi ngton Shoe Co. v. A -Z Sporting Goods, Inc. , 704 F.3d 668, 674 (9th Cir. 2012).  \nAs to the second prong, there is express aiming when a defendant knows his action will have a \npotentially devastating impact upon a plaintiff who defendant knows lives or works  in the forum \nstate.  See id . at 675.  \nPlaintiff’s sole fact giving rise to personal jurisdiction over the Conner Defendants rests on \nthe alleged meeting in Menlo Park between Mr. Conner and a “head” of Google Ventures.  In a \nmotion to dismiss, Plaintiff’s allegations are usually taken as true.  However, for purposes of \npersonal jurisdiction, the court cannot accept as true allegations stated in a complaint that are \ncontradicted by affidavit.  See Alexander v. Circus Circus Enterprises, Inc. , 972 F.2d 261, 2 62 \n(9th Cir. 1992) (quoting Data Disc, Inc. v. Systems Technology Assoc., Inc. , 557 F.2d 1280, 1284 \n(9th Cir. 1977).  Here, Plaintiff alleges this meeting took place based on email conversations with \nMr. Conner.  Mr. Conner subsequently filed a declaration  recanting  his prior statement s to \nPlaintiff.  Mr. Conner states  that th e meeting never took place,  he was not in Califor nia on October \n4, 2016, nor did  he meet with anyone from Google.  Additionally , Mr. Krane, CEO of Google \nVentures, states in an affidav it that the meeting never occurred, nor is he familiar with any of the \nparties.  In light of Mr. Conner’s declaration and Mr. Krane’s affidavit, the court may not accept \nas true Plaintiff’s allegation that a meeting took place in Menlo Park.  In the absenc e of well -\npleaded facts establishing that a meeting took place in Menlo Park,  the court lacks jurisdiction \nover the Conner Defendants . Case 5:18-cv-04327-EJD   Document 100   Filed 03/26/19   Page 10 of 15 \nCase No.: 5:18-cv-04327 -EJD \nORDER GRANTING MOTIONS TO DISMISS  \n 11 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  ii. Claims Arising Out of, or Related to Forum Activities  \nTurning to the second requirement for specific jurisdiction, the Ninth Circuit has applied a \n“but for test.”  Unocal Corp. , 248 F.3d at 924.  More specifically, the court considers whether the \nplaintiff’s claims would have arisen but for Conner Defendants’  contacts with California.  Id. \n(citations omitted).  As mentioned, Plaintiff’s complaint is based on  the meeting in Menlo Park.  \nThe meeting is the only Plaintiff -related contact Conner Defendants allegedly have with \nCalifornia.  Plaintiff alleges his pat ent ideas were  exposed at this meeting, which caused  him $95 \nmillion in damages.  However, given the fact the  alleged  meeting cannot be taken as  true, the but \nfor test cannot be applied.  \niii. Reasonableness  \nAs to the final requirement, because th is court has fo und that Plaintiff has not met the \nNinth Circuit’s required burden in establishing specific jurisdiction, no further analysis is \nnecessary.  \n3. Forum Non Conveniens  \nConner Defendants also move this court to  dismiss Plaintiff’s claims on the grounds of \nforum no n convenie ns because the parties previously  litigated  part of  this matter in the Eastern \nDistrict of Pennsylvania .2  Pennsylvania is also  where Conner Defendants are located and where \ntheir business with Plaintiff  existed before his relocation to Californi a.  Dkt. No. 60 at 16 -17.  The \ncourt need not address Conner Defendants’ forum non conveniens argument because personal \njurisdiction does not exist.   \n  Accordingly, because this court does not have personal jurisdiction over the Conner \nDefendants’, their motion to dismiss Plaintiff’s claims is GRANTED with prejudice.  \n                                                 \n2  The court takes judicial notice of Conner Defendants’ Exhibits A through D.  Dkt. No. 60 -\n2.  It appears this actio n between Plaintiff and Conner Defendants first occurred in the Southern \nDistrict of New York in 2017.  Dkt. No. 65 at  5.  The presiding Judge transferred Plaintiff’s case \nto the Eastern District of Pennsylvania finding venue appropriate in the new Distric t.  Id.; Dkt. No. \n60 at 6.  In 2017, a court ordered Plaintiff to take a deposition in P ennsylvania.  Dkt. No. 65 at 6.  \nPlaintiff states for financial reasons he was unable to attend and withdrew the action.  Id.  Plaintiff,  \nnow residing in Santa Clara, C alifornia, brings the lawsuit to the Northern District .  Similarly, the \ncourt takes judicial notice as to GV Defendants’ request of Exhibits A through D pursuant to \nFederal Rule of Evidence 201(b).  Dkt. No. 52.   Case 5:18-cv-04327-EJD   Document 100   Filed 03/26/19   Page 11 of 15 \nCase No.: 5:18-cv-04327 -EJD \nORDER GRANTING MOTIONS TO DISMISS  \n 12 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  C. GV Defendants’ Motion to Dismis s is Granted with Leave to Amend  \nPlaintiff asserts one claim against GV Defendants of trade secret misappropriation under \nthe Defend T rade Secrets Act.  Compl.  ¶¶ 61-62.  GV Defendants move to di smiss the claim on \nthe grounds that Plaintiff fails to appropriately state a Defend Trade Secrets Act claim.  Dkt. No. \n50.  The court agrees.  \nCongress enacted the Defend Trad e Secrets Act in 2016 (the “Act ”).  See Defend T rade \nSecrets Act of 2016, Pub. L. No. 114 -153, §  2, 130 Stat. 376 (2016) (codified as amended at 18 \nU.S.C. §  1831 et seq.) .  The Act builds upon the Espionage Act of 1996 and provides exclusive \noriginal jurisdiction to the District Courts.  Id. § 1836.   The Act provides a right of civil action to \n“[a]n owner of a trade secret ” intended for use in commerce “that is misappropriated.”  Id. \n§ 1836 (b)(1).  A “trade secret” is considered “all forms and types of financial, business, scientific, \ntechnical, economic , or engineering information, including patter ns, plans, compilations, program \ndevices, formulas, designs, prototypes, methods, techniques, processes, procedures, programs, or \ncodes, whether tangible or intangible, and whether  or how stored, compiled  . . .”  Id. § 1839(3).  \nAn owner maintains her trade secret if: (1) she  takes reasonable measures in keeping it secret, and \n(2) “the information derives independent economic value, actual or potential, from not being \ngenerally known to, and not being readily ascerta inable through proper means . . .  .”  Id. \n§ 1839 (3)(A) and (B).  “Misappropriation” of a trade secret occurs when: (A) the trade secret is \nacquired “by a person who knows or has reason to know that the trade secret  was acquired by \nimproper means” or (B) “disclosure or use” occurs by a person without “express or implied \nconsent.”  Id. § 1839(5)(A) a nd (B).   \ni. Trade Secret Ownership  \n“A plaintiff need not ‘spell out the details of the trade secret, ’ Autodesk, Inc. v. Zwcad  \nSoftware Co. , 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 6361 0, at *13  (N.D. Cal. May 13, 2015).  Nevertheless, the \nplaintiff must “describe the subject matter of the trade secret with sufficient particularity to \nseparate it from matters of general knowledge in the trade or of special knowledge of those \npersons who are skilled in the trade, and to permit the defendant to ascertain at least the Case 5:18-cv-04327-EJD   Document 100   Filed 03/26/19   Page 12 of 15 \nCase No.: 5:18-cv-04327 -EJD \nORDER GRANTING MOTIONS TO DISMISS  \n 13 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  boundaries within which the secret lies.”  Pellerin v. Honeywell Int’l, Inc. , 877 F. Supp. 2d 983, \n988 (S.D. Cal. 2012) (quoting Diodes, Inc. v. Franzen , 260 Cal. A pp. 2d 244, 253 ( 2d Dist. \n1968)).  \nHere, Plaintiff’s description of his trade secrets as stated in the complaint are not plead \nwith sufficient particularity .  Plaintiff alleges he is the  “only true inventor and designer” of “four \ninnovative software produc t designs” including “Proprietary Streaming Video Protocol, Cloud \nBased Transcoding and Streaming System for Media Companies, OTT Platform with Social \nMedia Layers for OEMs, and Multiscreen OTT Video Stack for Operators,” Plaintiff “owns all \nrights, title,  and interest” of the “compromised assets.”  Compl.  ¶¶ 42, 53, 60.   Plaintiff’s \ndescription also lacks boundaries to permit GV Defendants to ascertain where the secrets might \nlie.  Plaintiff states that several of his patent ideas are to “support Plaintiff ’s design of a Streaming \nVideo Protocol to accompany U.S. Patent No. 09/587,026 that has the earliest priority date of \nvarying transfer rates of digital video considering bandwidth fluctuations detected by the \nShannon -Hartley Theorem.”  Id. ¶ 33.  Plaintif f’s minimal and broad description of his ideas fail to \nsufficiently identify his trade secret  for his claim against GV Defendants .  Cf. Autodesk, Inc. , 2015 \nU.S. Dist. LEXIS 63610 , at *13 -14 (finding sufficient description of a trade secret as “source code  \nwhich comprises AutoCAD 2007 and 2008 is a trade secret, including those portions of code that \nunderlie the commands, interfaces and program files associated with the dozens of specific \nfeatures which were wrongfully acquired and used in Defendants’ ZWCAD + 2012 and 2014 \nprograms.” ).   \nii. Misappropriation  \nTo show misappropriation, the Act  requires a showing of one of two categories: (1) \nwrongful acquisition, or (2) disclosure or use of the trade secre t without consent.  18 U.S.C. \n§ 1839( 5)(A) and (B).  GV Defe ndants argue that Plaintiff fails to show any wrongful acquisition \nand that any supposed secrecy was lost.  Dkt. No. 50. at 12.        \nTo wrongful ly acqui re a trade secret, one must obtain a trade secret while having reason to \nknow that it was obtained thr ough “improper means.”  Id. § 1839(5)(A) (“misappropriation” Case 5:18-cv-04327-EJD   Document 100   Filed 03/26/19   Page 13 of 15 \nCase No.: 5:18-cv-04327 -EJD \nORDER GRANTING MOTIONS TO DISMISS  \n 14 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  means “ acquisition of a trade secret by a person who knows or has reason to know that the trade \nsecret was acquired by improper means.”).  Such “improper means” can include lying, paying a \nbribe,  or inducing someone to breach their confidentiality agr eement.  Id. § 1839(6)(A).  \nPlaintiff has not shown that GV Defendants wrongfully acquired or disclosed any trade \nsecrets.  Plaintiff  includes in his  complaint exhibits of emails where Plaintiff consented to Mr. \nConner sharing Plaintiff’s business plan with a potential Google contact.  Mr. Conner had \nrequested Plaintiff to send him “a clean, fully updated business plan” so that he could have it in his \nbag when he went to Silicon Valley.  Compl. , Ex. B.  Plaintiff acknowledges that he sent his \nbusiness plan to Mr. Conner for the purpose of Mr. Conner sharing that plan with the Google \ncontact.   Two days later , Mr. Conner emailed Plaintiff —with “Google” in th e subject line —stating \n“I had dinner with the head of Google ventures – a hombre of a college roommate.  He now has \nyou on his radar.  I am charging you for 2 hours of my time. Pay our Invoice!”  Compl. , Ex. D.  \nPlaintiff responded  inquiring  about what Mr.  Conner meant by “has you on his radar.”  Compl. , \nEx. E.  In response, Mr. Conner stated that “[t]hey will do a review of the Business Plan and the \nIP; then they will get back to me as whether they are interested.  Simple as that.”  Id.  \nLater, Plainti ff followed up with Mr. Conner over email with his one page overview to \naccompany his b usiness plan that included his patent prosecution strategy.  Both the overview and \nbusiness plan, according to Plaintiff, were marked p roprietary and confidential .  Plaintiff \nconfir med with Mr. Conner over email —with “O verview” in the subject line —that the O verview \nwas sent to Mr. Conner’s “contact.”  Compl. , Ex. G.  Mr. Conner repl ied in the  email, “YES.”  Id.  \nPlaintiff maintains  in his complaint and emails h is consent to disclosure of trade secrets.  Thus, \neven if the meeting did take place  (which all Defendants deny ever occurred) , there are no facts to \nsupport a theory that  Conner  or GV Defendants wrongfully acquired Plaintiff’s trade secrets.   \nSimilarly, under the secon d category of misappropriation —disclosure or use of the trade \nsecret without consent —Plaintiff  asserts that as a result from the Menlo Park meeting that  \n“Google Inc. had made a move to artificially intelligent solutions in its Cloud platform and that \nGoogle invested $4.5M on artificial intel ligence research in Montreal.”  Compl.  ¶ 21.   Plaintiff’s Case 5:18-cv-04327-EJD   Document 100   Filed 03/26/19   Page 14 of 15 \nCase No.: 5:18-cv-04327 -EJD \nORDER GRANTING MOTIONS TO DISMISS  \n 15 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  complaint states that nine of his “twelve exposed patent ideas” of an “Expert System, Knowledge \nBase, Neural network Algorithms, and Genetic Algorithms” had “little use[] since its discovery at \na conference at Dartmouth College in 1956[.]”  Compl.  ¶ 19.   Plaintiff fails to connect his broad \npatent id eas to non -party Google, Inc. (or GV Defendants) moving  to artificially intelligent \nsolutions within its  own Cloud platforms.    \nMoreover, Mr. Krane, Chief Executive Officer of Google Ventures,  has stated by  affidavit \nthat he does  “not know and have never met any of the parties to this action. ”  Dkt. No. 70 -1 at 6.  \nThus, without more, Plaintiff fails to state a clai m that GV Defendants wrongfully acquired and \nused his trade secrets.   \nAccordingly,  GV Defendants’ motion to dismiss is GRANTED .  The court will allow \nPlaintiff an opportunity to amend his complaint.  Any amended complaint must be filed no later \nthan April  16, 2019.  \nIV. ORDER  \nFor the foregoing reasons, Plaintiff has failed to establish personal jurisdiction over Conner \nDefendants and Defendant Straggas and  has failed to sufficiently plead a claim for \nmisappropriation of trade secrets against GV Defendants.    \n1. Defendants’ requests for judicial notice is GRANTED.  \n2. Ms. Straggas’ Motion to Dismiss (Dkt. No. 36) is GRANTED with PREJUDICE.  \n3. Conner Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss (Dkt. No. 60) is GRANTED with  \nPREJUDICE . \n4. GV Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss (Dkt. No. 50) is GRAN TED with LEAVE TO \nAMEND.  \nPlaintiff must  file an amended complaint, if any, no later than April 16, 2019.  \nIT IS SO ORDERED.  \nDated: March 2 6, 201 9 \n______________________________________  \nEDWARD J.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: In this case, X.AI LLC sought to obtain discovery from OpenAI for use in a UK litigation against a former employee, Jimmy Fraiture, who X.AI accuses of misappropriating confidential information. The court denied X.AI's application under 28 U.S.C. § 1782 for discovery, as the factors considered weighed against providing such assistance. The case involves AI companies and centers on allegations related to the unauthorized transfer of proprietary AI code, highlighting the significant role of AI in the dispute.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the court should grant X.AI's application for discovery under 28 U.S.C. § 1782 to obtain evidence from OpenAI for use in a foreign proceeding in the UK.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court denied X.AI's application for discovery under 28 U.S.C. § 1782. The factors considered included the participation of OpenAI in the UK proceeding, the premature stage of the UK litigation, potential circumvention of UK and US discovery rules, and the unduly burdensome nature of the discovery requests.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine you're part of a club, and you feel like another club is trying to steal your secrets by poaching your members. You want to check if the other club got any of your club's secrets from people who used to be with you. You ask a judge for help to peek into what the other club is doing so that you can use that info in a separate argument you have in another country. The judge says no because you're jumping the gun—you haven't let the other argument play out yet, and you're asking for way too much to dig through. Plus, you'll soon have a chance to do this when you argue directly with the other club in your backyard, following local rules.",

The parties have consented \nto the jurisdiction of the undersigned magistrate judge pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 636(c).  For the \nreasons stated below, the Application is DENIED.  \nII. BACKGROUND  \nA. Freiture and Li  \nxAI and OpenAI are competitors in the field of artificial intelligence.  Case No. 25 -cv-\n8133 RFL, N.D. Cal., dkt. no. 1 (“8133 Compl .”) ¶ 7.   According to xAI, OpenAI has poached \nmultiple xAI employees to obtain its proprietary source code, including Jimmy Fraiture and \nXuechen Li , who  are software engineers formerly employed by xAI who left xAI to work for \nOpenAI.   Id.  ¶¶ 40 -101.   Fraiture’s employment with xAI ended on September 1, 2025 .  \nDeclaration of Bruce Applin in Support of x.AI LLC’s Application  for an Order Pursuant to 28 \nU.S.C. § 1782 to Take Discovery for Use in a Foreign Proceeding , dkt. no. 1 -2 (“Applin Decl.”) ¶ Case 3:25-mc-80299-JCS     Document 24     Filed 11/11/25     Page 1 of 13 \n2 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  3.  Fraiture began his employment with OpenAI on September 2, 2025 and now resides in London, \nEngland. 8133 Comp. ¶ 91; Declaration of Carson Swope in Support of x.AI LLC’s Application \nfor an Order Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1782 to Take Discovery for Use in a Foreign Proceeding  \n(“Swope Application Decl.”), Ex. 12 ( Claim Form filed in U.K. Proceeding on September 10, \n2025, in the High Court of Justice, King’s Bench Division ) (“U.K. Claim”).  \nxAI alleges that on July 31, 2025, while still employed by xAI  and having already \naccepted an offer of employment from OpenAI, “ Fraiture AirDropped ( i.e., copied via an Apple \nproduct feature that transfers files between Apple devices) to his personal Apple device \nsignificant, high -value parts of xAI’s highly confidential codebase, together with a video recording \nof a confidential internal meeting that had t aken place on July 30, 2025 in which Mr. Musk \ndetailed xAI’s future strategic and development plans. ”  Applin Decl. ¶ 4.    \nFraiture does not dispute that he copied these materials but according to his solicitor in the \nU.K. Proceeding, Lucy Chaize, he deleted them from his devices on August 29, 2025 , before his \nemployment with OpenAI had commenced,  in the “virtual presence” of the xAI Insider Threat \nTeam. Swope Application Decl., Ex. 14 (Sept. 9, 2025 Chaize letter to Lewis Silkin LLP) (“Sept. \n9 Letter”).   In particular, Chaize  provided the following account to xAI’s U.K. counsel in a letter \ndated September 9, 2025:  \n2. Our client resigned from his employment with your client on 1 \nAugust 2025. The same  day, your client placed our client on garden \nleave for the remainder of his notice period  (your client then sent a \nletter to our client on 5 August 2025 which stated that our client  was \nbeing placed on garden leave \"with immediate effect\"). Our client's \nnotice period  ended on 1 September 2025, being the date on which \nhis employment with your client  terminated.  \n \n3. Our client had decided to resign from your client's employment to \ntake up a role that had  been offered to him at OpenAI. As our client \nprepared to provide his notice to your  client, our client considered that \none possible reaction to him giving such notice could be  that, \nimmediately upon resigning, our client would have his work laptop \nand general  system access revoked, without having had an \nopportunity to obtain important  documents belonging to him (e.g. his \npayslips and other employment paperwork). Hav ing decided to \nprovide his resignation at an internal meeting which had been \narranged by his  line manager for 1 August 2025, on 31 July 2025 our \nclient copied a number of these  personal documents to his personal \nlaptop.  \n \n4. At the same time, our client also copied certain files belonging to Case 3:25-mc-80299-JCS     Document 24     Filed 11/11/25     Page 2 of 13 \n3 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  your client, including a  portion of the xAI monorepo (containing, \namongst other code, code that he personally  created during his tenure \nat xAI). Our client did not do this with the intention o f providing the \nxAI code to his new employer, or indeed any other third party. Rather, \nhe made a hasty and regrettable decision in the moment; he was proud \nof the code that he  worked so hard on, and he did not want to forget \nit in the future.  \n \n5. As part of the above transfer, our client inadvertently also included \na copy of the  recording of an xAI All Hands virtual meeting. This file \nhad been sent to his work device  contemporaneously by a colleague \nfor him to watch, as he did not attend the original  meeting. To be \nclear, and with reference to paragraph 5(d)(ii) of the First 8 September  \nLetter, our client did not \"take a recording of the xAI All Hands \nmeeting\", if your  suggestion is that our client made the recording \nitself. He did not.  \n \n6. Soon after our client was placed on garden leave, he remembered \nthat he had copied  these files. He realised that he had made a \nsignificant mistake in doing so and deleted  what he thought at the time \nwas the total sum of the files belonging to xAI.  \n \n7. On 28 August 2025, our client received an email from your client's \nInsider Threat security  team, requesting a meeting to discuss \"an \nAirdrop event of a 3GB file containing material  that is proprietary \nxAI company information\". Our client promptly met virtually with a  \nrepresentative of the Insider Threat team on 29 August 2025, and \nagain on 4 September  2025, as referred to in the First 8 September \nLetter. Our client realised, upon receiving  the 28 August 2025 email \nfrom the Insider Threat team, that the c ompressed version of  the xAI \nmonorepo remained on his personal device, despite him believing it \nhad been  deleted with the rest of the xAI files. He therefore deleted \nthe compressed version  without further delay.  \n \n8. During the 29 August 2025 meeting, our client confirmed that he \nhad not yet started  work at OpenAI, as his last day of employment \nwith xAI was 1 September 2025. He  realised, during this meeting, that \nhe had neglected to delete a recording of the xAI All  Hands meeting \nthat had come over at the same time as copying the xAI monorepo. \nHe had missed this document as it was located solely in his downloads \nfolder. He deleted  this document in the virtual presence of the Insider \nThreat team, and pursuant to their  instruction; the file was never \nopened by our client. This was the last of the xAI files to be  deleted \nfrom our client's personal device.  \n \n9. During the 4 September 2025 meeting, our client explained that he \nwas not forthcoming  in the 29 August 2025 meeting about the \ncircumstances in which he had copied the xAI  file to his personal \ndevice. He initially said that he attempted to copy the xAI monorepo  \nwithout success, such that the file was never transferred to his \npersonal device; this was  not correct. Rather, he attempted to copy the \nxAI monorepo initially, after which it was  successfully transferred \n(and then subsequently deleted). He provide d incorrect  information to \nthe Insider Threat team during the 29 August meeting, but his \nintention  was not to mislead or to deceive. This was an error of \njudgment on his part, which he  accepts.  Case 3:25-mc-80299-JCS     Document 24     Filed 11/11/25     Page 3 of 13 \n4 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  10. In the course of preparing this response, it has come to our client's \nattention that there  remains on his personal phone the history of a \ngroup chat on the X messaging function  used by xAI employees. Use \nof the X messaging function is, as you will be aware, not  confined to \nxAI employees, however it is used (and was used by our client) by \nxAI employees in the course of their ordinary work. Our client was \nremoved from this group  upon resigning from your client, and he \nunderstands that in due course he wil l need  assistance from your \nclient's IT team to permanently delete the history from his personal  \nphone (but for the avoidance of doubt will take no steps to do so for \nthe time being). Our  client confirms he has not opened the chat history \nsince resigning from your client, and  has not (and will not) attempt to \ndisclose any of its contents to OpenAI or any third  party.  Id. \nSwope Decl., Ex. 14.  \nB. The U.K. Litigation  \nxAI filed a claim against Fraiture in the High Court of Justice, King’s Bench Division  on \nSeptember 10, 2025.   Swope Application Decl., Ex. 12  (U.K. Claim).  The U.K. Claim alleges that \nFraiture copied xAI’s source code in violation of employment and confidentiality agreements with \nxAI that Fraiture signed on March 4, 2025.  Id.   The Claim does not include any allegations \nagainst OpenAI or name OpenAI as a defendant.  Id. \nAccording to Fraiture’s solicitor, xAI and Fraiture agreed to a Consent Order  in the U.K. \nProceeding , which was entered on September 15, 2025.  Declaration of Lucy Chaize in Support of \nRespondents’  Opposition to Application for an Order Pursuant To 28 U.S.C.  § 1782 to Take \nDiscovery for Use  in a Foreign Proceeding , dkt. no. 16 -1 (“Chaize Decl.”)  ¶ 5 & Ex. 1 (Consent \nOrder).   Chaize states that “[u]nder the Consent Order, Mr. Fraiture gave several ‘undertakings’ to \nthe Court, which are legally enforceable c ommitments with equivalent force and effect to an \ninterim injunction (including the risk of imprisonment in the event of breach). These undertakings \nincluded providing relevant devices1 and electronic accounts to an Independent IT Expert for \nforensic imaging, serving a witness statement setting forth Mr. Fraiture’s account of what \noccurred, and delivering any xAI confidential information in his possession to xAI’s counsel.” Id.  \n¶ 6.  She further states that Fraiture “has cooperated fully with his obligations under the Consent \n \n1 The Consent Order defines “relevant devices” as “any Device in the possession, custody or \ncontrol of the Defendant which has at any time contained or may contain any Confidential \nInformation or has been used to access the same.”  Chaize Decl., Ex. 1 (Cons ent Order), Section \n3.3. Case 3:25-mc-80299-JCS     Document 24     Filed 11/11/25     Page 4 of 13 \n5 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  Order [and that] xAI  has never contended that Mr. Fraiture has breached any undertaking under \nthe Consent Order. ”  Id.  ¶ 7. \nC. Cases in this District  \nOn August 28, 2025, xAI brought an action for trade secret misappropriation against \nXuechen Li in this Court.  Case No. 25 -cv-7292  RFL, N.D. Cal. (“ the 7292 case ”). On September \n2, 2025, the Court entered a Temporary Restraining Order in that case requiring that Li turn over  \nany personal electronic devices in his possession, custody and control for forensic examination “to \nidentify, remediate, and/or delete Confiden tial Information belonging to xAI”;  prohibiting Li \nfrom “having any role or responsibility at OpenAI or any other competitor of xAI pertaining to \ngenerative AI  . . .  until xAI has confirmed that all of xAI’s Confidential Information in Li’s \npossession, custody, or control has been deleted[;]” and permitting xAI to propound expedited \ndiscovery immediately in aid of preliminary injunction proceedings, including propounding a set \nof interrogatories and a set of requests for production and deposing Li. 7292 Case, dkt. no. 20.  The \nCourt modified the TRO on September 9, 2025 in response to objections  asserted by Li under the \nFifth Amendment due to an ongoing criminal investigation involving the same subject matter.  See \nid., dkt. no. 34. Briefing relating to xAI’s request for a preliminary injunction in the 7292 case is \nongoing.  \nOn September 24, 2025, xAI brought another trade secret misappropriation case in this \nCourt, naming OpenAI as a defendant .  See generally  8133 Comp.  In that case, xAI levels \nsweeping accusations against OpenAI concerning its alleged  “strategic campaign to undermine \nxAI and gain unlawful advantage in the race to build the best artificial intelligence models.”  Id.  ¶ \n2. In particular, xA I alleges that OpenAI has been “specifically targeting xAI employees and using \nthem to steal xAI Confidential Information and trade secrets.”  Id.  ¶ 8. The complaint in the 8133 \ncase includes lengthy allegations related to the alleged poaching of Fraiture and Li. Id.  ¶¶ 42-101. \nIt also alleges that OpenAI  “in just a few months, . . . poached no fewer than eight xAI employees \nas part of a deliberate scheme to gain access to specific xAI Confidential Information that OpenAI \nneeded to harm xAI and benefit itself.”  Id.  ¶ 115.  \nOn September 26, 2025, the 8133 Case was related to the 7292 Case.   On October 27, Case 3:25-mc-80299-JCS     Document 24     Filed 11/11/25     Page 5 of 13 \n6 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  2025, xAI filed an amended complaint  in the 8133 Case .  8133 Case, dkt. no. 44.  As in the \noriginal complaint, xAI alleges that OpenAI has engaged in a strategy of targeting  for hire  xAI \nemployees , including Fraiture and Li, in order to  obtain xAI’s  confidential information . See \ngenerally id.  An initial case management conference in the 8133 case is scheduled for January 14, \n2026.  \nD. The Application and Subpoena  \n On September 26, 2025, xAI initiated the instant action, filing an application under 28 \nU.S.C. § 1792 seeking discovery from OpenAI for use in the U.K. Proceeding.  On September 30, \n2025, Judge Lin declined to relate this case to the 8133 case.  The subpoena xAI seeks to serve on \nOpenAI in this case contains fourteen requests for production.  Swope Decl., Ex. 1  (“Subpoena”) .  \nBecause OpenAI challenges the breadth of the Subpoena, the Court reproduces here the specific \nrequests that are the focus of OpenAI’s challenge : \nREQUEST FOR PRODUCTION NO.4:  \nAll DOCUMENTS and COMMUNICATIONS related to Your \ninternal review and decisionmaking process about whether to hire \nFraiture, including without limitation internal memoranda, \nrecruitment notes, Fraiture’s job application, notes or correspondence \nregarding a review of Fraiture’s background and/or concerns, risks, \nor questions related to hiring Fraiture.  \n \nREQUEST FOR PRODUCTION NO.5:  \nAll DOCUMENTS and COMMUNICATIONS related to Your \nonboarding, orientation, and/or intended or actual training of Fraiture.  \n \n. . . \n \nREQUEST FOR PRODUCTION NO.7:  \nAll DOCUMENTS and COMMUNICATIONS related to Fraiture \nsoliciting, inducing, or encouraging any xAI employee, consultant, or \nindependent contractor to terminate his or her relationship with xAI \nor to consider joining OpenAI.  \n \n. . . \n \nREQUEST FOR PRODUCTION NO.12:  \nAll DOCUMENTS and COMMUNICATIONS related to xAI \nConfidential Information.  \nId.  xAI argues that it satisfies the statutory requirements for obtaining discovery under 28 U.S.C. \n§ 1728 and that the discretionary factors set forth in Intel Corp. v. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc ., \n542 U.S. 241 (2004)  also support its Application.   Case 3:25-mc-80299-JCS     Document 24     Filed 11/11/25     Page 6 of 13 \n7 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California   In its Opposition, OpenAI does not dispute that the statutory requirements  for discovery \nunder Section 1782  are satisfied but argues the Intel factors  support denying xAI’s application.  \nAmong other things, it points to the early stage of the U.K. Proceedings and the fact that Fraiture \nhas been cooperating in the U.K. discovery.  It also contends xAI’s broad requests for production \nindicate it is engagi ng in a “fishing expedition” and attempting to gain an i mproper advantage in \nthe 8133 case, in which disc overy has not yet opened.  \n In its Reply, xAI rejects OpenAI’s assertion that it will be able to obtain the evidence it \nneeds in the U.K. Proceeding through discovery in that case.  According to xAI, “ Fraiture \nadmitted to repeatedly deleting evidence of his theft of xAI trade secrets and being dishonest with \nxAI during its investigation. And Fraiture’s personal laptop and phone and his OpenAI -issued \nlaptop and phone were seized by the FBI —a fact conspic uously omitted from OpenAI’s \ndeclaration from Fraiture’s UK lawyer. ”  Reply at 1 ;  see also Declaration of Michael  \nAnderson In Support Of X.A I LLC’s Reply on Support of it Application for an Order  \nPursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1782 to Tak e Discovery for Use in A Foreign  Proceeding  (“Anderson \nDecl.”), ¶ 4 (stating that “ Fraiture’s personal devices were seized by the FBI on 12 September \n202S, shortly after he claims to have begun his employment with OpenAI (2 September 2025).  \nAccordingly, those devices are unavailable for forensic analysis in the UK.”).    \nxAI further asserts in its Reply that “ Fraiture’s destruction of evidence . . . creates an \nurgency here: records relating to deleted files may be preserved only for a short time, justifying \ndiscovery from OpenAI now, even though the UK Litigation is at an early stage. ”  Id.  xAI rejects \nOpenAI’s assertion that the Application is an attempt to get ahead of discovery in the 8133 case, \nciting the fact that Judge Lin declined to relate this case to the 8133 case  as evidence that she does \nnot seek to exercise an y oversight over the discovery xAI seeks in its Application .  Id.  at 14.  \nIII. ANALYSIS  \nE. Legal Standards  \nSection 1782 provides, in relevant part:  \n \nThe district court of the district in which a person resides or is found \nmay order him to give his testimony or statement or to produce a \ndocument or other thing for use in a proceeding in a foreign or Case 3:25-mc-80299-JCS     Document 24     Filed 11/11/25     Page 7 of 13 \n8 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  international tribunal  . . . . The order may be made .  . . upon the \napplication of any interested person  . . . . \n28 U.S.C. § 1782(a).  Section 1782 permits district courts to authorize discovery where the \nfollowing requirements are met: “(1) the person from whom the discovery is sought ‘resides or is \nfound’ in the district of the district court where the application is made; (2) the disco very is ‘for \nuse in a proceeding in a foreign or international tribunal’; and (3) the application is made by a \nforeign or international tribunal or ‘any interested person.’”   Khrapunov v. Prosyankin , 931 F.3d \n922, 925 (9th Cir. 2019) (citations omitted).  OpenAI does not dispute that these requirements are \nmet. \nEven if the basic requirements of § 1782 are satisfied, however, a district court has wide \ndiscretion in deciding whether to permit discovery under § 1782.   Intel Corp. v. Advanced Micro \nDevices, Inc ., 542 U.S. 241, 260 -61 (2004) .  In exercising its discretion, a district court should \nconsider the following factors: (1)  whether the “person from whom discovery is sought is a \nparticipant in the foreign proceeding,” (2) “the nature of the foreign tribunal, the character of the \nproceedings underway abroad, and the receptivity of the foreign government or the court or \nagency abroad to U.S. federal court judicial assistance,” (3) whether the request “conceals an \nattempt to circumvent foreign proof -gathering restrictions or other policies of a foreign country or \nthe United States,” and (4) whether the request is “unduly intrusive or burdensome.”   Id. at 264 –\n65. \n“A district court’s discretion is to be exercised in view of the twin aims of § 1782: \nproviding efficient assistance to participants in international litigation and encouraging foreign \ncountries by example to provide similar assistance to our courts.”   In re Nat’l Ct. Admin. of the \nRepublic of Korea , No. C15 -80069 MISC LB, 2015 WL 1064790, at *2 (N.D. Cal. Mar. 11, 2015) \n(citing Schmitz v. Bernstein Libehard & Lifshitz, LLP , 376 F.3d 79, 85 (2d Cir. 2004)).   The party \nseeking discovery need not establish th at the information sought would be discoverable under the \nforeign court’s law or that the U nited States  would permit the discovery in an analogous domestic \nproceeding.  See Intel , 542 U.S. at 247, 261 –63. \n  Case 3:25-mc-80299-JCS     Document 24     Filed 11/11/25     Page 8 of 13 \n9 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  F. Discretionary Factors  \n1. Whether OpenAI is a Participant in the U.K. Proceeding  \nThe first Intel factor is whether “the person from whom discovery is sought is a participant \nin the foreign proceeding.” 542 U.S. at 264.  “Courts have held that ‘[a]lthough the case law at \ntimes refers to whether the “person ” is within the foreign tribunal ’s jurisdictional reach, the key \nissue is whether the material is obtainable through the foreign proceeding. ’ ” MetaLab Design Ltd. \nv. Zozi Int'l, Inc ., No. 17 -MC-80153 -MEJ, 2018 WL 368766, at *3 (N.D. Cal. Jan. 11, 2018)  \n(citing cases).   \n“ ‘Although § 1782 does not have an ‘exhaustion’ requirement, the Court is permitted, in \ndeciding how to exercise its discretion, to consider whether the applicant has availed itself of \ndiscovery procedures in the foreign forum. ’ ” In re Quadre Invs., L.P ., No. 24 -MC-1341 -MMP, \n2025 WL 502054, at * 9 (S.D. Cal. Feb. 14, 2025)  (quoting In re Ex Parte LG Elecs. Deutschland \nGmbH , No. 12 -cv-1197 -LAB -MDD, 2012 WL 1836283, at *2 (S.D. Cal. May 21, 2012) (internal \ncitation omitted)).   Thus, for example, in In re Qua dre Investments, L.P. , the court found that this \nfactor favored denial of the applicant’s Section 1782 application because the applicant had not yet \navailed itself of the discovery procedures available in the foreign proceeding when it filed the \napplication ;  therefore the applicant  was not in a position to know what could or could not be \nobtained in the foreign proceeding.  Id. at *10 (“W ithout availing themselves of the discovery \nprocedures expressly contemplated by the Cayman Court, this Court cannot con clude the \ndiscovery sought under § 1782 is ‘unobtainable absent § 1782 aid. ’”) (quoting Intel, 542 U.S. at \n264).  \nHere, it is too soon to tell whether the discovery  xAI seeks for use in the U.K Proceeding is \n“unobtainable absent § 1782(a) aid .” Intel, 542 U.S. at 264.  First, the U.K Proceeding was \ninitiated only sixteen days before xA I filed the Application , and the Consent Order establishing a \nprocedure for obtaining discovery from Fraiture was entered only eleven days before the \nApplication was filed.  It is too soon for xAI to know what  information it will be able to obtain \nfrom Fraiture directly, which also makes it impossible to narrowly tailor its subpoena to seek \ndiscovery only  of the information xAI will be unable to obtain in the U.K. Proceeding.  Further, Case 3:25-mc-80299-JCS     Document 24     Filed 11/11/25     Page 9 of 13 \n10 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  while xAI cites concerns related to Fraiture’s “destruction of evidence”, there is no evidence in the \nrecord that establishes the Fraiture has destroyed any evidence that he had an obligation to \npreserve.  There is evidence in the record that Fraiture destroyed xAI source code that was in his \npossession, but he appears to have done so  in order to comply with his obligations to xAI under \nhis employment and confidentiality agreements.  Indeed,  xAI’s  Insider Threat Team appears to \nhave supervised the deletions on August 29, 2025.  \nFurthermore, the Court is not persuaded by xAI’s assertion that “records relating to deleted \nfiles may be preserved only for a short time, justifying discovery from OpenAI now .” Reply at 1.  \nThe Subpoena seeks discovery from OpenAI rather than Fraiture.  As OpenAI is a defendant in the \n8133 case, which encompasses all of the allegations in the U.K. Proceeding, it has an obligation to \npreserve any evidence that is relevant to th ose claims. See Elko, Inc. v. Peters , No. 3 -22-CV 00015  \nMMD  CLB, 2022 WL 256975, at *7 (D. Nev. Jan. 27, 2022)  (“Defendants have an inherent \nobligation to preserve evidence, particularly when they have been notified of the litigation, and \n[Plaintiff]  failed to show that Defendants have breached this duty ”).  xAI has not offered any \nevidence suggesting  that OpenAI will not abide by its obligation to preserve relevant evidence or \nthat any concerns xAI may have on that score cannot be alleviated by entering into a protocol in \nthe 8133 case that addresses the preservation of digital informa tion. \nFinally, because of the overlap between xAI’s claim against Fraiture in the U.K. \nProceeding and the more broad -ranging claims asserted  against OpenAI  in the 8133 case , it is \nlikely that at least some of the discovery that xAI seeks in this proceeding can be obtained once \ndiscovery in that case opens, which is likely to occur in a matter of a few months.  Regardless of \nwhether or not this case has been formally related to the 8133 Case, the possibility that xAI may \nsoon be able to obtain at least some of the  discovery it seeks in that proceeding may be considered \nby this Court in addressing the first Intel factor.  See Intel , 542 U.S. at 266 n.19 (observing that  in \ndetermining whether 1782 assistance should be afforded, the court “ might also consider ” whether \npermitting such discovery would frustrate a protective order entered by another district court \nrelated to the same material).  \nThe Court therefore concludes that this factor supports denial of the Application.  Case 3:25-mc-80299-JCS     Document 24     Filed 11/11/25     Page 10 of 13 \n11 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  2. Whether U.K. Tribunal is Receptive to Discovery xAI Seeks  \nIntel’s second discretionary factor “focuses on whether the foreign tribunal is willing to \nconsider the information sought.”  In re Varian Med. Sys. , 2016 WL 1161568, at *4.  Where there \nis no evidence suggesting that foreign courts would be unreceptive to the requested discovery, the \nsecond discretionary factor weighs in favor of the application.  See In re Med. Corp. H&S , No. 19 -\nmc-80107 -SVK, 2019 WL 2299953, at *3 (N.D. Cal. May 30, 2019) ( holding that the second \nfactor weighs in favor of an application w hen there is an absence of evidence that a foreign \ntribunal is unreceptive to this type of discovery or the information sought).  Here, OpenAI has not \npointed to any evidence that the U.K. tribunal will not be receptive to  the discovery  xAI seeks .  \nAccordingly, this factor points in favor of granting the application.  \n3. Whether Application Seeks to Circumvent Discovery Rules  \nThe third factor in Intel considers  whether the application “conceals an attempt to \ncircumvent foreign proof -gathering restrictions or other policies of a foreign country or the United \nStates.”  Intel, 542 U.S. at 265.  Where there is a “perception that an applicant has side -stepped \nless-than-favorable discovery rules by resorting immediately to § 1782” this factor may weigh \nagainst the application.  In re Cathode Ray Tube (CRT) Antitrust Litig. , No. C07 -5944 -SC, 2013 \nWL 183944, at *3 (N.D. Cal. Jan. 17, 20 13).  But absence of evidence of attempted circumvention \nweighs in favor of an application.  See, e.g., In re Google, Inc. , No. 14 -mc-80333 -DMR, 2014 WL \n7146994, at * 2 (N.D. Cal. Dec. 15, 2014);  In re Eurasian Nat . Res. Corp. Ltd ., No. 18 -mc-80041 -\nLB, 2018 WL 1557167, at *3 (N.D. Cal. Mar. 30, 2018) ; In re Honda , No. 21 -mc-80167 -VKD, \n2021 WL 3173210, at *4 (N.D. Cal. July 27, 2021) .   \nHere, xAI appears to be seeking to “side -step” discovery rules in both the U.K. Proceeding \nand the 8133 case.  In particular, xAI does not dispute that under U.K. law, requests for “ relevant \ndocuments from third parties ‘must be supported by evidence, ’ U.K. CPR § 31.17(2) [;]” that “ the \ndisclosure must be not merely relevant but ‘necessary in order to dispose fairly of the claim or to \nsave costs, ’ id. § 31.17(3) [;] and [that] any disclosure order must ‘specify the documents or the \nclasses of documents which the respondent must disclose, ’ id. § 31.17(4). ”  Opposition at 10.  Nor \ndoes it dispute that “[a] s a procedural matter, such applications are generally made at a later stage Case 3:25-mc-80299-JCS     Document 24     Filed 11/11/25     Page 11 of 13 \n12 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  of U.K. litigation, once the pleading stage is  complete. ”  Id.  at 10 -11 (citing  Chaize Decl. ¶ 16 ).  \nGiven the broad nature of the discovery requested in the Subpoena and the narrow allegations \nagainst Fraiture in the U.K. Proceeding, it appear xAI is us ing Section 1782 to obtain discovery as \nto which it might have difficulty meeting the burdens imposed under U.K. discovery rules.  \nFurthermore, the timing of the Application suggests that xAI is seeking to make an end run around \nrules in both the U.K. and i n this Court that render xAI’s discovery request s premature . \n4. Whether Discovery Imposes Undue Burden  \nIntel’s fourth and final  factor considers whether the requested discovery is “unduly \nintrusive or burdensome.”  Intel, 542 U.S. at 265.   Requests are unduly burdensome when they are \n“not narrowly tailored, request confidential information and appear to be a broad ‘fishing \nexpedition’ for irrelevant information.”  In re Qualcomm Inc. , 162 F. Supp. 3d 1029, 1043 (N.D. \nCal. 2016).   The “proper scope” of requests under section 1782 is “generally determined by the \nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure.”  In re Varian Med. Sy s., 2016 WL 1161568, at *5.  Parties \n“may obtain discovery that is relevant to any parties claim or defense,” Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(1), \nbut “unduly intrusive or burdensome requests may be rejected or trimmed .”  Intel, 542 U.S. at 246.   \n This factor strongly favors OpenAI’s position.  The discovery requests in the Subpoena are \nextremely broad , as discussed above,  and appear to be a “fishing expedition ” aimed at gaining an \nunfair advantage in  both the U.K. Proceeding and the 8133 Case (and possibly in other pending or \nfuture litigation xAI is contemplating bringing against OpenAI and/or former xAI employees) .  \nThey are likely to require production of OpenAI’s confidential information, some of which will be \nhighly sensitive. This will requir e the Court to adopt protocols for production that will almost \ncertainly duplicate (or possibly impede) the efforts of the Court in the 8133 Case in supervising \ndiscovery in that case.  Furthermore, the broad discovery requests in the Subpoena are likely to \nduplicate discovery in the 8133 case.  Such duplication of discovery imposes an undue burden on \nOpenAI and the Court.   \n In sum, the Court finds that on balance, the Intel factors favor denial of the Application.  \n  Case 3:25-mc-80299-JCS     Document 24     Filed 11/11/25     Page 12 of 13 \n13 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  IV.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: Loop AI Labs Inc., a startup focusing on artificial intelligence technology, brought a claim against multiple defendants for the misappropriation of trade secrets under California’s Uniform Trade Secrets Act. The court had earlier ordered Loop AI to disclose its trade secrets with reasonable particularity under California Civil Procedure Code section 2019.210, but Loop AI's submission was deemed insufficient. The court found that Loop AI's trade secret disclosures were too vague, often using broad categories rather than specific descriptions, thus granting the defendants’ motion to enforce the previous order for a more detailed disclosure.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether Loop AI Labs sufficiently complied with the court's order to disclose its trade secrets with reasonable particularity pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure section 2019.210.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court held that Loop AI's trade secret disclosure was insufficient and failed to comply with the court's prior order. Loop AI's vague and non-specific listing of trade secrets did not meet the \"reasonable particularity\" standard required to pursue a trade secret misappropriation claim. The consideration of sanctions for this failure was deferred to the trial judge.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine you have a secret recipe for a smoothie, and someone stole it. To sue them, the court wants you to list out what's special about your recipe without just saying \"it's a blend of secret fruits and veggies.\" Loop AI Labs said their secret was basically \"we use AI for stuff,\" which was too general, like saying your recipe involves \"healthy ingredients\" without naming any. So the court said, \"That's not specific enough for us to determine if it’s really a secret.\" They need to give more detail so the other side knows what they're accused of stealing.",

No. 459  \n \nDefendant IQSystem, Inc.  (“IQS”) filed a motion to enforce the court’s December 21, 2015 \norder directing Plaintiff Loop AI Labs Inc. to submit a particularized trade secret disclosure .  \nDefendant Almawave USA, Inc. (“Almawave”) joins  in IQS’s motion .  [Docket Nos. 459  (Mot.) , \n472.]  Plaintiff timely filed an opposition.  [Docket No. 541  (Opp’n).]  This matter is appropriate \nfor resolution without a hearing.  Civ. L.R. 7 -1(b).  For the following reasons, IQS’s motion is \ngranted.  \nI. BACKGROUND  \nPlaintiff is a startup that develops artificial intelligence technology.  In this action, Plaintiff \npursues a number of claims for relief, including a  claim for misappropr iation of trade secrets \nagainst all Defendants  based upon their alleged violation of California Civil Code section 3426, \nCalifornia’s Uniform Trade Secrets Act (“CUTSA”).   In October 2015, IQS moved to compel \nPlaintiff to comply with California Code of Civil Procedure section 2019.210 by identifying its \nalleged trade secrets with particula rity.  IQS also  asked the court to stay all discovery until \nPlaintiff provided a proper trade secret disclosure.  [Docket No. 232.]  Section 2019.210 provides \nthat in any action alleging misappropriation of trade secrets under CUTSA, “before commencing \ndiscovery relating to the trade secret, the party alleging the misappropriation shall identify the \ntrade secret with reasonable particularity subject to any orders that may be appropriate under Case 4:15-cv-00798-HSG   Document 795   Filed 07/06/16   Page 1 of 13 \n2 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  Section 3426.5 of the Civil Code.”1  Cal. Civ. Proc. Code § 2019. 210.  Plaintiff opposed the \nmotion on the ground that section 2019.210 is a state procedural rule that does not apply in  federal \ncourt.  Alternatively, Plaintiff argued that if section 2019.210 applies, then Plaintiff had already \ncomplied with the statute by providing a detailed explanation of the trade secrets at issue in its \npleadings and  other submissions.  In support of this assertion, instead of submit ting a trade secret \ndisclosure document, Plaintiff  identified descriptions of trade secrets contained  in specific \nparagraphs in its amended complaint, second amended complaint, and three declarations filed in \nsupport of two April 2015 motions.  \nOn December 21, 2015, the court granted in part and denied in part IQS’s motion  (Docket \nNo. 331) .  Loop AI Labs I nc. v. Gatti , No. 15 -cv-00798 HSG (DMR), 2015 WL 9269758 (N.D. \nCal. Dec. 21, 2015).  The court first concluded that section 2019 .210 applies to CUTSA claims \nbrought in federal court.  Id. at *3.  It then analyzed the sufficiency of Plaintiff’s purported tr ade \nsecret disclosure .  Id. at *3 -4.  The court concluded that “Plaintiff’s ersatz ‘trade secret disclosure’ \n[was] insufficient to meet the requirements of section 2019.210,” and that its designation of certain \nparagraphs  in previous court filings  “[was] n o substitute for specifically identifying and describing \nthe actual claimed trade secrets in order ‘to permit [Defendants] to ascertain at least the boundaries \nwithin which the secret[s] lie[].’”  Id. at *4 (quoting Brescia v. Angelin , 172 Cal. App. 4th 133, \n147 (2009)).   The court ordered Plaintiff to file and serve a statement identifying the specific trade \nsecrets at issue by a date certain .  The court  warned Plaintiff that its trade secret  disclosure “must \nbe thorough and co mplete ,” and that “[a]ny fu ture amendment to the disclosure [ would]  only be \npermitted upon a showing of good cause.”  Id. (citing Neothermia Corp. v. Rubicor Med., Inc ., \n345 F. Supp. 2d 1042, 1045 (N.D. Cal. 2004) ).  The court also denied IQS’s motion to stay all \ndiscovery , but did stay discovery as to Plaintiff’s CUTSA claim until such time that Plaintiff filed \na statement “identifying with reasonable particularity the trade secrets at issue in this lawsuit.”  Id.   \nPlaintiff timely filed its trade secret disclosure on the public do cket.  [Docket No. 372  \n(Disclosure) .]  IQS challenges the sufficiency of Plaintiff’s disclosure.  It moves  to enforce the \n                                                 \n1 California Civil Code section 3426.5 allows a cou rt to enter appropriate orders to ensure the \nconfidentiality of a plaintiff’s trade secrets identified in accordance with section 2019.210.  Case 4:15-cv-00798-HSG   Document 795   Filed 07/06/16   Page 2 of 13 \n3 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  court’s December 21, 2015 order t hat Plaintiff  provide a thorough and complete identification of \nthe trade secrets that are the basis  of its CUTSA claim.  It also asks the court to sanction Plaintiff \nby precluding Plaintiff’s introduction of evidence as to its CUTSA claim and/or dismiss ing \nPlaintiff’s suit for failing to specify the trade secrets at issue.    \nII. DISCUSSION  \nA. Legal Standards  \nCalifornia Civil Code section 3426.1 defines a trade secret as follows:  \n \n“Trade secret” means information, including a formula, pattern, \ncompilation, program, device, method, technique, or process, that:  \n \n(1) Derives independent economic value, actual or potential, from \nnot being generally known to the public or to other persons who can \nobtain economic value from its disclosure or use; and  \n \n(2) Is the subject of efforts that are reasonable under the \ncircumstanc es to maintain its secrecy.  \nCal. Civ. Code § 3426.1(d).  “The sine qua non  of a trade secret, then, is the plaintiff’s possession \nof information of a type that can, at the possessor’s option, be made known to others, or withheld \nfrom them, i.e., kept secre t.”  Silvaco Data Sys. v. Intel Corp ., 184 Cal. App. 4th 210, 220 (2010), \ndisapproved on other grounds by Kwikset Corp. v. Superior Court , 51 Cal. 4th 210 (2011).  As \nexplained by the court in Silvaco Data Systems , trade secret law protects the right to ma intain the \nconfidentiality of facts, not ideas:  \n \nA patent protects an idea, i.e., an invention, against appropriation by others.  Trade \nsecret law does not protect ideas as such.  Indeed,  a trade secret may consist of \nsomething we would not ordinarily cons ider an idea (a conceptual datum) at all, but \nmore a fact (an empirical datum), such as a customer’s preferences, or the location \nof a mineral deposit.  In either case, the trade secret is not the idea or fact itself, but \ninformation  tending to communicate  (disclose) the idea or fact to another.  Trade \nsecret law, in short, protects only the right to control the dissemination of \ninformation . \n \nIt is critical to any CUTSA cause of ac tion—and any defense —that the information \nclaimed to have been misappropriate d be clearly identified.  \n \nId. at 220 -21 (emphas es in original).  \nUnder section 2019.210, a plaintiff is required “to identify or designate the trade secrets at Case 4:15-cv-00798-HSG   Document 795   Filed 07/06/16   Page 3 of 13 \n4 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  issue with ‘sufficient particularity’ to limit the permissible scope of discovery by distinguishi ng \nthe trade secrets ‘from matters of general knowledge in the trade or of special knowledge of those \npersons . . . skilled in the trade. ’”  Advanced Modular Sputtering, Inc. v. Superior Court , 132 Cal. \nApp. 4th 826, 835 (2005) (quoting Imax  Corp. v. Cinem a Techs., Inc ., 152 F.3d 1161, 1164 -65 \n(9th Cir. 1998) (citation omitted)).  Review of the case  law cited in the moving papers, as well as \nthe court’s own research, makes clear that there is no bright -line rule governing  the level of \nparticularity require d by section 2019.210.  See Advanced Modular , 132 Cal. App. 4th at 835 \n(noting the lack of clear authority defining “reasonable particularity ,” and observing that “the law \nis purposely vague in some areas so that there is ‘play in the joints.’” (quoting Locke v. Davey , 540 \nU.S. 712, 718 (2004)).  However, courts generally agree that in order to satisfy section 2019.210 , a \nparty alleging misappropriation need not “define every minute detail of its claimed trade secret at \nthe outset of the litigation,” but nevertheless “must make some showing that is reasonable, i.e., \nfair, proper, just and rational.”  Advanced Modular , 132 Cal. App. 4th at 835-36; see, e.g. , Lilith \nGames (Shanghai) Co. v. uCool, Inc. , No. 15 -CV-01267 -SC, 2015 WL 4149066, at * 3-4 (N.D. \nCal. July 9, 2015)  (discussing Advanced Modular ).  “What is required is not absolute precision, \nbut ‘reasonable particularity[,]’ ” the degree of which “will differ, depending on the alleged trade \nsecrets at issue in each case.”  Advanced Modular , 132 Cal. App. 4th at 836.  For example, as \nnoted in Advanced Modular , where  alleged trade secrets “consist of incremental variations on, or \nadvances in the state of the art in a highly specialized technical field , a more exacting level of \nparticularity may be required to distinguish the alleged trade secrets from matters already known \nto persons skilled in that field.”  Id. at 836 ; see also Perlan  Therapeutics, Inc. v. Superior Court , \n178 Cal. App. 4th 1333, 1350 (2 009) ( applying “more exacting level of particularity” standard in \ntrade secrets case involving protein -based therapeutics).  \n“‘[R]easonable particularity’ should . . . be understood in light of the purpose of section \n2019.210,” which is as follows:  \n \nFirst,  [section 2019.210] promotes well -investigated claims and \ndissuades the filing of meritless trade secret complaints. Second, it \nprevents plaintiffs from using the discovery process as a means to \nobtain the defendant’ s trade secrets. Third, the rule assists  the court \nin framing the appropriate scope of discovery and i n determining Case 4:15-cv-00798-HSG   Document 795   Filed 07/06/16   Page 4 of 13 \n5 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  whether plaintiff’ s discovery requests fall within that scope. Fourth, \nit enables defendants to form complete and well -reasoned defenses, \nensuring that they need not wait until the  eve of trial to effectively \ndefend against charges of trade secret misappropriation.  \nLilith Games , 2015 WL 4149066, at *4  (quoting Advanced Modular , 132 Cal. App. 4th at 833 -34 \n(quoting Comput . Econ s., Inc. v. Gartner Grp. Inc ., 50 F. Supp. 2d 980, 98 5 (S.D. Cal. 1999))).  \nB. Plaintiff’s Trade Secret Disclosure is Insufficient  \nPlaintiff’s trade secret disclosure  consists of a publicly -filed document listing 55 \nparagraphs of purported trade secrets .  It falls far short of the “reasonable particularity” standard.   \nIn large part, i t reads like  an inventory  of categor ies of Plaintiff’ s scientific or strategic business \ninformation .  Rather than separately discuss e ach of the 55 paragraphs, the court will describe  the \nbasic problems with Plaintiff’s disclosure, illustrate  each problem with example s, and list  other \nparagraphs with similar  deficien cies. \nAs a preliminary matter, the fact that Plaintiff publicly filed its trade secret disclosure \nbelies the proposition that it contains information specific enough to be considered “confidential” \ntrade secrets.  Section 2019.210 does not expressly require a plaintiff alle ging a CUTSA  claim  to \nfile the trade secret  disclosure  under seal.  However, the statute contemplates the need for such a \nprocedure by providing that “a party alleging . . . misappropriation shall identify the trade secret \nwith reasonable par ticularity subject to any orders that may be appropriate under Section 3426.5 of \nthe Civil Code.”  Cal. Civ. Proc. Code § 2019.210.  California Civil Code section 3426.5 in turn \nrequires  a court to “preserve the secrecy of an alleged trade secret by reasonable m eans,” including \ngranting protective orders , holding in camera hearings, and sealing records.  Cal. Civ. Code § \n3426.5.  In cases in which courts have addressed the sufficiency of a plaintiff’s identification of \nalleged trade secrets, the parties have filed the disclosures under se al, and courts discuss the \nsecrets in either “purposefully vague” terms or redact portions of the opinions.  See, e.g., \nAdvanced Modular , 132 Cal. App. 4th at 831 n.2 (“[t]o avoid disclosure of the parties’ \nconfidential information we are, in this publicly  available opinion, purposefully vague in our \ndescriptions of the claimed trade secrets . . .”); Perlan , 178 Cal. App. 4th at 1338 n.3 (noting that \nthe court would “exercise caution in [its] recitation of facts” because the trade secret statement at \nissue was designated confidential and sealed at trial and on appeal); Jobscience, Inc. v.

June 14, 2012) (finding trade \nsecret disclosure insufficient and ordering plaintiff to serve an amended disclosure, noting “[t]he \nCourt is mindful that an identification of the trade secre ts at issue might require a protective order \nor sealing order . . . [h]owever, the need to seek further protective or sealing orders does not \nexcuse [plaintiff’s] failure to identify the trade secrets.”).  While the court does not hold that \nPlaintiff’s dis closure is per se  insufficient because it was publicly filed, the fact that the disclosure \nis public is a telling indication  that it does not satisfy the “reasonable particularity” standard.2  \nThe court also notes that in some cases,  especially those invol ving technical or scientific \ninformation  such as this one , plaintiffs have supported their trade secret disclosures with \ndeclarations by expert witnesses which attempt to  distinguish  the alleged trade secrets from \ninformation already known  in the field.   See, e.g., Advanced Modular , 132 Cal. App. 4th at 836; \nLilith Games , 2015 WL 4149066, at *5;  see also Phoenix Techs., Ltd. v. DeviceVM, Inc ., No. 09 -\n4697 -EDL, 2010 WL 8590525, at *4 (N.D.

Plaintif fs also submit  \ndocumentation supporting their disclosures.  See, e.g.,  Phoenix Techs. , 2010 WL 8590525, at *1 \n(noting plaintiff attached “almost one thousand pages of supporting documentation” to amended \nidentification of trade secrets).  Neither s ection 2019.210 nor the case  law require s the submission \nof expert declarations or documentation, see Brescia , 172 Cal. App. 4th at 148, but it is \nnoteworthy that Plaintiff failed to submit any support at all for its publicl y-filed disclosure.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \nTurning to  Plaintiff’s disclosure , problems  are evident from the outset .  The first two \n                                                 \n2 In one article exploring the “ubiquitous” problem of litigating disputes related to identification of \ntrade secrets, the authors propose a rule that “if the list of alleged secrets is not marked as a \nconfidential documen t or could have been listed verbatim in the complaint without actually \ndisclosing the plaintiff’s alleged trade secrets, the list is prima facie insufficient,” for “[n]o \nplaintiff making a good faith identification would disclose its alleged secrets in a n on-confidential \ndocument.”  Charles Tait Graves & Brian D. Range, Identification of Trade Secret Claims in \nLitigation: Solutions for a Ubiquitous Dispute , 5 Nw. J. Tech & Intell. Prop. 68, 91 (2006).  \n Case 4:15-cv-00798-HSG   Document 795   Filed 07/06/16   Page 6 of 13 \n7 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  paragraphs contain “catchall” descriptions  that refer to allegations made in pleadings and other \ncourt filings .  The first paragraph  of the disclosure informs the reader that Plaintiff’s  trade secrets \ninclude “[a]ll information and documents identified by Plaintiff as containing its trade secrets at \nissue in this case in response to discovery propounded by or sought by” any defendant, as well as \n“the information and documents identified in Plaintiff[’s]  . . . First Amended Complaint and \nSecond Amended Complaint.”  Disclosure at ¶ 1.  In the next paragraph, Plaintiff identifies “[a]ll \ninformation and documents identified with particularity in Plaintiff’s documents produced to the \nDefendants at Bates Numbers Loop -00019679 to Loop -00020223.”  Id. at ¶ 2.  As to the first \ncategory, the court has already rejected Plaintiff’s prior attempt to rely on the pleadings and other \nfilings to satisfy its trade secret disclosure obligations.  Regarding the second category, IQS \nasserts (and Plaintiff does not dispute) that the specified bates range identifies  two declarations \npreviously publicly filed in this litigation .  Plaintiff  already tried to  argue that it had satisfied  its \nobligations under section 201 9.210  by citing to paragraphs in these declarations .  The court was \nnot persuaded.  See Loop , 2015 WL 9269758, at *3 n.2.   Plaintiff’ s attempt to meet its disclosure \nobligation by pointing to allegations in its pleadings and other court filings was insuffi cient the \nfirst time, and is no more sufficient now.    \nPlaintiff divide s the remaining 53 paragraphs of its trade secret disclosure into three \ngroups: technical data, business development/marketing data, and financial/operational data.   \nThe vast majorit y of Plaintiff’s disclosures consist of paragraphs  in which Plaintiff simply lists \ncategories of alleged trade secrets in broad  terms.  Paragraph 4 is representative of the level of \nspecificity Plaintiff uses when describing categories of claimed trade secrets : \n \nApplication of Plaintiff’s technology to the analysis of big data \ngenerally owned by medium to large companies and governmental \nentities (in cluding the target customers and partners from among \nthose types of entities) with large volumes of structured and \nunstructured data from multiple sources and in need of quickly \nperforming analyses of the data and obtain actionable inputs or \nresults that c an quickly be used for a variety of applications in \nvarious fields including customer relationship management, \ncustomer experience needs.  \nDisclosure at ¶ 4.  This does not constitute a “particularized” disclosure of trade secrets, but is \nsimply a listing o f concepts that Plaintiff asserts constitute its trade secret information.  See, e.g., Case 4:15-cv-00798-HSG   Document 795   Filed 07/06/16   Page 7 of 13 \n8 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  Disclosure at ¶¶ 3, 6 -8, 10 -30, 32 -42, 45 -50, 54 ; see Soc. Apps , 2012 WL 2203063, at *5 (finding \ninsufficient disclosure in which plaintiff “only offered the most general concepts to describe what \nit believes is its trade secret information”) .  Similarly, in paragraph 6, Plaintiff identifies \n“Plaintiff’s confidential information regarding the generation of semantics from structured and \nunstructured text data.”  Disc losure at ¶ 6.  This general category of information merely echoes \nPlaintiff’s description of its technology as pleaded in the second amended complaint.  [See Docket \nNo. 210 ( SAC ) at ¶ 138 (“similar to the main thrust of [Plaintiff’s] technology: generating \nsemantics from u nstructured text data”). ]  Plaintiff’s use of technical language does not mask the \nfact that its description s fail to identify any “confidential information” described therein.  See, e.g., \nPerlan , 178 Cal. App. 4th at 1339 (“[d]espite  the highly technical language used, it is apparent \nthat this description does not provide specific identifications of the peptides or reagents used in the \nprocess.”).   \nRather than a “reasonably particular” list of  trade s ecrets, Plaintiff’s disclosure resemble s \nan effort to categorize every piece of information or know -how that could potentially have value \nto the company.  For example, paragraph 3 lists unnamed experiments, test results, research, \nanalysis, evaluations, ap plications, and design concepts, among other things, as examples of \nPlaintiff’s “highly confidential technical data.”  Disclosure at ¶ 3.  The disclosure is devoid of any \ndetails about the claimed experiments, test results, research, etc.  Paragraph 19 is similarly vague \nand unspecific: “Plaintiff’s confidential modeling and discussions regarding its development and \nexperimentation of supervised and unsupervised artificial intelligence technology.”  Id. at ¶ 19.  \nPlaintiff’s technique  of listing  general concepts  or categories of information is plainly insufficient ; \nDefendants cannot fairly be expected to rebut Plaintiff’s trade secr ets claim without  a reasonably \nconcrete definition  of the  purpor ted secrets.  See, e.g.,  Jobscience , 2014 WL 1724763, at *3 -4 \n(N.D. Cal. May 1, 2014) (dismissing trade secrets claim based on inadequate disclosure, noting \n“Defendants cannot reasonably prepare [their] defenses and searc h for art in the field if the \nboundaries of the trade secret are so undetermined.”) ; Imax , 152 F.3d at 1167 (“CTI could not be \nexpected to prepare its rebuttal to Imax’s trade secrets claim without some concrete identification \nof exactly which ‘dimensions and tolerances’ Imax alleged were incorporated into CTI’s own Case 4:15-cv-00798-HSG   Document 795   Filed 07/06/16   Page 8 of 13 \n9 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  projector system.”).    In the same vein , a fact finder will not be able to  determine  whether the \ninformation in Plaintiff’s disclosure  qualif ies as trade secrets, including  whether they are in fact \nsecret, i f the parameters of the secrets rem ain unclear.  \nIn many of the paragraphs , particularly those  classified under the “Business \nDevelopment/Marketing Data” and “Financial/Operational Data” headings , Plaintiff identifies  \ncategories of information such as “actual and prospective investors and partners,” (¶ 34), “key \ncontact information . . . at a large Japanese technology company,” (¶ 36), “key contacts at a major \ntelephone company,” (¶ 38), “confidential target partner, client, investor, supplier, employee, \nconsultant , advisor information,” (¶ 42), and “key service providers” (¶ 46) .  See also  Disclosure \nat ¶¶ 17, 37, 39, 45 -47, 54.  Potential investors, clients, suppliers, or contacts theoretically could \nconstitute protectable facts.  However, as noted above, Plaintiff’s disclosure was unaccompanied \nby any supporting documentation , and th ere is no indication that Plaintiffs identified the se claimed \ntrade secrets with more specificity .  Without more, Defendants are left to guess .  Who exactly are \nthe secret companies or individuals ?  Are the names easily identifi able, or must Defendants \nengage in mindreading to determine which of them  constitute trade secrets?  What prevented \nPlaintiff from naming them in a sealed document?  Plaintiff ’s categorical descriptions  render  it \nimpossible for Defendants to conduct p ublic domain or other research to challenge the alleged \nsecrecy of the information at issue.   Instead, Defendants are left to guess at the specifics.   See \nBrescia , 172 Cal. App. 4th at 147 (“the burden on the trade secret claimant is to provide a level of \ndetail adequate to distinguish the subject information from general knowledge or knowledge of \nskilled persons in the field.  The defendant may then use that level of detail to determine the limits \nof the trade secret by investigating whether the informa tion disclosed is within the public domain . \n. . or to develop . . . defenses.”).  \nMany of the paragraphs in Plaintiff’s disclosures contain  “catchall” wording  such as \n“including” when describing the trade secrets.  For example, paragraph 33 states, “Plaint iff’s \nconfidential information, including  regarding problems experienced with certain tests . . .” \n(emphasis added).  Disclosure at ¶ 33; see also  id. at ¶¶ 13 -14, 18, 21-22, 33-35, 37, 45, 49 -50, 55.  \nThe Ninth Circuit has rejected the use of “catchall” language , holding that such language is Case 4:15-cv-00798-HSG   Document 795   Filed 07/06/16   Page 9 of 13 \n10 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  insufficiently specific “because it does not clearly refer  to tangible trade secret material.”  Imax, \n152 F.3d at 1167  (emphasis in original) (determining that the phrase “including every dimension \nand tolerance that defines or reflects that design”  was an insufficient disclosure ). \nSeveral paragraphs read more like requests for production of documents rather than trade \nsecret disclosures.  For example, p aragraphs 51 and 52 identify  “[a]ll informatio n stored in \nPlaintiff’s Apple MacBook Air computer . . . assigned to Anna Gatti in 2012 for use in \nconjunction with Plaintiff’s business” and “[a]ll information stored in Plaintiff’s data accounts \nused by Gatti while she purported to work as Plaintiff’s CE O and President.”  Disclosure at ¶¶ 51, \n52.  Similarly, i n another paragraph, Plaintiff identifies, “ Plaintiff’s information sent to Defendant \nGatti’s email address while she was working for Plaintiff, which Gatti improperly forwarded to \nher personal email  account . . .”  Id. at ¶ 53; see also id . at ¶¶ 43, 44.  These disclosures are so \nvague and unspecific as to constitute no disclosure at all since Defendants cannot “ascertain at \nleast the boundaries within which the secret[s] lie[].”  Comp . Econ s., 50 F. Supp. 2d at 984 \n(citation omitted).   \n  In several paragraphs, Plaintiff identifies categories of information, and states that the \nspecifics have been disclosed to Defendants in discovery and/or identifies the Bates numbers of \ndocuments which it apparently contends contain the secret information .  See, e.g ., Disclosure at ¶¶ \n3, 5, 9, 16 -17, 21 -22, 26, 31 -32, 37, 40, 47 -48.  While on their face  these paragraphs appear to be \nmore specific than those described above, they also do not satisfy t he requirement of “reasonable \nparticularity.”  This is because simply stating that specifics have been “provided in discovery ” \ndoes not identify where  in the discovery the alleged trade secret  can be found .  For example, \nparagraph 48 lists, “Plaintiff’s confidential contracts and agreements setting forth offer letters and \nemployment agreements and confidentiality agreements with Anna Gatti, Dario Vignudelli and \nDB as discovered to date.”  Id. at ¶ 48.  Howev er, Plaintiff does not specify which contracts and \nagreements contain the alleged trade secrets, nor does it  describe where  the contracts and \nagreements can be found in Plaintiff’s discovery responses or productions.  Moreover , identifying \ndocuments alone would not be  an adequate substitute for detailed identification of the trade secrets \ntherein, since review  of the  documents may not inform Defendants as to what precisely Plaintiff is Case 4:15-cv-00798-HSG   Document 795   Filed 07/06/16   Page 10 of 13 \n11 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  asserting is a trade secret.   As a further  example, paragraph 31 lists, “Plaintiff’s confidential patent \napplication provided to Gatti on May 29, 2014, as set forth at Loop -00020163 -66.  The Plaintiff’s \npatent application that Gatti obtained at the time, purporting to be acting as Plaintiff’s C EO was \nconfidential and remained confidential for an extended period of time through 2015.”  Id. at ¶ 31.  \nThis paragraph is confusing and does not clearly identify the claimed trade secret.  To the extent \nthat Plaintiff is asserting that its patent applic ation is a trade secret, it does not specify which \nportion of the application describes  the claimed secret.3  See, e.g., Myrio Corp. v. Minerva \nNetwork, Inc ., No. C 00 -20996 RMW (PVT), 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10461, at *3 (N.D. Cal. Apr. \n10, 2001) (ordering plaintiff to describe all trade secrets “in narrative form, rather than by cross -\nreference to other trade secrets or documents,” and stating, “[i]f Plaintiff references a document as \nsetting forth one or more trade secrets, it shall specify precisely which  portions of the document \ndescribes the trade secret[s].”).  \nIn its opposition, Plaintiff argues that its trade secret disclosure and “various discovery \nserved on the Defendants ” satisfy its section 2019.210 obligation s, but offers no support for its \nposit ion.  See Opp’n at 2.  The court finds Plaintiff’s  contention without merit.  Notably, Plaintiff \ndoes not specifically identify any of its discovery responses  that purportedly identified its trade \nsecrets.4  Plaintiff also a sserts  that the purpose of section 2019.210 “is to define the scope of \ndiscovery, before discovery begins, in a case filed in State court, where only trade secrets are at \nissue.”  Opp’n at 2.  It contends  that IQS’s motion is “simply a red herring, particularly since \ndiscovery in this case has now closed.”  Id. at 3.  This argument, too, lacks merit, given that the \ncourt has already held that section 2019.210 applies in this action.  Moreover, the purpose of \n                                                 \n3 The court notes that i n several paragraphs Plaintiff appears to refer to  patent applications.  See, \ne.g., Disclosure at ¶¶ 5, 7, 9, 13 .  However, “[i]t is well established that the disclosure of a trade \nsecret in a patent places the information comprising the secret into the public domain.”  Forcier v. \nMicro soft Corp ., 123 F. Supp. 2d 520, 528 (N.D. Cal. 2000)  (citation omitted ).   \n \n4 In its reply, IQS contends that Defendants propounded two interrogatories asking Plaintiff to \nidentify its trade secrets.  Brayer Decl., Apr . 6, 2016, ¶¶ 3, 4.  Plaintiff did not respond to the f irst \ninterrogatory.  As to the second, Plaintiff responded by identifying pleadings and declarations, and \nstated, “Loop AI will produce a supplemental list of information covered by this Interrogatory in \naccordance with the applicable rules governing the i dentification of confidential information or \ntrade secrets.”  Id. at Ex. 2.  Case 4:15-cv-00798-HSG   Document 795   Filed 07/06/16   Page 11 of 13 \n12 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  section 2019.210 goes well beyond shaping discovery.  I t also “promotes well -investigated claims \nand dissuades the filing of meritless trade secret complaints . . . [and] enables defendants to form \ncomplete and well -reasoned defenses, ensuring that they need not wait until the eve of trial to \neffectively defen d against charges of trade secret misappropriation.”  Comp . Econ s., 50 F. Supp. \n2d at 985.   \n Finally, Plaintiff responds by complain ing that IQS has refused to respond to Plaintiff’s \ndiscovery.  This argument is irrelevant, since Plaintiff does not explain how it needs discovery \nfrom Defendants in order to identify with particularity its own  trade secrets that it has put at issue \nin this case.  See Comp. Econs. , 50 F. Supp. 2d at 985  (section 2019.210 “prevents plaintiffs from \nusing the discovery process as a means to obtain the def endant’s trade secrets . . . ‘[t]he purpose \n[of CCP § 2019(d)] is to prevent plaintiff from conducting ‘fishing expeditions’ into competitors’ \nbusiness files by unfounded claims of trade secret misappropriation.’” (citation omitted)).    \nIn sum, the court f inds that Plaintiff has failed to comply with the court’s December 21, \n2015 order to provide a “thorough and complete” identification of the trade secret s at issue in this \nlitigation  in accordance with section 2019.210.   The court notes that in its Decembe r 21, 2015 \norder, it warned Plaintiff that “[a]ny future amendment to [its] disclosure [would] only be \npermitted upon a showing of good cause.”  Loop , 2015 WL 9269758, at *4 (citation omitted).  \nPlaintiff has not sought leave to amend its trade secret disc losure, nor does its failure to comply \nwith the court’s order constitute good cause to amend.   \nC. Sanctions  \nAlthough not entirely clear, it appears that IQS seeks preclusive sanctions under Rule \n37(b)(2)(A) barring Plaintiff from introducing evidence related to its CUTSA claim, or in the \nalternative, dismissal of all of Plaintiff’s claims under Rule 41(b) for it s failure to obey the court’s \nDecember 21, 2015 order.  Mot. at 11.5   \nPlaintiff’s main response to IQS’s request for sanctions is its assertion that it did in fact \n                                                 \n5 The reason this is unclear is because IQS moves for the Rule 37(b)(2)(A) sanctions  described \nabove, but also  request s an order enforcing the December 21, 2015 order to provide a thorough \nand complete trade secret disclosure.  Mot. at 9.  \n Case 4:15-cv-00798-HSG   Document 795   Filed 07/06/16   Page 12 of 13 \n13 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  comply with the December 21, 2015 order  by filing a n adequate  trade secret disclosure .6  As \ndiscussed above, the court finds that Plaintiff did not comply with th at order.   Rule 37(b)(2)(A) \nprovides that “[i]f a party . . . fails to obey an orde r to provide or permit discovery ,” the court may \n“prohibit[] the disobedient party from supporting or opposing designated claims or defenses, or \nfrom introducing designated matters in evidence .”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(b)(2)(A)(ii).   Defendants ’ \nmotions for su mmary judgment currently are pending before the Honorable Haywood S. Gilliam.  \nFor that reason, and after consultation with  Judge  Gilliam, the court defer s to the trial judge the \nramifications of Plaintiff’s failure to comply with the court’s December 21, 2015 order  to provide  \nan adequate  section 2019.210 trade secret disclosure .   \nIII. CONCLUSION  \nFor the foregoing reasons, IQS’s motion is granted .  Plaintiff ’s trade secret disclosure is \ninsufficien t, and violated the undersigned’ s December 21, 2015 order.  The issue of sanctions for \nPlaintiff’s failure to comply with the court’s December 21, 2015 order is deferred to Judge \nGilliam.  \n \nIT IS SO ORDERED.  \nDated: July 6, 2016  \n______________________________________  \nDonna M.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: In the case of Loop AI Labs Inc. v. Anna Gatti, et al., the court granted Loop AI's motion to strike a counterclaim by IQ System, Inc. under California's anti-SLAPP statute. Loop AI, a startup developing AI technology, accused its former CEO, Anna Gatti, and several companies of conspiring to interfere with its business. IQ System's counterclaim for intentional interference with contractual relations was struck because it arose from Loop AI's protected litigation communications, and the claim lacked a probability of success due to California's litigation privilege.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether IQ System's counterclaim for intentional interference with contractual relations was subject to dismissal under California's anti-SLAPP statute because it arose from protected petitioning activity.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court held that Loop AI's actions of filing litigation and related submissions constituted protected activity under the anti-SLAPP statute. Furthermore, IQ System could not demonstrate a probability of prevailing on its counterclaim because it was barred by California's litigation privilege, which protects communications made in judicial proceedings.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine you're in a school and you find out that a former principal took some secrets about the school’s new AI programs to another school. You tell the school board about this, and they start figuring out what happened. The other school, annoyed by all the fuss, claims you ruined their reputation with what you said. The judge says, \"Wait, those statements were just part of you telling us what happened, and you have the right to do that when you're trying to solve such issues, so those complaints against you don’t count.” Essentially, the former principal and the other school's complaint couldn't continue because they were part of the school board’s efforts to gather information on a legitimate issue.",

No. 55 \n \nPlaintiff Loop AI Labs, Inc. (“Loop AI”) moves to strike Defendant IQ System, Inc.’s (“IQ \nSystem ’s”) counterclaim for intentional interference with contractual rela tions pursuant to \nCalifornia’s a nti-SLAPP statute.  The Court has considered the arguments and evidence presented \nby the parties and, for the reasons s tated below, GRANTS  Loop AI’s motion to strike.  \nI. BACKGROUND  \nLoop AI  is a startup company focused on developing artificial intelligence technology.  In \nthis case, it  alleges that it was the victim of a conspiracy undertaken by Anna Gatti, IQ System \nLLC, IQ S ystem, Inc., Almaviva S.p.A., Almawave S.r.l., and Almawave USA (the \n“Defendants”).   Specifically, Loop AI alleges that Gatti, its now-former CEO, violated her \nemployment agreement by accepting a position as the CEO of a competing company called \nAlmawave USA , whereby Gatti  (1) secretly provided the other Defendants with Loop AI’s \nbusiness information; and (2) actively frustrate d Loop AI’s attempts to fundraise in order to force \nan eventual sa le of Loop AI to Almawave USA . \nOn March 16, 2015, IQ System, Inc. (“IQ System”) answered the Complaint and asserted a \ncounterclaim against Loop AI for intentional interference with contractual relations.  See Dkt. No. \n33.  IQ System’s counterclaim arises from its loss of  customers as a result of the allegations of \nmisconduct contained in Loop AI’s pleadings and related submissions to the Court.  See id.   Loop Case 4:15-cv-00798-HSG   Document 184   Filed 09/02/15   Page 1 of 6 \n2 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  AI filed an Amended Complaint on April 6, 2015, see Dkt. No. 45  (“Am. Compl.”) , and then, on \nApril 13, 2015, moved to strike IQ Sy stem’s counterclaim as file d in violation of California’s a nti-\nSLAPP statute.  See Dkt. No. 55 (“Mot.”).  IQ System filed an Answer to the Amended Complaint  \non April 24, 2015 but —while the tortious interference counterclaim is still included in the \ncaption —removed all reference to the counterclaim from the body of the pleading.  See Dkt. No.  \n72.  IQ System opposed Loop AI’s  motion to strike on April 27, 2015. Dkt. No. 74 (“Opp.”).  \nLoop AI filed a reply brief on April 28, 2015.  See Dkt. No. 75 (“Reply”).  \nII. DISCUSSION  \nCalifornia enacted section 425.16 to curtail “strategic lawsuits against public \nparticipation,” known as “SLAPP” actions, finding “a disturbing increase in lawsuits brought \nprimarily to chill the valid exercise of the constitutional rights of fre edom of speech and petition \nfor redress of grievances.”   Cal. Civ. Proc. Code § 425.16(a).  SLAPPs “masquerade as ordinary \nlawsuits but are brought to deter common citizens from exercising their political or legal rights or \nto punish them for doing so.”  Batzel v. Smith , 333 F.3d 1018, 1024 (9th Cir. 2003)  (internal \nquotation marks omitted).  Because “it is in the public interest to encourage continued \nparticipation in matters of public significance, and [because] this participation should not be \nchilled th rough abuse of the judicial process,” the anti -SLAPP statute is to be construed broadly. \nCal. Civ. Proc. Code § 425.16(a).   \nCalifornia courts apply a two -step process for analyzing an anti -SLAPP motion.  Hilton v. \nHallmark Cards,  599 F.3d 894, 903 (9th Cir. 2010).  Under the first prong, the moving party must \nmake “a threshold showing . . . that the act or acts of which the plaintiff complains were taken ‘in \nfurtherance of the right of petition or free speech under the United Stat es or California \nConstitution in connection with a public issue,’ as defined in the statute.”  Equilon Enters., LLC v. \nConsumer Cause, Inc.,  29 Cal.4th 53, 67 (2002) (quoting Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 425.16(b)(1)).  \n“The moving party does so by showing that an act underlying the claims to be stricken fits one of \nthe categories spelled out in section 425.16(e).”  Netlist, Inc v. Diablo Technologies, Inc. , No. 13 -\ncv-05962 -YGR, 2015 WL 153618, at *3 (N.D. Cal. Jan. 12, 2015) (cit ation omitted ).   Case 4:15-cv-00798-HSG   Document 184   Filed 09/02/15   Page 2 of 6 \n3 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  A. SLAPP  Applies t o State -Law Claims in Federal Court  \nIQ System argues that Loop AI’s motion to strike must fail because California’s a nti-\nSLAPP statute only applies to claims asserted in federal court pursuant to diversity jurisdiction.  \nOpp. at 4 -6.  IQ System characteriz es United States v. Lockheed Missiles & Space Co., Inc.,  190 \nF.3d 963 (9th Cir. 1999) as standing for that proposition.  The Court disagrees.   While the \nLockheed Missiles  action satisfied federal subject matter jurisdiction based on the diversity of the \nparties, the Ninth Circuit decision did not limit its holding to such cases.  Instead, the Court \nperformed an analysis under Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins,  304 U.S. 64 (1938) and found that  (1) \nimportant substantive state interests were furthered by the anti -SLA PP statute; (2) no identifiable \nfederal interest would be undermined by its application; and (3) prohibiting its application would \npromote forum -shopping.   \nThe Erie doctrine applies to pendent state law claims to the same extent it applies to st ate \nlaw claims before a federal court on the basis of diversity jurisdiction.  See Nathan v. Boeing Co.,  \n116 F.3d 422, 423 (9th Cir.  1997).  Accordingly, numerous federal district courts in California, \nincluding courts in this dis trict, have found that California’s ant i-SLAPP statute may be asserted \nagainst state law claims in federal court regardless of the basis for the court’s jurisdiction.  As \nJudge Fogel reasoned, “under the Erie analysis set forth in Lockheed  the anti -SLAPP statute may \nbe applied to state law clai ms which, as in this case, are asserted pendent to federal question \nclaims.”  Globetrotter Software, Inc. v. Elan Computer Grp., Inc. , 63 F. Supp. 2d 1127, 1130 \n(N.D. Cal. 1999).  This reasoning has been applied in numerous decisions over the past fifteen \nyears:   \n \nWe have located only one case in which a court has addressed the \nissue of whether the anti -SLAPP statute applies in federal question \ncases with pendent state law claims.  In Globetrotte r, 63 F. Supp. 2d \nat 1129 -30, the court held that the anti-SLAPP statute was not \napplicable to federal questions, but could be applicable to pendent \nstate law claims.  We agree with this holding.  \n \nIn re Bah , 321 B.R. 41, 46 (B.A.P. 9th Cir. 2005); see Berman v. McManus , 11-cv-00635 -MCE, \n2012 WL 1455088, at *2  (E.D. Cal. Apr. 26, 2012) (“A party may seek to specially strike . . . state \nlaw claims that are supplemental to federal claims in an action premised on federal question Case 4:15-cv-00798-HSG   Document 184   Filed 09/02/15   Page 3 of 6 \n4 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  jurisdiction.”); McFadden v. Deutsche Bank Nat. Trust Co. , No. 10 -cv-03004 -JAM, 2011 WL \n3606797, at *6 (E.D. Cal. Aug. 16, 2011) report and recommendation adopted , No. 10 -cv-3004 -\nJAM, 2011 WL 4765845 (E.D. Cal. Oct. 7, 2011) (same).   \nThe Court agrees with the reasoning articulated in these cases.  IQ System has asserted a \nstate law cause o f action as a counterclaim in this case.  Loop AI may move to strike that \ncounterclaim under California’s anti -SLAPP statute.  Accordingly, the Court proceeds to the two -\nstep process described above.  \nB. Step One: Protected Activity  \nThere can be no reasonable question that IQ System’s counterclaim arises from Loop AI’s \nprotected speech or petitioning activity.  Section 425.16(e) expressly defines the phrase “act in \nfurtherance of a person’s right of petition or free speech” to include:  \n \nany written or oral stat ement or writing made before a . . . judicial \nproceeding [and]  any written or oral statement or writing made in \nconnection with an issue under consideration or review by a . . . \njudicial body . . . .  \n \nCal. Civ. Proc. Code § 425.16(e); see also Netlist , 201 5 WL 153618 at *3 (“To put it simply, any \nstatement made in a complaint filed with a court would fall squarely within the purview of \n‘petitioning activity.’”); Dove Audio, Inc. v. Rosenfeld, Meyer & Susman,  47 Cal. App. 4th 777, \n784 (1996) (under section 4 25.16, “‘[t]he constitutional right to petition  . . . includes the basic act \nof filing litigation or otherwise seeking administrative action.’”).   \nIn this case, IQ System concedes  that its counterclaim arises from the “flurry of \ninflammatory pleadings and  moving papers” filed in this action.  Opp. at 9.  IQ System’s inclusion \nin those pleadings is not extraneous, as it is alleged to have conspired with the other Defendants to \ncarry out the conspiracy alleged by Loop AI.  Accordingly, the Court finds that I Q System’s \ncounterclaim arises from protected speech or petitioning activity, and thus satisfies the first prong \nof the anti -SLAPP statute analysis.  \nC. Step Two: Probability of Prevailing  \nThe Court now turns to the second prong, which requires  IQ System to put forwa rd \nevidence to show that it is likely to prevail on  its counterclaim in order to avoid dismissal.  The Case 4:15-cv-00798-HSG   Document 184   Filed 09/02/15   Page 4 of 6 \n5 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  second pro ng requires that IQ System both  (1) state a legally sufficient claim; and (2) support that \nclaim with a sufficient prima facie evidentiary sho wing to sustain a favorable judgment.  See \nNygard, Inc. v. Uusi –Kerttula,  159 Cal. App. 4th 1027, 1044 (2008).  The standard applied to an \nanti-SLAPP motion —probability of prevailing on the merits —presents a higher burden than the \nplausibility standard app lied for a motion to dismiss.  See Hilton,  599 F.3d at 902 (finding that a \ndefendant who was unsuccessful on a motion to dismiss could still prevail on the anti -SLAPP \nmotion to strike because the plaintiff may state “a legal claim” but may not have “facts to support \nit”).  Loop AI argues that —far from being able to provide a prima facie evidentiary showing \nsufficient to sustain a favorable judgment —IQ System’s counterclaim is legally foreclosed by \nCalifornia’s litigation privilege.  Mot. at 5 -6.   \nCaliforni a Civil Code section 47(b) provides that communications made in or related to \njudicial proceedings are absolutely immune from tort liability.  The California Supreme Court has \nexplained that the purpose of the privilege is “to afford litigants . . . the ut most freedom of access \nto the courts without fear of being harassed subsequently by derivative tort actions.”  Silberg v. \nAnderson,  50 Cal.3d 205, 213 (1990).  “The litigation privilege applies to any communications (1) \nmade in a judicial proceeding; (2) b y litigants or other participants authorized by law; (3) to \nachieve the objects of the litigation; (4) that have some connection or logical relation to the \naction.”  Sharper Image Corp. v. Target Corp.,  425 F. Supp. 2d 1056, 1077 (N.D. Cal. 2006) \n(citing Silberg,  50 Cal.3d at 212).  Once these requirements are met, section 47(b) operates as an \nabsolute privilege.  Silberg , 50 Cal.3d at 216.  \nThe Court agrees that the statements that form the basis of IQ System’s counterclaim are \nprotected by Section 47(b).  The privilege covers “any publication required or permitted by law in \nthe course of a judicial proceeding to achieve the objects of the litigation, even though the \npublication is made outside the courtroom and no function of the court or its officers is in volved.”  \nId.  The allegations contained in Loop AI’s pleadings and described in Loop AI’s submissions to \nthe Court are at the heart of this exceptionally broad privilege.  Id. at 219 -20 (“The requirement \nthat the communication be in furtherance of the obj ects of the litigation is, in essence, simply part \nof the requirement that the communication be connected with, or have some logical relation to, the Case 4:15-cv-00798-HSG   Document 184   Filed 09/02/15   Page 5 of 6 \n6 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  action, i.e., that it not be extraneous to the action.”).  Courts have applied the litigation privilege to  \nall tort claims, with the exception of malicious prosecution.  Edwards v. Centex,  53 Cal. App. 4th \n15, 29 (1997); see also  U.S. Ethernet Innovations, LLC v. Acer, Inc.,  No. C 10 -3724 CW, 2013 \nWL 4104458, at *3 (N.D. Cal. Aug. 12, 2013) (applying the litig ation privilege to bar an \nintentional inference with contract claim).  \nIQ System’s opposition to Loop AI’s motion ignores Loop AI’s argument that California’s \nlitigation privilege precludes its counterclaim for tortious interference with contractual relatio ns.  \nIn fact, IQ System has appears to have conceded that its counterclaim is not viable by removing it \nfrom the body of its responsive pleading to the FAC.  Dkt. No. 72.  Accordingly, the Court finds \nthat IQ System has not demonstrated that there is a pro bability of prevailing on its counterclaim.   \nD. Attorneys’ Fees and Costs  \n“Under section 425.16, subdivision (c), an award of attorney fees to a defendant prevailing \non a special motion to strike is mandatory . . . .”   Vargas v. City of Salinas , 200 Cal. App. 4th \n1331, 1341 (2011); see also Cal. Civ. Proc. Code § 425.16(c) (“[A] prevailing defendant on a \nspecial motion to strike shall be entitled  to recover his or her attorney’ s fees and costs.”).  Loop AI \nis entitled to recovery its attorneys’ fees and costs arising from IQ System’s counterclaim.   \nIII. CONCLUSION  \nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court GRANTS  Loop AI’s motion to strike IQ System’s \ncounter claim pursuant to California’s  anti-SLAPP statute, Cal. Civ. Proc. Code § 425.16.  Loop \nAI and IQ Systems are directed to meet and confer on the amount of attorneys’ fees and costs \nrecoverable under section 425.16(c).  No later than 21 days  from the date of this order , Loop AI \nand IQ S ystems shall file a joint statement concerning the attorneys’ fees and costs at issue whi ch \neither  (1) states the stipulated amount to which the parties have agreed; or (2) sets forth a \nstipulated briefing schedule for a motion to determine the attorneys’  fees and costs.  \nIT IS SO ORDERED.  \nDated:   September 2, 2015  \n_______________ ______ _________  \nHAYWOOD S.

Black \n \nORDER DENYING MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION (Doc. 7)  \n \nThis civil case is before the Court on Plaintiff Concentrix CVG Customer \nManagement Group, Inc.’s motion for preliminary injunction (Doc. 7),1 and the parties’ \nresponsive memoranda  (Docs. 22, 24).2  Also before the Court is Defendant Stephan J. \nDaoust’s objection to and motion to strike all evidence attached to Plaintiff’s reply in \nsupport of its motion for preliminary injunction.  (Doc. 26).3 \n \n1 This motion (Doc. 7) was originally titled “ motion for temporary restraining order and \npreliminary injunction.”   However, after the Court entered its order regarding personal \njurisdiction (Doc. 18), Concentrix changed its request to simply one for a preli minary injunction.  \n(Doc. 21).   \n \n2 The Court finds that an evidentiary hearing is  unnecessary.  “[Sixth Circuit] Rule 65 \njurisprudence indicates that a hearing is only required when there are disputed factual issues, and \nnot when the issues are primarily questions of law.”  Certified Restoration Dry Cleaning Network, L.L.C. v. Tenke Corp., 511 F.3d 535, 552 (6th Cir. 2007).  Here, the issues presented, particularly the reasonableness of the non- compete agreement under Ohio law , and whether \ncertain informat ion is trade secret, are primarily questions of law , not fact . \n \n3 Finding that this  motion to strike primarily argued  local and evidentiary rules, the Court \nconsidered the motion to strike without any response or reply, and denied the motion. (4/22/2021 Notation Order).  The Court expands on its reasoning in this Order.  Case: 1:21-cv-00131-TSB Doc #: 27 Filed: 05/03/21 Page: 1 of 35  PAGEID #: <pageID>2 I.  BACKGROUND  \nThe Court has already stated certain  factual and procedural background in this \ncase when deciding now-dismissed defendants TaskUs Holdings, Inc. and TaskUs, Inc.’s \nmotion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction.  See Concentrix CVG Corp. v. Daoust, \nNo. 1:21- CV-131, 2021 WL 1118025 (S.D. Ohio Mar. 24, 2021) .  The Court \nreincorporates that factual and procedural history here.  Accordingly, in this Order, the \nCourt will briefly summarize Concentrix’s allegations, and then will relate the parties’ \nevidence presented in support of and in opposition to Concentrix’s motion for \npreliminary injunction.  (Doc. 7).  \nDefendant Stephan J. Daoust is a former employee of Plaintiff Concentrix, \nformerly known as Convergys.  ( Doc. 14 at ¶ 23).  During his 22-year tenure with \nConvergys/Concentrix, Daoust rose to the level of Senior Vice President – Operations.  \n(Id.)  On August 20, 2018, Daoust executed a Non-Disclosure and Non-Competition \nAgreement (the “NCA”).  (Id. at ¶ 24; see also Doc. 14- 1).  In October 2018, Convergys \nwas acquired by Concentrix.  (Doc. 14 at ¶ 2).  \nOn December 18, 2020, Daoust gave notice to Concentrix that he was terminating \nhis employment effective December 31, 2020.  (Id. at ¶ 38).  Concentrix then learned that Daoust had accepted employment with TaskUs.  (Doc. 15-1 at ¶ 6).  On December 23, \n2020, after learning of Daoust’s employment with TaskUs, Concentrix sent correspondence to TaskUs and Daoust, notifying them of the NCA and Daoust’s \npurported breach.  (Doc. 15-1 at ¶ 6).  Daoust officially ended his employment with \nConcentrix on December 31, 2020.  (Doc. 14 at ¶ 38).  Case: 1:21-cv-00131-TSB Doc #: 27 Filed: 05/03/21 Page: 2 of 35  PAGEID #: <pageID>3 Concentrix alleges that TaskUs and Concentrix are direct competitors.  (Doc. 14 at  \n¶ 39).  Concentrix alleges that Daoust: (1) breached the NCA by going to work for one of \nConcentrix’s direct competitors and by using and/or disclosing Concentrix’s confidential, \nproprietary, and trade-secret information when  performing services for TaskUs; and (2) \nmisappropriated Concentrix’s trade secrets by taking the position with TaskUs.  (Id.) \nConcentrix requests that that Court:  \n1. Restrain Daoust from continued employment at TaskUs \nas Chief Operating Officer and from committing any \nother violations of the NCA;  \n \n2. Restrain Daoust from using or disclosing any of \nConcentrix’s confidential or proprietary information;  \n \n3. Require Daoust to immediately return to Concentrix any \ndocuments or information containing or comprising of \nConcentrix trade secrets or other confidential \ninformation; and  \n \n4. Require Daoust to immediately identify in writing for \nConcentrix the identities of all persons and entities with whom he has shared any Concentrix trade secrets or \nother confidential or proprietary information.   \n \n(Doc. 21-1).  Concentrix defines its trade secret, confidential and/or proprietary \ninformation as, “including without limitation confidential information pertaining to \nConcentrix’s technologies, employees, customers, prospective customers, costs, profit \nmargins, salaries, pricing, strategies, business plans, techniques, methods, processes, \nsales, finances, sales plans, and any and all trade secrets, as well as all other confidential \ninformation relating to Concentrix’s means of delivering services to its clients and their \ncustomers.”  (Id.)  Case: 1:21-cv-00131-TSB Doc #: 27 Filed: 05/03/21 Page: 3 of 35  PAGEID #: <pageID>4 A. Evidence as Presented  by the Parties  \n1. Concentrix’s Evidence \ni. The Non -Compete Agreement (“NCA”)  \nDaoust signed an NCA with Concentrix on August 20, 2018.  (Doc. 14-1).  Daoust \nsigned the NCA electronically.  (Id at 6).  In consideration for signing the NCA, Daoust \nwas offered an award of stock in Convergys (later acquired by Concentrix).  (Doc. 24-1).  \nThe NCA provides  that Daoust:  \nwill be entrusted with, have access to, and obtain intimate, \ndetailed, and comprehensive knowledge of confidential and/or \nproprietary information that is not generally known by the \npublic (“Information”), including confidential information \nconcerning: (i) the Company’s and/or its customers’ and/or \nsuppliers’ processes, practices, and procedures; (ii) the Company’s customers, suppliers and employees; (iii) the Company’s advertising and marketing plans; (iv) the \nCompany’s strategies, plans, goals, projections, and \nobjectives; (v) the Company’s research and development \nactivities and initiatives; (vi) the strengths and weaknesses of \nthe Company’s products or services; (vii) the costs, profit \nmargins, and pricing associated with the Company’s products \nor services; (viii) the Company’s sales strategies, including the manner in which it responds to customer requests and requests \nfor information or requests for proposals; (ix) the Company’s \nbusiness, including budgets and margin information, and (x) \nmatters or intellectual property considered confidential by the \nCompany, its customers, or suppliers, including information \nconsidered confidential by such customers’ or suppliers’ \ncustomers, vendors, or other third-party providers, and any \ninformation of a third party that the Company designates as \nconfidential (e.g., third -party information accessed or used by \nEmployee during his/her employment).  \n \n(Doc. 14-1 at § 2) (underline in original).  This Section further provides that Daoust \n“agrees that the Information is highly valuable and provides a competitive advantage to Case: 1:21-cv-00131-TSB Doc #: 27 Filed: 05/03/21 Page: 4 of 35  PAGEID #: <pageID>5 the Company.”  (Id .)  Similarly, it requires Daoust to return all Information, and any \ncopies of the Information, at the end of his employment with Concentrix.  (Id.)  \n The NCA also provide s the following:  \nEmployee recognizes the Company’s need to prevent unfair \ncompetition and to protect the Company’s legitimate business \ninterests.  Accordingly, Employee agrees that, during \nEmployee’s employment and for a period of one year \nfollowing Employee’s  termination or separation (for any \nreason), Employee will not accept employment or engage in any business activity (whether as a principal, partner, joint \nventurer, agent, employee, salesperson, consultant, \nindependent contractor, director, or officer) with a \n“Competitor” of the Company where such employment would \ninvolve Employee:  \n (i) developing, marketing, providing, selling or attempting \nto sell, or assisting in the sale or attempted sale of, any \nservices or products similar to those services or \nproducts with which Employee had any involvement or \nInformation during Employee’s employment with the \nCompany (including any products or services being \nresearched or developed by the Company during \nEmployee’s employment with the Company); or \n \n(ii) providing or performin g services that are similar to any \nservices that Employee provided to or performed for the Company during Employee’s employment with the \nCompany.  \n \n(Id. at § 3 (emphasis in original)).  A “Competitor” is defined as:  \nany business or entity that, at any time during the one year \nperiod prior to and/or the one-year period following \nEmployee’s termination or separation, provides or seeks to \nprovide, any products or services similar to or related to any \nproducts sold or any services provided by the Company…  \n \n(Id.)  The NCA then provides examples of “Competitors,” which includes “without \nlimitation,”  any company or business that:  Case: 1:21-cv-00131-TSB Doc #: 27 Filed: 05/03/21 Page: 5 of 35  PAGEID #: <pageID>6 (i) provides outsourced customer management and/or \ncustomer care services (including but not limited to \ncustomer service; customer retention; technical support; \nbusiness-to -consumer sales; complex device support; \nbusiness-to -business sales and account management; \nback office; collections; quality assurance; direct \nresponse; and home agent);  \n \n(ii) operates call centers and/or employs home agents to provide customer management and/or customer care \nservices;  \n \n(iii) provides products or services similar or related to, or in \ncompetition with, the products or services provided by \nany entity or business that is acquired by or merged into \nthe Company during Employee’s employment with the \nCompany; or  \n \n(iv) is identified by the Company as a competitor in any of \nthe Company’s public filings with the Securities and \nExchange Commission. \n \n(Id.) \nAs stated, Daoust signed an NCA in consideration for stock-options, leading to \ntwo agreements – the Performance Restricted Stock Unit (“PRSU”) and the Time-Based \nRestricted Stock Unit (“TRSU”) Agreements (collectively, the “Stock -Option \nAgreements”).  (Docs. 24-2, 24-3).  Each Stock-Option Agreement includes an NCA.  \nThe PRSU (Doc. 24-2) includes two consecutive NCA’s – a first version which \nwas attached to the Amended Complaint (compare Doc. 14-1 with Doc. 24-2 at 10–14), \nand a second version which was attached to the December 23 letter (compare Doc. 22-1 \nat Ex. A.1 with Doc. 24 -2 at 15–19).  Daoust’s one electronic signature on the PRSU is \nafter both NCAs, and is time-stamped “08/20/2018 09:42 AM U.S. Eastern Standard \nTime.”  (Doc. 24-2 at 20).  According to Concentrix, the second version attached to the Case: 1:21-cv-00131-TSB Doc #: 27 Filed: 05/03/21 Page: 6 of 35  PAGEID #: <pageID>7 PRSU was “apparently included by mistake by Fidelity Investments when it delivered the \nPRSU to Mr. Daoust electronically.”  (Doc. 24 -1, the “Gabbard Decl.,” at ¶ 3).4   \nThe TRSU includes only one NCA, and is the same as the second version in the \nPRSU and the December 23 letter.  (Compare Doc. 22-1 at Ex. A.1 with Doc. 24 -2 at 15 –\n19 with Doc. 24-3 at 8– 13).  Daoust’s electronic signature on the TRSU is at the end of \nthe document, and is time-stamped “08/20/2018 09:42 AM U.S. Eastern Standard Time.”  \n(Doc. 24-3 at 12–13 ). \nii. Daoust’s Role at Concentrix  \nDaoust started working for Convergys Corporation, now Concentrix, in 1999.  \n(Gabbard Decl. at ¶ 3; Doc. 14 at ¶ 23).  During his 22- year career with \nConvergys/Concentrix, he had risen to the level of Senior Vice-President – Operations.  \n(Doc. 25-1, the “Twomey Decl.,” at ¶ 10; Doc. 14 at ¶ 23).5  When Daoust resigned from \nConcentrix, his base salary was $300,000,  plus “Concentrix Incentive Plan” and “Long-\nTerm Incentive” pay s.  (Gabbard Decl. at ¶ 4).  During his last five years of employment,  \nDaoust averaged $89,097 and $75,040 of each incentive pay, respectively.  (Id.)  \n \n4 Jennifer Gabbard is the Director of Compensation of Concentrix CVG Corporation.  Gabbard \nsubmitted a declaration and attachments in support of Concentrix’s motion for preliminary \ninjunction  (Doc. 24- 1, 24- 2, and 24- 3). \n \n5 Cormac Twomey is the Executive Vice- President – Global Operations and Service Delivery for \nConcentrix UK Ltd.  Twomey submitted a declaration in support of Concentrix’s motion for prelimina ry injunction  (Doc. 25- 1).  The Twomey Declaration was originally attached to \nConcentrix’s Reply (Doc. 24- 2).  However, the manner and formatting in which the declaration \nwas filed cut off lines of text at the bottom of each page.  ( Compare  Doc. 24- 2 with  Doc. 25- 1).  \nConcentrix then re -filed a reformatted version (Doc. 25- 1), which the Court considers for the \npurposes of this Order.  Case: 1:21-cv-00131-TSB Doc #: 27 Filed: 05/03/21 Page: 7 of 35  PAGEID #: <pageID>8 Daoust’s role at Concentrix included managing relationships with employees and \noverseeing Concentrix’s call-centers.  (Twomey Decl. at ¶ 10; Doc. 14 at ¶ 25).  Daoust \nserved clients in the digital economy and supervised Concentrix’s services to its clients.  \n(Twomey Decl. at ¶ 15).  At the time of his resignation, he was working (remotely and in-\nperson) on an assignment in the Philippines.  (Twomey Decl. at ¶ 11; Doc. 14 at ¶ 25).  \niii. The Business of Concentrix and TaskUs  \nConcentrix provides outsourced customer-service management, call- center \noperations, and general business- process management (“BPM”), or business-process \noutsourcing (“BPO”) services to its customers .  (Twomey Decl. at ¶ 2).  Concentrix \nserves between 450 and 600 customers, including technology, innovation, and digital \neconomy companies.  ( Id.)  Concentrix operates world-wide.  (Id. at 4).  Concentrix’s \nservices includes traditional voice-support services, as well as non- traditional voice \nsupport services, such as digital customer- experience support and artificial intelligence \noperations.  (Id. ¶ 15).  \nOne-quarter of Concentrix’s $500 billion  annual revenue is derived from its \noperations in the Philippines, including call-centers.  (Id. at ¶ 6).  According to Twomey, \nTaskUs is a “younger and smaller” company, but a growing competitor and the two \ncompanies often compete for the same clients and same work.  (Id . at ¶¶ 12 –13).  TaskUs \nnow lists the Philippines as one of its prime locations, and TaskUs has opened at least \ntwo new call -centers in the Philippines within the past few months.  (Id . at ¶ 14).  \n“Within the last few weeks” of Twomey’s April 16, 2021 Declaration, Concentrix \nwas awarded , over TaskUs, a contract to perform content- moderation and content-Case: 1:21-cv-00131-TSB Doc #: 27 Filed: 05/03/21 Page: 8 of 35  PAGEID #: <pageID>9 security services for a major digital economy company.  ( Id. at ¶ 24).  And, four days \nafter TaskUs lost that contract, TaskUs offered a job to another Concentrix employee, a \nDirector of Recruitment.  (Id.)  \n2. Daoust’s Evidence  \ni. Careers  at Concentrix and TaskUs  \nAs Senior Vice-President – Operations for Concentrix, Daoust would be assigned \nto a specific account or region to oversee an assignment, often across the globe.  ( Doc. \n22-1, the “Daoust Decl.,” at ¶  3).  During his last year with Concentrix, Daoust was \nassigned to the Philippines, and his primary job responsibilities included managing Concentrix’s call centers in that specific area.  (Id. at ¶ 5).  Daoust returned  all \nConcentrix equipment and materials, including his work laptop, access card, and cut-up \ncorporate credit card prior to his last day of employment.  (Id. at ¶ 10). \nDaoust began working at TaskUs on January 18, 2021 as Chief Operating Officer.  \n(Id. at ¶ 1 ).  Daoust viewed the career change as a potential for advancement, given he \nwas confined to specific regions at Concentrix and the TaskUs role is much broader.  (Id. \nat ¶ 8).  In Daoust’s  role as Chief Operating Officer of TaskUs, Daoust oversees TaskUs’ \ncompany-wide, world- wide operati ons, including customer experience support, content \nsecurity, and artificial intelligence operations services.  (Rosner Decl. at ¶ 14; Daoust \nDecl. at ¶ 17 ).\n6  In this role, “Daoust is expected to rely on his extensive experience and \n \n6 Brandy Rosner  is the Vice President of People Operations of TaskUs .  Rosner submitted a \ndeclaration and attachments in support of Concentrix’s motion for preliminary injunction  (Doc. \n22-2). Case: 1:21-cv-00131-TSB Doc #: 27 Filed: 05/03/21 Page: 9 of 35  PAGEID #: <pageID>10 knowledge of the general customer service industry to employ effective operational \ntechniques and methods.”  (Rosner Decl. at ¶ 14).   \nWhen Daoust began working for TaskUs, he was  explicitly instructed not to copy, \nreplicate, share, transmit, or otherwise reveal any confidential or trade secret Concentrix \ninformation.  (Id. at ¶ 10).  Daoust declares he has not done as such.  (Daoust Decl. at  \n¶ 12).  Moreover, TaskUs has explicitly instructed  Daoust not to solicit any Concentrix \ncustomers or employees.  (Rosner Decl. at ¶¶ 11–13).  Daoust declares (swears) that he \nhas not done so.  (Daoust Decl. at ¶¶ 13–14).  \n3. Business of TaskUs and Concentrix  \nTaskUs is a service- oriented company, providing BPO services to  customers.  \n(Rosner Decl. at ¶ 2).  TaskUs serves high-growth technology companies, including start-\nups, to represent, protect, and grow their brands.  (Id. at ¶ 4).  TaskUs achieves this by \noffering digital outsourcing services, such as digital customer experience, content \nsecurity, and artificial intelligence operations.  (Id. at ¶ 3).   \nConcentrix and TaskUs are admittedly in the same BPO  industry, but, according to \nRosner, each company’s primary services a nd customers are not the same.  (Id. at ¶ 15).  \nTaskUs’ primary focus is non-traditional voice support services, and this is different than \nConcentrix’s traditional voice support services.  (Daoust Decl. at ¶ 17). \nTaskUs has hired, from Concentrix, at leas t 15 individuals, director level and \nabove, and eight of whom are sales and customer-facing.  (Rosner Decl. at ¶ 9).  Daoust \nis the first employee about whom Concentrix has raised a concern regarding confidential \nor trade secret information.  (Id.)  Case: 1:21-cv-00131-TSB Doc #: 27 Filed: 05/03/21 Page: 10 of 35  PAGEID #: <pageID>11 II. MOTION TO STRIKE  \n Daoust moved to strike all of the evidence attached to Concentrix’s reply in \nsupport, which includes (1) the Gabbard Declaration, and Stock- Option Agreements \nattached  (Docs. 24-1, 24 -2, and 24 -3); and (2) the Twomey Declaration (Doc. 25- 1).  \n(Doc. 26).  The Court already denied this motion.  (4/22/2021 Notation Order).  \nHowever, the Court provides a more detail ed analysis of its decision here.  \nA. Gabbard Declaration and Attachments  \nDaoust contends that the Gabbard Declaration and attachments are improperly \nsubmitted for the first time on reply in violation of Local Rule 7.2(d).  (Doc. 26 at 2–4). \nDaoust also contends that the Gabbard Declaration and attachments should be stricken as \nmisleading based on Federal  Rule of Evidence 403, because the documents create more \nconfusion than clarity as to the which NCA applies.  (Doc. 26 at 6).  \nLocal Rule 7.2(d) provides that “all evidence then available shall be discussed in, \nand submitted no later than, the primary memorandum of the party relying upon such \nevidence.  Evidence used to support a reply memorandum shall be limited to that needed \nto rebut the positions argued in memoranda in opposition.”  S.D. Ohio Civ. R. 7.2(d) \n(emphasis added).  \nThe Court finds that the Gabbard Declaration and attachments were submitted to \nrebut the positions taken by Daoust in his memorandum in opposition and that the \ndocuments are not misleading.  \nIn his opposition,  Daoust raises several issues regarding the authenticity of the \nNCA.  (Doc. 22 at 10–13).  Daoust argues  that the NCA attached to the Amended Case: 1:21-cv-00131-TSB Doc #: 27 Filed: 05/03/21 Page: 11 of 35  PAGEID #: <pageID>12 Complaint (Doc. 14-1) was not the same NCA that was attached to the December 23 \nletter from Concentrix which put TaskUs on notice of Daoust’s alleged violation of the \nNCA.  (Doc. 22-1 at Ex. A.1).  When comparing the two documents, Daoust points to \ndifferences in the two NCAs, including the inconsistent pagination, the page number of \nDaoust’s signature, the different definition of “Competitor,” the different footers, and the \ndifferent intellectual property provisions.  Because of these “oddities,” Daoust objected  to \nthe use of any NCA to award injunctive relief.  (Doc. 26)  Thus, because there is no \nNCA, Daoust contends Concentrix cannot succeed on the merits.  (Doc. 22 at 10 –13).  \nThe Gabbard Declaration helps resolve these “oddities.”  Concentrix  filed and \nattached an  NCA signed by Daoust, albeit an incomplete document, to the Amended \nComplaint and December 23 letter.  Most of Daoust’s issues raised in his opposition over \nthe NCA –  page numbers, footers, etc. – are resolved by the Gabbard Decoration and \nattachments.  The Gabbard Declaration and attachments are more helpful than misleading or confusing.  And, although including the full version of  the Stock- Option Agreements \nat the onset, instead of cherry-picking the NCA portions of the Agreements, would have \navoided this briefing, failing to consider and striking these documents would not serve \njustice.  \nAccordingly, the motion to strike (Doc. 26) the Gabbard Declaration and \nattachments (Docs. 24- 1, 24-2, and 24-3) is DENIED.  \nB. Twomey Declaration  \nDaoust also contends that the Twomey Declaration is improperly submitted for the \nfirst time on reply in violation of Local Rule 7.2(d).  (Doc. 26 at 2 –4).  However, as with Case: 1:21-cv-00131-TSB Doc #: 27 Filed: 05/03/21 Page: 12 of 35  PAGEID #: <pageID>13 the Gabbard Declaration, the Twomey Declaration rebuts the positions taken by Daoust \nin his opposition.  In Concentrix’s Amended Complaint, Concentrix alleged that \nConcentrix and TaskUs are competitors, describing each company’s business.  (Doc. 14 at ¶ 39).  This is verified twice in the pleadings by Jason Murphy, Global Vice-President \n– Legal for Concentrix CVG Corporation.  (Doc. 14-2; Doc. 15-1).  In his response in \nopposition to the motion for preliminary injunction, Daoust contests whether Concentrix \nand TaskUs are competitors, and presents testimony that the two are not competitors.  (Doc. 22 at 19–20; Daoust Decl. at ¶¶ 2, 17 –18; Rosner Decl. at ¶¶ 3– 4, 14–15).  The \nTwomey Declaration rebuts these arguments; moreover, the Court declines to the strike the declaration as untimely.  \nDaoust then contends that certain paragraphs in the Twomey Declaration should \nbe stricken for lack of foundation and/or inadmissible hearsay.  (Doc. 26-5).  Fed. R. \nEvid. 602, 802.  Specifically, he requests t hat Paragraphs 12–14, 16– 20, and 24 should be \nstricken.  In sum, these paragraphs describe Twomey’s knowledge of the BPO industry and how Concentrix and TaskUs are competitors (¶¶ 12– 14); Twomey’s knowledge of \nthe alleged confidential information in Daoust’s possession (¶¶ 16–20); and a recent \nexample of Concentrix and TaskUs competing for the same client (¶ 24).  \nPreliminary injunctions are governed by less strict rules of evidence:\n7 \n \n7 It may very -well be appropriate to consider  a preliminary  injunction proceeding as one of the  \n“miscellaneous proceedings” to which the Federal Rules of Evidence do not apply.  Fed. R. Evid. \n1101(d) (exceptions to the Rules).  Although the specific “exceptions” listed in that Rule relate to criminal proceedings ( e.g., grand- jury proceedings, issuing an arrest warrant, preliminary \nexamination in a criminal case), many concern the prelimin ary stages  of those proceedings . Case: 1:21-cv-00131-TSB Doc #: 27 Filed: 05/03/21 Page: 13 of 35  PAGEID #: <pageID>14 The purpose of a preliminary injunction is merely to preserve \nthe relative positions of the parties until a trial on the merits \ncan be held.  Given this limited purpose, and given the haste \nthat is often necessary if those positions are to be preserved, a \npreliminary injunction is customarily granted on the basis of \nprocedures that are less formal and evidence that is less \ncomplete than in a trial on the merits.  \n Univ. of Tex. v. Camenisch, 451 U.S. 390, 395 (1981); compare Fed. R. Civ. P. 56 \n(requiring affidavits supporting summary judgment to be “made on personal knowledge, \n[and to] set out facts that would be admissible in evidence”), with Fed. R. Civ. P. 65 \n(providing no such requirement in the preliminary injunction context). \nMoreover, with regards to hearsay, the Sixth Circuit has not explicitly stated \nwhether hearsay evidence should not be considered in the context of a preliminary \ninjunction.  In re DeLorean Motor Co., 755 F.2d 1223, 1230 n.4 (6th Cir.1985) (“The \nparties assume that the Federal Rules of Evidence are fully applicable to a hearing on a \nmotion for preliminary injunction. We express no opinion on this question.”).  “This \nCourt, however, and other district courts within this circuit have considered such \nevidence, as have numerous other circuit courts,” and accord ed weight to evidence even \nproperly cha racterized as hearsay at the preliminary injunction stage.  Damon’s \nRestaurants, Inc. v. Eileen K Inc., 461 F. Supp. 2d 607, 620 (S.D. Ohio 2006) (collecting \ncases).  \nThus, considering the case law, at a minimum, it is appropriate for the Court to \naccord weight to the Twomey Declaration, even assuming it would not be admissible \nevidence at trial.  However, the Twomey Declaration survives evidentiary scrutiny.  Case: 1:21-cv-00131-TSB Doc #: 27 Filed: 05/03/21 Page: 14 of 35  PAGEID #: <pageID>15 First, the Twomey Declaration lays sufficient foundation.   Twomey has been  the \nExecutive Vice-President – Global Operations and Service Delivery for Concentrix for \nmore than two years, and with Concentrix for the past seven.  (Twomey Decl. at ¶ 1).  He \nhas worked in the BPO industry for more than two decades and is familiar with industry \nkey players, market trends, and customer preferences.  (Id. at ¶ 2).  He consistently \ntestifies to his knowledge of the industry.  (See, e.g., id. at ¶ 12 (“from my years of \nexperience in the BMP/BPO industry”); ¶ 13 (“the best of my knowledge from my years \nin the BMP/BPO industry”)).  If Twomey’s experience in the industry does not lay the \nfoundation for industry knowledge, it is difficult to imagine what person in the \nBMP/BPO industry could testify about his or her knowledge of that industry.  \nMoreover, Twomey lays the foundation for his statements regarding Daoust. \nTwomey and Daoust worked together since 2014.  (Id. at ¶ 9).  Daoust was Twomey’s \ndirect report on two different occasions, including Daoust’s most recent role with \nConcentrix overseeing the Philippine call- centers .  (Id.)  Twomey and Daoust spoke \nformally at least three to five times a week, and informally at other times.  (Id.)  With this \nbackground, Twomey laid the foundation related to his work with Daoust, and in his \nperspective, what information Dao ust would know about Concentrix’s business and \noperations.  Thus, even under strict  evidentiary standards , and notwithstanding the less-\nstringent evidentiary standards considered during a motion for preliminary injunction, \nTwomey’s declaration lays the necessary foundation.  \nAs to hearsay, the paragraphs Daoust seeks to strike are not properly characterized \nas hearsay.  Hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter Case: 1:21-cv-00131-TSB Doc #: 27 Filed: 05/03/21 Page: 15 of 35  PAGEID #: <pageID>16 asserted.  Fed. R. Evid. 801.  The statements made by Twomey are not out of court \nstatements.  Moreover, the statements are made in a declaration, before this Court, based \non Twomey’s personal knowledge of the BPO industry, his work at Concentrix, and his \nwork with Daoust.   Daoust’s objections to the Twomey Declaration are not well-taken.  \n Accordingly, the motion to strike (Doc. 26) the Twomey Declaration (Doc. 25-1) \nwas and is DENIED.  \nIII.  MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUCTION  \nPlaintiff bears the heavy burden of demonstrating its entitlement to injunctive \nrelief.  An “injunction is an extraordinary remedy which should be granted only if the movant carries his or her burden of proving that the circumstances clearly  demand it.” \nOverstreet v. Lexington -Fayette Ur ban Cty. Gov’t, 305 F.3d 566, 573 (6th Cir. 2002) \n(emphasis added).  \nIn determining whether to grant injunctive relief, this Court must weigh four \nfactors: (1) whether the moving party has shown a strong likelihood of success on the \nmerits; (2) whether the moving party will suffer irreparable harm if the injunction is not \nissued; (3) whether the issuance of the injunction would cause substantial harm to others; \nand (4) whether the public interest would be served by issuing the injunction.  Hall v. \nEdgewood Partners Ins. Ctr., Inc., 878 F.3d 524, 526–27 (6th Cir. 2017).  These four \nconsiderations are factors that must be balanced, not prerequisites that must be met.  \nMcPherson v. Mich. High Sch. Athletic Ass’n, Inc., 119 F.3d 453, 459 (6th Cir. 1997). \n“Although no one factor is controlling, a finding that there is simply no likelihood of Case: 1:21-cv-00131-TSB Doc #: 27 Filed: 05/03/21 Page: 16 of 35  PAGEID #: <pageID>17 success on the merits is usually fatal.”  Gonzales v. Nat’l Bd. of Med. Exam’rs, 225 F.3d \n620, 625 (6th Cir. 2000). \nIII.  ANALYSIS  \nA. Likelihood of Success  \nThe first preliminary injunction factor is whether Plaintiff has established a strong \nlikelihood of success on the merits.  To establish a strong likelihood of success on the merits, a pl aintiff  “is not required to prove [its] case in full.”  Univ. of Tex., 451 U.S. at  \n395.  However, a plaintiff “must show more than a mere possibility of success.”  Six \nClinics Holding Corp., II v. Cafcomp Sys., Inc. , 119 F.3d 393, 402 (6th Cir. 1997).  In \nthis case, Concentrix alleges two claims against Daoust for breach of contract related to the NCA and misappropriation of trade secrets .  The Court considers each in turn.  \n1. Breach of Contract (NCA)  \nUnder Ohio law, to succeed on a breach of contract claim, a plaintiff must show \n(1) that a contract existed, (2) that the plaintiff fulfilled his contractual obligations, (3) that the defendant failed to fulfill his contractual obligations, and (4) that the plaintiff incurred damages as a result of the defendant’s failure.  Langfan v. Carlton Gardens Co., \n916 N.E.2d 1079, 1087 (Ohio Ct. App. 2009).  \nIn response to Concentrix’s motion, Daoust challenges the first and third elements.  \n(Doc. 22).  Particularly, Daoust challenges: (1) the authenticity of any NCA; (2) if there \nis a valid NCA, the enforceability of the NCA; and (3) if there is an enforceable NCA, \nany actual breach by Daoust.  (Id.)  Daoust contends that these issues over authenticity, Case: 1:21-cv-00131-TSB Doc #: 27 Filed: 05/03/21 Page: 17 of 35  PAGEID #: <pageID>31 v. Newman , Case No. 1:16-cv -734, 2016 WL 4449641, at *4 (S.D. Ohio Aug. 24, 2016) \n(citing Proctor & Gamble Co. v. Stoneham, 747 N.E.2d 268, 279 (Ohio Ct. App. 2000)).  \nIn this case, Concentrix has not carried its heavy burden of showing a likelihood \nof success on the merits of its trade secret claim.  Concentrix, in its first time on  reply, \nlists five categories of trade secret information that it is seeking to protect: (1) material \nterms of its contracts with clients; (2) the way Concentrix operates and manages its call-\ncenter; (3) knowledge of particular employees’ relationships with clients; (4) historical \n(and current) performance under the contracts; and (5) the identities of Concentrix’s \nclients.  (Doc. 24 at 16 –17).  Concentrix contends that “[t] hese are items of information, \nprocesses, and procedures developed over many years by Convergys and Concentrix that derive independent economic value from not being known to co mpetitors and which are \nthe subjects of reasonable efforts to keep them secret.”  (Id . at 17).  \nFirst, Concentrix fails to demonstrate at this stage in the proceedings the existence \nof trade secret information.  Concentrix argues that it has taken steps to protects its purported trade secrets, such as having its employees sign NCAs, and restricting access to \nand within its facilities.  (Doc. 7 at 12).  Concentrix argues that the identity of clients is \nso secret that clients are often referred to as code names only.  (Twomey Decl. at ¶ 17).  \nHowever, as TaskUs readily admits and Concentrix acknowledges, TaskUs has \nhired at least 15 former Concentrix employees in the last four years, all at director level \nand above, and at least eight of which were in sales roles and client-facing.  (Rosner \nDecl. at ¶ 9; Doc. 24 at 2).  And, Concentrix did not raise trade secret claims or seek to \nenforce NCAs with those employees.  (Rosner Decl. at ¶ 9).  Thus, the Court cannot say Case: 1:21-cv-00131-TSB Doc #: 27 Filed: 05/03/21 Page: 31 of 35  PAGEID #: <pageID>32 at this juncture that Concentrix has taken the necessary steps to protect its purported, \nclient-related trade secret information, such as the identity of clients, employee \nrelationships with clients, and terms of contracts with clients.  \nConcentrix also contends that the manner it operates its call -centers is trade secret \ninformation.  Yet, as discussed, there is no evidence to suggest that the manner Concentrix operates is call-centers is unique in the industry.  At most, Concentrix \nprovides the Twomey Declaration, which states that the manner Concentrix organizes and \nmanages its call-center teams allow s it to process large volumes of customers in a very \nefficient manner.  (Twomey Decl. at ¶ 19).  And, although operational efficiency is likely \nimportant to Concentrix when successfully running its business, the Court cannot say at \nthis preliminary stage that Concentrix has carried its burden of showing that this is trade \nsecret information.\n9 \nAccordingly, Concentrix has not demonstrated a likelihood of success on the \nmerits on its misappropriation of trade secret claim or its breach of contract claim.  The \nfirst element weighs against an injunction.  \nB. Irreparable Harm  \nThe second preliminary injunction factor is whether the moving party will suffer \nirreparable harm if the injunction is not issued.  To demonstrate irreparable harm, the \nplaintiff must show that it will suffer harm that is “actual and imminent” rather than \n \n9 It is unnecessary for the Court to consider the inevitable disclosure doctrine, finding that \nConcentrix has not carried its burden of demonstrating a strong likelihood of success on the \nexistence of trade secrets.  Case: 1:21-cv-00131-TSB Doc #: 27 Filed: 05/03/21 Page: 32 of 35  PAGEID #: <pageID>33 “speculative or unsubstantiated.”  Abney v. Amgen, Inc., 443 F.3d 540, 552 (6th Cir. \n2006).  Harm is not irreparable if it is fully compensable by monetary damages. \nBasicomputer, 973 F.2d at  511.  “Although no one factor is controlling, a finding that \nthere is simply no likelihood of success on the merits is usually fatal.”  Gonzales , 225 \nF.3d at 625.  \nConcentrix has not shown irreparable harm.  Concentrix argues that it will suffer \nirreparable harm because Daoust will inevitably take its confidential and trade secret information to TaskUs, and use that information at TaskUs to Concentrix’s detriment.  \nHowever, as already discussed, the Court is not convinced that Concentrix is likely to \nsucceed on the merits of its claims.  \nMoreover, the “harm” Concentrix alleges seems more speculative or \nunsubstantiated than actual and imminent.  Four months have elapsed between Daoust’s \nstart of employment with TaskUs and Concentrix’s reply brief in support of its motion for preliminary injunction.  The Court considered all evidence attached to the reply in the \nface of Daoust’s objections and motion to strike the evidence.  In that reply and evidence in support, Concentrix suggests speculative harm – that Daoust must be using its \npurportedly confidential and trade secret information.  But, Concentrix cites no actual or imminent risk of harm, such as a customer leaving or threatening to leave Concentrix for \nTaskUs, since Daoust started working for TaskUs.  \nTherefore, the second element of the injunction test weighs against issuing a \npreliminary injunction.  Case: 1:21-cv-00131-TSB Doc #: 27 Filed: 05/03/21 Page: 33 of 35  PAGEID #: <pageID>34 C. Harm to Others  \nThe third preliminary injunction factor is whether granting the injunction would \ncause harm to others.  “The irreparable injury [the plaintiff] will suffer if [its] motion for \ninjunctive relief is denied must be balanced against any harm which will be suffered by \n[others] as a result of the granting of injunctive relief.”  Martin-M arietta Corp. v. Bendix \nCorp., 690 F.2d 558, 568 (6th Cir. 1982).   If injunctive relief were granted, the parties \nharmed would be Defendant Daoust and non- party TaskUs.  This harm would be of \nDaoust and TaskUs’ own making, given Daoust signed the NCA and TaskUs proceeded \nwith employing Daoust, even once it knew of the NCA.   \nThe third element of the injunction test does not weigh against issuing a \npreliminary injunction.  \nD. Public Interest  \nThe final preliminary injunction factor is whether granting the injunction would \nharm the public interest.  Under Ohio law, “[p]reserving the sanctity of contractual relations and preventing unfair competition have traditionally been in the public interest.”  Total Quality Logistics, LLC v. OTC Logistics LLC, No. 1:19- CV-151, 2019 WL \n1300223, at *5 (S.D. Ohio Mar. 21, 2019)  (quoting UZ Eng’red Prods. Co. v. Midwest \nMotor Supply Co., Inc., 770 N.E.2d 1608, 1081 (Ohio Ct. App. 2001)).  However, there is \nalso an interest in “not restricting employment opportunities for employees.” Convergys, \n2007 WL 4248202.  Based on the foregoing, this element does not weigh in favor nor \nagainst a preliminary injunction.  Case: 1:21-cv-00131-TSB Doc #: 27 Filed: 05/03/21 Page: 34 of 35  PAGEID #: <pageID>35 In balancing the four factors pertaining to injunctive relief, the Court finds \nConcentrix has not carried it heavy burden of establishing that it is entitled to the \nextraordinary relief it seeks. \nHowever, when reaching this conclusion, the Court reiterates its finding that the \nNCA is a valid agreement between Daoust and Concentrix, even if  the covenant not to \ncompete provision appears unreasonable.  Although Daoust may continue his employment with TaskUs, in accordance with the NCA, Daoust shall continue not to \nsolicit or attempt to solicit any of Concentrix’s customers known to Daoust; solicit or attempt to solicit any of Concentrix’s employees; or provide any actual, Concentrix trade secret information in his possession with TaskUs.  (Daoust Decl. at ¶¶ 12–15).  \nIV. CON\nCLUSION\nBased upon the foregoing, Plaintiff’s motion for preliminary injunction (Doc. 7) is \nDENIED.  \nIT IS SO ORDERED. \nDate:  \nTimothy S. Black  \nUnited States District Judge  5/3/2021 s/Timothy S. BlackCase: 1:21-cv-00131-TSB Doc #: 27 Filed: 05/03/21 Page: 35 of 35  PAGEID #: <pageID>",

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: The court granted the plaintiffs leave to amend their complaint against Databricks and Mosaic ML. The plaintiffs, a group of authors, claim copyright infringement because Mosaic ML's large language models (LLMs), including newly released DBRX models from Databricks, were allegedly trained using datasets containing their works. The case involves AI as the plaintiffs argue that AI models were unlawfully trained on copyrighted material.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: The legal issue posited in this case is whether the training of large language models (LLMs) using datasets that allegedly include copyrighted works constitutes copyright infringement, thereby justifying the addition of a direct infringement claim against the defendant.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court granted the plaintiffs' motion to amend their complaint. The court allowed them to add a direct infringement claim against Databricks concerning their new LLMs (DBRX models). The court also permitted an update to the list of allegedly infringed works, despite the concerns regarding undue delay, as the delay alone did not justify denying the amendment.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine you drew a really cool picture, and you found out that some robots learned how to draw by looking at your picture without asking you first. The court is saying that you are allowed to change your complaint to officially say that these new robots might have looked at your picture too. The person in charge is saying, \"Yes, you can update your complaint to include these new robots because it seems fair to look into this, even though it's a bit late in the game.\"",

Plaintiffs initially alleged that Mosaic  ML \ntrained some of its LLMs, the MPT  models , using a dataset that contained some of their \nworks.  Now they seek leave to amend their complaint (1)  to add a direct infringement \nclaim against Databricks based on Databrick’s new LLMs, the DBRX models, and (2)  to \nupdate their list of infringed works.  The Court finds this matter suitable for resolution \nwithout argument pursuant to Civil Local Rule 7 -1(b) and GRANTS  Plaintiffs’ motion.  \nI. BACKGROUND  \nIn their initial complaints, filed in March and May 2024, Plaintiffs contended that \nMosaic ML infringed on their copyrighted works by training their MPT large language \nmodels on datasets that included their works.  O’Nan Compl. (dkt.  1) ¶ 23; Makkai Compl. \n(No. 24-cv-2653 dkt.  1) ¶ 22.  They therefore brought cla ims of direct infringement against \nMosaic ML.  O’Nan Compl. ¶¶  36–42; Makkai Compl. ¶¶  35–42.  Plaintiffs also brought \nvicarious liability claims against Databricks, the corporate parent of Mosaic M L.  O’Nan \nCompl. ¶¶  43–46; Makkai Compl. ¶¶  43–48. \nCase 3:24-cv-01451-CRB     Document 129     Filed 06/25/25     Page 1 of 6 \n2 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  In March 2024 —several weeks after Plaintiffs O’Nan, Nazemian, and Keene filed \ntheir complaint and over a month before Plaintiffs Makkai and Reynolds filed theirs —\nDatabricks released new LLMs, the DBRX models.  Proposed Am. Compl. (dkt.  124-2) \n¶ 39; Opp. (d kt. 126) at 3.  Around that time, Defendants’ employees made several \nstatements that Plaintiffs contend indicate that Defendants trained the DBRX models using \nthe same infringed works.  See Proposed Am. Compl. ¶¶  40–44.  Starting in March 2025, \nPlaintiffs started seeking discovery into the DBRX models, which Defendants opposed.  \nWakefield Decl. (dkt.  126-1) ¶ 6; Defs.’ Disc. Brief (dkt.  122).  Magistrate Judge Cisneros \nhas since  ruled that DBRX is relevant to the case as laid out in Plaintiffs’ original \ncomplaints.  See Disc. Order (dkt.  123) 1 \nPlaintiffs now move to amend their complaint to add a direct infringement claim \nagainst Databricks based on the DBRX models and to update the list of works that they \nallege that Defendants infringed.  See Proposed Am. Compl. ¶¶  49–56; Proposed Am. Ex. \nA (dkt.  124-4).  Plaintiffs filed their motion for leave on the deadline to do so; on that date, \nfour months remained in fact discovery, and eight months remained before the deadline for \nsummary judgment moti ons.  See Sched. Order (dkt.  111) at 1.  \nII. LEGAL STANDARD  \nBecause Defendants have filed an answer in this case and have not consented to \namendment, Plaintiffs may amend their complaint only with leave of the Court.  Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 15(a)(2).  Though courts “freely give leave when justice so requires,” id., factors \nsuch as “undue delay, bad faith or dilatory motive on the part of the movant, repeated \nfailure to cure deficiencies by amendments previously allowed, undue prejudice to the \nopposing party by virtue of the amendment, [and] futility of amendment” j ustify d enial of \nleave to amend.  Foman v. Davis , 371 U.S. 178, 182 (1962).  Of these factors, “the \nresulting prejudice to the opposing party” is the “crucial factor ,” Howey v. United States , \n481 F.2d 1187, 1190 (9th Cir. 1973) , while  “delay alone does not provide sufficient \n \n1 Defendants moved for relief from this discovery order.  See Mot. for Relief (dkt.  125).  \nThe motion has been deemed denied.  See Civ. L.R. 72 -2(d).  \nCase 3:24-cv-01451-CRB     Document 129     Filed 06/25/25     Page 2 of 6 \n3 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  grounds for denying leave to amend.”  United States v. Pend Oreille Pub. Util. Dist. No. 1 , \n926 F.2d 1502, 1511 (9th Cir. 1991) (cleaned up).  \nIII. DISCUSSION  \nDefendants contend that four factors weigh against granting leave to amend: undue \ndelay, bad faith, prejudice, and futility.  Though the Court acknowledges the substantial  \ndelay at issue here, the Court does not find that any other factor warrants denial of leave to \namend and accordingly grants Plaintiffs’ motion.  \nUndue Delay.   Plaintiffs moved for leave to amend their complaint fourteen months \nafter Databricks released the DBRX models and concomitantly made statements that could \nhave put Plaintiffs on notice that the DBRX models might have been trained on the same \nallegedly in fringing datasets that the MPT models were trained on.  That delay is without a \ndoubt significant.  For example, in AmerisourceBergen Corp. v. Dialysist West, Inc. , the \nNinth Circuit affirmed a district court’s denial of leave to amend when the  plaintiff had \ndelayed amendment by a similar period of fifteen months.  465 F.3d 946, 951 –54 (9th Cir. \n2006).  And Plaintiffs have not provided a satisfactory explanation for their delay.  Their \nsuggestions that the delay was exacerbated by Defendants’ re sistance to their discovery \nefforts into the DBRX models glosses over the fact that those discovery efforts began only \nin March 2025, and their concern about piecemeal amendments , see Reply (dkt.  128) at 2 –\n4, while fair enough in the abstract , does not justify over a year of delay  in this case . \nYet any delay must also be placed in context.  The parties are still in the midst of \ndiscovery, with several months left to go.  See Sched. Order  at 1.  That differentiates  this \ncase from others in which courts have held that undue delay warrants denial of leave to \namend.  See Texaco Inc. v. Ponsoldt , 939 F.2d 794, 799 (9th Cir. 1991) (denial of leave to \namend proper when plaintiffs sought to amend eight months after the court’s summary \njudgment ruling); Johnson v. Hewlett -Packard Co. , 809 F. Supp. 2d 1114,  1120 –21 (N.D. \nCal. 2011) (denying leave to file fourth amended complaint after summary judgment).  \nAnd though late, Plaintiffs’ motion for leave to amend fell within the time limits that the \nparties expressly contemplated in their scheduling order.  See Sched. Order at 1.  Case 3:24-cv-01451-CRB     Document 129     Filed 06/25/25     Page 3 of 6 \n4 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  In any case, delay alone is insufficient to deny leave to amend, see Pend Oreille , \n926 F.2d at 1511, so the Court turns to  consider the remaining Foman  factors.  \nBad Faith.   Defendants raise two arguments as to why Plaintiffs’ motion for leave \nto amend should be taken in bad faith.  Neither favors denial of leave to amend, though.  \nFirst, Defendants suggest that Plaintiffs’ delay itself is evidence of bad faith.  Opp. \nat 8 (“Courts find bad faith sufficient to deny leave to amend where the moving party \nengages in dilatory tactics, such as waiting months to move to amend a complaint.”).  But \nthe case they cite, Cabrera v. Residential Credit Solutions Inc. , involved a plaintiff who \nhad a demonstrated “history of dilatory tactics.”  No.  CV 14 -9212 DMG, 2015 WL \n13916231, at *7 (C.D. Cal. Sept. 10, 2015)  (citation omitted) .  They have not established \nsuch a history of delay on Plaintiffs’ part, and delay alone generally does not give rise to \nan inference of bad faith.  See Naranjo v. Bank of Am. Nat’l Ass’n , No.  14-cv-2748 -LHK, \n2015 WL 913031, at *6 –7 (N.D. Cal. Feb. 27, 2015).  \nSecond , Defendants argue that Plaintiffs made “misleading representations” in their \nmoving papers as to the basis for their amendment.  Opp. at 8.  The Court is not convinced  \nby Defendants’ assertion .  Plaintiffs seek to make two substantive amendments to their \ncomplaint: (1)  the addition of a direct infringement claim against Databricks based on the \nDBRX models and (2)  the addition of new allegedly infringing works.  See Proposed Am. \nCompl. ¶¶  49–56; Proposed Am. Ex. A.  The language that Defendants point to as evincing \nbad faith (for example, Plaintiffs’ statement that they want to update their complaint “to \nbetter reflect the evidence to date” and their repeated referen ces to “Defendants’ LLMs” \ngene rally) might be misleading if Plaintiffs had only sought the first amendment.  But \nPlaintiffs’ descriptions are accurate  given the full scope of their proposed amended \ncomplaint .  Moreover, Plaintiffs’ statements only carry a risk of confusion if the Court \nrejects their allegations that Databricks trained the DBRX models on Plaintiffs’ works; if \nthe Court accepts those allegations, even just at the pleading  stage, Plaintiffs’ statements \nare vague at worst.  This is certainly not grounds to find bad faith.  \n Case 3:24-cv-01451-CRB     Document 129     Filed 06/25/25     Page 4 of 6 \n5 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  Prejudice.   Defendants  bear the burden of showing that they will be prejudiced by \namendment.  DCD Programs, Ltd. v. Leighton , 833 F.2d 183, 187 (9th Cir. 1987).  They  \nassert that they will be prejudiced by Plaintiffs’ proposed amendment because it “will \nradically alter this case.”  Opp. at 9.  And t o be sure, if an amendment significantly \nchanges the “nature of the litigation,” it may result in prejudice.  Morongo Band of \nMission Indians v. Rose , 893 F.2d 1074, 1079 (9th Cir. 1990).  On the other hand, neither \n“the burden of hav ing to defend a new claim” nor “the prospect of additional discovery \nneeded by the non -moving party” constitutes a sufficient showing of prejudice to deny \namendment.  PNY Techs., Inc. v. SanDisk Corp. , No.  11-cv-4689 -WHO , 2014 WL \n294855, at *4 (N.D. Cal. Jan. 27, 2014) (citations omitted).  There is especially low risk of \nprejudice when discovery is still open.  Id. at *5; see also  Lockheed Martin Corp. v. \nNetwork Sols., Inc. , 194 F.3d 980, 986 (9th Cir. 1999) (“A need to reopen discovery and \ntherefore delay the proceedings supports a district court’s finding of prejudice.”).  \nDefendants’ conclusory assertions of prejudice do not demonstrate that they will, in \nfact, be prejudiced by amendment.  Discovery is still open and will remain so for several \nmonths .  The Court has already granted Plaintiffs’ request for discovery into the DBRX \nmodels, so Defendants are on notice as to what discovery will be necessary.  See Disc. \nOrder.   And to the extent that P laintiffs are correct that there is overlap between the MPT \nand DBRX models , any discovery into the DBRX models will not represent a radical shift \nin the nature or scope of discovery.   Defendants have not established prejudice, so this \nfactor does not weigh against amendment.  \nFutility.   Futility alone can be grounds to deny amendment.  Ahlmeyer v. Nev. Sys. \nof Higher Educ. , 555 F.3d 1051, 1055 (9th Cir. 2009).  But a s a general rule, courts “defer \nconsideration of challenges to the merits of a proposed amended pleading until after leave \nto amend is granted and the amended pleading is filed.”  Clarke v. Upton , 703 F. Supp. 2d \n1037, 1043 (E.D. Cal. 2010).  Accordingly, the bar for an amendment to be so futile that it \nwarrants denial of leave to amend is “if there is no set of fact s that can be proved under the \namendment that would constitute a valid claim.”  Id. Case 3:24-cv-01451-CRB     Document 129     Filed 06/25/25     Page 5 of 6 \n6 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  Defendants argue that the allegations as to the DBRX models in Plaintiffs’ proposed \namended complaint are largely conclusory and that any allegations of fact do not support \nan inference of copyright infringement.  Opp. at 11 –14.  Indeed, Defendants contras t \nPlaintiffs’ proposed allegations about the DBRX models (for example, the allegation that \n“Defendants have further made copies of Plaintiffs’ Works for use to train the DBRX \nmodels,” Proposed Am. Compl. ¶  49) with their more specific allegations about the  MPT \nmodels (for example, that the MPT models were trained using specific datasets, id. ¶¶ 27–\n37).  It may be that Plaintiffs’ DBRX -related allegations are too conclusory to state a \nclaim, but this is not one of the rare cases where it the proposed amendment is so clearly \nfutile that leave to amend should be denied.  Defendants can (and no doubt will) brief these \nissues more fully once Plaintiffs file their amended complaint.  \nIV.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: In a Northern District of California case between Loop AI Labs Inc. and Almawave USA, the court addresses a dispute over the breadth of topics included in a Rule 30(b)(6) deposition notice. Loop AI Labs objected to numerous topics, claiming they were excessively broad or infringed upon privileged information, among other reasons. The court granted some of Loop’s requests for a protective order while denying others, allowing Almawave to proceed with questioning on certain topics related to trade secret misappropriation and other allegations in the complaint. Notably, the case involves allegations concerning artificial intelligence technology developed by Loop AI, which is central to the claims of trade secrets and business competitive advantages.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether Almawave's Rule 30(b)(6) deposition notice topics were overly broad, unduly burdensome, or encroached upon privileged information and whether Loop AI should be required to provide testimony on those topics.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court granted Loop AI's motion for a protective order in part and denied it in part. It found most of the deposition topics reasonable and allowable, but it restricted topics that sought testimony irrelevant to the litigation and upheld some confidentiality concerns.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine a school project where one group of students has to explain how they created a secret talking robot to another group who claims they copied it. The teachers (judges) have to decide what questions the second group can ask about the robot. Some questions are okay because they help figure out if the first group shared secrets, but others are too personal or off-topic, so the teachers say no to those ones. The curious group of students is allowed to ask most questions, except a few that are too nosey.",

No. 336  \n \nThe court has received the joint discovery letter submitted by Plaintiff Loop AI Labs Inc. \n(“Loop”) and Defendant Almawave USA (“Almawave” ) in which Loop moves for a protective \norder regarding Almawave’s Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 30(b)(6) deposition notice to Loop.  \n[Docket No. 336 (Jt. Letter).]  The court finds this matter suitable for resolution without oral \nargument.  See Civ. L.R. 7 -1(b).  For the following reasons, Loop’s motion for a protective order \nis granted in part and denied in part.  \nThe p arties’ lamentable discovery conduct has consumed an unjustifiable amount of court \nresources.  [ See Docket No. 271; see also  Docket No. 415 (Feb. 5, 2016 Order by Hon. Haywood \nS. Gilliam).]  Their behavior has impeded the court’s ability to control  its docket and to provide \nprompt attention to the needs of litigants in other cases.  Accordingly, instead of providing the \nparties with a detailed (and time -consuming) analysis, the court makes these rulings in summary \nform.  \nI. DISCUSSION  \nLoop generally objects that Almawave’s 30(b)(6) deposition notice  contains 60 “extremely \nbroad and far reaching topics.”  While the notice does cover a large number of topics, the \noperative complaint is over 100 pages and contains lengthy, detailed allegations of wrongdoing by \nAlmawave and the other defendants.  Given the breadth of Loop’s allegations, the notice is not Case 4:15-cv-00798-HSG   Document 466   Filed 03/10/16   Page 1 of 6 \n2 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  overbroad or unduly burdensome on its face.   \nLoop also objects to several topics on specific grounds.  The court will address each group \nof obj ections  in turn . \nA. Objection to Topics “Beyond Loop AI’s Operation”  \nLoop objects to topic nos. 3 -15, 18 -22, 43, 47 -49, and 54 -55 on the ground that they are \nunrelated to Loop as a corporate entity  and are thus improper .  Jt. Letter at 3.   \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 30(b)(6) permits a party to name a corporation as a \ndeponent , and requires the noticing party to “describe with re asonable particularity the matters for \nexamination. ”  The persons designated by the named organization “ must testify about inf ormation \nknown or reasonably available to the organization. ”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 30(b)(6).   “The reason for \nadopting Rule 30(b)(6) was not to provide greater notice or protections to corporate deponents, but \nrather to have the right person present at depositi on.”  King v. Pratt & Whitney , 161 F.R.D. 475, \n476 (S.D. Fla. 1995).   \nThe court has examined the topics at issue and concludes that they are “describe[d] with \nreasonable particularity” and are permissible subjects on which Almawave may examine  a Loop \nrepresentative .  Loop’s  motion for a protective order on this basis is denied.  \nB. Objection to Topics Which “Improperly Seek Loop AI’s Roadmap of How It \nIntends to Prove Its [Case]”  \nTopic nos. 1, 3 -22, 45, 49, and 54 -56 seek the factual basis for specifi c allegat ions made in \nLoop’s second amended complaint .  Loop objects to these topics  on the grounds that they do not \nrelate to Loop’s operation of its business and seek “a complete roadmap of its lawyers[’] work -\nproduct information regarding the case.”  Jt. Letter at 3-4.  Topics which seek the factual basis for \nallegations are not improper, and are consistent with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure  11, which \nrequires that factual contentions in a pleading “have evidentiary support.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. \n11(b)(3).  Contrar y to Loop’s assertion, the topics at issue do not seek information about how \ncounsel will try Loop’s case.  Loop’ s motion for a protective order on these grounds is denied.  \nC. Objection to Topics “That Do Not Appear to Have Any Relation to the \nLitigation”  \nLoop objects to topic nos. 25, 26, 34, and 40, arguing that they are not related to any claim Case 4:15-cv-00798-HSG   Document 466   Filed 03/10/16   Page 2 of 6 \n3 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  and are therefore not calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.  Jt. Letter 4 -5.   \nTopic no. 25 is “[t]he acquisition of documents by Loop from Ele ttranova or Fabio \nFicano.”  Topic no. 26 is “[c]ommunications between Loop and Elettranova or Fabio Ficano.”  In \nresponse to Loop’s relevance objection, Almawave notes that Loop relied on documents obtained \nfrom Elettranova, Tony DiNapoli’s former employer , to support its March 2015 motion for a \ntemporary restraining order.  [Docket No. 28 -2 at 2 n.2.]  Topic no. 40 is “[a]ny employee, officer \nor director of Loop’s employment, consulting, or other work for monetary gain with any person or \nentity other than Loop, or its predecessor or related entity, from 2011 to present.”  Almawave \nargues that Loop’s complaint is based on its allegation that Defendant Gatti’s employment with \nAlmawave was improper, but Gatti contends that Loop’s contractual restriction on out side \nemployment was “routinely and openly disregarded by management.”  Jt. Letter at 5.  The court \nconcludes that topic nos. 25, 26, and 40 are tailored to relevant issues in this case and are thus \npermissible.   Loop’s motion for a protective order as to these three topics is denied.  \nAs to t opic no. 34 , which  is “[o]wnership of Loop stock,” Almawave made no argument \nregarding relevance , and t he relevance of this topic is not readily discernable.  Therefore, Loop’s \nmotion for a protective order as to topic no. 34 is granted.   It need not produce a witness to testify \non this topic.  \nD. Objection to Topics “Protected From Disclosure”  \nLoop objects to topic nos. 2, 24, and 57 on the ground that they seek information protected \nby the attorney -client privilege and the  attorney work -product doctrine.   Topic no. 2 is “[a]ny \ninvestigation Loop conducted into potential claims against, or potential wrongdoing of Almawave, \nbut not including potential claims against, or wrongdoing of Gatti or IQS, Inc.”  Topic no. 24 is \n“Loop ’s document preservation, collection and production.”  Topic no. 57 is “[a]ny non -privileged \ninvestigation conducted by Loop into alleged wrongdoing of Almawave, excluding Gatti.”  \nAs to topic nos. 2 and 57, Loop argues that  these topics are improper becaus e “work \nproduct or attorney client privilege so permeates the topic[s] that a breach of privilege will be \ninevitable.”  Jt. Letter at 5.  Regarding topic no. 24, Loop admits that some aspects of this topic \nmay be non -privileged, but that information regard ing “collection” and “production” “clearly Case 4:15-cv-00798-HSG   Document 466   Filed 03/10/16   Page 3 of 6 \n4 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  involves attorney communications and actions.”  Jt. Letter at 5 n.9.  Almawave responds that it \nseeks facts, not privileged or protected information.  \nA company cannot shield from discovery facts learned by an atto rney in the course of an \ninvestigation because the attorney -client privilege protects communications, not facts.  Upjohn Co. \nv. United States , 449 U.S. 383, 395 -96 (1981).  A Rule 30(b)(6) deponent’s role is “to provide the \nentity’ s interpretation of event s and documents.”  Kelley v. Provident Life & Accident Ins. Co.,  No. \n04cv807–AJB (BGS) , 2011 WL 2448276, at *2 (S.D.  Cal. June 20, 2011) (emphasis added) \n(citation omitted).  As such, “the designee must become educated  and gain the requested \nknowledge to t he extent reasonably available.”  Id. (citation omitted); see Int’l Ass’ n of Machinists \n& Aerospace Workers v. Werner –Matsuda,  390 F.  Supp.  2d 479, 487 (D.  Md. 2005) (“This means \nthat [d efendant] is obligated to produce  one or more  30(b)(6) witness es who [ are] thoroughly \neducated about the noticed deposition topics with respect to any and all facts known to [ defendant] \nor its counsel  . . . .” (citation omitted)).   While questions related to these three  noticed  topics could \nimplicate privileged communication s between Loop and its attorneys  or Loop’s counsel’s work \nproduct, the proper approach is for Loop’s counsel to make specific objections to specific \nquestions, not for the court to preclude these topics altogether  based on speculation about what \nquestions Almawave’s counsel may ask .  Loop’s motion for a protective order as to these three \ntopics is denied.  \nE. Objection to Topics “Requiring Expert Testimony”  \nLoop objects to topic nos. 28, 29, 37, and 39 as improper because they “require expert \nknowledge and test imony.”   Topic no. 28 is “Loop’s damages relating to the instant matter.”  \nTopic no. 29 is “[v]aluations of Loop.”  Topic no. 37 is “[t]he value to Loop and to Loop’s \ncompetitors of any trade secrets Loop alleges was misappropriated,” and topic no. 39 is “ [t]he ease \nor difficulty with which any trade secrets Loop alleges was misappropriated could be properly \nacquired or duplicated by others.”   Loop argues that it is not required to prepare a 30(b)(6) witness \non expert disclosures, since such disclosures are  not yet due under the case management order.   \nRule 30(b)(6) witnesses are not required to provide expert testimony, but “must testify \nabout information known or reasonably available to the organization.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 30(b)(6).  Case 4:15-cv-00798-HSG   Document 466   Filed 03/10/16   Page 4 of 6 \n5 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  The court finds that t hese topics do not impermissibly seek expert testimony.  Almawave is \nentitled to question Loop’s representative(s) about the factual information available to the \nrepresentative(s) underlying its claims for damages and trade secret misappropriation.  Loop’s  \nmotion for a protective order as to these topics is denied.  \nF. Objection to Topics which “Requir[e] a Lay Person to Make Legal \nConclusions”  \nLoop objects to topic nos. 35, 38, and 46 which it claims improperly “seek testimony on \nlegal conclusions,” including the “misappropriation of trade secrets.”  Jt. Letter 7.  \nTopic no. 35 is “[i]dentification of any trade secrets that Loop alleges was \nmisappropriated.”  Topic no. 38 is “[t]he amount of effort or money expended by Loop in \ndeveloping any trade secrets it all eges was misappropriated ,” and topic no. 46 is “Loop’s \ntechnology and business as described in paragraphs 3, 138, and 141 of the [second amended \ncomplaint].”1 \nAlmawave is entitled to question Loop’s representative(s ) about facts related to these three \ntopics.  To the extent that any particular question calls for a legal conclusion, Loop’s counsel may \ninterpose an objection .  Loop’s motion for a protective order as to these topics is denied.  \nG. Objection that Topics “Fail to Provide the Requisite Particularity”  \nFinally, Loop objects that “virtually all topics” included in the 30(b)(6) notice lack the \n“reasonable particularity” that the rule requires.  For example, topic nos. 27, 30, 31, and 32 use \nwords like profits, financial statements, and general financial p erformance “without clarification \nor direction.”  Jt. Letter at 7.   It argues that topic nos. 44, 50, and 59 are similarly overbroad.  Id. \nThe court finds that the disputed topics are sufficiently “particular” under Rule 30(b)( 6).  \nThe topics are not phrased so broadly or vaguely that Loop will be unable to prepare its \nrepresentative(s) to respond to questions on these subjects.   \nLoop’s motion for a protective order as to these topics is denied.  \n                                                 \n1 The specified paragraphs of the second amended complaint describe Loop’s proprietary artificial \nintelligence technology and “Digital Genome Platform” and “core technology.”  Case 4:15-cv-00798-HSG   Document 466   Filed 03/10/16   Page 5 of 6 \n6 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  II. CONCLUSION  \nLoop’s motion for a p rotective order is granted in part and denied in part.  The court directs \nthe parties to immediately confer regarding the prompt scheduling of Loop’s corporate \nrepresentative(s).  \nIT IS SO ORDERED.  \nDated: March 10, 2016  \n_____________________________________ _ \nDonna M.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: uSens, Inc. sought a preliminary injunction against its former consultant, Shi Chi, to prevent him from using or disclosing uSens’ confidential information and to compel the return of a Dell laptop and cell phone containing this information. The court denied the motion, stating that uSens did not sufficiently specify or prove the existence of trade secrets nor established its own legal ownership over the alleged confidential information, much of which was related to Hangzhou Linggan, a company not party to the action. The case involves AI/automation as uSens focuses on AI-based computer-vision tracking solutions for augmented and virtual reality products.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether uSens, Inc. met the legal standard for obtaining a preliminary injunction to protect purported trade secrets and confidential information related to AI-based technologies.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court denied the preliminary injunction because uSens failed to provide sufficient evidence to clearly identify trade secrets, demonstrate that the information met the statutory definition of trade secrets, and establish that it was the rightful owner of the alleged trade secrets.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: uSens, a company that makes cool AI-based VR and AR gadgets, wanted to stop one of its former workers from sharing their secret info and to get back some company gear. The court said \"no\" because uSens couldn't clearly show what secret info they were worried about, didn't prove the info was secret by legal standards, and it was unclear if the info even belonged to uSens or another related company not part of this case.",

No. 29 \n \nPlaintiff uSens, Inc. moves for a preliminar y injunction against Defendant Shi Chi, who \nwas formerly a consultant to Plaintiff.  EC F 29.  uSens seeks an injunction “(1) prohibiting \n[Defendant] from disclosing, copying , or using Plaintiff’s confidentia l information (defined as set \nforth in Provision 2 of the Consulting Agreemen t executed by the parties on July 22, 2013); and \n(2) demanding Defendant to immediately return Pl aintiff’s Dell laptop and cell phone that contain \nPlaintiff’s confidential information.”  Id. at 1.  Defendant opposes the motion.  ECF 32.  The \nCourt held a hearing on September 18, 2018. \nBased on a careful review of the parties’ s ubmissions, their arguments at the hearing, the \ncase file, and relevant law, the Court DENIES Pl aintiff’s motion for a preliminary injunction for \nthe reasons discussed at the he aring and as set forth below. \nI. FACTUAL BACKGROUND \nA. The parties \nPlaintiff uSens, Inc. is a company headquart ered in San Jose, Ca lifornia that “builds \nartificial intelligence-based computer-vision tr acking solutions for augmented and virtual reality \nproducts.”  ECF 1 at ¶ 7. \nDefendant Chi Shi worked for Plaintiff uSens as an independent contractor from July 22, \n2013 to December 27, 2017.   Id. at ¶ 8. Case 5:18-cv-01959-SVK   Document 39   Filed 10/11/18   Page 1 of 6 \n2 1 \n2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 \n10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 \n28 United States District Court \nNorthern District of Californi a During a portion of the time Defendant was wo rking as an independent contractor for \nPlaintiff uSens, he was also employed as Chie f Operating Officer for another company, Hangzhou \nLinggan.  Id. (stating that Defendant worked fo r Hangzhou Linggan from April 13, 2015 to \nDecember 27, 2017).  Hangzhou Linggan is not a part y to this action.  However, throughout its \nmotion, Plaintiff collectively refers to uS ens and Hangzhou Linggan as “the Company.”  See, e.g., \nECF 29 at 1; ECF 29-2 at ¶ 3.   \nB. The alleged trade secret misappropriation \nPlaintiff’s preliminary injunction motion focu ses on several instances  of alleged trade \nsecret misappropriation by Defenda nt.  First, Plaintiff claims  that Defendant obtained and \ndistributed a recording of a February internal  business meeting of Hangzhou Linggan.  ECF 29 at \n6; ECF 29-2 at ¶¶ 3-5, 13; ECF 29-2 at ¶ 3.  At the meeting, Anli He, the CEO of both Plaintiff \nand Hangzhou Linggan, “discussed various business topics and shared sensitive product technology with the employees, including product research and development progress, business \ndevelopment achievement, financial projection and ro admap of future projects.”  ECF 29-2 at ¶ 3.  \nToward the end of the meeting, she also “dis cussed various misconduct involving Defendant upon \ninquiries from a meeting attendee.”  Id.  Defendant admits that he circ ulated clips of a recording of \nthe February meeting, tota ling less than ten minutes, after rece iving an unsolicite d recording.  ECF \n32-1 at ¶ 10.  However, Defendant asserts that th e clips were sent only to  employees, independent \ncontractors/consultants, or i nvestors of the companies.  Id.  He also states that clips included only \nMs. He’s comments about Defendant and rebuttal comments.  Id. \nSecond, Plaintiff alleges in its motion\n1 that Guojin Chen, a former employee of Hangzhou \nLinggan, downloaded “the Company’s” source code  without authorization.  ECF 29 at 4-7; ECF \n29-2 at ¶¶ 7, 13.  More specificall y, Plaintiff claims that shortly after Mr. Chen’s departure from \nHangzhou Linggan, he used a company password and sy stem key to download source code for the \n“SLAM algorithm” between February 15, 2018 and February 25, 2018.  ECF 29-2 at ¶ 7.  According to Plaintiff, Mr. Chen was later arre sted by the Chinese police and allegedly confessed \n                                                 \n1 There are no allegations of misappropriation of source code in the Complaint.

ECF 29-2 at ¶ 13; ECF 29-3 at ¶ 14.   \nThird, Plaintiff claims that De fendant has failed to return  a “Company-issued” Dell laptop \nand cell phone.  ECF 29 at 7. II. LEGAL STANDARD \nA preliminary injunction is “an extraordin ary remedy that may only be awarded upon a \nclear showing that the plaintiff is entitled to such relief.”  Winter v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc. , \n555 U.S. 7, 22 (2008).  “The purpose of a preliminary injunction is merely to preserve the relative \npositions of the parties until a trial on the merits can be held.”  Univ. of Texas v. Camenisch , 451 \nU.S. 390, 395 (1981).  It “i s not a preliminary adjudi cation on the merits.”  Sierra On-Line, Inc. v. \nPhoenix Software, Inc. , 739 F.2d 1415, 1423 (9th Cir. 1984).  As  such, the Court does not make \nany binding findings of fact  but “only find[s] probab ilities that the necessary facts can be proved.”  \nId. \nThe traditional test for issuance of a preliminary injunction requires the plaintiff to \nestablish “that he is likely to succe ed on the merits, that he is like ly to suffer irreparable harm in \nthe absence of preliminary relief, that the balance of equities tips in his favor, and that an injunction is in the public interest.”  Winter , 555 U.S. at 20.  Under the alternative “sliding scale” \ntest, the elements of the preliminary injunction te st are balanced so that a preliminary injunction \nmay be granted where “the likelihoo d of success is such that serious  questions going to the merits \nwere raised and the balance of hardship s tips sharply in [plaintiff’s] favor.”  Alliance for the Wild \nRockies v. Cottrell,  632 F.3d 1127, 1131 (9th Cir. 2011) (quotation marks and citation omitted).  \nIn deciding whether to grant a preliminary injunction, the trial court has discretion to \nconsider inadmissible evidence “whe n to do so serves the purpose of preventing irreparable harm \nbefore trial.”  Flynt Distrib. Co., Inc. v. Harvey , 734 F.2d 1389, 1394 (9th Cir. 1984).  This rule \nrecognizes that “[t]he urgency of obtaining a preliminary injunction necessitates a prompt \ndetermination and makes it difficult to obtain affi davits from persons who would be competent to \ntestify at trial.”  Id. Case 5:18-cv-01959-SVK   Document 39   Filed 10/11/18   Page 3 of 6 \n4 1 \n2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 \n10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 \n28 United States District Court \nNorthern District of Californi a A. DISCUSSION \nPlaintiff uSens argues that it is entitled to a preliminary injunction because:  (1) “there are \nserious questions going to the merits of Plain tiff’s trade secret misappropriation claim”; and (2) \n“the balance of the hardships tips sharpl y in Plaintiff’s favor.”  ECF 29 at 6, 8.   Both prongs of \nPlaintiff’s argument lack suffici ent evidentiary support to demonstr ate the “probabil ities that the \nnecessary facts can be proved.”  See Sierra On-Lin e, 739 F.2d at 1423.   \nPlaintiff’s motion for preliminary injunction is premised on its trade secret claim.  A trade \nsecret is information that:  (1) derives independe nt economic value, actual  or potential, from not \nbeing generally known to the public or to other persons who can obtain economic value from its \ndisclosure or use; and (2 ) is the subject of reasonable measures to maintain its secrecy.  18 U.S.C. \n§ 1839(3); Cal. Civ. C. § 3426.1(d).  \nFirst, Plaintiff has not adequately identified the information it alleges are trade secrets.  See \nNational-Arnold Magnetics Co. v. Wood , 46 Fed. App’x 416, 420 (9th Cir. 2002) (affirming \ndistrict court’s finding th at plaintiff failed to establish like lihood of success on trade secret claim \nwhere plaintiff failed to establish or describe its trade secrets).  With respect to the February \nmeeting that was allegedly recorded and sent to  Defendant, Plaintiff st ates that the topics \ndiscussed included “various business topics” and “sensitive product technology” including \n“product research and development progress, business development ach ievement, financial \nprojection and roadmap of future projects.”  EC F 29-2 at ¶ 3.  Although it is possible that these \nbroad categories could include trad e secrets, Plaintiff has failed to provide facts that support its \nconclusion that the information di scussed constitutes a trade secret .  Similarly, although Plaintiff \nclaims that the “source codes for the SLAM al gorithm” that Mr. Chen allegedly downloaded are \n“fundamental to the Company’s augmented and vi rtual reality products” and “are regarded as \nhighly protected trade secrets of  the Company” (ECF 29-2 at ¶¶ 7-8), these assertions are too \ngeneral to establish that the sour ce code meets the legal definition of a trade secret.  With respect \nto the cell phone and laptop, Plaintiff argues that “[i]t is highly likely that  Defendant copied or \nsaved the Company’s confidential information on th e Dell laptop” and “it is very likely that the \nCompany-issued cell phone, currently possessed by Defendant, also contains the Company’s Case 5:18-cv-01959-SVK   Document 39   Filed 10/11/18   Page 4 of 6 \n5 1 \n2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 \n10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 \n28 United States District Court \nNorthern District of Californi a confidential information.”  ECF 29 at 7.  These assertions are speculativ e and do not adequately \nspecify the alleged trade secrets that are located on th e cell phone and laptop.  Plaintiff’s request \nthat the Court enjoin Defendant from “discl osing, copying, or using Pl aintiff’s confidential \ninformation (defined as set forth in Provisi on 2 of the Consulting Agreement executed by the \nparties on July 22, 2013” suffers from the same lack of specificity; an injunc tion must “describe in \nreasonable detail—and not by referring to the complaint or other document—the act or acts \nrestrained or required.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(d)(1)(C). \nSecond, Plaintiff has not demons trated that the information it contends are trade secrets \nmeet the statutory requirements for trade secret protection.  Plaintiff has not offered any evidence \nthat the information is not generally known, deri ves independent value from not being generally \nknown, or is the subject of reasonable efforts to maintain its secrecy.   \nThird, an even more fundamentally, Plaintiff has not shown that it is the owner of the \nalleged trade secrets.  Most of  the evidence submitted by Plaintiff in support of its motion for \npreliminary injunction does not relate directly to Plaintiff uSens but in stead relates to Hangzhou \nLinggan, which Plaintiff claims is “related” to uSens.  See ECF 1 at ¶ 1.  For example, uSens cites \nDefendant’s distribution of a r ecording of a February 8, 2018 internal business meeting held by \nHangzhou Linggan.  ECF 29-2 at ¶¶ 3-4.  Plaintiff also argues that it is  entitled to the return of a \nDell laptop and cell phone that were issued to Defendant, but the evidence submitted indicates these items were purchased by Hangz hou Linggan, not Plaintiff uSens.  See ECF 32-1 at ¶ 20; \nECF 33 at 9; ECF 33-3at  ¶¶ 3-6. \nHangzhou Linggan is not a party to this action.  Plaintiff has not esta blished, either as a \nmatter of law or fact, that Defendant’s alle ged interactions with non-party Hangzhou Linggan \nentitle Plaintiff to a obtain a preliminary injuncti on—particularly an injunc tion that would pertain \nto Defendant’s possession of information and items that allegedly belong to Hangzhou Linggan.  \nPlaintiff argues that it is related to Hangz hou Linggan and has submitted evidence that the \ncompanies share a Chief Executive Officer, Anli He.  ECF 29-2 at ¶ 1.  Plaintiff has also stated \nthat Hangzhou Linggan and uSens “have a para llel corporate stru cture and under common \ncontrol,” with Hangzhou Linggan conducting busine ss in China and uSens conducting “the exact Case 5:18-cv-01959-SVK   Document 39   Filed 10/11/18   Page 5 of 6 \n6 1 \n2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 \n10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 \n28 United States District Court \nNorthern District of Californi a same business” in the United States.  ECF 33 at 9; see also ECF 33-8 at ¶¶ 3-4.  However, Plaintiff \nhas not submitted evidence sufficient to establish that Defendant’s alleged conduct towards Hangzhou Linggan creates ei ther a likelihood that uSens  will succeed in this action or that uSens  \nwill suffer irreparable harm without a preliminar y injunction.  Plaintiff has argued that the \nconfidential information contained on the la ptop “belongs to both Ha ngzhou and Linggan and \nuSens.”  Id.  To be sure, trade secrets can be jointly owned.  StrikePoint Trading, LLC v. Sabolyk , \nNo. SACV071073DOCMLGX, 2008 WL 11334084, at *6 (C.D. Cal. Dec. 22, 2008).  However, Plaintiff’s complaint contains no allegations of sh ared trade secrets, and Plaintiff has presented no \nevidence concerning its interest in the alle ged trade secrets at issue in this case. \nAccordingly, Plaintiff has not presented eviden ce to satisfy the standard for a preliminary \ninjunction, either under the traditional test or the “sliding scale” approach , and thus Plaintiff’s \nmotion is DENIED. III. CONCLUSION \nFor the reasons set forth above, Plaintiff’s mo tion for a preliminary injunction is DENIED.  \nDefendant is reminded of his duty to preserve ev idence, including but not limited to the cell phone \nand laptop referred to in Paragraph 38 of the Comp laint, during the pendency of this litigation.  \nSO ORDERED. \nDated: October 11, 2018  \n  \nSUSAN VAN KEULEN \nUnited States Magistrate Judge \nCase 5:18-cv-01959-SVK   Document 39   Filed 10/11/18   Page 6 of 6",

Factual & Procedural Background  \n Rex I is a real estate company that specializes  in commercial and \ninvestment properties. It brokers real estate transactions in Texas, with  \nclients throughout the United States and other countries. It has used three \nregistered trademarks throughout its existence: “REX,” “REX Real \nEstate,” and a logo showing a crown alongside the words “REX Real Estate.”\n1 \nBefore it ceased operations in May 2022, Rex Exchange offered an \nonline platform for real estate sales of single -family homes. It used artificial \nintelligence and other data- based technology to match prospective  buyers \nwith properties . The company originated  in California, but later moved its \nheadquarters  to Texas, where it had first expanded operations  prior to  March \n2018.   \nIn May 2018, Rex I filed suit against Rex Exchange in the Easter n \nDistrict of Texas alleging trademark infringement in violation of the Lanham \nAct. Rex Real Estate I, L.P. v. Rex Real Estate, Inc. , 80 F.4th 607,  614 (5th Cir. \n2023) ; 15 U.S.C. §§  1114(1), 1125(a).2 The following  year , the district court \n_____________________  \n1 Rex I has used “REX” since  December 31, 1987, and registered that name  with \nthe United States Patent and Trademark Office in June 2018. It has used “REX Real \nEstate” since  January 1, 1987, and registered that name  in June 2018. It has used the crown \nlogo since  December  31, 1990 , and registered that logo  in January 2015. Rex Real Estate I, \nL.P. v. Rex Real Estate, Inc.,  80 F.4th 607, 614 (5th Cir. 2023).  \n2 Anticipating that Rex I would file suit, Rex Exchange  first filed a separate suit  \nearlier that month  in the Central District of California . In that earlier suit, Rex Exchange  \nsought  a declaratory judgment that it was not infringing on Rex I’s trademarks. Th e district \ncourt, however, dismissed the suit for lack of personal jurisdiction. See Rex Real Estate \nExch.  v. Rex Real Estate , 2018 WL 8335386, at *18 (C.D. Cal. Sept. 20, 2018).  Case: 23-50889      Document: 57-1     Page: 2     Date Filed: 10/14/2024No. 23 -50889  \n3 transferred the case to the Western District of Texas. The case then \nprogressed to trial in April 2022 . After Rex I rested its case -in-chief, Rex \nExchange moved for judgment as a matter of law. The district court granted \nits motion, entering judgment in favor of Rex Exchange.   \nRex I then appealed that judgment to this court. We affirmed the \ndistrict court’s ruling on Rex I’s trademark claims that arose after th ose \nmarks were federally registered, but reversed and remanded for a new trial on Rex  I’s claims that arose before federal registration.  Rex Real Estate , 80 \nF.4th at 628.  \nWhile Rex I’s appeal was pending before this court, Rex Exchange \nclosed its doors and laid off all its employees. Accordingly, seven days after we remanded the case to the district court, Rex  I moved to voluntarily \ndismiss its remaining claims  without prejudice  under Rule  41(a)(2). \nAccording to Rex  I, it believed that because Rex Exchange was going out of \nbusiness,  it would neither continue to infringe on Rex I’s marks, nor  be able \nto satisfy any money judgment for past infringement. Rex Exchange opposed Rex I’s motion for voluntary dismissal, asserting  that it would only agree to \nthe dismissal if Rex I pa id its attorneys’ fees , which  Rex I refused  to do. T he \ndistrict court granted Rex I’s motion , declining to award  Rex Exchange \nattorneys’ fees as a condition of  dismissal .\n3 \nRex Exchange then appealed the district court’s order. In a briefing \nnotice to the parties, this court directed the parties to brief the following:  \n_____________________  \n3 Alongside its order granting voluntary dismissal without prejudice , the district \ncourt issued a final judgment, which noted that its “previous order granting [Rex \nExchange ] judgment as a matter of law  . . . is still valid as to many of the claims in this case” \nand that its voluntary dismissal order “dismissed the remaining [claims]  in this case that \nwere revived on appeal, making final judgment appropriate once again.” . Case: 23-50889      Document: 57-1     Page: 3     Date Filed: 10/14/2024No. 23 -50889  \n4 This court has jurisdiction over appeals from final decisions of \nthe district courts. Orders dismissing fewer than all claims or \ndefendants are final only if the district court has made an \nexpress determination that there is no just reason for delay and \nan express direction for the entry of judgment. Dismissal \nwithout prejudice of remaining claims or parties does not render the case final. See  Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(b); [] Williams  v. \nSeidenbach , 958 F.3d 341 (5th Cir 2020) (en banc). The court \nrequests the par ties [to] brief whether this is a final, appealable \ncase.  \nNearly seven  weeks later, Rex Exchange filed its opening brief. In that \nbrief, Rex Exchange  only mention s finality  in its jurisdictional statement, \nwhich states  that “[t]his Court has jurisdiction over this appeal pursuant to \n29 [sic] U.S.C. Section 1291 because the judgement [ sic] below is the final \njudgement [sic] of the United States District Court.” In its opposing brief , \nRex I argues  that Rex Exchange “has forfeited any argument that the district \ncourt’s decision is final or that this court has jurisdiction to review it.”\n4 In its \nreply brief, Rex Exchange counters  that we do have jurisdiction  to hear its \nappeal . It does not, however,  discuss  Rex I’s claim that it  had already \nforfeited that argument by not raising it in its opening  brief.  \nII. Discussion  \n“Arguments in favor of jurisdiction can be forfeited.” Ctr. for \nBiological Diversity  v. U.S. Env’t Prot. Agency, 937 F.4th 533, 542 & n.4 (5th \nCir. 2019) (cleaned up); Matter of Gilani , 2024 WL 340822, at  *3 & n.11 (5th \nCir. Jan. 30, 2024) (unpublished) (quoting the same to determine that the \nappellant had forfeited his jurisdictional argument concerning the finality of \na judgment).  Although “[t]his court has a continuing obligation to assure \n_____________________  \n4 Rex I also argues that the district court’s dismissal of  this case without prejudice \ndid not make the case  final such that we have jurisdiction to hear Rex Exchange’s appeal.  Case: 23-50889      Document: 57-1     Page: 4     Date Filed: 10/14/2024No. 23 -50889  \n5 itself of its own jurisdiction,” that only means  that parties cannot forfeit \narguments against  jurisdiction.  United States  v. Pedroza -Rocha , 933 F.3d 490, \n493 (5th Cir. 2019). “But the opposite is not true.” Abraugh v. Altimus , 26 \nF.4th 298, 305 (5th Cir. 2022). Accordingly, w e need not “accept subject \nmatter jurisdiction based on [a] theor[y]” that has been forfeited. See id.  \nA. Rex Exchange Inadequately Briefed Its Jurisdictional Argument  \nTo preserve arguments  from forfeiture , a party  must include those \n“contentions” in its opening brief “ and the reasons for them, with citations \nto the authorities and parts of the record on which the appellant relies.” \nFed. R. App. P. 28(a)(8)(A); see United States v. Miranda, 248 F.3d 434, \n443 (5th Cir. 2001) (“Failure to satisfy the requirements of Rule  28 as to a \nparticular issue ordinarily constitutes abandonment of the issue.”). It is insufficient merely to begin  the brief with a conclusory assertion  and \n“fail[] . . . to make any argument whatsoever to support this contention .” \nUnited States v. Beaumont , 972 F.2d 553, 563 (5th Cir. 1992)  (emphasis \nremoved ); see also United States v. Bennett , 874 F.3d 236, 243 n.9 (5th Cir. \n2017) (holding that a “conclusory assertion” constituted  “inadequate \nbriefing” to preserve an argument for review).  Further, “[a]rguments raised \nfor the first time in a reply brief ” are also forfeited.  Dixon v. Toyota Motor \nCredit Corp. , 794 F.3d 507, 508 (5th Cir. 2015).  \nHere, as  Rex I points out, Rex Exchange only mentions jurisdiction or \nfinality in a  “conclusory” sentence in its jurisdictional statement. Although \n“[w]e liberally construe briefs in determining issues presented for review,” SEC v. Recile , 10 F.3d 1093, 1096 –97 (5th Cir. 1993) , we do not see how any \nother part of Rex Exchange’s 55- page brief even plausibly addresses whether \nthe district court issued a final order when it granted Rex I’s Rule  41(a)(2) \nmotion,  see id. at 1096  (“[I]ssues not raised at all are [forfeited].”) . And \nalthough  Rex Exchange present s arguments regarding jurisdiction and Case: 23-50889      Document: 57-1     Page: 5     Date Filed: 10/14/2024No. 23 -50889  \n6 finality  in its  reply brief , those arguments  are too late. See Dixon, 794 F.3d at \n508.  Rex Exchange has therefore failed to  adequately brief its jurisdictional \nargument  to preserve it for our review . See Miranda, 248 F.3d at 443.  \nB. This Case Does Not Merit Disregarding Usual Procedural Rules  to \nConsider Rex Exchange’s Jurisdictional Argument  \n When we determine that a party has not adequately preserved an \nargument  for our review , we retain  the discretion to overl ook that deficiency \nand nonetheless consider the argument . Miranda , 248 U.S. at 444 (noting \nthat a determination as to  whether a party has abandoned an argument  is “a \nprudential construct  . . . that requires the exercise of discretion ”).5 In the \njurisdictional context, we pay particular attention to whether a party still  \nincludes “a cursory discussion”  so that we can “assume they had a \ngood -faith (though mistaken) belief that” the jurisdictional issue “would be \nboth undisputed and easy to resolve.” Ctr. for Biological Diversity , 937 F.4th \nat 542 n.4.  \n Here, we cannot give Rex Exchange th e benefit of th at doubt.  See id . \nUnlike in Center  for Biological Diversity , we explicitly “direct[ed]” Rex \n_____________________  \n5 In our exercise of t his discretion , forfeiture  is distinguished fr om waiver. \n“Whereas forfeiture is the failure to make the timely assertion of a right, waiver is the \nintentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right.” United States v. Olano , 507 \nU.S. 725, 733 (1993) (internal quotation  mark s omitted) ; see also Farber v. Crestwood \nMidstream Ptrs. L.P., 863 F.3d 410, 417 (5th Cir. 2017) (“[T]he issue of waiver essentially turns on whether waiver was made knowingly and voluntarily.” (internal quotation marks \nomitted)) . Unlike  in cases of  forfeiture, we do not retain discretion to overlook an effective \nwaiver. See id.  at 732 –33. Our precedent, however, sometimes uses these terms \ninterchangeably. McGee v. Estelle, 722 F. 2d 1206, 1213 n.21 (1984) (en banc ); see, e.g., \nMiranda , 248 F.3d at 443 (referring to the “exercise of discretion” regarding whether to \nconsider issues that the parties did not adequately brief as “the \nissues- not-briefed -are-waived  rule.” (emphasis added)) . Nonetheless, there is no evidence \nin this case’s appellate record that Rex Exchange “knowingly and voluntarily” waived its \nargument that this is a final, appealable case.  See Farber , 863 F.3d at 417. Accordingly, by \nnot raising th e issue in its appellate briefing, Rex Exchange merely forfeited the argument.  Case: 23-50889      Document: 57-1     Page: 6     Date Filed: 10/14/2024No. 23 -50889  \n7 Exchange  and Rex I to “brief whether this is a final, appealable case.” See id.  \nRex Exchange fai led to follow our explicit instruction . It therefore could not \nhave had the  reasonable expectation that jurisdiction  would be “undisputed” \nor “easy to resolve .” See id . Additionally, Rex Exchange made no effort in its \nreply brief to refute Rex  I’s argument that it had forfeited its jurisdictional \nargument. See id. (considering the party’s level of “treatment of the \nargument in [its] reply brief”  as relevant to determ ining whether to overlook \na briefing deficiency in the opening brief ). We therefore decline to consider \nRex Exchange’s  argument  that we have appellate jurisdiction in this case . \nIn sum, w e conclude that Rex Exchange has forfeited its argument that \nthe district court’s dismissal without prejudice is  a final order because (1) it \ndid not adequately discuss the issue in its opening brief, and (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding that deficiency do not lead us to exercise our \ndiscretion to overlook it. Accordingly, we hold that we do  not have \njurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1291 to hear Rex Exchange’s appeal.6 \nIII. Conclusion  \n For the foregoing reasons, Rex Exchange’s appeal is DISMISSED . \n_____________________  \n6 Our holding is not to be construed as comment ing on the substantive strength of \nRex Exchange’s position that we may assert jurisdiction over this  case as a final action . See \nWilliams , 958 F.3d at 346 (“Of course, once the district court has decided all claims against \nall parties, that decision is plainly final.”) ; id. at 348 n.2 (“Of course, if a plaintiff \nvoluntarily dismisses an entire case under Rule 41(a), then the case is over and there is \nnothing left pending in the district court.”) . As mentioned,  the district court issued a \nseparate “final judgment ,” in which it stated that it “dismissed the remaining [claims] in \nthis case that were revived on appeal, making final judgment appropriate once again.” \nNevertheless, given our holding that Rex Exchange forfeited its argument that we have \njurisdiction to hear its appeal, we pretermit further discussion of the issue.

The Chief Magistrate Judge submits that Defendants ’ Motion to Dismiss \nshould be granted.  (ECF No. 34 at PageID 280.)   \nPlaintiff  Chris A. Pritchard (“Mr. Pritchard”) filed a timely Objection  on August 16, \n2023.  (ECF No. 36.)   Defendant filed a timely Response to Plaintiff’s Objections on August \n30, 2023.  (ECF No. 38.) \n \n1 Defendant Samsung Electronics has not been served.  ( See ECF No. 35.)  Samsung is a South Korean entity \nbased in Seoul, South Korea.  ( Id. at PageID 309.)   Plaintiff intends to serve Samsung Electronics in accordance \nwith the Hague Service Convention.  ( Id.; see also  ECF No. 37.)  For this reason, the instant Order pertains only \nto Plaintiff’s claims against Mr. Thompson and Harman.  Case 2:22-cv-02838-JPM-tmp   Document 39   Filed 09/06/23   Page 1 of 7    PageID <pageID>2 For the reasons discussed below, the Court ADOPTS  the Chief Magistrate Judge’s \nReport and Recommendation in its entirety. \nI. BACKGROUND \na. Factual Background \n“We construe the complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, accepting all \nwell-pleaded factual allegations as true.”  Parrino v. Price, 869 F.3d 392, 397 (6th Cir. 2017)  \n(citing Robbins v. New Cingular Wireless PCS, LLC, 854 F.3d 315, 318 (6th Cir. 2017) ; \nAshcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) ).  The Chief Magistrate Judge accurately \nsummarized Plaintiff’s well- pleaded factual allegations in his Report and Recommendation.  \n(ECF No. 34 at PageID 280–84.)  The Court will highlight the most pertinent facts here.  \nPlaintiff  i s an inventor domiciled in Germantown, Tennessee.  (ECF No. 18 at PageID \n64.)  Plaintiff  holds design patent US D 904,256 S, issued on December 8, 2020, and utility \npatent US 11,558,584 B2, issued on January 17, 2023, for  a dashcam with artificial \nintelligence  capabilities.   (Id. at PageID 65.)  Plaintiff  emailed Mr. Thompson, the Senior \nPlatform Director at Harman and a resident of Brighton, Michigan , regarding manufacturing \nhis invention.  ( Id. at PageID 264–66.)  Harman is a wholly -owned  subsidiary of Samsung \nElectronics Co., Ltd. (“Samsung”), a  South Korean entity based in Seoul, South Korea.  ( Id. at \nPageID 65.)  Harman is a Delaware corporation headquartered in  Mountain View, California. \n(ECF No. 20 at PageID 99.)   Plaintiff and Mr. Thompson discussed Plaintiff’s prototype and a \nnon-disclosure agreement, and Plaintiff shared design specifications.  (ECF No. 18 at PageID \n66–68.)  Plaintiff discovered “ an exact replica of Plaintiff’s product” on Harman’s website in \nJune of 2022.  ( Id. at PageID 68.) \n  Case 2:22-cv-02838-JPM-tmp   Document 39   Filed 09/06/23   Page 2 of 7    PageID <pageID>3 b. Procedural  Background \nThe Chief Magistrate Judge summarized the procedural background of the instant case \nas follows: \n[Mr.] Pritchard filed suit in this district court on December 9,  2022.  (ECF No. \n1.) He filed an amended complaint on January 23, 2023. (ECF No. 18.)   In his \namended complaint, Pritchard brings eleven counts: 1) trade secret \nmisappropriation; 2) infringement  of U.S. Patent No. US 11,558,584 B2; 3) \ninfringement of U.S. Patent No. D904,258 S; 4) breach of implied duty of good faith and fair  dealing; 5) declaratory judgment; 6) fraud – intentional \nmisrepresentation; 7) fraud – concealment; 8) promissory fraud; 9)  negligent \nmisrepresentation; 10) breach of contract; and 11) tort of another. ( Id.)  \n \nHarman and [Mr.] Thompson filed the present Motion to Dismiss on February \n6, 2023.  (ECF No. 20.)   The defendants argue that this  court lacks personal \njurisdiction and is not the proper venue for  these claims.  ( Id.)  They further \nassert that Pritchard has failed  to state a claim upon which relief can be \ngranted.  ( Id.)  [Mr.] Pritchard  responded on April 5, 2023, arguing that \nbecause Harman has a registered agent in Tennessee, it is subject to the court’s  \njurisdiction here.  (ECF N o. 28.)  In his supplemental brief, Pritchard also \ncontends that because Harman formerly had an automotive plant in West \nTennessee, venue for the patent claims is  proper in this district.  (ECF No. 33 \nat PageID 272.)  Pritchard  alleges that the plant in qu estion, which shut down \noperations in  the year 2000, is “permanently bound in perpetuity by an  \nEnvironmental covenant regulated by the EPA.”  ( Id. at PageID 275.) \n (ECF No. 34 at PageID 283–84.) \n \nII. LEGAL STANDARD  \n“Within 14 days after being served with a copy of the recommended disposition, a \nparty may serve and file specific written objections to the proposed findings and \nrecommendations.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 72(b)(2).  “When no timely objection is filed, the court need only satisfy itself that there is no clear error on the face of the record in order to accept the recommendation.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 72(b) advisory committee notes. \nWhen a timely objection has been filed, “[t]he district judge must determine de novo \nany part of the magistrate judge’s disposition that has been properly objected to.”  Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 72(b)(3).  The portions of a magistrate judge’s recommendation as to which no Case 2:22-cv-02838-JPM-tmp   Document 39   Filed 09/06/23   Page 3 of 7    PageID <pageID>4 specific objections were filed are reviewed for clear error.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 72(b) advisory \ncommittee notes; Howard v. Sec’y of Health & Human Servs., 932 F.2d 505, 509 (6th Cir. \n1991) (noting that when a party makes a general objection, “[t]he district court’s attention is not focused on any specific issues for review, thereby making the initial reference to the magistrate useless”).  “A general objection to the entirety of the magistrate’s report has the same effects as would a failure to object.”  Howard , 932 F.2d at 509.  Moreover, the “failure \nto properly file objections cons titutes a waiver of appeal.”  See id. at 508 (citing United States \nv. Walters , 638 F.2d 947, 950 (6th Cir. 1981)).   \nIII. ANALYSIS  \na. Motion to Dismiss as to Harman \nPlaintiff objects that Harman is  subject to personal jurisdiction in the Western District \nof Tennessee.   (ECF No. 26 at PageID 312.)   He specifically argues that an EPA clean -up site \nlocated at a former Harman plant  in Bolivar, Tennessee  creates sufficient contacts  to subject \nthe company to general jurisdic tion.  (Id.)   \nPlaintiff argued in his supplemental brief that the presence of the closed plant  in \nBolivar, Tennessee  meant that the Western District of Tennessee was a proper venue for a \npatent suit, not that it created general jurisdiction over Harman.  (ECF No. 33 at PageID 275.)   \n“Issues raised for the first time in objections to the magistrate judge's recommendation are deemed waived.”  Burley v. Miller, 241 F. Supp. 3d 828, 840 (E.D. Mich. 2017) (citing Ward \nv. United States, 208 F.3d 216, *1 (6th Cir. 2000)).  “[A]bsent compelling reasons, [the \nMagistrate Judge Act, 28 U.S.C. § 631 et seq. ,] does not allow parties to raise at the district \ncourt stage new arguments or issues that were not presented to the magistrate.”  Murr v. \nUnited States , 200 F.3d 895, 902 n. 1 (6th Cir. 2000).  “[A]llowing parties to litigate fully \ntheir case before the magistrate and, if unsuccessful, to change their strategy and present a Case 2:22-cv-02838-JPM-tmp   Document 39   Filed 09/06/23   Page 4 of 7    PageID <pageID>5 different theory to the district court would frustrate the purpose of the Magistrates Act.”  \nGreenhow v. Secretary of Health & Human Servs. , 863 F.2d 633, 638–39 (9th Cir. 1988), \noverruled on other grounds by United States v. Hardesty , 977 F.2d 1347 (9th Cir. 1992), cert. \ndenied , 507 U.S. 978 (1993).  The Court will not consider arguments raise d for the first time \nin Plaintiff’s  objections. \nBecause no proper objections were filed  regarding Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss as \nto Harman , the Court reviews the Report and Recommendation for clear error.  Fed. R. Civ. P. \n72(b)(3).  Upon full review of the Magistrate Judge’s Report and Recommendation, the Court has not identified any clear error and concurs with the Magistrate Judge’s findings.  The Report and Recommendation is, therefore, ADOPTED.  The instant Motion to Dismiss is GRANTED as to Harman . \nb. Motion to Dismiss as to Thompson \nPlaintiff offers no specific objection to the Chief Magistrate Judge’s finding that the \nCourt lacks both general and specific jurisdiction over Mr. Thompson.  (See generally  ECF \nNo. 36.)  Plaintiff generally objects that Mr. Thompson is subject to general jurisdiction in the Western District of Tennessee.  ( Id. at PageID 312.) \nBecause no clear or specific objections were filed  regarding Defendant’s Motion to \nDismiss as to Mr. Thompson, the Court reviews the Report and Recommendation for clear error.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 72(b)(3).  Upon full review of the Magistrate Judge’s Report and Recommendation, the Court has not identified any clear error and concurs with the Magistrate Judge’s findings.  The Report and Recommendation is, therefore, ADOPTED.  The instant \nMotion to Dismiss is GRANTED as to Mr. Thompson. \n  Case 2:22-cv-02838-JPM-tmp   Document 39   Filed 09/06/23   Page 5 of 7    PageID <pageID>6 c. Transfer  \nPlaintiff requests that the Court transfer  the instant  case to the Eastern District of \nMichigan in his Objection.  (ECF No. 36 at PageID 312–13.)   \n“The district court of a district in which is filed a case laying venue in the wrong \ndivision or district shall . . . if it be in the interest of justice, transfer such case to any district \nor division in which it could have been brought. ”  28 U.S.C.A. § 1406.  “ The Supreme Court's \ndecision in Goldlawr, Inc. v. Heiman, 369 U.S. 463, 82 S.Ct. 913, 8 L.Ed.2d 39 (1962), \nexpressly included the lack of personal jurisdiction as one of the procedural hurdles that can \nbe remedied by a § 1406 transfer. ”  Flynn v. Greg Anthony Constr. Co., 95 F. App'x 726, 739 \n(6th Cir. 2003) .  “T he decision of whether to dismiss or transfer is within the district court's \nsound discretion.”  First of Michigan Corp. v. Bramlet, 141 F.3d 260, 262 (6th Cir. 1998).   \nThe interest of justice “ may require that the complaint not be dismissed but rather that it be \ntransferred in order that the plaintiff not be penalized by . . . time -consuming and justice -\ndefeating technicalities. ”  Goldlawr , 369 U.S. at  467.  This is especially true in the case of a \npro se plaintiff.  See, e.g. , Kodjo v. Tyson Foods, No. 3:13- 00679, 2014 WL 346818, at *1 \n(M.D. Tenn. Jan. 30, 2014) ; see also  Fam v. Bank of Am. NA (USA) , 236 F. Supp. 3d 397, \n408 (D.D.C. 2017) (collecting cases) .   \nHowever, transfer would not be appropriate given t he circumstances of the instant \ncase.   28 U.S.C. § 1406 only permits the Court to transfer a case “to a district where venue \nwould have been proper in the first instance .”  Thompson v. Greenwood, 507 F.3d 416, 421 \n(6th Cir. 2007) .  From the pleadings in the instant case, it is not clear that the Eastern District \nof Michigan was the proper venue in the first instance.  ( See generally  ECF No. 31 (ordering \nthe Parties to brief the issue of where proper venue would lie); ECF Nos. 32, 33 (offering no proper venue in which the instant suit could be brought against all  Parties ).)  It is therefore Case 2:22-cv-02838-JPM-tmp   Document 39   Filed 09/06/23   Page 6 of 7    PageID <pageID>7 appropriate to dismiss Mr. Thompson and Harman.  Transferring the instant case to another \npotentially improper venue  would not be  in the interest of justice and would be contrary to the \nprinciple of judicial economy. \nIV. CONCLUSION \nThe Court ADOPTS  the Report and Recommendation of the Chief Magistrate Judge.  \nAccordingly, Mr. T hompson’s and Harman’s  Motion to Dismiss  is GRANTED. \nSO ORDERE D, this  6th day of September, 2023.  \n/s/ Jon P.

    "summary": "1. **Summary:** This court case involves a dispute between Concord Music Group, Inc. and Anthropic PBC regarding the sealing of certain discovery materials in a lawsuit focused on Claude, Anthropic's AI product. The court examined whether to allow the sealing of usage metrics, specific prompts, and datasets used to train the AI, determining which items should remain confidential based on the \"good cause\" standard rather than the higher \"compelling reasons\" standard.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue:** Whether there is \"good cause\" to seal various documents and pieces of information related to the AI system Claude, in the context of a discovery dispute.\n\n3. **Court's Holding:** The court granted in part and denied in part Anthropic’s requests to seal, allowing some information to remain private due to competitive sensitivity, while denying the sealing of other information like prompt descriptions and specific usage numbers which had either been disclosed publicly or were not sensitive enough.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation:** A company named Anthropic wanted to keep some facts about their AI, Claude, secret during a legal case because they think their rivals could use this info against them. The court decided that some details really should be kept private, but others can be shared because they're not as important or are already public.",

Nos. 340, 344, 351  \n \nBefore the Court are Plaintiffs’ (“Publishers” ) Administrative Motions to Consider \nWhether Another Party’s Material Should Be Sealed pursuant to Civil L.R. 79-5(f) in connection \nwith:  (1) the Parties’ Joint Statement Regarding the Dispute as to the Sampling Protocol to Address Publisher’s Request for Production nos. 50-51 (Dkt. 3 Anthropic’s Searches and Production of Claude Prompts and Output (Dkts. 340 and 351\n1) and (2) the Parties’ Joint \nStatement Regarding the Discovery Dispute over Publishers’ Challenges to Anthropic’s Confidentiality Designations. Anthropic filed declarations pursuant to Civil Local Rule 79- 5(f)(3) \nin support of sealing.  Dkts. 354, 362 and 370 (supporting Dkts. 340, 344 and 351, respectively).  Publishers oppose sealing.  See Dkts. 357, 374-75.

LEGAL STANDARD  \nCourts recognize a “general right to inspect and copy public records and documents, \nincluding judicial records and documents.”  Kamakana v. City & Cnty. Of Honolulu, 447 F.3d 1172, \n1178 (9th Cir. 2006) (quoting Nixon v. Warner Comm c’ns., Inc., 435 U.S. 589, 597 & n.7 (1978)).   \nThe standard for overcoming the presumption of public access to court records depends on the \npurpose for which the records are filed with the court.  A party seeking to seal court records relating to motions that are “more than tangentially related to the  underlying cause of action” must \ndemonstrate “compelling reasons” that support secrecy .  Ctr. For Auto Safety v. Chrysler Grp., 809 \nF.3d 1092, 1099 (9th Cir. 2016).  For records attached to motions that a re “not related, or only \ntangentially related, to the merits of the case,”  such as “a discovery motion unrelated to the merits \nof the case,” the lower “good cause” standard applies.  Id. ;  see also Kamakana, 447 F.3d at 1179.  \nThe requests at issue relate to records attached to and cited in the Parties’ Joint Discovery submissions noted above, rather than motions or pleadings concerning the merits of the case.\n2    \nAccordingly, the “good cause” standard applies.3 \nII. DISCUSSION  \nA. Anthropic’s Requests to Seal Claude Metrics and Usage Information  \nAnthropic argues that there is good cause to seal Claude metrics and usage information, \ni.e., metrics of how many prompts were submitted to Claude over various periods of time.  Dkt. \n354, ¶ 4;  Dkt. 362, ¶ 6.  It argues that such metrics are “competitively sensitive” and “would give [its] competitors and potential business partners unfair insights into Anthropic’s business strategies,” including the relative importance of Claude and Anthropic’s market share.  Dkt. 354, ¶ 4;  Dkt. 362, ¶ 6.  In so arguing, Anthropic points to a recent case in the Southern District of New \n \n2 This Sealing Order does not resolve Dkt. 336 or its related filings, which relate to Anthropic’s \nrequest to seal certain material in Publisher’s First Amended Complaint and are properly before \nthe Honorable Eumi K. Lee. \n3 Anthropic addresses the “good cause” standard in all of its declarations in support of sealing.  \nDkts. 354, 362 and 370, ¶¶ 3.  Publishers’ oppositions address the “compelling reasons” standard, arguing only that “even if the ‘good cause’ standard applie[d],” Anthropic’s sealing requests should still be denied.  Dkts. 374-75, n. 1.  Publishers’ application of the “compelling reasons” standard is incorrect.   are incorrect .  However, because Anthropic bears the burden of overcoming \nthe strong presumption in favor of access, the Court will consider Publishers’ arguments to the extent they are relevant to the “good cause” inquiry.  Case 5:24-cv-03811-EKL     Document 378     Filed 05/23/25     Page 2 of 6 \n3 1 \n2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 \n10 11 12 13 14 15 \n16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  York wherein the  court sealed certain metrics related to ChatGPT usage.  See N.Y. Times Co. v. \nOpenAI , No. 23 -cv-11195- SHS (OTW), Dkt. 426 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 17, 2025) (sealing ECF  414 and \nreferring back to the reasoning in ECF 378 ( erroneously cited as ECF 376) ).  The rationale of the \ncourt in OpenAI , relying on the sealing standard of the Second Circuit, was that (1) there was “a \nlow presumption of public access” for documents related to discovery;  (2) the parties had designated the documents confidential under the protective order;  and (3) the documents “reference information of the type that would normally be kept strictly confidential by the parties.”  OpenAi , Dkt. 378 at 5.  \nHere, Publishers make several arguments against sealing “ general Claude usage figures,” \nbut most of Publishers’ arguments rely upon the “compelling reasons” standard.  See Dkt. 357 at \n2-5;  Dkt. 374 at 3- 4;  Dkt. 375 at 1- 3.  Publishers ’ first argument, that the information Anthropic \nseeks to seal is 13 or 19 months old (depending on the metrics at issue) relies  explicitly on the \n“compelling reasons” standard:  “there are no compelling reasons to seal stale information.”  Dkt.  357 at 2- 3 (citing Applied Materials, Inc. v. Demaray LLC , No. 5:20- CV-09341- EJD, 2023 WL \n4409106, at *2 (N.D. Cal. July 7, 2023) ) (emphasis added) ;  Dkt. 374 at 3 (same);  Dkt. 375 \n(same).  Similarly, Publishers’ third argument  relies on the “strong pres umption in favor of access \nto court records” that is present in the compelling reasons analysis.  Dkt. 357 at 4- 5;  Dkt. 374 at 1;  \nDkt. 375 at 1.  These arguments are misplaced.  \nThe “good cause” standard is much closer to the “low presumption” applied by the court in \nOpenAI , which is persuasive here.  The  Ninth Circuit has explained that “ discovery is largely \n‘conducted in private as a matter of modern practice, ’ so the public is not presumed to have a right \nof access to it .”  Ctr. for Auto Safety v. Chrysler , 809 F.3d at 1097 (quoting Seattle Times Co. v. \nRhinehart , 467 U.S. 20, 33 (1984) ).  “There is no tradition of public access to discovery, and \nrequiring a trial court to scrut inize carefully public claims of access would be incongruous with \nthe goals of the discovery process.”   Id. (citation omitted).  Accordingly, under the “good cause” \nstandard, “ the private interests of litigants are ‘the only weights on the scale.’”  Id.   Thus, \nPublishers’ arguments based on the “strong presumption” of public access are simply not applicable.  Their arguments based on “stale” information have some force, but this Court is not Case 5:24-cv-03811-EKL     Document 378     Filed 05/23/25     Page 3 of 6 \n4 1 \n2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 \n10 11 12 13 14 15 \n16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  persuaded that 13- month- old or 19- month- old usage metrics are sufficiently old as to categorically \nrebut Anthropic’s declared competitive interest in the information.   Rather, this Court agrees that, \nfor a company whose bread- and-butter is generative artificial intelligence, the usage metrics of \ntheir most well- known AI product could give their competitors insight into their market share and \nthus may be  competitively sensitive.  See Dkt. 354, ¶ 4;  Dkt. 362, ¶ 6. \nPublishers’ second argument, that “Anthropic has not consistently held this type of \ninformation confidential,” (Dkt. 357 at 3- 4), is well -taken .  Publishers cite two types of \ndisclosures:  reporting by third parties, including metrics generated by analytics firms, and statements by Anthropic itself.  As to the first category, the  Court is not convinced that unsourced, \nthird -party reporting is  sufficient to defeat Anthropic’s asserted competitive interests.   But  as to \nthe second category, the Court agrees that Anthropic has disclosed isolated  usage metrics in \nlimited contexts :  for example, “2.8 million Claude.ai Free and Pro conversations between \nNovember 28, 2024 and December 18, 2024.”  See Handa, K., et al. , Which Economic Tasks Are \nPerformed with AI? Evidence from Millions of Claude Conversations  27 (2025).  Thus, \nAnthropic’s behavior suggests that the risk of harm from disclosure  of isolated usage metrics from \nlimited time periods is minimal or at least not overriding.  \nAccordingly, this Court GRANT S-IN-PART  Anthropic’s request to seal Claude usage \nfigures  as set forth b elow.  This is also consistent with the Court’s finding in its attendant  \nsubstantive order that, while Anthropic’s detailed query counts may be maintained as “HC -AEO” \nmaterial, other, less comprehensive  use-counts are merely “Confidential.”  \nB. Anthropic’s Request  to Seal Information from Specific Prompts  \nAnthropic next seeks to seal materials that contain “direct quotes from specific prompts by \nClaude users.”  Dkt. 362, ¶ 4.  Publishers oppose this request, arguing that descriptions of prompts \nand the anonymous quotes at issue pose  no risk of harm for Anthropic or its third- party users.  See \nDkt. 374 at 1- 2.  The Court agrees with Publishers. \nAs the Court explained previously, Anthropic’s users do have a privacy interest at stake in \ntheir interactions with Claude.  See Dkt. 318 at 4- 5.  But, as explained in the attendant substantive \norder, while Anthropic may categorically designate prompts and outputs as confidential “at the Case 5:24-cv-03811-EKL     Document 378     Filed 05/23/25     Page 4 of 65\n 1 \n2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 \n10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  outset under the PO ,” it must “de -designate and/or propose tailored redactions for th[e] specific \nprompt/output record[s]” that it submits in filings .  In this case, there is no cause to seal the \ndescriptions and anonymous excerpts at issue .  Accordingly, the Court DENIES  Anthropic’s \nrequest to seal these descriptions and prompt excerpts. \nC. Anthropic’s Request to Seal the Two Datasets Used to Train Claude\nFinally, Anthropic seeks to seal “two specific datasets used to train Claude.”  Dkt. 362, ¶\n7. Publishers oppose this request, arguing that “this information is already well- known” and\n“these same training datasets are commonly used by Anthropic’s competitors.”  Dkt. 374 at 5.These arguments mirror those Publishers made in opposing Anthropic’s use of the “HC- AEO”\ndesignation for these training datasets.\nAs the Court explains in the attendant substantive order, Anthropic maintains that it has \nnever publicly disclosed using either dataset to train Claude and “[n]either Publishers’ citations to what Anthropic’s competitors have disclosed about their products, nor their citations to a 2021 article that predates Claude and does not mention Claude, refute this representation.”  Accordingly, the Court does not agree that Anthropic has made this information public.  Additionally, while the Court does not decide whether these datasets could be maintained under seal under the compelling reasons standard, in the context of the lower “good cause” standard where “the private interests of litigants are ‘the only weights on the scale,’” ( Ctr. for Auto Safety v. \nChrysler , 809 F.3d at 1097), this Court is satisfied that the datasets used to train Claude are \ncompetitively sensitive and so should remain under seal in the context of this discovery dispute.  Accordingly, the Court GRANTS Anthropic’s request to seal these materia ls as set forth below. \nIII. CONCLUSION\nIn sum, the Court GRANTS -IN-PART and DENIES -IN-PART Anthropic’s requests to\nseal certain materials, as follows: \n//// \n//// \n//// \n//// Case 5:24-cv-03811-EKL     Document 378     Filed 05/23/25     Page 5 of 66 1 \n2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 \n10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  Document  Sealing Request  Sealing Order \nDiscovery \nDispute Statement (Dkt. 340-2) Highlighted portions at pages 1 -2, 4-7, 10. \nDENIED as to the word “seven” on ECF page 2, \nthe number “14” on ECF pages 3, 5, and 6, the \nnumber “45” on ECF page 5, the number “8” on \nECF page 7, all highlighting on ECF page 8, and \nthe number “8” on ECF page 11.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: Mounir Shita, self-represented, filed a case against Steve Taylor alleging trade secret misappropriation about AGI technology, and other state law claims, with a request for a temporary restraining order (TRO) and to seal the case, which were denied. The court granted his application to proceed in forma pauperis but found his claims inadequately pleaded, requiring him to show cause or amend his complaint. The case involves AI as the disputed technology is about artificial general intelligence (AGI), and Shita claims Taylor's wrongful acts involve misappropriating and attempting to claim ownership of this AGI technology.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the plaintiff, Mounir Shita, sufficiently alleged a claim of trade secret misappropriation, conversion, breach of fiduciary duty, and tortious interference, particularly in a context involving AGI technology.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court held that Shita's complaint did not sufficiently state a claim for trade secret misappropriation, breach of fiduciary duty, or tortious interference, though he adequately stated a claim of conversion. The application to proceed IFP was granted, but the motions for a TRO and to seal the case were denied. Shita was given the opportunity to amend his complaint to address the deficiencies identified.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine you invented a new type of super-smart robot technology and are mad because your former business partner is acting like it's his invention and might be sharing it with others. You take him to court asking for help, but the court says your complaint wasn’t clear enough, especially about what exactly makes your invention a secret and how he stole it. The court lets you update your complaint to try again and says you don’t have to pay court fees but denies your request to keep the case secret or to stop your partner right away without him even knowing about it.",
    "full_text": "1 IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT  \nF\nOR THE DISTRICT OF OREGON  \nMOUNIR SHITA , \nPlaintiff,  \nv. \nSTEVE TAYLOR , \nDefendant.  Case No.:  3:25-cv-00051 -AN \nOP\nINION AND ORDER \nSe\nlf-represented p laintiff  Mounir Shita brings  this action against defendant Steve Taylor, \nalleging trade secret misappropriation in violation of the Defend Trade Secrets Act, 18 U.S.C. § 1836, and \nstate law claims for conversion, breach of fiduciary duty, and tortious interference .  On January 10, 2025, \nplaintiff  filed his initial complaint, as well as an ex part e motion to seal the case, an application for leave \nto proceed in forma pauperis (\"IFP\"), and motion for temporary restraining order  (\"TRO\")  and preliminary \ninjunction.  On January 21, 2025,  the Court dismissed plaintiff's complaint  and denied plaintiff's motions \nand IFP application.  On January 27, 2025, plaintiff filed renewed motions but did not file an amended \ncomplaint or a renewed IFP application; accordingly, the Court denied plaintiff's renewed motions.    \nOn February 5, 2025, plaintiff filed a n amended complaint, second r enewed ex parte  \nmotion to s eal, second IFP application, and second r enewed ex parte m otion for TRO .  Defendant has not \nbeen served or appeared in this case.  P laintiff's IFP application is  hereby  GRANTED.  Further, plaintiff is \nordered to show cause in writing by March 17, 2025, why the amended c omplaint should not be dismissed \nfor failure to state a claim and for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.  Alternatively, plaintiff may file a  \nsecond  amended complaint by that date curing the defects outlined below.  Finally,  for the reasons set forth \nbelow, plaintiff 's motions are DENIED.  \nBACKGROUND \nT his action arises from the parties' dispute over the ownership and direction of EraNova  Case 3:25-cv-00051-AN      Document 18      Filed 02/14/25      Page 1 of 142 \n Global (\"EraNova\") and its development of artificial general intelligence (\"AGI\") technology.  In his \namended complaint, plaintiff alleges the following.  Over twenty -seven years, he \"developed a \nrevolutionary approach to AGI based on quantum mechanics and general relativity theories, distinctly \ndifferent from current mainstream [artificial intelligence ] approaches.\"  Am. Compl. , ECF [14],  ¶ 11.  I n \nNovember 2024, he incorporated EraNova Global (\"EraNova\") \"to explore commercialization \nopportunities while maintaining personal ownership of all intellectual property.\"  Id. ¶ 13.  D efendant was \na co-founder of  EraNova \" but was never granted any ownership rights to the underlying AGI technology. \"  \nId. ¶ 14. \n  On December 15, 2024, following disagreements over EraNova's direction , plaintiff \nemailed defendant proposing two potential paths forward.  Id. ¶ 15 (citing id. Ex. A ).  On December 16, \n2024, defendant \"responded with unauthorized demands [.]\"  Id.   On December 18, 2024, plaintiff \n\"terminated [d]efendant's involvement \" in EraNova, to which defendant \"threatened $1.5 million in \nretaliatory penalties if [p]laintiff sought legal protection[.]\"  Id.  On December 20, 2024, plaintiff sent a \nwarning email regarding deletion of trade secrets, and defendant \"falsely claimed ownership rights\"  over \nthose trade secrets.  Id.  On January 24, 2025, \"[e]vidence emerged that [d]efendant's  system was \ncompromised [.]\"  Id. ¶ 16.  On February 4, 2025, plaintiff \"received confirmation that [d]efendant is \nactively recruiting third parties to work on the AGI technology[ .]\"  Id. \n  Plaintiff's proposed TRO  bars defendant and all persons acting in concert with him from \n\"[u]sing, disclosing, or misappropriating [p]laintiff 's trade secrets and proprietary AGI technology \"; \n\"[c]laiming any ownership, authority, or control over [p]laintiff's intellectual property \"; \"[e]ngaging in any \ndevelopment activities that would require disclosure of [ p]laintiff's trade secrets to third parties \"; and \n\"[d]estroying, altering, concealing , or transferring any materials containing [p]laintiff 's trade secrets. \"  \nRenewed Ex Parte Mot. for TRO  (\"Mot. for TRO\") , ECF [ 16], at 15.  The proposed order also requires \ndefendant to  \"[p]reserve all physical and electronic materials containing or relating to [p]laintiff's trade \nsecrets\" ; \"[i]dentify any third parties to whom he has disclosed or intends to disclose [p]laintiff's trade \nsecrets\" ; \"[c]ease using any email addresses or signatures suggesting authority over [ p]laintiff's Case 3:25-cv-00051-AN      Document 18      Filed 02/14/25      Page 2 of 143 \n technology\" ; and \"[ p]rovide a complete accounting of all locations where trade secret information may be \nstored .\"  Id.  Plaintiff also request s a waiver of the security requirement.  Id. \nDISCUSSION  \nA. Sufficiency of Complaint  \n 1. Failure to State a Claim  \n  When a complaint is filed by a plaintiff proceeding IFP , the court must dismiss the case if \nit determines that the action is frivolous or malicious, fails to state a claim on which relief can be granted, \nor if the defendant is immune to monetary relief.  28 U.S.C. § 1915(e)(2) (B).  The standard used under 28 \nU.S.C. § 1915(e)(2) (B) for failure to state a claim is the same as the Federal Rule of Procedure ( \"FRCP \") \n12(b)(6) standard.  Watison v. Carter , 668 F.3d 1108, 1112 (9th Cir. 2012)  (citing Lopez v. Smith , 203 F.3d \n1122 (9th Cir. 2000)) . \n  To survive a FRCP 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, a complaint must \nallege \"sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to 'state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face. '\"  \nAschroft v. Iqbal , 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) (quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly , 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007)).   \nA claim is facially plausible \"when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the \nreasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.\"   Id. at 678 (citing Twombly , \n550 U.S. at 556).  The court \" must accept as true all factual allegations in the complaint and draw all \nreasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party.\"  Retail Prop. Tr. v. United Bhd. of Carpenters & \nJoiners of Am. , 768 F.3d 938, 945 (9th Cir. 2014).  Bare assertions that amount to mere \"formulaic recitation \nof the elements\"  of a claim \"are conclusory and not entitled to be assumed true. \"  Iqbal , 556 U.S. at 681.   \nIn ruling on a  FRCP (12)(b)(6) motion to dismiss, a court may \"consider only allegations contained in the \npleadings, exhibits attached to the complaint, and matters properly subject to judicial notice. \"  Swartz v. \nKPMG LLP, 476 F.3d 756, 763 (9th Cir. 2007)  (per curi am) (citation omitted) . \n  The court must construe pleadings by self -represented  plaintiffs liberally \"and must afford \nplaintiff  the benefit of any doubt. \"  Karim -Panahi v. L.A. Police Dep't , 839 F.2d 621, 623 (9th Cir. 1988)  \n(citation omitted) , aff'd, 15 F.3d 1086 ( 9th Cir. 1994) .  Before dismissing a complaint, a court must give a Case 3:25-cv-00051-AN      Document 18      Filed 02/14/25      Page 3 of 144 \n statement of the complaint's deficiencies and must give leave to amend the complaint unless it is \"absolutely \nclear \" that the deficiencies could not be cured by amendment.   Id. (internal qu otation marks omitted ) \n(quoting Noll v. Carlson, 809 F.2d 1446, 1448 (9th Cir. 1987) , superseded by statute on other grounds as \nstated in Lopez v. S mith, 160 F.3d 567, 570 (9th Cir. 1998), rev'd and remanded on other grounds , 203 F.3d \n1122 (9th Cir. 2000) ), abrogated on other grounds as stated in Cuviello v. City & Cnty. of San Francisco, \n940 F. Supp. 2d 1071, 1090 (N.D. Cal. Apr. 15, 2013) . \n  a. Trade Secret Misappropriation Claim  \n  To state a claim for trade secret misappropriation under the D efend Trade Secrets Act \n(\"DTSA\") , \"a plaintiff must allege that: (1) the plaintiff owned a trade secret; (2) the defendant \nmisappropriated the trade secret; and (3) the defendant's actions damaged the plaintiff. \"  Alta Devices, Inc. \nv. LG Elec s., Inc., 343 F. Supp. 3d 868, 877, 883 (N.D. Cal. 2018).   \n  The DTSA defines trade secrets as \" all forms and types of financial, business, scientific, \ntechnical, economic, or engineering information[ .]\"  18 U.S.C. § 1839(3).  To allege the existence of a trade \nsecret, a plaintiff must demonstrate that (1) the information is not \"readily ascertainable through proper \nmeans\"  and (2) \"derives independent economic value, \" and (3) the plaintiff  took \"reasonable measures to \nkeep such information secret [.]\"  18 U.S.C. § 1839(3) (A)-(B).  A plaintiff must identify a trade secret with \nsufficient particularity.  AlterG, Inc. v. Boost Treadmills LLC , 388 F. Supp. 3d 1133, 1144 (N.D. Cal. 2019) .  \n\"'A plaintiff need not spell out the details of the trade secret, ' but must 'describe the subject matter of the \ntrade secret with sufficient particularity to separate it from matters of general knowledge in the trade or of \nspecial persons who are skilled in the trade, and to permit the defendant to ascertain at least the boundaries  \nwithin which the secret lies. '\"  Id. (footnote and citation omitted).  To determine whether a plaintiff \nsufficiently identified a trade secret,  a court examine s \"(1) whether something beyond general knowledge \nis being claimed and (2) whether there is enough specificity to put the defendant on notice regarding the \nnature of the trade secret. \"  Beluca Ventures LLC v. Einride Aktiebolag, 660 F. Supp. 3d 898, 909 (N.D. \nCal. 2023) (citation omitted).  \n  Here, plaintiff has not identified his purported trade secrets with sufficient particularity .  Case 3:25-cv-00051-AN      Document 18      Filed 02/14/25      Page 4 of 145 \n Plaintiff alleges that he \"developed a revolutionary approach to AGI based on quantum mechanics and \ngeneral relativity theories, distinctly different from current mainstream Al approaches \" and that he \nincorporated EraNova \" to explore commercialization opportunities \" regarding that AGI technology.  Am. \nCompl. ¶ ¶ 11, 13.  However, plaintiff  does not name  a single  trade secret relating to the AGI technology \nthat w as allegedly misappropriated, let alone describe the trade secret with any particularity.  The most \nspecific of plaintiff's allegations provides:  \n\"Plaintiff's AGI technology constitutes trade secrets within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. \n§ 1839(3) because: a. It derives independent economic value from not being generally \nknown or readily ascertainable; b. Plaintiff has taken reasonable measures to maintain its secrecy; c. The technology is used in interstate commerce through Internet -based \napplicati ons; d. The technology has been specifically validated by senior U.S. intelligence \nofficials as having strategic significance [.]\" \n \nAm. Compl. ¶  18.  These vague  assertions  are not \"sufficient to ascertain at least the boundaries within \nwhich the [ alleged trade] secrets lie and the scope of appropriate discovery .\"  Cisco Sys., Inc. v. Chung, 462 \nF. Supp. 3d 1024, 1049 (N.D. Cal. 2020)  (internal quotation marks and citation omitted) ; see Vesta Corp. \nv. Amdocs Mgmt. Ltd., No. 14- cv-1142- HZ, 2018 WL 830141, at *3 (D. Or. Feb. 12, 2018)  (citation \nomitted)  (\"The reasonable particularity standard required [the ] [p]laintiff to provide specific references to \nconcrete documents and characteristics of its trade secrets. \").  Moreover , plaintiff merely  states  in a \nconclusory manner that the AGI technology \"derives independent economic value from not being generally \nknown or readily ascertainable \" and that he \"has taken reasonable measures to maintain its secrecy. \"  Am. \nCompl. ¶  18.  Plaintiff fails to allege any facts to support these  conclusory  allegations , which  are merely a \nrecitation  of the elements of  a DTSA claim .  Accordingly, plaintiff has not alleged facts to adequately state \na trade secret misappropriation claim under the DTSA.  \n  b. Conversion Claim  \n  Under Oregon common law, \" [c]onversion is an intentional exercise of dominion or control \nover a chattel which so seriously interferes with the right of another to control it that the actor may justly \nbe required to pay the other the full value of the chattel.\"  Scott v. Jackson C ounty , 244 Or. App. 484, 499, \n260 P.3d 744 (2011)  (internal quotation marks omitted)  (quoting Restatement (Second) of Torts § 222A Case 3:25-cv-00051-AN      Document 18      Filed 02/14/25      Page 5 of 146 \n (1965)); see Mustola v. Toddy , 253 Or. 658, 664, 456 P.2d 1004 (1969).  To state a claim for conversion, a \nplaintiff  must allege that they were \"entitled to immediate possession  of [the] chattel \" at issue.  Willamette \nQuarries, Inc. v. Wodtli , 308 Or. 406, 413, 781 P.2d 1196 (1989)  (en banc)  (internal quotation marks \nomitted ) (quoting Artman v. Ray , 263 Or. 529, 531, 501 P.2d 63 (1972)) .  \"'Bad faith is not required; the \ngravamen of the tort is the defendant's intent to exercise control over the chattel inconsistently with the \nplaintiff's rights. '\"  K.F. Jacobsen & Co. v. Gaylor , 947 F. Supp. 2d 1120, 1128 (D. Or. 2013) (quoting \nNaas v. Lucas , 86 Or. App. 406, 409, 739 P.2d 1051 (1987)) . \n  Plaintiff alleges that he has \"the right to possession of all AGI technology, related \ndocumentation, and trade secrets\"  and that defendant \"was never granted any ownership rights to the \nunderlying AGI technology.\"   Am. Compl. ¶ ¶ 13, 22.  Plaintiff also alleges that \"[d]efendant has wrongfully \nexercised dominion over [p] laintiff's property by: a.  Refusing to return materials containing trade secrets; \nb. Claiming unauthorized ownership rights; c. Attempting to transfer or license the technology to others.\"  Id. ¶ 23.\n1  Viewing the facts in the light most favorable to plaintiff, defendant's refusal to return plaintiff's \nproperty, claiming of ownership rights, and attempts to transfer the technology to third parties together \ndemonstrate an \"intent to exercise control  over the [technology, related documentation, and trade secrets]  \ninconsistent ly with [] plaintiff's rights .\"  K.F. Jacobsen & Co., 947 F. Supp. 2d at  1128 (internal quotation \nmarks and citation omitted) .  Accordingly, at this stage, plaintiff has adequately stated a claim of \nconversion.  \n  c. Breach of Fiduciary Duty Claim  \n  To state a claim for breach of fiduciary duty under Oregon law , a plaintiff must allege the \nexistence of a fiduciary relationship between the parties , breach of a fiduciary  duty arising out of that \nrelationship , and damage  resulting from that breach.  Evergreen  W. Bus. Ctr., LLC v. Emmert , 254 Or. App. \n361, 367, 296 P.3d 545 (2012)  (citation omitted) , rev'd on other grounds , 354 Or. 790, 323 P.3d 250 (2014)  \n(en banc) .  \"[A] fiduciary duty exists  only where the parties are in a 'special relationship' in which one party \n \n1 The amended complaint contains two paragraphs numbered twenty -three.  Th e Court cites the second  reference  \nsetting forth part of plaintiff's conversion claim.  Case 3:25-cv-00051-AN      Document 18      Filed 02/14/25      Page 6 of 147 \n is obliged to pursue the other party's best interests.\"  Spada Props., Inc. v. Unified Grocers, Inc., 121 F. \nSupp. 3d 1070, 1090 (D. Or. 2015) ( quoting Conway v. Pac. Univ., 324 Or. 231, 237, 924 P.2d 818 (1996) ).  \nIn determining whether such a relationship exists:  \n\"The focus [of the court's inquiry] is not on the subject matter of the relationship, such as \none party's financial future; nor is it on whether one party, in fact, relinquished control to \nthe other.  The focus instead is on whether the nature of the parties' relationship itself  \nallowed one party to exercise control in the first party's best interests.  In other words, the \nlaw does not imply a tort duty simply because one party to a business relationship begins \nto dominate and to control the other party's financial future.  Ra ther, the law implies a tort \nduty only when that relationship is of the type that, by its nature, allows one party to \nexercise judgment on the other party's behalf. \" \n \nBennett v. Farmers Ins. Co. , 332 Or. 138, 161- 62, 26 P.3d 785 (2001) ( alteration and emphasis in original) \n(citing Conway , 324 Or. at 241).  \n  Plaintiff alleges that defendant was a co -founder of EraNova and thus \"owed fiduciary \nduties to both the company and [p]laintiff.\"  Am. Compl. ¶  26.  Plaintiff alleges that \"[d]efendant breached \nthese duties by: a.  Attempting to usurp corporate opportunities; b. Engaging in self -dealing; c. Acting \ncontrary to [p]laintiff's i nterests regarding the AGI technology.\"  Id. ¶ 27.  However, plaintiff does not \nprovide any facts , such as plaintiff and defendant's roles  within EraNova , that would allow the Court to  \ndetermine whether a fiduciary relationship  existed  between plaintiff and defendant  such that one party is \nobliged to pursue the other party's best interests .  The  Court has found no case law that supports either the \nargument that defendant and plaintiff have a fiduciary relationship simply because they co -founded a \ncompany together , or that  defendant  owes fiduciary dut ies to plaintiff because he  co-founded  a company \nwith him.  Moreover, even assuming that a fiduciary relationship existed, plaintiff does not allege any facts \nto support his assertions that defendant attempted to usurp corporate opportunities, engaged in self -dealing, \nor acted contrary to plaintiff's interests regarding the AGI technology.   Accordingly, plaintiff has not alleged \nsufficient facts to state a claim of breach of fiduciary duty.  \n  d. Tortious Interference Claim  \n  \"To state a claim for tortious interference with economic relations, plaintiff must allege \nfacts that, if taken as true, establish: (1) the existence of a professional or business relationship; Case 3:25-cv-00051-AN      Document 18      Filed 02/14/25      Page 7 of 148 \n (2) intentional interference with that relationship; (3) by a third party ; (4) accomplished through improper \nmeans or for an improper purpose; (5) a causal effect between the interference and damage to the economic \nrelationship; and (6) damages.\"  Silkett v. Royal Crown Cola Bottling Co. of N. Bend, 151 Or. App. 187, \n189-90, 947 P.2d 626 (1997) (citing McGanty v. Staudenraus , 321 Or. 532, 535, 901 P.2d 841 (1995)).  \n  Here, plaintiff alleges only that defendant \"intentionally interfered with [ plaintiff's \nbusiness] relationships by: a.  Making false claims of ownership; b.  Attempting to redirect business \nopportunities; c. Threatening to disclose trade secrets to third parties.\"  Am. Compl. ¶  31.  Plaintiff does \nnot identify any contract or prospective economic advantage or allege any other facts t hat would allow the \nCourt to find that a business relationship exists , much less one that defendant , as a third party , has \nintentionally interfered with .  Nor does plaintiff allege facts to demonstrate any improper means or  improper  \npurpose or any causal effect between the supposed interference and damage to a business relationship.  \nAccordingly, plaintiff has not alleged sufficient facts to state a claim for tortious interference with economic \nrelations.  \n 2. Lack of  Subject Matter Jurisdiction  \n  Federal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction  and must have subject matter jurisdiction \nto preside over claims .  Kokkonen v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of Am., 511 U.S. 375, 377 (1994)  (citations \nomitted).  A federal court's  original jurisdiction must be based on either f ederal question jurisdiction under \n28 U.S.C. § 1331 for \" all civil actions arising under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States \" \nor diversity jurisdiction over civil actions under 28 U.S.C. § 1332(a) where the \" matter in controversy \nexceeds the sum or value of $75,000\"  and the action is between \" citizens of different States.\"  The party \nseeking to invoke diversity jurisdiction bears the burden of pleading and proving that diversity jurisdiction \nexists.  NewGen, LLC v. Safe Cig, LLC , 840 F.3d 606, 613- 14 (9th Cir. 2016)  (citing FW/PBS, Inc.  v. City \nof Dallas , 493 U.S. 215,231 (1990)) .  \"[T]he amount in controversy is determined from the face of the \npleadings. \"  Geographic Expeditions, Inc. v. Est. of Lhotka, 599 F.3d 1102, 1106 (9th Cir. 2010)  (internal \nquotation marks and citation omitted) . \n  As described above, t he only claim that plaintiff has plausibly stated is his  state law Case 3:25-cv-00051-AN      Document 18      Filed 02/14/25      Page 8 of 149 \n conversion claim.  Therefore, plaintiff must establish  that diversity jurisdiction exists.  However, plaintiff \nalleges that both he and defendant reside in Oregon.  Am. Compl. ¶¶  6-7.  In terms of damages for his \nconversion claim, plaintiff states that defendant's actions \"have caused [p]laintiff substantial damages\"  but \ndoes not allege that the amount in controversy is greater than $75,000.   Id. ¶ 24.  Accordingly, plaintiff's \nallegations are insufficient to invoke the Court's diversity jurisdiction  over his remaining claim.  \nB. Motion for Temporary Restraining Order  \n  Even if the amended complaint were sufficient, the circumstances in th is case do not \nwarrant a temporary restraining order.  Temporary restraining orders and preliminary injunctions are \ngoverned by the same legal standard.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 65; New Motor Vehicle Bd. of Cal. v. Orrin W. \nFox Co., 434 U.S. 1345, 1347 n.2 (1977) ; Don't Shoot Portland v. City of Portland, 465 F. Supp. 3d 1150, \n1154 (D. Or. 2020 ) (citation omitted)  (collecting cases)  (calling the standards \"essentially identical\") .  A \nplaintiff seeking a temporary restraining order must show (1) they are \" likely to succeed on the merits \"; \n(2) they are \"likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief \"; (3) \"the balance of \nequities tips in [the plaintiff's ] favor \"; and (4) \" an injunction is in the public interest. \"  Winter v. Nat. Res. \nDef. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 20- 22 (2008)  (citations omitted) (collecting cases) . \n  A court may issue an ex parte  temporary restraining order without notice to the adverse \nparty only if \"specific facts in an affidavit or a verified complaint clearly show that immediate and \nirreparable injury, loss, or damage will result to the movant before the adverse party can be heard in \nopposition\" and \"the movant's attorney certifies in writing any efforts made to give notice and the reasons \nwhy it should not be required.\" Fed. R. Civ P. 65(b)(1) (A)-(B).  The circumstances under which courts will \nissue ex parte temporary restraining orders are  \"extremely limited\" because \"'our entire jurisprudence runs \ncounter to the notion of court action taken before reasonable notice and an opportunity to be heard has been \ngranted both sides of a dispute.'\"  Reno Air Racing Ass'n. v. McCord , 452 F.3d 1126, 1131 (9th Cir. 2006) \n(quoting Granny Goose Foods, Inc. v. Bhd. of Teamsters & Auto Truck Drivers Loc. No. 70 of Alameda \nCnty. , 415 U.S. 423, 438- 39 (1974)).  Courts have recognized that issuing  an ex parte  temporary restraining \norder may be appropriate in the limited circumstances \"where notice to the adverse party is impossible Case 3:25-cv-00051-AN      Document 18      Filed 02/14/25      Page 9 of 1410 \n either because the identity of the adverse party is unknown or because a known party cannot be located in \ntime for a hearing\" or \"because notice to the defendant would render fruitless the further prosecution of the \naction.\"  Id.  (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  \n  Plaintiff argues that ex parte relief is necessary because \"[ d]efendant would likely respond  \nto notice of these proceedings [] by taking immediate actions to frustrate the purpose of this lawsuit.\"  Mot. \nfor TRO 4.  Plaintiff alleges that when he attempted to assert control over his trade secrets, defendant \n\"responded with a calculated threat\" that defendant would \"demand $1.5 mil lion in retroactive fees\" if \nplaintiff succeeded in this action.  Id. at 3.  Plaintiff asserts that this threat \"was an explicit attempt to coerce \n[p]laintiff  into abandoning legal protection of his intellectual property by threatening ruinous financial \nconsequences for winning.\"  Id. at 4.  Additionally, plaintiff alleges that \"[g]iven [d]efendant's demonstrated \npattern of retaliation and current recruitment of developers,\" notice would allow defendant to \"[ a]ccelerate \ndisclosure of trade secrets to third parties [,]\" \"[d]estroy or conceal evidence [,]\" \"[t]ransfer sensitive files[ ,]\" \nand otherwise retaliate  against him .  Id.  Plaintiff further argues that \"extraordinary U.S. intelligence interest \ncreates immediate personal danger to [p]laintiff\" because defendant's disclosure of portions of the AGI \ntechnology with third parties will likely cause \"foreign intelligence agencies \" to \"target [p]laintiff more \naggressively since [plaintiff] possesses the complete technology.\"  Id.  at 5.  Plaintiff argues that this risk is \nheightened because the AGI technology \"was specifically validated as 'bona fide general artificial \nintelli gence poised to disrupt most things in our economy/world' by senior U.S. intelligence officials.\"  Id. \nat 6.  Finally, plaintiff argues that security risks will continue to arise from any further disclosure of trade \nsecrets because of \"[e]vidence that [d]efendant's systems are already compromised [,]\" \"[t]he documented \ninterest of sophisticated state actors [,]\" and \" [t]he strategic significance of AGI technology in current \ngeopolitical competition.\"  Id. at 7.  \n  The circumstances of this case are not among the \"very few circumstances justifying the \nissuance of an ex parte TRO.\"  Reno Air Racing Ass'n., Inc., 452 F.3d at 1131.  Notice to defendant is not \nimpossible.  Although plaintiff ha s not yet served defendant or given him notice of the action , plaintiff has \nlisted defendant's address in previous filings.  Moreover, providing notice to defendant would not render Case 3:25-cv-00051-AN      Document 18      Filed 02/14/25      Page 10 of 1411 \n fruitless further prosecution of the case.  Plaintiff's assertions  of likely accelerated disclosure of trade \nsecrets, destruction of evidence , and retaliation by defendant  are wholly speculative.  Contrary to plaintiff's \nassertions, an allegedly spoofed email and a message on a social networking site by an unknown sender \nintroducing plaintiff to an unknown recipient  demonstrate neither  breaches  to defendant's \"systems\" nor \n\"validation\" of the AGI technology by U.S. or foreign intelligence agencies.  See Mot. for TRO Exs. G, J.  \nPlaintiff does not allege any facts to allow the Court to find that defendant would frustrate the purpose of \nthis lawsuit if given notice.   Accordingly, issuing  an ex parte  temporary restraining  order  is not warranted.  \n  As for the Winter  factors, plaintiff argue s that he is  likely to succeed on the merits of  his \ntrade secret misappropriation claim  under the DTSA  because the AGI technology constitutes legal protected \ntrade secrets validated by U.S. intelligence agencies , and defendant has misappropriated these trade secrets  \nby retaining and claiming ownership over the trade secrets and recruiting developers to implement the AGI technology.  Plaintiff also argue s that he will suffer immediate and irreparable harm because defendant is \ncurrently recruiting developers and implementation of the AGI technology will require disclosure of trade secrets;  \"[d]efendant's system has been breached,\" which \"enables unauthorized access to trade secrets\" ; \nand the \"[c]urrent geopolitical climate heightened risks\" and \" [e]ach disclosure [of trade secrets] creates \nnew attack vectors.\"  Id.  at 8-9.  Plaintiff further argues that the balance of equities heavily favors granting \nrelief because defendant would not suffer legitimate harm from being prevented from misappropriating trade secrets that he has no right to possess, and \"[a]ny claimed hardship stems entirely from [defendant's ] \nown wrongful conduct[.]\"  Id.  at 9.  Finally, plaintiff argues that the public interest strongly favors protecting \n\"validated sensitive technology from unauthorized disclosure \" because of the \"documented interest of U.S. \nintelligence agencies[ ,]\" \"strategic significance of AGI technology [,]\" and \"need to prevent improper \ncoercion and protect technologies with national security implications.\"  Id.  at 9-10. \n  Even if the Court could issue a temporary restraining order ex parte , a temporary \nrestraining order is not warranted in these circumstances.  As explained above, at this stage plaintiff has \nfailed to even state a plausible claim of trade secret misappropriation under the DTSA, let alone demonstrate  \nthat he is likely to succeed on the merits of such a claim.  Plaintiff also fails to allege any facts to support Case 3:25-cv-00051-AN      Document 18      Filed 02/14/25      Page 11 of 1412 \n his remaining assertions.  Accordingly, the Court denies this motion, including plaintiff's request for in \ncamera  review . \nC. Motion to Seal  \n  Plaintiff also fails to articulate any compelling reason s to seal this case.   Courts \"recognize \na general right to inspect and copy public records and documents, including judicial records and documents.\"  Nixon v. Warner Commc'ns, Inc., 435 U.S. 589, 597 (1978)  (footnotes omitted) . As a result, \nthere is \"a strong presumption in favor of access to court records.\"  Foltz v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. , \n331 F.3d 1122, 1135 (9th Cir. 2003)  (citations omitted) . \n  A party seeking to seal a judicial record \" must articulate compelling reasons supported by \nspecific factual findings that outweigh the general history of access and the public policies favoring disclosure, such as the public interest in understanding the judicial process.\"  Kamakana v. City & Cnty. of Honolulu, 447 F.3d 1172, 1178- 79 (9th Cir. 2006) (internal quotation marks, alteration , and citations \nomitted).  The court must then \"'conscientiously balance[] the competing interests' of the public and the party who seeks to keep certain judicial records secret.\"  Id. at 1179 (alteration in original) (quoting Foltz , \n331 F.3d at 1135).  The court has discretion to determine whether compelling reasons exist; examples \ninclude where judicial records \" might have become a vehicle for improper purposes, such as the use of \nrecords to gratify private spite, promote public scandal, circulate libelous statements, or release trade \nsecrets.\"  Id. (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). \n  Plaintiff seeks to seal the entire case for forty -five days; file redacted versions of court \ndocuments with sensitive technical and security information that will remain redacted for ten years; and \npermanently seal plaintiff's application to proceed IFP .  Plaintiff argues that \"malicious actors are already \nattempting to access the technology through multiple vectors.\"  Renewed Ex Parte Mot. to Seal, ECF [13], \nat 5.  Additionally, plaintiff argues that an \"exponential increase in state -sponsored technology theft \nattempts makes protection particularly critical for AGI technology that has been specifically validated by \nU.S. intelligence agencies.\"  Id. at 5-6.  Plaintiff further argues that he has \"additional sensitive evidence\" \nthat the Court should review in camera.  Id. at 6-7.  Plaintiff argues that redaction alone would be Case 3:25-cv-00051-AN      Document 18      Filed 02/14/25      Page 12 of 1413 \n insufficient because \"redacted filings would draw heightened attention from intelligence services,\" which \nwould in turn \"increase[] targeting of individuals associated with the technology through cyber operations \nor other means.\"  Id. at 7.  Finally, plaintiff seeks to permanently seal his IFP application because the \ninformation therein \"would provide adversaries with data points for developing targeting profiles [,]\" and \n\"[p]revious attempts to influence [p]laintiff's work included sophisticated social engineering operations \nusing detailed personal and financial profiling[ .]\"  Id. at 8.  \n  Again, p laintiff fail s to present any compelling reasons or factual findings to support his  \nbroad request s to seal and  redact .  As for the request to seal the entire case for forty -five days, there is no \nevidence of \"U.S. intelligence interest,\" \"validation\" of the AGI technology, or \"active attempts to \ncompromise the technology.\"  Id.  at 5-6.  A s stated above , an allegedly spoofed email is not evidence of \ncompromises to defendant's \"system\" or \"unauthorized access to confidential communications.\"  Id. at 5.  \nAs for the request to redact documents, plaintiff has not filed any documents regarding his alleged trade \nsecrets that might justify redaction, nor has he submitted any proposed reda ctions.  As for the request to \npermanently seal his IFP application, there is no evidence that the information in th at document  \"would \nprovide adversaries with data points for developing targeting profiles.\"  Id.  at 8.  Plaintiff  continues to  make \nonly speculative,  conclusory assertions that he or the  AGI technology will be subject to safety risks or \ntargeted by alleged foreign actors.   Because plaintiff do es not articulate any compelling reasons  to seal , he \ncannot overcome the presumption in favor of public access to judicial records.  See Kamakana, 447 F.3d at \n1178- 79.  Accordingly, the Court also denies this motion, including pla intiff's request for in camera review . \n \n \n \n   \n Case 3:25-cv-00051-AN      Document 18      Filed 02/14/25      Page 13 of 1414 \n CONCLUSION \n  For the foregoing reasons, plaintiff's IFP application, ECF [15], is GRANTED, and \nplaintiff 's Renewed Ex Parte Motion for Temporary Restraining Order, ECF [16 ], and Renewed Ex Parte \nMotion to Seal, ECF [13], are DENIED.   The Court orders plaintiff to show cause in writing by March  17, \n2025, why the Amended Complaint , ECF [14],  should not be dismissed for failure to state a claim and for \nlack of subject matter  jurisdiction.  Alternatively, plaintiff may file a  second amended complaint curing the \ndefects outlined above by that date.   \n  \nIT IS SO ORDERED.  \n \nDATED this 14th  day of February , 2025. \n \n______________________  \nAdrienne Nelson United States District Judge  \nCase 3:25-cv-00051-AN      Document 18      Filed 02/14/25      Page 14 of 14",

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: In this court case, Overjet, a dental AI company, brought several claims including trademark, copyright, and patent infringement against its competitor VideaHealth. The dispute centers around the use of AI in scanning dental X-rays to detect diseases, with Overjet alleging that VideaHealth has copied its proprietary methods and designs. The court denied VideaHealth's motion to dismiss several of Overjet's claims, finding sufficient plausibility in the allegations related to copyright and patent infringement.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: The key legal issue is whether VideaHealth infringed on Overjet's copyright and patent by allegedly adopting and copying Overjet’s unique combination of design elements and technological methods in its dental AI products.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court held that Overjet has provided sufficient factual allegations to suggest potential copyright and patent infringement by VideaHealth. Consequently, VideaHealth's motion to dismiss these claims was denied, allowing the case to proceed.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine you're in a race to invent the best robot helper for the dentist. Overjet, one team, made their robot really good at seeing cavities by teaching it to color-code X-ray images in a special way, which is like making a coloring book with unique colors and lines. Videa, another team, saw this and started using similar colors and lines in their robot's images, which made Overjet upset. They went to a judge to say, \"Hey, they copied our kind of coloring book!\" The judge said, \"Okay, you might have a point. Let's look into this more,\" and didn't throw out the case.",

(“Videa” or “Defendant”) for trademark infringement, copyright infringement, \npatent infringement, false advertising, and unfair competition .  [ECF No. 1 (“Complaint” or \n“Compl.”) ¶ 1].  Presently before the Court is Videa’s motion to dismiss certain claims of the Complaint.  [ECF No. 36].  For the reasons stated herein, the motion is DENIED.   \n  Case 1:24-cv-10446-ADB     Document 54     Filed 03/28/25     Page 1 of 262 \n \n I. BACKGROUND  \nThe following facts are taken from Overjet’s  Complaint,  the factual allegations of which \nare assumed to be true when considering a motion to dismiss.  See Ruivo v. Wells Fargo Bank, \nN.A. , 766 F.3d 87, 90 (1st Cir. 2014).  As it may on a motion to dismiss, the Court has also \nconsidered “documents incorporated by reference in [the complaint], matters of public record, and other matters susceptible to judicial notice.”  Giragosian v. Ryan, 547 F.3d 59, 65 (1st Cir. \n2008) (alteration in original) (quoting In re Colonial Mortg. Bankers Corp., 324 F.3d 12, 20 (1st \nCir. 2003)). \nA. Factual Background \nOverjet  is a dental artificial intelligence (“AI”) company  formed i n 2018 and \nheadquartered in Boston, Massachusetts.  [Compl. ¶¶ 8 –10].  Overjet uses AI to scan dental \nradiographic X- rays and detect dental diseases.  [ Id. ¶ 9].   Specifically, Overjet uses an approach \ncalled “ segmentation ” to detect the exact border and extent of caries on the tooth.1  [Id. ¶¶ 11, \n13].  The segmentation approach allows Overjet “to outline exactly where pathologies exist.”  [Id. ¶ 10].  This approach differs from the “bounded box” approach, which is a “‘detection’ \napproach that can localize and distinguish between objects with an [X] -ray image , and can place \na ‘box’ around the area detected, such as an area on a specific tooth where caries were found.”  [Id. ¶ 11].   For comparison, I mage 1 below is an example of an annotated X- ray created by \nOverjet’s software using the segmentation approach, [id. ¶¶ 3 0, 45], and I mage 2 represents the \n“bounded box” approach, [id. ¶ 64].   \n \n \n \n1 “‘Caries ’ refers to ‘a progressive destruction of bone or tooth,’ such as a cavity. ”  [Compl. at 4 \nn.1].  Case 1:24-cv-10446-ADB     Document 54     Filed 03/28/25     Page 2 of 263 \n \n  \nImage 1—Overjet ’s Segmentation Approach  \n \nImage 2 —Bounded -Box Approach  \n \nCase 1:24-cv-10446-ADB     Document 54     Filed 03/28/25     Page 3 of 264 \n \n Overjet obtained U.S. Patent No. 11,158,046 titled “Estimating Measurements of \nCraniofacial Structures in Dental Radiography” on October 26, 2021.  [Compl. ¶ 47]; [ECF No. \n1-4 (the “’ 046 Patent”)].  Specifically, the ’046 Patent “discloses a novel system and method for \nproviding segmentation and measurements of dental radiographic images.”  [Compl. ¶ 49].   \nOverjet is  “the only dental AI company with United States Food and Drug \nAdministration (“FDA”) clearance for performing dental detection and segmentation to outline exactly where pathologies exist.”  [Compl. ¶ 10].  Specifically , Overjet has applied for and \nobtained the following FDA pre- market clearances:  \n• Overjet Dental Assist :  On Ja\n nuary 25, 2021, Overjet applied for 510(k) \nPremarket clearance for “Overjet Dental Assist” (FDA 510(k) No. K210187), \nwhich “is a radiological semi -automated image processing software intended to \naid dental professionals in the measurements of mesial and distal bone levels associated with each tooth from bitewing and periapical radiographs.”  [Compl. ¶ 15].  The product received clearance on May 19, 2021.  [ Id.].   \n \n• Overjet Caries Assist :  On Augus t 10, 2021, Overjet applied for 510(k) Premarket \nclearance for “Overjet Caries Assist” (FDA 510(k) No. K212519), which allows for segmentation of caries on bitewing radiographs.  [Compl. ¶ 16].  The Caries Assist  was cleared on May 10, 2022, and indicated for use on patients at least 18 \nyears of age.  [ Id.].  On September 12, 2022, Overjet applied for pre- clearance of \nanother Caries Assist version  (FDA 510(k) No. K222746), which was approved \non March 27, 2023 and “expanded the age range and image type and improved model accuracy for caries,” all owing the software to be used on patients 12 years \nof age and older.  [ Id. ¶ 17].  \n \n• Overjet Calculus Assist:  On March 31, 2022, Overjet applied for premarket \nclearance for “Overjet Calculus Assist”  (FDA 510(k) No. K220928), “a \nradiological automated concurrent-read computer- assisted detection software” \nused to detect “interproximal calculus deposits on bitewing and periapical radiographs” for patients 18 years of age or older.  [Compl. ¶ 18].  The product \nwas cleared on December 16, 2022.  [ Id.].   \n \n• Periapical Radiolucency Assist :  On June  9, 2023, Overjet applied for premarket \nclearance of Overjet’s Periapical Radiolucency  (“PARL”) Assist software  (FDA \n510(k) No. K231678), “a radiological, automated, concurrent read computer-assisted detection software” to detect “periapical radiolucencies on permanent teeth captured on periapical radiographs.”  [Compl. ¶ 19].  PARL was cleared on September 21, 2023, for use on patients 12 years of age or older.  [ Id.].   Case 1:24-cv-10446-ADB     Document 54     Filed 03/28/25     Page 4 of 265 \n \n  \n• Overjet Charting Assist:  On February 23, 2024, the FDA cleared “Overjet \nCharting Assist.”  [Compl. ¶ 20].   \n \nOverjet’s software, used by dental practices, dental services organizations (“DSOs”), and \ninsuran\nce companies, allows clinicians to better detect dental diseases and devise treatment \nplans.  [Compl. ¶¶ 9, 33].  Obtaining FDA clearance for its  software has “contribute[d] to \nOverjet’s success in the marketplace” and gives it a competitive advantage.  [ Id. ¶¶ 11, 13, 33].   \nSince its inception in 2018, Overjet “has invested substantial resources creating and \nimproving various iterations of its software.”  [Compl. ¶ 14].  Adopting the naming convention \n“Overjet [X] Assist,” it has named its software products “Overjet Dental Assist,” “Overjet Caries Assist,” “Overjet Calculus Assist,” “Overjet Periapical Radiolucency Assist,” and “Overjet Charting Assistant.”  [ Id.].  To that end, “Overjet owns a United States federal trademark \nregistration for the mark DENTAL ASSIST (Reg. No. 7,124,822) in connection with ‘Software as a medical device service (SAAS) []  featuring software used by dentists and hygienists to \ndetect and measure dental disease’ in International Class 44. ”  [Id. ¶ 25] ; see also  [ECF No. 1-1].  \nSince May 2021, Overjet has been using the “DENTAL ASSIST” trademark to market and sell \nits software.2  [Id. ¶ 22].   \nOverjet employs “color schemes, shapes, and designs ” to help visualize the detection of \ndiseases  and other findings on dental X- rays, using its copyrighted computer programs.  [Compl. \n¶ 29].  Overjet owns two copyright registrations  for its computer program: (i) U.S. Copyright \nRegistration Number TX 9-344-133 for its computer program titled “Overjet Code 2022,” which was first published on April 26, 2022, and (ii) U.S. Copyright Registration Number TX 9-344-\n \n \n2 Overjet applied to register the DENTAL ASSIST Mark on April 22, 2022, and it was registered \non August 1, 2023, with a first use of date in May 2021.  [Compl. ¶ 25].   Case 1:24-cv-10446-ADB     Document 54     Filed 03/28/25     Page 5 of 266 \n \n 155 for its computer program titled “Overjet Code 2023” (collectively, the “ Overjet  code”),  \nwhich was first published on September 21, 2023.  [ Id. ¶¶ 39 –45]; see also  [ECF Nos. 1-2, 1- 3].  \nThe Overjet code covers “the copyrightable expression in the program code and the \ncopyrightable expression in screen displays that the program generates.”  [Compl. ¶¶ 39, 42].   \nIn the fall of 2023, Overjet  launched its “Anatomical Structures Visualization Tool”  \n(“Visualization Tool”)  for Overjet Caries Assist , which introduced the coloring scheme and \ndesign at issue in the instant motion.  [Compl. ¶¶ 29–30].  The  tool annotates X- rays, using white \nto represent enamel, purple to denote the pulp of a tooth, bright green lines with circles at the ends to indicate measurements of bone levels,  and red and translucency to mark areas of decay.  \n[Id. ¶ 30].  Overjet chose these colors and shapes to create a “contrast with the gray scale” of the \nX-rays, with the ultimate goal of assisting with “patient assessment, diagnosis, and treatment \nplanning.”  [ Id. ¶¶ 33–34].  It also selected  the design and colors to help with  brand \nidentification; the purple, for example, complements Overjet’s purple brand color.  [ Id. ¶ 35].  \nBelow is an example of an annotated X- ray created by  the Overjet  code, displaying the \nsegmentation approach.

[Compl. ¶¶ 31, 88].   \nVidea is also a dental AI company  that us es A I to scan X- rays and detect dental diseases.  \n[Compl. ¶ 56].  Founded in 2018, Videa is Overjet’s direct competitor, and the two companies \ncontend “for the same customers and market their product in the same forums, including at trade shows and dental conferences.”  [ Id. ¶¶ 55, 57–58].  \nVidea holds FDA clearance for  various indications and adopted naming conventions such \nas “Videa Caries Assist,” “Videa Perio Assist,” and “ Videa Dental Assist” for its software \nproducts.  [Compl. ¶ 59] .  Videa has obtained FDA clearance for the following software \nproducts: \n• Videa Caries Assist :  On Dec ember 6, 2021, Videa filed a 510(k) application with \nthe FDA for “Videa Caries Assist,” which was cleared on April 21, 2022.  \n[Compl. ¶ 60].  The FDA clearance states that Videa Caries Assis t, when  \n“[p]rovided proper authentication and a bitewing image, [] returns a set of bounding boxes representing the various lesions detected.”  [ Id. ¶ 62].   \n \n• Videa Perio Assist : On Oct ober 26, 2022, Videa filed a 510(k) application with \nthe FDA for Videa Perio Assist, which was cleared on February 6, 2023.  [Compl. \n¶ 65].   \n \n• Videa Den\ntal Assist :3 On August 8, 2023, Videa filed a 510(k) application for the \n“Videa Dental Assist” device, which the FDA granted on December 15, 2023.  [Compl. ¶ 66].  The clearance states that  for Videa Dental Assist, when  \n“[p]rovided proper authentication and an eligible bitewing, periapical or panoramic image, the device returns a set of bounding boxes representing the suspect dental finding, historical treatment or normal anatomy detected.”  [ Id. ¶ \n69].    \n \n \n3 During the preliminary injunction briefing, the Court learned that, in response to Overjet’s \nComplaint, VideaHealth changed “Videa Dental Assist” to “Videa Dental AI.”  [ECF No. 22 -1 \n¶ 26].  For purposes of the instant motion, the Court continues to refer to the product as “Videa Dental Assist.”  Case 1:24-cv-10446-ADB     Document 54     Filed 03/28/25     Page 7 of 268 \n \n Beginning in early December 2023, Videa “ started to  use and/or to advertise its ability to \nuse segmentation instead of bounding boxes.”  [Compl. ¶ 86].  Overjet alleges that Videa shifted \naway from it s historical bounding approach  “to a segmentation approach in a manner that \ndirectly copies the design and intellectual property of Overjet’s . . . Visualization Tool.”  [ Id. ¶ \n87].  For example, during the Heartland Dental Winter Conference on December 9, 2023, Videa displayed the below image, which Overjet  contends is  a direct copy of its  Visualization Tool.  \n[Id. ¶ 91].\n4   \nAt the same conference, Videa also displayed a  purported infringing image at its bo oth, \nand Videa’s CEO, Florian Hillen, made a presentation discussing Videa’s segmentation capabilities .  [Compl. ¶¶ 93–94].  Beginning in approximately January 2024, Videa began to \nadvertise its segmentation capability on its website, in blog posts, and on YouTube, including using images such as the one below.  [ Id. ¶¶ 72–86, 95–101] ; [ECF No.  1-6 at 15].   \n \n \n4 Overjet directs the Court to six infringing images.

[Compl. ¶ 88].  On December 5, 2023, Heartland announced that it had selected \nVidea as its dental AI partner.  [ Id. ¶ 90].5   \nB. Procedural History  \nOn February 23, 2024, Overjet brought the following claims against Videa:  federal \ntrademark infringement, 15 U.S.C. § 1125(a) (Count I) ; Massachusetts common l aw trademark \ninfringement (Count II) ; copyright infringement (Count II I); false advertising under both federal, \n15 U.S.C. § 1125(a) (Count IV), and Massachusetts law , Mass. Gen. Laws c h. 266, § 91 (Count \nV); federal unfair competition  and false designation of origin under the Lanham Act , 15 U.S.C. \n§ 1125(a) (Count VI); unfair competition under Massachusetts law , Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A, \n§ 11 (Count VII), and common law (Count VIII); direct patent infringement, 35 U.S.C. § 271(a) \n(Count IX); and indirect patent infringement, 35 U.S.C. § 271(b)–( c) (Count X).  Also on \nFebruary 23, 2024, Overjet filed a motion for preliminary injunction  on the trademark, copyright, \nand false advertising claims , [ECF No. 8], which, after holding oral argument on April 11, 2024, \n[ECF No. 40], the Court denied on July 19, 2024, [ECF No. 50].6  Videa filed the instant motion \nto dismiss Counts III, VI, VII, VIII, IX, and  X on April 9, 2024, [ECF No. 36], and Overjet \nopposed on May 7, 2024, [ECF No. 43].  On May 29, 2024, Videa filed a reply, [ECF No. 46], \nand Overjet responded on June 5, 2024, [ECF No. 49].    \n \n \n5 Independent of this contract, Overjet currently works with over 150 Heartland D ental offices.  \n[Compl. ¶ 88].   \n6 At oral argument, Videa assured the Court that it had cured the alleged trademark infringement \nallegations, and Overjet agreed to withdraw any allegations related to Videa’s purported use of \nits trademark.  See [ECF No. 38 at 4:4–5:24].  The Court accordingly did not rule on Overjet’s \ntrademark infringement claims in the preliminary injunction order .    Case 1:24-cv-10446-ADB     Document 54     Filed 03/28/25     Page 10 of 2611 \n \n II. LEGAL STANDARD  \nIn evaluat ing a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, the Court \nmust\n accept as true all well -pled facts, analyze those facts in the light most hospitable to the \nplaintiff ’s theory, and draw all reasonable inferences from those facts in favor of the plaintiff.  \nU.S. ex rel. Hutcheson v. Blackstone Med., Inc., 647 F.3d 377, 383 (1st Cir. 2011).  To avoid \ndismissal, a complaint must set forth “factual allegations, either direct or inferential, respecting \neach material element necessary to sustain recovery under some actionable legal theory.”  Gagliardi v. Sullivan, 513 F.3d 301, 305 (1st Cir. 2008) (internal quotations and citation \nomitted).  The plaintiff ’s obligation to articulate the basis of her claims “requires more than \nlabels and conclusions.”  Bell Atl.  Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007).  The facts \nalleged, when taken together, mus t be sufficient to “state a claim to relief that is plausible on its \nface.”  A.G. ex rel. Maddox v. Elsevier, Inc., 732 F.3d 77, 80 (1st Cir. 2013) (quoting Twombly, \n550 U.S. at 570).  “A claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.”  Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) (citation omitted). \nIII. DISCUSSI ON \nA. Copyright Infringement (Count III)  \nWith regard to Count III, Overjet alleges that Videa incorporated all of the protected \nelements o\nf Overjet’s copyright, including the use of white to represent enamel, purple to denote \npulp, reddish to represent areas of decay, and bright green lines with dots on the end to depict measurements of bone levels.  [Compl. ¶ 102] ; compar e [Overjet Approach], with  [Videa \nApproach].   \n Case 1:24-cv-10446-ADB     Document 54     Filed 03/28/25     Page 11 of 2612 \n \n To establish copyright infringement, Overjet must show: (1) ownership of a valid \ncopyright in a\n work; and (2) a copying of constituent elements of the work that are original.  \nFeist Publ’ns, Inc. v. Rural Tel. Serv. Co., 499 U.S. 340, 361 (1991).  The second prong consists \nof a “bifurcated inquiry.”  Coquico, Inc. v. Rodríguez- Miranda, 562 F.3d 62, 66 (1st Cir. 2009).  \nOverjet must establish that (i) Videa “copied [its] copyrighted work as a factual matter” and (ii) \n“that the copying . . . was so extensive that it rendered the infringing and copyrighted works ‘substantially similar. ’”  Segrets, Inc. v. Gillman Knitwear Co., 207 F.3d 56, 60 (1st Cir. \n2000) ( citing Lotus Dev. Corp. v. Borland Int’ l, Inc. , 49 F.3d 807, 813 (1st Cir. 1995), aff ’d, 516 \nU.S. 233 (1996)).  “A plaintiff bears the burden of proving that the work, as a whole, is original and that it has ‘ complied with the applicable statutory formalities. ’”  Soc’y of the Holy \nTransfiguration Monastery, Inc. v. Archbishop Gregory of Denver, 685 F. Supp. 2d 217, 225 (D. \nMass. 2010) (quoting Lotus Dev. Corp., 49 F.3d at 813), aff ’d sub nom. Soc’y of Holy \nTransfiguration Monastery, Inc. v. Gregory, 689 F.3d 29 (1st Cir. 2012).  A certificate of \ncopyright registration is “ prima facie  evidence of copyrightability and shift s the burden to the \ndefendant” to establish the invalidity of the copyright.  Id.  (quoting Lotus Dev. Corp., 49 F.3d at \n813).  \nHere, Videa challenges the second component, that is , the copying of or iginal elements of \nthe copyrighted work.7  [ECF No. 37 at 10].  Specifically, Videa argues that Overjet’s use of \n \n \n7 The Court notes that Videa applies the so -called “abstraction -filtration -comparison” test when \nchallenging Overjet’s copyright infringement claim.  [ECF No. 37 at 10–13].  Videa is correct \nthat computer programs such as the Overjet code may be literal ly copied, referring to a \nprogram’s source code, or, as here, non- literally  copied , which encompasses a “program’s \nsequence,  structure, organization and user interface.”  McEnroe v. Mantissa Corp., No. 14- cv-\n12320, 2016 WL 7799636, at *9 n.6 (D. Mass. Feb. 29, 2016).  When assessing non- literal \n Case 1:24-cv-10446-ADB     Document 54     Filed 03/28/25     Page 12 of 2613 \n \n common colors and shapes is not entitled to copyright protection because they are not \nsuffic\niently original and only serve a functional purpose.  [ECF No. 37 at 11–12] ; [ECF No. 46 at \n7–10].  Overjet replies that it does not claim that the underlying elements —that is, individual \ncolors and shapes —are copyrightable, but rather that the combination and arrangement  of color \nschemes, shapes, and translucencies  are protected by copyright.  [ECF No. 43 at 8 (citing Compl. \n¶¶ 29 –30)].  Overjet contends that it “selected specific, arbitrary color and highlighting schemes \nto present results generated by its software” and that such “expressive choices are protected by copyright.”  [ Id.].  Overjet further asserts that the combination of its design elements is  not \ndictated by diagnostic necessity and does  not just serve a functional purpose.  [ Id. at 11 –13].     \nAt this juncture, the Court is satisfied that Overjet has adequately  pled that the \ncombination of colors, shades, and shapes is original.  “Original, as the term is used in copyright, means only that the work was independently created by the author (as opposed to copied from other works), and that it possesses at least some minimal degree of creativity.”  Feist  Publ’ns, \n \n \ninfringement claims, courts in this Circuit apply the “abstraction -filtration -comparison” test  \ndeveloped by Comput. Assocs. Int’l, Inc. v. Altai, Inc., 982 F.2d 693, 706 (2d Cir. 1992)).  Id.; \nLotus Dev. Corp., 49 F.3d at 814.  The filtration step ordinarily requires a Court to “dissect the \nallegedly copied program’s structure and isolate each level of abstraction contained within it.”  \nAltai, 982 F.2d at 707.  Because Overjet, as Videa concedes, has already identified the alleged \nprotectable “materials,” namely the shapes, colors, and shading used in the annotation of X- rays, \n[Compl. ¶ 102], “this Court need not engage in the abstraction process,” Real View, LLC v. 20-\n20 Techs., Inc., 683 F. Supp. 2d 147, 154 (D. Mass. 2010); [ECF No. 37 at 11] .  The filtration \nstep requires a court t o determine whether the alleged protectable “materials” identified in the \nabstraction step  are copyrightable; that is, whether they are, among other things, original or only \nserve a functional purpose.  Torah Soft Ltd. v. Drosnin, 136 F. Supp. 2d 276, 284–85 (S.D.N.Y. \n2001).   Here, O\nverjet does not formally refer to the “abstraction -filtration -comparison” test when \nresponding to Videa’s motion to dismiss.  [ECF No. 43].  That omission, however, is immaterial given that the crux of the parties’ dispute is whether Overjet’s design elements are original, the focus of the filtration  analysis.  Thus, although the Court does not refer it to it as such, given the \nparties’ briefing, the Court’s analysis is firmly situated in the filtration  step.   Case 1:24-cv-10446-ADB     Document 54     Filed 03/28/25     Page 13 of 2614 \n \n 499 U.S. at  345.  Although the  Court agrees tha t the individual colors and geometric shapes  are \nnot by themselves copyrightable, see, e.g. , Yankee Candle Co., Inc. v. Bridgewater Candle Co., \nLLC , 259 F.3d 25, 35 (1st Cir. 2001), the selection, arrangement , and coordination of individual \nnon-copyrightable elements have been found deserving of copyright protection, see, e.g. , \nCoquico, 562 F.3d at 68–69 (1st Cir. 2009); Feist  Publ’ns, 499 U.S. at 358 (“[T]he principal \nfocus should be on whether the selection, coordination, and arrangement are sufficiently original \nto merit protection.”); Wilson v. Brennan, 666 F. Supp. 2d 1242, 1254–55, 1267 (D.N.M. 2009), \naff’d, 390 F. App’x 780 (10th Cir. 2010).   \nIn Coquico, a case relied on by Overjet  that concerned  whether a stuffed -animal \nrendering of a coquí, a tree frog, was copyrightable, the First Circuit observed  that neither a \nrealistic depiction of a coquí nor qualities that are byproducts of the “stuffed- animal artistic \nmedium” are protected by copyrights.  562 F.3d at  68.  Nonetheless, the First Circuit explained \nthat because creating a stuffed -animal depiction of the coquí included “countless artistic \ndecisions . . . concerning the precise size, shape, posture, color, juxtaposition of featur es, \nstitching, and adornment of the toy,” plaintiff’s p roduct was copyright protected, even though the \nindividual components constituting the stuff ed animal were not themselves copyrightable.  Id. at \n68–69.  Likewise i n Wilson , an out-of- circuit case  where plaintiff created maps for a race course, \nthe court found that although physical facts such as geographic locations, landmasses, or bodies of water are not copyrightable, plaintiff’s decision s on how to depict them on the map, that is ,  \n“what geographic features and roads to emphasize, what thickness of lines to use to delineate roads, how to indicate political boundaries , and many other details,” satisfied the originality \nrequirement.  666 F. Supp. 2d at 1254–55.  Similarly , here,  Overjet made artistic choices as to \nhow to depict features on a dental radiographic image, that is , it made decisions on how to Case 1:24-cv-10446-ADB     Document 54     Filed 03/28/25     Page 14 of 2615 \n \n arrange and combine colors, shades, translucencies, and shapes.  [Compl. ¶¶ 29–30].  These \ndecisions\n meet the required modicum of creativity.  Feist Publ’ns, 499 U.S. at 345 (observing \nthat the “requisite level of creativity is extremely low” and that “even a slight amount will suffice”).   \nAt this stage of the proceeding, the Court is also not persuaded that  Overjet’\n s design \nchoices serve a mere functional purpose or that Overjet  was limited to only a few choices .  [ECF \nNo. 37 at 12–13].  17 U.S.C. § 102(b) requires a court to distinguish between an  annotated X-\nray’s “expressive aspects,” which can be copyrightable, and its functional aspects, which are not \ncopyrightable.8  See e-Steps, LLC v. Americas Leading Fin., LLC, No. 19- cv-01637, 2019 WL \n9834429, at *2 (D.P.R. Sept. 25, 2019) (citing Oracle Am., Inc. v. Google Inc., 750 F.3d 1339, \n1357 (Fed. Cir. 2014)  (“[A]nything that performs a function is necessarily uncopyrightable.”)).  \nAlthough the a\nnnotation of X- rays is in part a diagnostic tool, see [Compl. ¶ ¶ 33–34], it is not \nclear that Overjet’s decision t o use its particular arrangements of colors, shapes, and \ntranslucencies was solely guided by functionality.  In fact, one of the parties’ competitors, Pearl, uses a teal and magenta color scheme to highlight segmentation in X- rays, suggesting that \nOverjet had other options at its disposal and that diagnosti c necessity did not determine its design \nchoices.  See [ECF No. 43 at 12].  Nor is it evident , at least without the benefit of discovery, that \nOverjet ’s decision was limited to only a few choices, rendering its design decisions \nunprotectable.  Cf.  Morrissey v. Procter & Gamble Co., 379 F.2d 675, 678 (1st Cir. 1967) \n \n \n8 “In no case does copyright protection for an original work of authorship extend to any idea, \nprocedure, process, system, method of operation, concept, principle, or discovery, regardless of \nthe form in which it is described, explained, illustrated, or embodied in such work.”  17 U.S.C. § 102(b) .    Case 1:24-cv-10446-ADB     Document 54     Filed 03/28/25     Page 15 of 2616 \n \n (affirming summary judgment for defendant because the subject matter  at issue was narrow and \ntherefore only allowed for “a limited number” of expressions).9 10    \nIn sum, Overjet’s facts as pled suggest at least “some minimal degree of creativity,” Feist  \nPubl’ns, 499 U.S. at  345, and that its design choices are not just functional.11  As such, Count III \nsurvives the motion to dismiss.  LovePop, Inc. v. PaperPopCards, Inc., 286 F. Supp. 3d 283, 288 \n(D. Mass. 2018) (“Because ‘ the ultimate question of substantial similarity requires a factual \njudgment,’ it is often ‘ a matter for the trier of fact ’ and therefore ill -suited to resolution at a \nmotion to dismiss. ” (first quoting Harney v. Sony Pictures Television, Inc., 704 F.3d 173, 183 \n(1st Cir. 2013); then  quoting Yankee Candle, 259 F.3d at 34 n.5)).   \nB. Unfair Competition  and False Designation und er the Lanham Act (Count \nVI)  \n \nVidea ar\ngues that Overjet’s unfair competition and false designation claim under the \nLanham Act should be dismissed to the extent it is  duplicative of the copyright and patent \ninfringement claims.  [ECF No. 37 at 13–14].  Overjet responds that Count VI is based on \n \n \n9 Satava v. Lowry, a Ninth Circuit case cited by Videa for the proposition that “a combination of \nunprotectable elements is eligible for copyright protection only if those elements are numerous \nenough and their selection and arrangement original enough,” does not compel a different outcome.  323 F.3d 805, 811–12 (9th Cir. 2003).  In affirming the district court’s grant of a preliminary injunction, the Ninth Circuit had the benefit of a record that contained “dozens of photographs” of the sculptures at issue.  Id. at 812 n.5.  Given  the motion to dismiss posture here, \nthe Court declines to find on the current record that Overjet’s arrangement of colors, shapes, and translucencies  is based on only a few unprotectable elements.   \n10 Based on the facts alleged in the Complaint, see, e.g. , [Compl. ¶¶ 28, 35], the Court \nunderstands that although the source code annotates the X- rays, the decision concerning the \nannotation design was made by humans rather than artificial intelligence.  As such, the Court cannot find that Videa’s reliance on the Copyright Registration Guidance: Works Containing Material Generated by Artificial Intelligence is apt in the current context, and the Court need not consider it.  See [ECF No. 46 at 9–10].   \n11 Videa presented no argument as to the comparison prong of the “abstraction- filtration -\ncomparison” test , and the Court accordingly does not address it.  See [ECF No. 37].   \n Case 1:24-cv-10446-ADB     Document 54     Filed 03/28/25     Page 16 of 2617 \n \n Videa’s  trademark infringement and false advertising and, as such , is not duplicative of its \ncopyright infringement claim.  [ECF No. 43 at 13–14].   \n“The Lanham Act prohibits unfair competition through false or misleading \nrepres\nentations that could cause confusion with respect to the ‘origin, sponsorship, or approval’ \nof goods or services.”  Ivymedia Corp. v. iLIKEBUS, Inc., No. 15- cv-11918, 2015 WL 4254387, \nat *5 (D. Mass. July 13, 2015) (quoting 15 U.S.C. § 1125(a)(1)(A) ).  Courts in this district have \nfound that “[w]here a plaintiff’s Lanham Act claim merely alleges that the defendant made \nunauthorized use of a copyrighted work, the Lanham Act claim will be dismissed as duplicative of the copyright claim .”  Mitchell Int’ l, Inc. v. Fraticelli, No. 03- cv-01031, 2007 WL 4197583, at \n*12 (D.P.R. Nov. 26, 2007) ( citing  Ulloa v. Universal Music and Video Distrib . Corp., 303 F. \nSupp. 2d 409, 419 (S.D.N.Y. 2004)) ; Ivymedia Corp., 2015 WL 4254387, at *5; Applera Corp. \nv. Mich.  Diagnostics, LLC, 594 F. Supp. 2d 150, 161 (D. Mass. 2009) (“[A] claim for patent \ninfringement, without more, cannot be the basis for an unfair competition claim under Section 43(a) of the Lanham Act.”).  In situations, however, where a Lanham Act claim is not only based on copyright infringement but also a sserts claims of providing false or misleading \nrepresentations, at least one court has  declined to dismiss a Lanham Act claim  on that basis.  \nTimmins Software Corp. v. EMC Corp., 502 F. Supp. 3d 595, 600–01 (D. Mass. 2020) ; cf. \nJalbert v. Grautski, 554 F. Supp. 2d 57, 74 (D. Mass. 2008) (because plaintiff did not present any \n“evidence or argument to support his false designation of origin claim that differs from that presented in support of his copyright claim ,” the court dismissed the claim at summary \njudgment).   \nHere, Overjet’s Lanham Act claim (Count VI) is not based solely  on copyright a\n nd patent \ninfringement, [Compl. ¶¶ 191, 193],  but rather additionally asserts that Videa “ made several false Case 1:24-cv-10446-ADB     Document 54     Filed 03/28/25     Page 17 of 2622 \n \n calculating a calibrated measurement of the oral structure  \nusing the sensor pixel to mm ratio and the image metadata.  \n \n[Id. at 19:23–40].   \n2. The Two -Step Alice  Test  \nThe general standard for patentability is found in Section 101 of the Patent Act, which \nprovides that “[w]hoever invents or discovers any new and useful process, machine, \nmanufacture, or composition of matter, or any new and useful improvement thereof, may obtain a patent therefor.”  35 U.S.C. § 101.  The Supreme Court has “long held that this provision contains an important implicit exception: Laws of nature, natural phenomena, and [, as relevant here,]  abstract ideas are not patentable.”  Alice  Corp. Pty. Ltd. v. CLS Bank Int’l, 573 U.S.  208, \n216 (2014) (internal quotations and citation omitted).   Specifically, in Alice , the Supreme Court \nset forth a two -step test for determining patent- eligible subject matter.  Id. at 217.  “First,” the \nCourt “determine[s] whether the claims at issue are directed to one of those patent -ineligible \nconcepts,” in this case abstract ideas.   Id.  In making this determination, “the claims are \nconsidered in their entirety to ascertain whether their character as a whole is directed to excluded subject matter.”  Internet Pats. Corp. v. Active Network, Inc., 790 F.3d 1343, 1346 (Fed. Cir. \n2015).  In the context of computer-related technology, the Federal Circuit has explained that Alice ’s first step hinges on “ whether the focus of the claims is on the specific asserted \nimprovement in computer capabilities . . . or, instead, on a process that qualifies as an ‘abstract idea’ for which computers are invoked merely as a tool.”  Enfish, LLC v. Microsoft Corp., 822 \nF.3d 1327, 1335–36 (Fed. Cir. 2016).   \nSecond, if the Court finds that the claims at issue are in fact directed to an abstract \nconcept, i\nt must then ask, “ ‘[w]hat else is there in the claims before us?’   To answer that Case 1:24-cv-10446-ADB     Document 54     Filed 03/28/25     Page 22 of 2623 \n \n question, [the Court] consider [s] the e lements of each claim both individually and ‘as an ordered \ncombination’ to determine whether the additional elements ‘transform the nature of the claim’ \ninto a patent- eligible application.”   Alice , 573 U.S. at 217 ( first alteration in original) (quoting \nMayo Collaborative Serv s. v. Prometheus Lab ’ys, Inc. , 566 U.S.  66, 78–79 (2012) ).  When \nconducting the second part of this analysis, the Court is searching for an “inventive concept,” i.e., “an element or combination of elements that is ‘sufficient to ensure that the patent in practice amounts to significantly more than a patent upon the ineligible concept itself.’”  Id. at \n217–18 (alterations adopted) (quoting Mayo , 566 U.S. at 72–73). \nVidea claims that the ’046 Patent is  directed to an abstract idea in that it “recites a system \nfor processing digital images” and merely “acquir[es] and analyz[es] information obtained from an image and applies it using a set of generic and conventional or black box components .”  [ECF \nNo. 37 at 19; id. at 19 –22].  Specifically, Videa argues that the claims do not amount to an \nimprovement in computers as tools, but instead  focus on high level functional language—such \nas, “receiving a dental radiographic image,” “selecting a segmenter . . . ,” “predicting masks and points . . . ,” or “providing image metadata”—that  reflects  the use of computers as tools.  [ Id. \n(citing SAP Am., Inc. v. InvestPic, LLC, 898 F.3d 1161, 1168 (Fed. Cir. 2018) )].  Videa further \ncontends that Claim 1 focuses on the end  results , namely  “receiving,” “selecting,” “predicting,” \n“providing,” and “calculating,” without explaining how the invention intends to achieve these \nresults.  [ Id. at 20 –21].  Overjet replies that Videa oversimplifies the technology at issue and \nignores  “the wording of the claims articulating specific technological improvements to the \nmanner in which dental radiographs approximate the absolute and relative measurements of oral structures .”  [ECF No. 43 at 17].  Overjet further contends that the claims “address problems that \narose in the art (how to account for image  distortion to accurately measure oral structures in 2D Case 1:24-cv-10446-ADB     Document 54     Filed 03/28/25     Page 23 of 2624 \n \n dental radiographs) and solve them with improvements that enable use of conventional \nequipment\n in unconventional ways (using patients’ unique anatomical oral  structures as \ncalibration objects to make calibrated measurements ).”  [id. at 17].  The Court agrees with \nOverjet.   \nThe ’046 Patent does not solely acquire and analyze information obtained from an image \nwithout i\ndentifying an improvement in computers as tools.  Videa’s characterization of the \nclaims , although quoting directly from them, is  overly  general  in that it focuses  on a few high-\nlevel phrases such as “receiving a dental radiographic image,” “selecting a segmenter . . . ,” “predicting masks and points . . . ,” or “providing image metadata .”  [ECF No. 37 at 19].  In \ncompleting a § 101 analysis, however, the “Federal Circuit cautions that courts must be careful to avoid oversimplifying claims.”  3Shape A/S v. Carestream Dental, LLC , No. 22- cv-01829, \n2023 WL 2908846, at *7 (N.D. Ga. Feb. 16, 2023) (quoting McRO, Inc. v. Bandai Namco \nGames Am. Inc. , 837 F.3d 1299, 1313 (Fed. Cir. 2016)), report and recommendation adopted, \nNo. 22- cv-01829, 2023 WL 2908847 (N.D. Ga. Mar. 14, 2023).  Rather, a  court must consider \nthe claims “as a whole, in light of the specification ,” Data Engine Techs. LLC v. Google LLC, \n906 F.3d 999, 1011 (Fed. Cir. 2018), and determine whether “their character as a whole is directed to excluded subject matter ,” Enfish , 822 F.3d at 1335.  \nThe specification here explains that the ’046 Patent offers, among other things, “a \ntechnical solution to the technical problems of using a patient’s unique anatomical oral structures as calibration objects to make calibrated measurements without the need for an external calibration object.”  [ ’046 Patent 4:2–5].  As such, the technical solution disclosed in the patent \n“optimize[s] the process of obtaining calibrated measurements of oral structures featured in 2D dental radiographs.”  [ Id. 4:5–8] .  Claims 1  and 10, situated within the context of the patent’s Case 1:24-cv-10446-ADB     Document 54     Filed 03/28/25     Page 24 of 2625 \n \n specification, capture this improvement.  They  descri be how the need for an external calibration \nobject is eliminated  when the X- ray process us es a patient’s anatomical structure s to calculate \ncalibrated measurement s by, for example, “receiving a dental radiographic image that includes \nan oral structure,” “selecting a segmenter and an object detector ,” “selecting by the selector at \nleast one measurement method  of a set of measurement methods according to the dental \nradiographic image and the Image metadata,” and  “calculating a calibrated measurement of the \noral structure using the sensor pixel to mm ratio and the image metadata.”  [ Id. 18:14–34, 19:23–\n40].  The independent claims further outline additional requirements necessary to achieve these \ngoals, including outlining measurement methods (Claims 3 and 12) and  receiving data from a \nlibrary that includes at least one of four databases (an x- ray sensor database, an implant database, \na population based anatomical averages database, and a patient specific database) (Claims 4 and 13).  [ Id. 18:41–56, 20:5–18].  The claims, in other words, are directed to the patent’s concept —\nthat is, using a patient’s unique anatomical oral structures as calibration objects—and not merely an abstract idea.  See 3Shape, 2023 WL 2908846, at *10 (concluding that the claims at -issue \nwere “directed to determining tooth shade using texture data and shape data of  a 3D \nrepresentation of the tooth for specific points of the tooth” and were therefore not abstract, but rather “reflect[ed] a specific means or method that improves upon, and differs from, the human-performed methods of detecting tooth sha de described  by the specification of the at- issue \npatents”).   \nThe Court is further persuaded that the ’ 046\n  Patent focuses “on a specific means or \nmethod that improves the relevant technology.”  McRO, Inc. , 837 F.3d at 1314.  As explained  in \nthe specification, “[a]ccurately measuring oral structures present on  a two -dimensional dental \nradiograph using currently available image processing methods is problematic.”  [’046 Patent Case 1:24-cv-10446-ADB     Document 54     Filed 03/28/25     Page 25 of 2626 \n \n 3:36–38].  This is because current processing methods rely on external calibration objects in \naccounti\nng for image distortion when measuring oral structures on a two -dimensional X- ray.  \n[Id. 3:36–58].  At the heart of the ’046 Patent is the use of a patient’s anatomical oral structures \nas calibration objects without the need for an external object, which, in the court’s understanding of the patent, plainly qualifies as an improvement in the relevant technology.  The Court is therefore “not convinced that the claims at -issue are merely using computers as tools to apply an \nabstract idea as opposed to improving the effectiveness or efficiency of computers that determine [a patient’s unique anatomical oral structures as calibration objects].”  3Shape, 2023 WL \n2908846, at *8.  Accordingly, the Court find s that the ’046 Patent satisfies the first prong of the \nAlice  test and therefore declines to dismiss the patent claims.   \nIV. CONCLUSION  For the reasons set forth above, Defendant’s motion to dismiss, [ECF No. 36], is \nDENIED.   \nSO ORDERED.         \n             \nMarch 28, 2025 /s/ Al lison D.

    "summary": "**1. Summary:**\nThe case involves a legal dispute between Marco Yammine and Toolbox for HR (TB4HR), a Polish software company, over the ownership and use of the domain name \"CV Timeline.\" This dispute arose from Yammine's registration of the domain with GoDaddy, an Arizona-based company, for a project he claims was independent of TB4HR, which led to TB4HR's UDRP administrative proceeding win and subsequent legal actions by Yammine. Key facts include the company's development of recruitment software utilizing AI to identify tech professionals likely to change jobs, which sparked disagreements over intellectual property and alleged fiduciary breaches. The court's decision on multiple motions involved issues of personal jurisdiction, trademark infringement, misappropriation of trade secrets, tortious interference, and breach of fiduciary duty.\n\n**2. Key Legal Issue:**\nThe primary legal issue is whether the court of Arizona has jurisdiction over Yammine regarding TB4HR's counterclaims, and whether TB4HR's claims, such as trademark infringement and misappropriation of trade secrets, state valid legal claims.\n\n**3. Court's Holding:**\nThe court held that it has personal jurisdiction over Yammine for the counterclaims, denied dismissal of most counterclaims, including those related to trademark infringement and breach of fiduciary duty, but granted the dismissal of the tortious interference claim for lack of specific alleged business expectancies. The court also denied TB4HR's request for jurisdictional discovery.\n\n**4. ELI5 Explanation:**\nImagine two people, Marco and a company called TB4HR, both claim to own a website name, like a digital street address for an online shop. Marco says he owns it since he set it up, but TB4HR argues it's theirs because the site is connected to their tech that uses AI to predict who might be looking for new jobs. The court ruled that they can decide over all the disputes because Marco first went to this court. They didn't agree with Marco on most things, except one point: TB4HR didn't clearly show they missed out on money from non-existing customer deals. So, while Marco stays to defend most claims, he wins that one smaller point.",

He also argues Counts I, II, IV, VI, and VII fail to state a claim upon which \nrelief can be granted. ( Id.)  \nYammine and TB4HR dispute ownership of the website domain for CV Timeline \n(the “Domai n”). The Domain is registered with GoDaddy, a company located in Arizona. \n(Doc. 1 at ¶ 7.)  This dispute was originally adjudicated as an administrative proceeding \npursuant to the Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy (“UDRP”) where \nYammine was ord ered to transfer the Domain to TB4HR. ( Id. at ¶¶ 5, 26.)  In compliance \nwith UDRP, Yammine filed in this jurisdiction to prevent the transfer of the Domain. ( Id. \nat ¶¶ 27 –28; Doc. 35 at ¶ 56.)  For the following reasons, the Motion is granted in part and \ndenied in part.  Case 2:21-cv-00093-MTL   Document 64   Filed 03/11/22   Page 1 of 13 \n- 2 -  \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n I. BACKGROUND  \nTB4HR is a software company based in Warsaw, Poland .  TB4HR’s software is \ndesigned to help  international tech companies recruit technology professionals. (Doc. 35 \nat ¶¶ 10 –11.) Yammine also resides in Poland. (Doc. 43 -1 at ¶ 3. ) Yammine’s relationship \nwith TB4HR began in March 2018. ( Id. at ¶ 17.)  Though the exact nature of that \nrelationship is disputed, the parties agree Yammine was tasked with developing the \nprecursor to  the CV Timeline  product . (Id.; Doc. 1 at ¶ 8.)   \nBefore 2018, TB4HR “conducted research and development into automating the \nwork of recruiters with enhancements in artificial intelligence .” (Doc. 35 at ¶ 15.) This \nresearch led TB4HR to believe that “there are patterns that could be followed up on to \nmake enhanced prognostications that accurately identify when a tech professional may be \ninterested in changing their job.” (Id.) With this research , TB4HR created a  new service \nand product, first naming it “Mageekz” and later renaming it to “CV Timeline”. ( Id. at ¶ \n16.) \nWhile developing the product, Yammine and other TB4HR employees had the idea \nto present resumes on a timeline, which they named “Mageekz for Recruite rs.” (Doc. 35 at \n¶ 21.)  Yammine contends he was the one who came up with this idea, and he and the CEO \nof TB4HR verbally agreed to develop a product together. (Doc. 1 at ¶ 9.) But TB4HR \nasserts that Yammine coded Mageekz for Recruiters as part of his job pursuant to a \ncontractor agreement. (Doc. 35 at ¶ 21 .) TB4HR began marketing Mageekz for Recuriters \nin September 2018 through social media. ( Id.)  \nAround that time, the parties renamed Mageekz for Recruiters to CV Timeline. ( Id.) \nat ¶ 22.) TB4HR alleges th at it then tasked Yammine with creating a website to market the \nproduct. ( Id. at ¶ 23.)   But Yammine contends TB4HR never showed interest in the new \nventure, and he took full responsibility getting the project started. (Doc. 1 at ¶ 10.) So, in \nSeptember 20 18, Yammine registered the CVTimeline.com website (the “Domain”) with \nGoDaddy. ( Id. at ¶ 11; Doc. 35 at ¶ 23.) Yammine maintains that the “Domain Name was \nregistered separate and apart from the Mageekz Project for a venture independent of, and Case 2:21-cv-00093-MTL   Document 64   Filed 03/11/22   Page 2 of 13 \n- 3 -  \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n unrelated to , TB4HR.” (Doc. 1 at ¶ 12.) TB4HR states that Yammine began advertising the \nDomain on LinkedIn on behalf of TB4HR. (Doc. 35 at ¶ 23.)  In December 2018, TB4HR \nfully employed Yammine as Vice President of Research and Development. ( Id. at ¶ 27.) \nYammine state s that he was hired for a project unrelated to CV Timeline. (Doc. 1 at ¶ 13.)  \nIn January 2020, in a discussion with a coworker about intellectual property, \nYammine stated that he owned the Domain. (Doc. 35 -3 at 2.) Yammine then founded a \nnew company calle d “CVT spolka z ograniczona odpowiedzialnoscia” and listed the \nDomain as the company’s web address. (Id. at ¶ 35–36.) TB4HR did not find out about \nYammine’s activities until late May 2020. (Doc. 35 at ¶  39.) In June 2020, TB4HR fired \nYammine. ( Id. at ¶ 43. ) TB4HR alleges that Yammine and other employees wrongfully \ncontrolled the Domain and were double -dealing.  ( Id. at ¶ 35.)  One year later, Yammine \nwent into business with a Swiss technology company to sell the CV Timeline product. ( Id. \nat ¶ 47.)  \nIn Octob er 2020, TB4HR commenced a World Intellectual Property Organization \n(“WIPO”) arbitration as an attempt to regain control of the Domain. ( Id. at ¶ 56.) Late \nDecember 2020, a WIPO panelist determined the Domain belonged to TB4HR and ordered \nthat it be transf erred to TB4HR. ( Id.) The UDRP allows a defendant to file an action within \n10 business days to prevent the WIPO -ordered transfer. ( Id.; Doc. 1 at ¶ 27.) Accordingly, \nYammine had to commence an action specifically in this district to stop the transfer. (Doc. \n1 at ¶ 27.)  \nYammine filed the Complaint against TB4HR in January 2021, and seeks, inter alia , \ndeclaratory relief. ( Id. at ¶ 1.) TB4HR then filed the First Amended Answer and seven \ncounterclaims. (Doc. 35.) In the pending Motion, Yammine mov es to dismiss four of the \nseven counterclaims against him for lack of personal jurisdiction and, in the alternative, \nfive of the seven counterclaims for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. \nYammine does not challenge the exercise of p ersonal jurisdiction over Count I \n(Cyberpiracy), Count III (Declaratory Relief), and Count V (Conversion) of the \ncounterclaims.

LEGAL STANDARDS  \nA. Rule 12(b)(2)  \nUnder Rule 12(b)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, a defendan t may move, \n“prior to trial, to dismiss the complaint for lack of personal jurisdiction.” Data Disc, Inc. \nv. Sys. Tech. Assocs., Inc. , 557 F.2d 1280, 1285 (9th Cir. 1977). The plaintiff bears the \nburden to show that an exercise of jurisdiction is proper. Ziegler v. Indian River Cnty. , 64 \nF.3d 470, 473 (9th Cir. 1995). Here, the plaintiff “need only make a prima facie showing \nof jurisdictional facts.” Sher v. Johnson , 911 F.2d 1357, 1361 (9th Cir. 1990) (internal \ncitation omitted). When examining whether the re is a prima facie showing of jurisdictional \nfacts, any “uncontroverted allegations in [the complaint] must be taken as true, and \nconflicts between the facts contained in the parties’ affidavits must be resolved in \n[plaintiff’s] favor.” AT&T Co. v. Compag nie Bruxelles Lambert , 94 F.3d 586, 588 (9th Cir. \n1996) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).  \nB. Rule 12(b)(6)  \nTo survive a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, a complaint must contain \n“a short and plain statement of the claim showi ng that the pleader is entitled to relief” such \nthat the defendant is given “fair notice of what the . . . claim is and the grounds upon which \nit rests.” Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly , 550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007) (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. \n8(a)(2); Conley v. Gibso n, 355 U.S. 41, 47 (1957)). Dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) “can be \nbased on the lack of a cognizable legal theory or the absence of sufficient facts alleged \nunder a cognizable legal theory.” Balistreri v. Pacifica Police Dep’t , 901 F.2d 696, 699 \n(9th Cir. 1 988). A complaint should not be dismissed “unless it appears beyond doubt that \nthe plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of the claim that would entitle it to relief.” \nWilliamson v. Gen. Dynamics Corp. , 208 F.3d 1144, 1149 (9th Cir. 2000).  \nThe Cou rt must accept material allegations in the complaint as true and construe \nthem in the light most favorable to the p laintiff. North Star Int’l v. Ariz. Corp. Comm’n , \n720 F.2d 578, 580 (9th Cir. 1983). “Indeed, factual challenges to a plaintiff’s complaint \nhave no bearing on the legal sufficiency of the allegations under Rule 12(b)(6).” Lee v.

Review of a Rule 12(b)(6) motion is \n“limited to the content of the complaint.” North Star Int’l , 720 F.2d at 581 . \nIII. DISCUSSION  \nA. Personal Jurisdiction  \nYammine challenges this Court’s exercise of personal jurisdiction over half of the \ncounterclaims against him. He asserts that the four counterclaims at issue are “unrelated” \nto his act of registering the Domain wi th GoDaddy, which is headquartered in Arizona, and \nthat act alone is insufficient to support personal jurisdiction. (Doc. 44 at 8 –15.) TB4HR \nargues  that Yammine has consented to personal jurisdiction over any potential \ncounterclaims because Yammine invoked  this Court’s jurisdiction by filing his initial \ncomplaint. (Doc. 55 at 12 –14.)   \n“Once a plaintiff invokes the jurisdiction of a federal court by filing a complaint, \nthe court maintains jurisdiction over the plaintiff for all subsequent proceedings, inclu ding \nall counterclaims asserted against the plaintiff.” Verve LLC v. Hypercom Corp. , No. CV -\n05-0365 -PHX -FJM, 2006 WL 8441358, at *4 (D. Ariz. June 13, 2006); see also  Leman v. \nKrentler -Arnold Hinge Last Co. , 284 U.S. 448, 451 (1932) (finding jurisdiction e xisted \nbecause the plaintiff, upon bringing suit in federal district court, “submitted itself to the \njurisdiction of the court with respect to all the issues embraced in the suit, including those \npertaining to the counterclaim of the defendants”). Stated d ifferently, a plaintiff who avails \nhimself of the district court consents to the district court’s personal jurisdiction over the \ncounterclaims against him.   \n Yammine invoked the jurisdiction of this Court by filing his complaint against \nTB4HR here in the District of Arizona. Schnabel v. Lui , 302 F.3d 1023, 1037 (9th Cir. \n2002) (“[P]laintiffs who avail themselves of the district court consent to personal \njurisdiction.”). Accordingly, the Court maintains jurisdiction over all subsequent \nproceedings “embraced  in the suit” —including all of TB4HR’s counterclaims. Leman , 248 \nU.S. at 451. Yammine argues  that he filed in this District because it was “the exclusive \njurisdiction in which Plaintiff could stop the UDRP decision from taking effect”  to contest Case 2:21-cv-00093-MTL   Document 64   Filed 03/11/22   Page 5 of 13 \n- 6 -  \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n personal jurisdiction.  (Doc. 44 at 12 (emphasis omitted).) How Yammine came to file in \nthis District d oes not change the fact that Yammine filed in this District, invoked the \njurisdiction of this District, and consented to personal jurisdiction in this District.    \nYammine and TB4HR further debate the relatedness of the claims to Yammine’s \ninitial complain t. The crux of Yammine’s argument is that four of TB4HR’s counterclaims \nagainst him are “unrelated” to the underlying claim.  ( Id. at 8, 10, 12, 15.) TB4HR argues \nthat all of its counterclaims “relate to the same core controversy over the Domain.” (Doc. \n55 at 13 n.3.)  Regardless of whether the counterclaims are compulsory or permissive, this \nCourt has jurisdiction. 6 Charles Alan Wright, Arthur Miller and Mary Kay Kane (“Wright \n& Miller”), Federal Practice and Procedure §  1424 (“In general, if defendant in terposes a \npermissive counterclaim, plaintiff cannot object that the court lacks personal jurisdiction \nor that venue is improper for purposes of adjudicating the claim.”); Wright & Miller, \n§ 1416 (“Plaintiff may not object that the court lacks personal jur isdiction or that venue is \nimproper for purposes of adjudicating a compulsory counterclaim that defendant has \ninterposed. By choosing a particular forum in which to seek affirmative relief, plaintiff \neffectively waives any objections to that forum based on  personal inconvenience.”). \nBecause Yammine filed the underlying complaint in this district, he may not contest \njurisdiction against any counterclaims filed against him, whether they are permissive or \ncompulsory. Thus, this Court denies Yammine’s motion fo r lack of personal jurisdiction  \nas to Counts II, IV, VI and VII .  \nB. Failure to State a Claim  \nYammine alternatively moves to dismiss Counts I, II, IV, VI, and VII of TB4HR’s \nFirst Amended Counterclaim for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be g ranted. \n(Doc. 44 at 7.)1  \n \n1 TB4HR suggests that Yammine did not fully comply with LRCiv 12.1(c) in filing this \nmotion to dismiss  because the motion  “omits the certification of the pre -motion meet and \nconfer process.” (Doc. 55 at 9, n.10.) But Yammine did not omit the LRCiv. 12.1(c) \ncertification; it was attached to the Memorandum in Support of Plaintiff’s Motion to \nDismiss. (Doc. 44 at 25.) Thus, Yammine fully complied with the 12.1(c) certification \nrequirements and the Court, in its discretion, will not summarily dismiss Yammine’s Case 2:21-cv-00093-MTL   Document 64   Filed 03/11/22   Page 6 of 13 \n- 7 -  \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n 1. Cyberpiracy (Count I) and Trademark Infringement (Count II)  \nTB4HR brings a counterclaim for cyberpiracy under the Anti -Cybersquatting \nConsumer Protection Act (“ACPA ”). 15 U.S.C. § 1125(d). To state a claim under the \nACPA, a plaintiff must allege: “that (1) the defendant registered, trafficked in, or used a \ndomain name; (2) the domain name is identical or confusingly similar to a protected mark \nowned by the plaintiff;  and (3) the defendant acted with bad faith intent to profit from that \nmark.” DPST Int’l., Inc. v. Nahum , 624 F.3d 1213, 1218 –19 (9th Cir. 2010). Additionally, \nTB4HR brings a counterclaim for trademark infringement under 15 U.S.C. § 1125(a). In \nthis case, a plaintiff must prove “(1) that it held a valid protectable mark and (2) that the \ndefendant is using a mark confusingly similar.” Cont’l Promotion Grp., Inc. v. Garvin , No. \nCV-08-0070 -PHX -SRB, 2008 WL 11338887, at *11 (D. Ariz. Mar. 8, 2008) (internal \nquotations omitted).  Yammine contends that Counts I and II must be dismissed because \nTB4HR “does not allege any information that would demonstrate trademark rights in its \nalleged unregistered  trademark.” (Doc. 44 at 18.) No other elements of the claims are \ncontested, and it is undisputed that the trademark —here, CV Timeline —is unregistered.  \nProtectable ownership interests are established in an unregistered trademark if the \nmark has been used in commerce. Adams v. Hartz Mountain Corp. , No. C14 -1174RSL, \n2014 WL 7151781, at *3 (D. Ariz. Dec. 14, 2014). To show commercial use , a party must \nprove (1) that it actually adopted and used the mark in commerce before it was registered \nby another party and (2) the use of the mark was continuous and not interrupted. Dep’t o f \nParks & Recreation for State of Cal. v. Bazaar Del Mundo Inc. , 448 F.3d 1118, 1125 –26 \n(9th Cir. 2006). Protectable ownership interests vest in an unregistered trademark upon a \nsingle instance of commercial use, “so long as the use demonstrate[s] both ado ption of the \nmark[] and use in a way sufficiently public to identify or distinguish the marked goods in \nan appropriate segment of the public mind as [that] of the adopter of the mark.” Adams , \n2014 WL 7151781, at *3.  \n \n12(b)(6) Motion.  Case 2:21-cv-00093-MTL   Document 64   Filed 03/11/22   Page 7 of 13 \n- 8 -  \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n Here, TB4HR has alleged facts sufficient  to raise a plausible inference it has a \nprotectable interest in the unregistered mark because TB4HR used CV Timeline  \ncontinuously in commerce since the mark’s  inception. See id. (finding the plaintiff alleged \nfacts sufficient to raise a plausible inferenc e of a protectable ownership interest in a mark \nbecause the plaintiff used the mark in commerce). TB4HR alleged that the CV Timeline \nmark  was “put into immediate use in commerce broadly and universally across the United \nStates and the world,” that it has been used to sell its service on social media since 2018, \nand $1 million was spent in development and marketing of the mark. (Doc. 35 at ¶¶ 22, 24, \n65, 71.) Thus, TB4HR has sufficiently stated a claim to survive a 12(b)(6) motion, and \nYammine’s Motion  to dismiss Counts I and II is denied.  \n2. Misappropriation and Threatened Misappropriation of Trade \nSecrets (Count IV)  \nYammine challenges TB4HR’s counterclaim for misappropriation of trade secrets \nunder the Defend Trade Secrets Act (“DTSA”) because TB4HR “has not pled what its trade \nsecrets are or their economic value.” (Doc. 44 at 13.) 18 U.S.C. §§ 1832, 1836 et seq. To \nstate a claim under the DTSA, a plaintiff must allege: “(1) that the plaintiff possessed a \ntrade secret, (2) that the defendant misapprop riated the trade secret; and (3) that the \nmisappropriation caused or threatened damage to the plaintiff.” InteliClear, LLC v. ETC \nGlob. Holdings, Inc. , 978 F.3d 653, 657 –58 (9th Cir. 2020). Besides the existence of a \ntrade secret, no other elements are con tested.  \nUnder the DTSA, a trade secret is defined as “financial, business, scientific, \ntechnical, economic, or engineering information” that the owner takes reasonable measures \nto keep secret and the information  derives independent economic value from bein g a secret. \n18 U.S.C. §  1839(3).   The DTSA has an expansive definition of trade secret; a plaintiff \nmeets the Iqbal pleading standard even by alleging  broad categories of confidential \ninformation. Physics, Material, and Applied Mathematics Rsch. LLC v. Yea k, No. CV -20-\n00379 -TUC -JCH, 2021 WL 2557398, at *6 (D. Ariz. May 3, 2021) (holding allegations of \n“trade secrets embodied in written materials, drawings, computer codes, processes, Case 2:21-cv-00093-MTL   Document 64   Filed 03/11/22   Page 8 of 13 \n- 9 -  \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n procedures, equipment, list of suppliers, customers, and contacts regarding  specific \ncategories of laser systems” are sufficient to survive a 12(b)(6) motion) (internal quotations \nomitted); see also W.L. Gore & Assocs., Inc. v. GI Dynamics, Inc. , No. CV -10-8088 -PHX -\nGMS, 2010 WL 5184254, at *8 (D. Ariz. Dec. 15, 2010) (holding all egations of “market \nstudies, financial information, manufacturing methods, and . . . future plans, which were \nnot published in the patent applications” are sufficient to survive a 12(b)(6) motion). A \nplaintiff is not required to plead with such specificity  as to reveal the trade secret. Physics, \nMaterial, and Applied Mathematics Rsch. , 2021 WL 2557398, at *6.   \nTB4HR alleged its trade secrets “include both knowhow and negative knowhow \nregarding creating, marketing, selling, designing, updating, and using th e software and \nservice comprising CV  Timeline” and “[t]he internal workings and design of the \nCVTimeline Domain and software are also themselves trade secrets.” (Doc. 35 at ¶¶ 81 –\n82.)  TB4HR also alleges it “conducted research and development into automati ng the work \nof recruiters with enhancements in artificial intelligence,” and had found “indication[s] that \nthere are patterns that could be followed up on to make enhanced prognostications that \naccurately identify when a tech professional may be interested  in changing their job.” ( Id. \nat ¶ 15.) These allegations surpass the pleading standard set forth in Iqbal and refined in \nPhysics, Material, and Applied Mathematics R esearch , and it is plausible that an entity \noutside of TB4HR would not have knowledge of T B4HR’s software design. Therefore, \nthese allegations are sufficient to state a trade secret.  \nYammine also contends that the TB4HR’s allegations “make bare bones \nstatements” about how its trade secrets derive economic value. (Doc. 44 at 20.) Trade \nsecrets have independent economic value when their actual or potential value derives from \nbeing kept secret. 18 U.S.C. § 1839(3)(B). This value is determined from “the degree to \nwhich the secret information confers a competitive advantage on its owner.” Attia v. \nGoogle LLC , 983 F.3d 420, 426 (9th Cir. 2020). As a result, the parties may prove \nindependent economic value via “circumstantial evidence of the resources invested in \nproducing the information, the precautions taken to protects its secrecy, and the willingn ess Case 2:21-cv-00093-MTL   Document 64   Filed 03/11/22   Page 9 of 13 \n- 10 -  \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n of others to pay for its access.” Joshua David Mellberg LLC v. Will , 96 F.Supp.3d 953, \n973–74 (D. Ariz. Mar. 30, 2015) (internal quotation marks omitted).  \nHere, TB4HR’s allegations of protective measures are sufficient to show that its \ntrade secrets d erive economic value. For example, TB4HR pleaded that its trade secrets are \n“subject to extensive efforts to maintain secrecy and confidentiality” such as requiring \nemployees and contractors to sign confidentiality agreements and restricting access to \nconfidential information to limited subset of people. (Doc. 35 at ¶ 80.)  Moreover, TB4HR \nemploys technical safeguards of data encryption and password protection corresponding to \na user’s role in the company. ( Id.) And “everyone who would possible obtain confi dential \ninformation, third parties, contractors, and/or employees would all have to sign \nconfidentiality agreements first.” ( Id. at 13, n.3.) These assertions , coupled with allegations \nthat TB4HR is in a “niche market ,” are enough for TB4HR to survive a 12 (b)(6) motion to \ndismiss on this claim. ( Id. at ¶¶ 11 –13.) Yammine’s Motion to dismiss Count IV is denied.  \n3. Tortious Interference With Prospective Economic Advantage \n(Count VI)  \nTB4HR also alleges a counterclaim for tortious interference with prospective \neconomic advantage. ( Id. at ¶¶ 98 –107.)   For this claim, a plaintiff must allege: “(1) the \nexistence of a valid contractual relationship or business expectancy, (2) the interferer’s \nknowledge of the relationship or expectancy, (3) intentional interference  inducing or \ncausing a breach or termination of the relationship or expectancy, and (4) resultant damage \nto the party whose relationship or expectancy has been disrupted.” FLP, LLC v. Wolf , No. \nCV17 -0214 PHX DGC, 2017 WL 4699490, at *2 (D. Ariz. Oct. 19, 2 017). Yammine \ncontends that TB4HR fails to meet the first element . By referring only to its “potential \ncustomers” and “people who may want to do business with TB4HR,” Yammine argues \nTB4HR failed to allege the existence of a business expectancy.  (Doc. 44 at 21 –22; Doc. \n35 at ¶¶ 100, 104.)  \n“A claim for tortious interferenc e with a business expectancy is insufficient unless \nthe plaintiff alleges facts showing the expectancy constitutes more than a mere hope.”  Case 2:21-cv-00093-MTL   Document 64   Filed 03/11/22   Page 10 of 13 \n- 11 -  \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n Crestwood Capital Corp. v. Andes Industries, Inc. , No. CV -15-00600 -PHX -NVW, 2016 \nWL 3457952, at *19 (D. Ariz. June 24 , 2016) (internal citation omitted).2 When the \nbusiness expectancy applies to a group of people, courts have permitted a “plaintiff to \nallege an expectancy with a class of individuals,” so long as the group is specifically \nidentifiable.  Dube v. Likins , 216 Ariz. 406, 414,  ¶ 20 (Ct. App. 2007). Thus, business \nexpectancy does not have to be measured by particular relations, instead it “can be \nmeasured by looking to a background of business experience rather than a particular \nrelationship.” Pettit v. Ariz. B d. of Regents , No. CV 05 -2922 -PHX -ROS, 2006 WL \n8422926, at *5 (D. Ariz. Aug. 28, 2006) (internal citation and quotation omitted) (finding \na business expectancy when plaintiff allege defendant “deprived [Plaintiff] of future patent \nand licensing income”).  \nTB4HR’s complaint states that “Yammine knew at all relevant times TB4HR was \nattempting to negotiate with and obtain customers in the United States, and beyond, for \n[CV Timeline].”  (Doc. 35 at ¶ 99.) As a result, TB4HR alleged Yammine interfered with \n“pote ntial customers” and “people who may want to do business with TB4HR.” ( Id. at ¶¶ \n100, 104.) Even with TB4HR’s reference to a targeted advertising campaign, this is not \nenough to prove its business expectancy constitutes more than a “mere hope.” ( Id. at ¶ 2 3.) \nCrestwood Capital Corp., 2016 WL 3457952, at *19; see also  Dube, 216 Ariz. at 414 \n(“Although the tort of tortious interference with a business expectancy covers situations \nthat the tort of intentional interference with a contract does not, the former h as only been \navailable in those situations where the plaintiff can identify the specific relationship with \nwhich the defendant interfered.”).  \nTB4HR has not proven a specific relationship with any of its potential customers. \nTB4HR relies on a string of ina pposite cases in unrelated areas or unrelated prongs of the \ntortious interference test to attempt to prove that potential customers can create a business \n \n2 Different standards govern a business expectancy versus contractual relationship. Rebath \nLLC v. HD Solutions LLC , No. CV -19-04873 -PHX -JJT, 2020 WL 4514934, at *2 (D. Ariz. \nSep. 18, 2020).  TB4HR and Yammine only brief the busine ss expectancy standard, and no \nfacts supporting a contractual relationship exist in this record. Accordingly, the Court \napplies the business expectancy standard.     Case 2:21-cv-00093-MTL   Document 64   Filed 03/11/22   Page 11 of 13 \n- 12 -  \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n expectancy ; this is unavailing . (Doc. 55 at 24 n.17.) E.g., Stoyanof v. Crocodiles Not \nWaterlillies, L .L.C. , No. CV 11 -00384 HWG, 2012 WL 13024085, at *10 (D. Ariz. Feb. \n16, 2012) (intentional interference with a business expectancy is  not a substitute for \ndefamation); Sunshine Media Grp., Inc. v. Goldberg , No. CV -10-0761 -PHX -DGC, 2010 \nWL 2899081, at *6 –*7 (D. Ariz. July 22, 2010) (focusing on whether the interference was \nimproper, not if a business expectancy existed); Antwerp Diamond Exch. of Am., Inc. v. \nBetter Bus. Bureau of Maricopa Cty., Inc., 130 Ariz. 523, 530 (1981) (considering whether \nthe defenda nt had specific intent to interfere with a business relationship, not if the \ncustomers constituted a business expectancy); Mach 1 Air Servs., Inc. v.

Aug. 6, 2008) (addressing a claim \nfor tor tious interference with existing and prospective contractual relations, not business \nexpectancy).  Thus, TB4HR’s reference to “potential customers” and “people who may \nwant to do business with TB4HR” is not enough to establish a business expectancy. (Doc. \n35 at ¶¶  98–107.) Yammine’s Motion to dismiss Count VI is granted.  \n4. Breach of Fiduciary Duties (Count VII)  \nYammine asserts TB4HR’s counterclaim for breach of fiduciary duties must be \ndismissed because Yammine resides in Poland, so the application of Arizona law is \n“complete overreach.” (Doc. 44 at 22 –23.) TB4HR advocates for the application of \nArizona law becau se Yammine registered the Domain in Arizona “in violation of the \nloyalties he owed to [TB4HR].”  (Doc. 55 at 24 –25.)  “To properly plead a claim for breach \nof fiduciary duty a party must show: (1) the existence of a fiduciary duty, (2) its breach, \nand (3) damages resulting from the breach.” Where Yammine resides and where the \nconduct occurred has no significance in the Court’s fiduciary duty analysis. See Wine Educ. \nCouncil v. Arizona Rangers , No. CV -19-02235 -PHX -SMB, 2020 WL 7352632, at *7 (D. \nAriz. Dec. 1 5, 2020) (listing the elements of a breach of fiduciary duty claim, but not listing \nthe situs of the conduct). Yammine cites no law in support of his assertion that a breach of \nfiduciary duty claim turns on where the conduct occurred. Additionally, as the parties gave \nno written notice of intent to raise an issue of foreign law, this Court is under no obligation Case 2:21-cv-00093-MTL   Document 64   Filed 03/11/22   Page 12 of 13 \n- 13 -  \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n \nto apply any other law. MCA, Inc. v. U.S. , 685 F.2d 1099, n.12 (9th Cir. 1982). TB4HR \nand Yammine have not provided such written intent, so this Co urt looks to Arizona as the \nforum state to determine what fiduciary duties Yammine owed. See id.  \nYammine also contends that TB4HR has not alleged any actual harm. But TB4HR \nalleged it projected to make $5 million in profit “using the Service and Mark, but  due to \nthe consumer -confusing activities of Yammine through the Domain and in his dilution of \nthe Mark, they have been unable to profit at all.” (Doc. 35 at ¶ 50.) Thus, TB4HR alleged \nharm sufficient to survive Yammine’s motion to dismiss. As such, Yammin e’s motion to \ndismiss Count VII is denied.  \nIV. CONCLUSION  \nAccordingly,  \nIT IS ORDERED denying Plaintiff/Counter -Defendant Marco Yammine’s Motion \nto Dismiss Counts II, IV, VI, and VII of Defendant/Counter -Plaintiff TB4HR’s \nCounterclaim for lack of personal jurisdiction. (Doc. 43.)  \nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED denying Plaintiff/Counter -Defendant Marco \nYammine’s Motion to Dismiss Counts I, II, VI, and VII for failure to state a claim.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: This case involves a dispute between Marco Yammine and Toolbox for HR Spolka z Ograniczona Odpowiedzialnoscia Spolka Komandytowa (TB4HR) over the ownership and control of the domain name for \"CV Timeline.\" The dispute arose after Yammine, who once worked with TB4HR on developing and marketing the CV Timeline product, claimed ownership of the domain name and allegedly started a competing venture. The court had to evaluate motions concerning jurisdiction and whether certain claims such as cyberpiracy and misappropriation of trade secrets were sufficiently stated.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the U.S District Court for the District of Arizona has personal jurisdiction over Yammine and whether TB4HR's counterclaims sufficiently state a legal claim to survive a motion to dismiss.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court denied Yammine's motion to dismiss the counterclaims for lack of personal jurisdiction, holding that by filing in this district, he submitted to the court's jurisdiction. The court also denied most of Yammine's motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, except for the claim of tortious interference with prospective economic advantage, which was dismissed due to insufficient allegation of a specific business expectancy.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine you lent a toy to a friend to play with, but then they moved to a different city and started saying the toy belonged to them. Your friend took you to court in that city because you tried to take back the toy. Now, because they went to court first, you can continue your side of the fight there too. Also, if your friend said you ruined their chances to be friends with others because of the toy drama, they need to show they had real plans with those others, not just hopes. The court said your friend's stories of damage were mostly valid, but they couldn't prove that you specifically messed up any friendships they'd actually started.",

( Id.)  \nYammine and TB4HR dispute ownership of the website domain for CV Timeline \n(the “Domai n”). The Domain is registered with GoDaddy, a company located in Arizona. \n(Doc. 1 at ¶ 7.)  This dispute was originally adjudicated as an administrative proceeding \npursuant to the Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy (“UDRP”) where \nYammine was ord ered to transfer the Domain to TB4HR. ( Id. at ¶¶ 5, 26.)  In compliance \nwith UDRP, Yammine filed in this jurisdiction to prevent the transfer of the Domain. ( Id. \nat ¶¶ 27 –28; Doc. 35 at ¶ 56.)  For the following reasons, the Motion is granted in part and \ndenied in part.

BACKGROUND  \nTB4HR is a software company based in Warsaw, Poland .  TB4HR’s software is \ndesigned to help  international tech companies recruit technology professionals. (Doc. 35 \nat ¶¶ 10 –11.) Yammine also resides in Poland. (Doc. 43 -1 at ¶ 3. ) Yammine’s relationship \nwith TB4HR began in March 2018. ( Id. at ¶ 17.)  Though the exact nature of that \nrelationship is disputed, the parties agree Yammine was tasked with developing the \nprecursor to  the CV Timeline  product . (Id.; Doc. 1 at ¶ 8.)   \nBefore 2018, TB4HR “conducted research and development into automating the \nwork of recruiters with enhancements in artificial intelligence .” (Doc. 35 at ¶ 15.) This \nresearch led TB4HR to believe that “there are patterns that could be followed up on to \nmake enhanced prognostications that accurately identify when a t ech professional may be \ninterested in changing their job.” (Id.) With this research , TB4HR created a new service \nand product, first naming it “Mageekz” and later renaming it to “CV Timeline”. ( Id. at ¶ \n16.) \nWhile developing the product, Yammine and other T B4HR employees had the idea \nto present resumes on a timeline, which they named “Mageekz for Recruiters.” (Doc. 35 at \n¶ 21.)  Yammine contends he was the one who came up with this idea, and he and the CEO \nof TB4HR verbally agreed to develop a product togeth er. (Doc. 1 at ¶ 9.) But TB4HR \nasserts that Yammine coded Mageekz for Recruiters as part of his job pursuant to a \ncontractor agreement. (Doc. 35 at ¶ 21 .) TB4HR began marketing Mageekz for Recuriters \nin September 2018 through social media. ( Id.)  \nAround th at time, the parties renamed Mageekz for Recruiters to CV Timeline. ( Id.) \nat ¶ 22.) TB4HR alleges that it then tasked Yammine with creating a website to market the \nproduct. ( Id. at ¶ 23.)   But Yammine contends TB4HR never showed interest in the new \nventure , and he took full responsibility getting the project started. (Doc. 1 at ¶ 10.) So, in \nSeptember 2018, Yammine registered the CVTimeline.com website (the “Domain”) with \nGoDaddy. ( Id. at ¶ 11; Doc. 35 at ¶ 23.) Yammine maintains that the “Domain Name was \nregistered separate and apart from the Mageekz Project for a venture independent of, and Case 2:21-cv-00093-MTL   Document 65   Filed 03/14/22   Page 2 of 13 \n- 3 -  \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n unrelated to, TB4HR.” (Doc. 1 at ¶ 12.) TB4HR states that Yammine began advertising the \nDomain on LinkedIn on behalf of TB4HR. (Doc. 35 at ¶ 23.)  In December 2018, TB4H R \nfully employed Yammine as Vice President of Research and Development. ( Id. at ¶ 27.) \nYammine states that he was hired for a project unrelated to CV Timeline. (Doc. 1 at ¶ 13.)  \nIn January 2020, in a discussion with a coworker about intellectual property,  \nYammine stated that he owned the Domain. (Doc. 35 -3 at 2.) Yammine then founded a \nnew company called “CVT spolka z ograniczona odpowiedzialnoscia” and listed the \nDomain as the company’s web address. (Id. at ¶ 35–36.) TB4HR did not find out about \nYammine’s  activities until late May 2020. (Doc. 35 at ¶  39.) In June 2020, TB4HR fired \nYammine. ( Id. at ¶ 43.) TB4HR alleges that Yammine and other employees wrongfully \ncontrolled the Domain and were double -dealing.  ( Id. at ¶ 35.)  One year later, Yammine \nwent int o business with a Swiss technology company to sell the CV Timeline product. ( Id. \nat ¶ 47.)  \nIn October 2020, TB4HR commenced a World Intellectual Property Organization \n(“WIPO”) arbitration as an attempt to regain control of the Domain. ( Id. at ¶ 56.) Late \nDecember 2020, a WIPO panelist determined the Domain belonged to TB4HR and ordered \nthat it be transferred to TB4HR. ( Id.) The UDRP  allows a defendant to file an action within \n10 business days to prevent the WIPO -ordered transfer. ( Id.; Doc. 1 at ¶ 27.) Accordingly, \nYammine had to commence an action specifically in this district to stop the transfer. (Doc. \n1 at ¶ 27.)  \nYammine filed th e Complaint against TB4HR in January 2021, and seeks, inter alia , \ndeclaratory relief. ( Id. at ¶ 1.) TB4HR then filed the First Amended Answer and seven \ncounterclaims. (Doc. 35.) In the pending Motion, Yammine moves to dismiss four of the \nseven counterclaim s against him for lack of personal jurisdiction and, in the alternative, \nfive of the seven counterclaims for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. \nYammine does not challenge the exercise of personal jurisdiction over Count I \n(Cyberpira cy), Count III (Declaratory Relief), and Count V (Conversion) of the \ncounterclaims.

LEGAL STANDARDS  \nA. Rule 12(b)(2)  \nUnder Rule 12(b)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, a defendant may move, \n“prior to trial, to dismiss the complaint for lack of personal jurisdiction.” Data Disc, Inc. \nv. Sys. Tech. Assocs., Inc. , 557 F.2d 1280, 1285 (9th Cir. 1977). The plaintiff bears the \nburden to show that an exercise of jurisdiction is proper. Ziegler v. Indian River Cnty. , 64 \nF.3d 470, 4 73 (9th Cir. 1995). Here, the plaintiff “need only make a prima facie showing \nof jurisdictional facts.” Sher v. Johnson , 911 F.2d 1357, 1361 (9th Cir. 1990) (internal \ncitation omitted). When examining whether there is a prima facie showing of jurisdictiona l \nfacts, any “uncontroverted allegations in [the complaint] must be taken as true, and \nconflicts between the facts contained in the parties’ affidavits must be resolved in \n[plaintiff’s] favor.” AT&T Co. v. Compagnie Bruxelles Lambert , 94 F.3d 586, 588 (9th  Cir. \n1996) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).  \nB. Rule 12(b)(6)  \nTo survive a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, a complaint must contain \n“a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief” s uch \nthat the defendant is given “fair notice of what the . . . claim is and the grounds upon which \nit rests.” Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly , 550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007) (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. \n8(a)(2); Conley v. Gibson , 355 U.S. 41, 47 (1957)). Dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) “can be \nbased on the lack of a cognizable legal theory or the absence of sufficient facts alleged \nunder a cognizable legal theory.” Balistreri v. Pacifica Police Dep’t , 901 F.2d 696, 699 \n(9th Cir. 1988). A complaint should not be dismissed “u nless it appears beyond doubt that \nthe plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of the claim that would entitle it to relief.” \nWilliamson v. Gen.

Review of a Rule 12(b)(6) motion is \n“limited to the content of the complaint.” North Star Int’l , 720 F.2d at 581.  \nIII. DISCUSSION  \nA. Personal Jurisdiction  \nYammine challenges this Court’s exercise of personal jurisdiction over half of the \ncounterclaims against him. He asserts that the four counterclaims at issue are “unrelated” \nto his act of registering the Domain with GoDaddy, which is headquartered in Arizon a, and \nthat act alone is insufficient to support personal jurisdiction. (Doc. 44 at 8 –15.) TB4HR \nargues  that Yammine has consented to personal jurisdiction over any potential \ncounterclaims because Yammine invoked this Court’s jurisdiction by filing his initial \ncomplaint. (Doc. 55 at 12 –14.)   \n“Once a plaintiff invokes the jurisdiction of a federal court by filing a complaint, \nthe court maintains jurisdiction over the plaintiff for all subsequent proceedings, including \nall counterclaims asserted against the plaintiff.” Verve LLC v. Hypercom Corp. , No. CV -\n05-0365 -PHX -FJM, 2006 WL 8441358, at *4 (D. Ariz. June 13, 2006); see also  Leman v. \nKrentler -Arnold Hinge Last Co. , 284 U.S. 448, 451 (1932) (finding jurisdiction existed \nbecause the plaintiff, upon bringing suit in federal district court, “submitted itself to the \njurisdiction of the court with respect to all the issues embraced in the suit, including those \npertaining to the counterclaim of the defendants”). Stated differently, a plaintiff who avails \nhimself o f the district court consents to the district court’s personal jurisdiction over the \ncounterclaims against him.   \n Yammine invoked the jurisdiction of this Court by filing his complaint against \nTB4HR here in the District of Arizona. Schnabel v. Lui , 302 F.3d 1023, 1037 (9th Cir. \n2002) (“[P]laintiffs who avail themselves of the district court consent to personal \njurisdiction.”). Accordingly, the Court maintains jurisdiction over all subsequent \nproceedings “embraced in the suit” —including all of TB4HR’s cou nterclaims. Leman , 248 \nU.S. at 451. Yammine argues  that he filed in this District because it was “the exclusive \njurisdiction in which Plaintiff could stop the UDRP decision from taking effect”  to contest Case 2:21-cv-00093-MTL   Document 65   Filed 03/14/22   Page 5 of 13 \n- 6 -  \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n personal jurisdiction.  (Doc. 44 at 12 (emphasis omit ted).) How Yammine came to file in \nthis District does not change the fact that Yammine filed in this District, invoked the \njurisdiction of this District, and consented to personal jurisdiction in this District.    \nYammine and TB4HR further debate the relat edness of the claims to Yammine’s \ninitial complaint. The crux of Yammine’s argument is that four of TB4HR’s counterclaims \nagainst him are “unrelated” to the underlying claim.  ( Id. at 8, 10, 12, 15.) TB4HR argues \nthat all of its counterclaims “relate to th e same core controversy over the Domain.” (Doc. \n55 at 13 n.3.)  Regardless of whether the counterclaims are compulsory or permissive, this \nCourt has jurisdiction. 6 Charles Alan Wright, Arthur Miller and Mary Kay Kane (“Wright \n& Miller”), Federal Practice and Procedure §  1424 (“In general, if defendant interposes a \npermissive counterclaim, plaintiff cannot object that the court lacks personal jurisdiction \nor that venue is improper for purposes of adjudicating the claim.”); Wright & Miller, \n§ 1416 (“Plaintif f may not object that the court lacks personal jurisdiction or that venue is \nimproper for purposes of adjudicating a compulsory counterclaim that defendant has \ninterposed. By choosing a particular forum in which to seek affirmative relief, plaintiff \neffect ively waives any objections to that forum based on personal inconvenience.”). \nBecause Yammine filed the underlying complaint in this district, he may not contest \njurisdiction against any counterclaims filed against him, whether they are permissive or \ncompu lsory. Thus, this Court denies Yammine’s motion for lack of personal jurisdiction  \nas to Counts II, IV, VI and VII .  \nB. Failure to State a Claim  \nYammine alternatively moves to dismiss Counts I, II, IV, VI, and VII of TB4HR’s \nFirst Amended Counterclaim for f ailure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. \n(Doc. 44 at 7.)1  \n \n1 TB4HR suggests that Yammine did not fully comply with LRCiv 12.1(c) in filing this \nmotion to dismiss  because the motion  “omits the certification of the pre -motion meet and \nconfer process.” (Doc. 55 at 9, n.10.) But Yammine did not omit the LRCiv. 12.1(c) \ncertification; it was attached to the Memorandum in Support of Plaintiff’s Motion to \nDismiss. (Doc. 44 at 25.) Thus, Yam mine fully complied with the 12.1(c) certification \nrequirements and the Court, in its discretion, will not summarily dismiss Yammine’s Case 2:21-cv-00093-MTL   Document 65   Filed 03/14/22   Page 6 of 13 \n- 7 -  \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n 1. Cyberpiracy (Count I) and Trademark Infringement (Count II)  \nTB4HR brings a counterclaim for cyberpiracy under the Anti -Cybersquatting \nConsumer Protection Act (“ACPA ”). 15 U.S.C. § 1125(d). To state a claim under the \nACPA, a plaintiff must allege: “that (1) the defendant registered, trafficked in, or used a \ndomain name; (2) the domain name is identical or confusingly similar to a protected mark \nowned by the plaintiff;  and (3) the defendant acted with bad faith intent to profit from that \nmark.” DPST Int’l., Inc. v. Nahum , 624 F.3d 1213, 1218 –19 (9th Cir. 2010). Additionally, \nTB4HR brings a counterclaim for trademark infringement under 15 U.S.C. § 1125(a). In \nthis case, a plaintiff must prove “(1) that it held a valid protectable mark and (2) that the \ndefendant is using a mark confusingly similar.” Cont’l Promotion Grp., Inc. v. Garvin , No. \nCV-08-0070 -PHX -SRB, 2008 WL 11338887, at *11 (D. Ariz. Mar. 8, 2008) (internal \nquotations omitted).  Yammine contends that Counts I and II must be dismissed because \nTB4HR “does not allege any information that would demonstrate trademark rights in its \nalleged unregistered  trademark.” (Doc. 44 at 18.) No other elements of the claims are \ncontested, and it is undisputed that the trademark —here, CV Timeline —is unregistered.  \nProtectable ownership interests are established in an unregistered trademark if the \nmark has been used in commerce. Adams v. Hartz Mountain Corp. , No. C14 -1174RSL, \n2014 WL 7151781, at *3 (D. Ariz. Dec. 14, 2014). To show commercial use , a party must \nprove (1) that it actually adopted and used the mark in commerce before it was registered \nby another party and (2) the use of the mark was continuous and not interrupted. Dep’t o f \nParks & Recreation for State of Cal. v. Bazaar Del Mundo Inc. , 448 F.3d 1118, 1125 –26 \n(9th Cir. 2006). Protectable ownership interests vest in an unregistered trademark upon a \nsingle instance of commercial use, “so long as the use demonstrate[s] both ado ption of the \nmark[] and use in a way sufficiently public to identify or distinguish the marked goods in \nan appropriate segment of the public mind as [that] of the adopter of the mark.” Adams , \n2014 WL 7151781, at *3.  \n \n12(b)(6) Motion.  Case 2:21-cv-00093-MTL   Document 65   Filed 03/14/22   Page 7 of 13 \n- 8 -  \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n Here, TB4HR has alleged facts sufficient  to raise a plausible inference it has a \nprotectable interest in the unregistered mark because TB4HR used CV Timeline  \ncontinuously in commerce since the mark’s  inception. See id. (finding the plaintiff alleged \nfacts sufficient to raise a plausible inferenc e of a protectable ownership interest in a mark \nbecause the plaintiff used the mark in commerce). TB4HR alleged that the CV Timeline \nmark  was “put into immediate use in commerce broadly and universally across the United \nStates and the world,” that it has been used to sell its service on social media since 2018, \nand $1 million was spent in development and marketing of the mark. (Doc. 35 at ¶¶ 22, 24, \n65, 71.) Thus, TB4HR has sufficiently stated a claim to survive a 12(b)(6) motion, and \nYammine’s Motion  to dismiss Counts I and II is denied.  \n2. Misappropriation and Threatened Misappropriation of Trade \nSecrets (Count IV)  \nYammine challenges TB4HR’s counterclaim for misappropriation of trade secrets \nunder the Defend Trade Secrets Act (“DTSA”) because TB4HR “has not pled what its trade \nsecrets are or their economic value.” (Doc. 44 at 13.) 18 U.S.C. §§ 1832, 1836 et seq. To \nstate a claim under the DTSA, a plaintiff must allege: “(1) that the plaintiff possessed a \ntrade secret, (2) that the defendant misapprop riated the trade secret; and (3) that the \nmisappropriation caused or threatened damage to the plaintiff.” InteliClear, LLC v. ETC \nGlob. Holdings, Inc. , 978 F.3d 653, 657 –58 (9th Cir. 2020). Besides the existence of a \ntrade secret, no other elements are con tested.  \nUnder the DTSA, a trade secret is defined as “financial, business, scientific, \ntechnical, economic, or engineering information” that the owner takes reasonable measures \nto keep secret and the information  derives independent economic value from bein g a secret. \n18 U.S.C. §  1839(3).   The DTSA has an expansive definition of trade secret; a plaintiff \nmeets the Iqbal pleading standard even by alleging  broad categories of confidential \ninformation. Physics, Material, and Applied Mathematics Rsch. LLC v. Yea k, No. CV -20-\n00379 -TUC -JCH, 2021 WL 2557398, at *6 (D. Ariz. May 3, 2021) (holding allegations of \n“trade secrets embodied in written materials, drawings, computer codes, processes, Case 2:21-cv-00093-MTL   Document 65   Filed 03/14/22   Page 8 of 13 \n- 9 -  \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n procedures, equipment, list of suppliers, customers, and contacts regarding  specific \ncategories of laser systems” are sufficient to survive a 12(b)(6) motion) (internal quotations \nomitted); see also W.L. Gore & Assocs., Inc. v. GI Dynamics, Inc. , No. CV -10-8088 -PHX -\nGMS, 2010 WL 5184254, at *8 (D. Ariz. Dec. 15, 2010) (holding all egations of “market \nstudies, financial information, manufacturing methods, and . . . future plans, which were \nnot published in the patent applications” are sufficient to survive a 12(b)(6) motion). A \nplaintiff is not required to plead with such specificity  as to reveal the trade secret. Physics, \nMaterial, and Applied Mathematics Rsch. , 2021 WL 2557398, at *6.   \nTB4HR alleged its trade secrets “include both knowhow and negative knowhow \nregarding creating, marketing, selling, designing, updating, and using th e software and \nservice comprising CV  Timeline” and “[t]he internal workings and design of the \nCVTimeline Domain and software are also themselves trade secrets.” (Doc. 35 at ¶¶ 81 –\n82.)  TB4HR also alleges it “conducted research and development into automati ng the work \nof recruiters with enhancements in artificial intelligence,” and had found “indication[s] that \nthere are patterns that could be followed up on to make enhanced prognostications that \naccurately identify when a tech professional may be interested  in changing their job.” ( Id. \nat ¶ 15.) These allegations surpass the pleading standard set forth in Iqbal and refined in \nPhysics, Material, and Applied Mathematics R esearch , and it is plausible that an entity \noutside of TB4HR would not have knowledge of T B4HR’s software design. Therefore, \nthese allegations are sufficient to state a trade secret.  \nYammine also contends that the TB4HR’s allegations “make bare bones \nstatements” about how its trade secrets derive economic value. (Doc. 44 at 20.) Trade \nsecrets have independent economic value when their actual or potential value derives from \nbeing kept secret. 18 U.S.C. § 1839(3)(B). This value is determined from “the degree to \nwhich the secret information confers a competitive advantage on its owner.” Attia v. \nGoogle LLC , 983 F.3d 420, 426 (9th Cir. 2020). As a result, the parties may prove \nindependent economic value via “circumstantial evidence of the resources invested in \nproducing the information, the precautions taken to protects its secrecy, and the willingn ess Case 2:21-cv-00093-MTL   Document 65   Filed 03/14/22   Page 9 of 13 \n- 10 -  \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n of others to pay for its access.” Joshua David Mellberg LLC v. Will , 96 F.Supp.3d 953, \n973–74 (D. Ariz. Mar. 30, 2015) (internal quotation marks omitted).  \nHere, TB4HR’s allegations of protective measures are sufficient to show that its \ntrade secrets d erive economic value. For example, TB4HR pleaded that its trade secrets are \n“subject to extensive efforts to maintain secrecy and confidentiality” such as requiring \nemployees and contractors to sign confidentiality agreements and restricting access to \nconfidential information to limited subset of people. (Doc. 35 at ¶ 80.)  Moreover, TB4HR \nemploys technical safeguards of data encryption and password protection corresponding to \na user’s role in the company. ( Id.) And “everyone who would possible obtain confi dential \ninformation, third parties, contractors, and/or employees would all have to sign \nconfidentiality agreements first.” ( Id. at 13, n.3.) These assertions , coupled with allegations \nthat TB4HR is in a “niche market ,” are enough for TB4HR to survive a 12 (b)(6) motion to \ndismiss on this claim. ( Id. at ¶¶ 11 –13.) Yammine’s Motion to dismiss Count IV is denied.  \n3. Tortious Interference With Prospective Economic Advantage \n(Count VI)  \nTB4HR also alleges a counterclaim for tortious interference with prospective \neconomic advantage. ( Id. at ¶¶ 98 –107.)   For this claim, a plaintiff must allege: “(1) the \nexistence of a valid contractual relationship or business expectancy, (2) the interferer’s \nknowledge of the relationship or expectancy, (3) intentional interference  inducing or \ncausing a breach or termination of the relationship or expectancy, and (4) resultant damage \nto the party whose relationship or expectancy has been disrupted.” FLP, LLC v. Wolf , No. \nCV17 -0214 PHX DGC, 2017 WL 4699490, at *2 (D. Ariz. Oct. 19, 2 017). Yammine \ncontends that TB4HR fails to meet the first element . By referring only to its “potential \ncustomers” and “people who may want to do business with TB4HR,” Yammine argues \nTB4HR failed to allege the existence of a business expectancy.  (Doc. 44 at 21 –22; Doc. \n35 at ¶¶ 100, 104.)  \n“A claim for tortious interferenc e with a business expectancy is insufficient unless \nthe plaintiff alleges facts showing the expectancy constitutes more than a mere hope.”  Case 2:21-cv-00093-MTL   Document 65   Filed 03/14/22   Page 10 of 13 \n- 11 -  \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n Crestwood Capital Corp. v.

June 24 , 2016) (internal citation omitted).2 When the \nbusiness expectancy applies to a group of people, courts have permitted a “plaintiff to \nallege an expectancy with a class of individuals,” so long as the group is specifically \nidentifiable.  Dube v. Likins , 216 Ariz. 406, 414,  ¶ 20 (Ct. App. 2007). Thus, business \nexpectancy does not have to be measured by particular relations, instead it “can be \nmeasured by looking to a background of business experience rather than a particular \nrelationship.” Pettit v. Ariz. B d. of Regents , No. CV 05 -2922 -PHX -ROS, 2006 WL \n8422926, at *5 (D. Ariz. Aug. 28, 2006) (internal citation and quotation omitted) (finding \na business expectancy when plaintiff allege defendant “deprived [Plaintiff] of future patent \nand licensing income”).  \nTB4HR’s complaint states that “Yammine knew at all relevant times TB4HR was \nattempting to negotiate with and obtain customers in the United States, and beyond, for \n[CV Timeline].”  (Doc. 35 at ¶ 99.) As a result, TB4HR alleged Yammine interfered with \n“pote ntial customers” and “people who may want to do business with TB4HR.” ( Id. at ¶¶ \n100, 104.) Even with TB4HR’s reference to a targeted advertising campaign, this is not \nenough to prove its business expectancy constitutes more than a “mere hope.” ( Id. at ¶ 2 3.) \nCrestwood Capital Corp., 2016 WL 3457952, at *19; see also  Dube, 216 Ariz. at 414 \n(“Although the tort of tortious interference with a business expectancy covers situations \nthat the tort of intentional interference with a contract does not, the former h as only been \navailable in those situations where the plaintiff can identify the specific relationship with \nwhich the defendant interfered.”).  \nTB4HR has not proven a specific relationship with any of its potential customers. \nTB4HR relies on a string of ina pposite cases in unrelated areas or unrelated prongs of the \ntortious interference test to attempt to prove that potential customers can create a business \n \n2 Different standards govern a business expectancy versus contractual relationship. Rebath \nLLC v. HD Sol utions LLC , No. CV -19-04873 -PHX -JJT, 2020 WL 4514934, at *2 (D. Ariz. \nSep. 18, 2020).  TB4HR and Yammine only brief the business expectancy standard, and no \nfacts supporting a contractual relationship exist in this record. Accordingly, the Court \napplies the  business expectancy standard.

Aug. 6, 2008) (addressing a claim \nfor tor tious interference with existing and prospective contractual relations, not business \nexpectancy).  Thus, TB4HR’s reference to “potential customers” and “people who may \nwant to do business with TB4HR” is not enough to establish a business expectancy. (Doc. \n35 at ¶¶  98–107.) Yammine’s Motion to dismiss Count VI is granted.  \n4. Breach of Fiduciary Duties (Count VII)  \nYammine asserts TB4HR’s counterclaim for breach of fiduciary duties must be \ndismissed because Yammine resides in Poland, so the application of Arizona law is \n“complete overreach.” (Doc. 44 at 22 –23.) TB4HR advocates for the application of \nArizona law becau se Yammine registered the Domain in Arizona “in violation of the \nloyalties he owed to [TB4HR].”  (Doc. 55 at 24 –25.)  “To properly plead a claim for breach \nof fiduciary duty a party must show: (1) the existence of a fiduciary duty, (2) its breach, \nand (3) damages resulting from the breach.” Where Yammine resides and where the \nconduct occurred has no significance in the Court’s fiduciary duty analysis. See Wine Educ. \nCouncil v. Arizona Rangers , No. CV -19-02235 -PHX -SMB, 2020 WL 7352632, at *7 (D. \nAriz. Dec. 1 5, 2020) (listing the elements of a breach of fiduciary duty claim, but not listing \nthe situs of the conduct). Yammine cites no law in support of his assertion that a breach of \nfiduciary duty claim turns on where the conduct occurred. Additionally, as the parties gave \nno written notice of intent to raise an issue of foreign law, this Court is under no obligation Case 2:21-cv-00093-MTL   Document 65   Filed 03/14/22   Page 12 of 13 \n- 13 -  \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n \nto apply any other law. MCA, Inc. v. U.S. , 685 F.2d 1099, n.12 (9th Cir. 1982). TB4HR \nand Yammine have not provided such written intent, so this Co urt looks to Arizona as the \nforum state to determine what fiduciary duties Yammine owed. See id.  \nYammine also contends that TB4HR has not alleged any actual harm. But TB4HR \nalleged it projected to make $5 million in profit “using the Service and Mark, but  due to \nthe consumer -confusing activities of Yammine through the Domain and in his dilution of \nthe Mark, they have been unable to profit at all.” (Doc. 35 at ¶ 50.) Thus, TB4HR alleged \nharm sufficient to survive Yammine’s motion to dismiss. As such, Yammin e’s motion to \ndismiss Count VII is denied.  \nIV. CONCLUSION  \nAccordingly,  \nIT IS ORDERED denying Plaintiff/Counter -Defendant Marco Yammine’s Motion \nto Dismiss Counts II, IV, VI, and VII of Defendant/Counter -Plaintiff TB4HR’s \nCounterclaim for lack of personal jurisdiction.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: The case involves Appdiff, Inc., a technology company in the AI industry, which filed a lawsuit against former employees, alleging breaches such as breach of contract and deceptive trade practices. Appdiff sought a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) to prevent the defendants from misusing company information and misrepresenting themselves as affiliates. However, the court denied the motion for TRO due to Appdiff's failure to demonstrate irreparable harm, while ordering expedited discovery to address disputed account ownership issues related to the integration of PinkLion, an AI company acquired by Appdiff.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether Appdiff, Inc. demonstrated irreparable harm sufficient to grant a preliminary injunction against its former employees, who allegedly misrepresented their association with a company Appdiff had acquired.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court denied the motion for a Temporary Restraining Order/Preliminary Injunction, as Appdiff did not sufficiently demonstrate irreparable harm. However, the court ordered expedited discovery to resolve ownership and access issues concerning certain disputed accounts.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine you have a toy robot business and hire some new team members who used to have their own robot company. You buy their company, but one day you find out they're still acting like the old company is theirs. You ask the court to immediately stop them, but the court says, “Show me why you can’t just solve this with money later,” and you can’t. So, the court doesn't stop them with a big “NO,” but instead lets you and them quickly gather all facts to sort out what’s really yours and what’s theirs, expecting they won't mess with what you've agreed is now yours.",

As such,  the Cou rt will treat Appdiff’s TRO M otion as a motion  for a preliminary \ninjunction pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(a).   \nBecause Appdiff has failed to show irreparable harm, the Court will deny the \nmotion.  Even so, the Court will order that the parties engage in expedited discovery, the \ncontours of which should be set by the Magistrate Judge,  to resolve the remaining \nownership issues that pertain to the limited accounts still in dispute.    \nBACKGROUND  \n \nAppdiff is a technology company in the artificial intelligence (“AI”) business and is  \norganized under the laws of Delaware with its principal place of business located in \nCalifornia.  (Compl. ¶ 2, July 10, 2020, Docket No. 1.)  Defendants are  residents o f \nMinnesota and former Appdiff  employ ees who worked out of Appdiff’s Minneapolis \noffice.  (Id. ¶¶ 3 –5.)  Prior to their employment with Appdiff, Defendants founded the AI \ncompany PinkLion.   (Id. ¶ 45 )  In March 2020, approximately eight months into their \nAppdiff employment, Defendants sold PinkLion to Appdiff.  ( Id. ¶ 47, Decl. of Jason Arbon \n(“Arbon Decl.”) ¶ 25, July 14, 2020, Docket No. 13.)  Defendant Birkholz was terminated \nby Appdiff shortly after Appdiff purchas ed PinkLion as part of a larger reduction in staff \ndue to the economic uncertainty created by COVID -19.  (Arbon Decl. ¶ 33.)  \nDespite selling PinkLion to Appdiff, f rom approximately May to mid -July 2020, \nAppdiff alleges Defendants operated as though they still owned PinkLion.  ( Id. ¶¶ 25 –32.) \nFor example, Appdiff alleges Defendants entered into contracts on PinkLion’s behalf.  ( Id. CASE 0:20-cv-01558-JRT-HB   Document 55   Filed 08/12/20   Page 2 of 9-3- ¶ 28.)  Appdiff also alleges that Defendants diverted business from Appdiff when, on \nAppdiff time, they fraudulently and falsely  pitched venture capital firms to invest in \nPinkLion as if it had never been sold, when in reality Defendants planned to use the money \nraised for a new, undisclosed AI project, called “The AI App Store” unrelated to Appdiff. \n(Id. ¶ 34 –36, 43.)   Bonine and Faulise also allegedly gave Birkholz unauthorized access to \nthe PinkLion servers.  ( Id. ¶ 37.)  \nOn July 10, 2020, after being confronted about their actions, Bonine and Faulise \nallegedly admitted to the actions and were terminated.   (Id. ¶¶ 39, 42–45.)  Appdiff filed \nthis action later that same day, alleging five Counts against Defendants: (I) breach- of-\ncontract against Bonine and Faulise for various violations of the employment agreement; \n(II) breach of fiduciary duty of loyalty; (III) breach of post -term ination employment \nobligations against Bonine and Faulise;1 (IV) violations of Minnesota Deceptive Trade \nPractices Act against all Defendants; (V) Aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty \nagainst all defendants.  (Compl. ¶¶ 73–127.)   \nOn July 14, 2020, Appdiff filed a Motion for a TRO pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 65 (b), \nseeking an order from the Court (1) preventing Defendants from misrepresenting \nthemselves to investors and the tech industry as representatives of Plaintiff and (2) \ncompelling them to re turn Plaintiff’s confidential business records, technology, and \n \n \n1 This appears to be alleged violations of the same contract under Count I, and should likely be \nconsidered alongside the other allegations in Count I for breach- of-contract.

Despite Appdiff purchasing PinkLion, PinkLion’s systems, \nservers, and other proprietary information had not been fully integrated into Appdiff’s \nsystems at the time of Bonine and Faulise’s termination.  Un der their employment \ncontracts, Appdiff alleges Bonine and Faulise were required to return company property \nand provide Appdiff with required login and password information to access the PinkLion \nservers and information, which became Appdiff property  after  it acquired PinkLion .  (Id. \n47.)  Appdiff stated Bonine and Faulise failed to turn over this information despite \npromising they would after being terminated.  (Id. ¶ 48.)  Without this information and \naccess to PinkLion, Appdiff states it is irreparably harmed because it cannot effectively \nrun its business and is deprived of customer information.  ( Id. ¶ 49.)   \nAfter holding two status conferences with the parties the Court declined to issue a \nTRO and instead allowed Defendants time to respond.  ( See Minut e Entry, July 16, 2020, \nDocket No. 33, Minute Entry, July 21, 2020, Docket No. 35.)  \n \n \n2 Specifically, Appdiff requested a TRO preventing Defendants from (1) representing themselves \nas officers, employees, or representatives of Appdiff or PinkLion; (2) soliciting revenue from \nventure capital funds by misrepresenting that they are acting on behalf PinkLion; (3) using, \ndisclosing or relying on Appdiff’s confidential informa tion; (4) failing to return Appdiff’s \nconfidential information; (5) failing to provide Appdiff with all account passwords associated with \nPinkLion; (6) accessing servers or other accounts owned or used by PinkLion; (7) physically \naccessing PinkLion’s physi cal office space; (8) refusing to identify bank account information \nassociated with PinkLion; and (9) using or transferring in any way money or assets Defendants \nacquired  through using the PinkLion name after March 13, 2020.  (Proposed Order ¶¶ 1 –9, July \n14, 2020, Docket No. 22.)    CASE 0:20-cv-01558-JRT-HB   Document 55   Filed 08/12/20   Page 4 of 9-5- On July 30, 2020 Defendants filed a response disputing most of the allegations \nalleged in the Complaint, but also noting that they have agreed to much of Appdiff’s TRO \nrequests , including that they will stop representing or associating themselves with the \nPinkLion name.   (See Def.’s Opp’n. at 15–20, July 30, 2020, Docket No. 36.)   \nRemaining in dispute are ownership, access , and control over  four specific, cloud -\nbased accounts:  (1) Defendants’ Microsoft Office365 email accounts; (2) Defendant \nBirkholz’s GitHub account; (3) Defendant Bonine’s HubSpot account; and (4) Defendant \nBirkholz’s personal Slack account.  Defendants also state that they are preserving without \naltering these accounts.  (Decl. of Jennifer L. Bonine (“Bonine Decl.”) ¶ 2 3, July 30, 2020, \nDocket No. 38, Decl. of Andrew A.

STANDARD OF REVIEW  \nCourts evaluating a motion for preliminary injunctive relief weigh four factors , \ncommonly referred to in this Circuit as the Dataphase factors : (1) the movant's likelihood \nof success on the merits; (2) the threat of irreparable harm to the movant in the absence \nof relief; (3) the  balance between that harm and the harm injunctive relief would cause \nto the other litigants; and (4) the public interest.  Rodgers v. Bryant , 942 F.3d 451, 455 (8th \nCir. 2019)  (citing Dataphase Sys., Inc. v. C L Sys., Inc. , 640 F.2d 109, 113 (8th Cir. 1981) (en \nbanc) ).  CASE 0:20-cv-01558-JRT-HB   Document 55   Filed 08/12/20   Page 5 of 9-6- When applying these factors, “a court should flexibly weigh the case’s particular \ncircumstances to determine whether the balance of equities so favors the movant that \njustice requires the court to intervene.” Hubbard Feeds, Inc. v. Animal Feed Supplement, \nInc., 182 F.3d 598, 601 (8th Cir. 1999)  (quoting United Indus. Corp. v. Clorox Co. , 140 F.3d \n1175, 1179 (8th Cir. 1998) ).  That said, “injunctive relief is an extraordinary remedy and \nthe movant has the burden of establishing the propriety of an injunction. ”  Watts v. Fed. \nHome Loan Mortg. Corp. , No. 12- 692 SRN/JSM, 2012 WL 1901304, at *3 (D. Minn. May \n25, 2012) .   \nII. ANALYSIS  \nGiven the part icular facts of this case, the Court will first consider the question of \nirreparable harm.  “Irreparable harm occurs when a party has no adequate remedy at law, \ntypically because its injuries cannot be fully compensated through an award of damages.” \nGen. M otors Corp. v. Harry Brown ’s, LLC, 563 F.3d 312, 319 (8th Cir. 2009).  “To succeed in \ndemonstrating a threat of irreparable harm, a party must show that the harm is certain \nand great and of such imminence that there is a clear and present need for equitable \nrelief.”  Roudachevski v. All- Am. Care Centers, Inc. , 648 F.3d 701, 706 (8th Cir. 2011) \n(cleaned up).   This factor is required to grant injunctive relief.  Id. (“Even when a plaintiff \nhas a strong claim on the merits, preliminary injunctive relief is improper absent a \nshowing of a threat of irreparable harm.” )   CASE 0:20-cv-01558-JRT-HB   Document 55   Filed 08/12/20   Page 6 of 9-7- Appdiff has  not adequately demonstrated it is likely to suffer irreparable harm  for \nseveral reasons .  Id.   First, Defendants have stipulated that they will no  longer associate  \nthemselves with the PinkLion name and are preserving without altering information on \nthe four accounts in dispute. Any past actions otherwise can be remedied by damages.   \nSecond, it appears undisputed that Appdiff’s customer base is secure  and that \nDefendants are not attempting to divert A ppdiff’s customer base to their own, new \nventure.  In fact, Defendants contend that their new venture is not a direct competitor \nwith Appdiff  at all.  And although Appdiff states that they are unable to communicate with \npotential clients,  they point to no specific business being lost.   \nThird, Defendants state that they have never had access to Appdiff’s trade secret \nAI technology or source code information and therefore there is no risk they could  use it  \nor disclose it without authorization .  Any allegations of past improprieties related to such \ninformation can be remedied with damages.  \nFourth, although Appdiff argues that a clause contained within Defendants ’ \nemployment contracts states that a violation  of the employment agreement constitutes \nirreparable harm, such a clause is but one consideration in the irreparable harm analysis .  \nSee Midwest Sign & Screen Printing Supply Co. v. Dalpe , 386 F. Supp. 3d 1037, 1055 (D. \nMinn. 2019)  (“The Agreement's inclus ion of a term acknowledging the possibility of \nirreparable harm in the event of a breach does not establish a likelihood of irreparable \nharm here. ”)  Under the circumstances of this case and presuming that Appdiff meets the CASE 0:20-cv-01558-JRT-HB   Document 55   Filed 08/12/20   Page 7 of 9-8- likelihood of success of the merits factor for its breach -of-contract claim , the Court finds \nthat the presence of such a clause, on its own, does not create irreparable harm.  \nFinally, because Defendants are no longer e mployed by Appdiff, Appdiff faces no \nprospective harm on its claims relating to duty of loyalty or aiding and abetting such a \nbreach, given that these duties only exist while employed.  See Rehab. Specialists, Inc. v. \nKoering , 404 N.W.2d 301, 304 (Minn. Ct . App. 1987) (citing Sanitary Farm Dairies, Inc. v. \nWolf , 112 N.W.2d 42 (1961)).   \nIn sum, the Court finds that Appdiff has not shown that it is likely to suffer harm \nthat “ is certain and great and of such imminence that there is a clear and present need \nfor equitable relief.”   Roudachevski , 648 F.3d at 706.   Accordingly, the Court will deny \nAppdiff’s motion without considering the remaining Dataphase factors.  \nEven so, to resolve the issue of ownership over the disputed accounts and \ninformation within, the Court will order the parties to adhere to an expedited discovery \nschedule, to be set by the Magistrate Judge.  The Court also notes that its decision denying \nequitable relief here does not absolve Defendants of potential liability for damages at a \nlater time.  The Court also expects Defendants to adhere to their agreement to no longer \nassociate themselves with PinkLion.  If Defendants fail to follow their stipulation or \nattempt to test its contours, the Court encourages Appdiff to renew its motion for \ninjunctive relief.  \nORDER  CASE 0:20-cv-01558-JRT-HB   Document 55   Filed 08/12/20   Page 8 of 9-9- Based on the foregoing, and all the files, records, and proceedings herein, IT IS \nHEREBY ORDERED that:  \n1.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: In the *In Re Google Generative AI Copyright Litigation*, visual artists and authors alleged that Google and its parent company Alphabet used their copyrighted works without permission to train generative AI models. The court partially granted Google's motion to dismiss, allowing claims related to specific AI models to proceed while dismissing others and all claims against Alphabet due to insufficient allegations of control over Google's actions or involvement in the alleged copyright infringement.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether Google and Alphabet are liable for copyright infringement by using plaintiffs' works to train generative AI models without authorization.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court dismissed claims related to certain generative AI models due to lack of detailed allegations and dismissed claims against Alphabet for vicarious liability, determining Alphabet's parent-subsidiary relationship with Google was insufficient to establish control over the alleged infringing actions.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: A group of artists sued Google and its parent company, Alphabet, because they believed Google used their art to teach computers to create similar content, without asking first. The judge decided that some models could have used the artists' works, so those parts of the case could keep going. However, the judge also ruled that Alphabet couldn't be blamed just for being Google's \"parent,\" because it didn't directly control what Google did with the art.",

See infra  Section IV.C . \nThe technology at the center of this case, generative AI, refers to “systems or  models \ncapable of producing output that simulates human expression, often in response to user inputs  \ncalled ‘prompts. ’”  Compl.  ¶ 113.  There are three types of generative AI models at issue here, and \nthey are defined according to the types of content they can produce.  Large language models \n“accept user text prompts as input  text and generate responsive text as output .”  Id. ¶ 116.  Text -to-\nimage diffusion models “ use text prompts to create image outputs through a machine -learning  \ntechnique called diffusion .”  Id. ¶ 118.  Finally, multimodal large language models  “accept input \nand generate  output in multiple formats .”  Id. ¶ 119.   \nGenerative AI models are developed by using a training dataset  – that is, a massive amount \nof data  that may include “a variety of text,  image, audio, and video ” depending on the type of \nmodel  being trained .  Id.  This training data is sourced from materials like books, websites, news \narticles, source code, Wikipedia, internet forum posts, and social media conversations.  Id. ¶ 123.  \nTraining a generative AI model requires creating multiple copies:  “ first a copy is made  during \ndata collection, then a series  of copies are made during model training, and finally a copy is  \npermanently incorporated into the parameters ” of the generative AI model.   Id. ¶¶ 120, 174 .  \nHere,  Plaintiffs allege that their copyrighted works were included, without authorization, in \nvarious datasets that Google used to train certain of its generative AI models.    \nFirst, Google developed a series of large language models and multimodal large language \nmodels known as PaLM, GLaM, LaMDA, Bard, and Gemini.  Id. ¶¶ 122-128, 131 n.34.  Google \nallegedly trained these models on overlapping datasets, including Google’s Infiniset dataset, which \nincorporates the C4 dataset.  Id. ¶ 123.  The C4 dataset includes materials collected fro m Z-\nLibrary  and oceanofpdf.org – digital  libraries of pirated books – and Scribd.com, “ a subscription -\nbased digital  library with 60 million e -books and audio books .”  Id. ¶¶ 126-127.  According to the \ncomplaint, the Infiniset and C4 datasets include the copyrighted works of Plaintiffs Almond, \nBarer, Hubbard, Larson, Leovy, and McLennan.  Id. ¶ 129; see also id . ¶¶ 19-20, 27, 37 -38, 45, \n56-57, 64, 69 -70, 72, 83 -84, 86, 91 -92, 95.  Case 5:23-cv-03440-EKL     Document 216     Filed 09/11/25     Page 2 of 22 \n3 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  Second, Google developed a family of text -to-image diffusion models known as Imagen.  \nId. ¶¶ 118, 132.  Google allegedly trained the first version of Imagen on the LAION -400M dataset, \na dataset of 400 million text -image pairs named after the organization that compiled it:  the Large -\nScale Artificial Intelligence Open Network.  Id. ¶¶ 132, 138.  Plaintiffs allege that Google “likely”  \ntrained later versions of Imagen on the LAION -5B dataset, which includes the LAION -400M \ndataset and about five billion additio nal images.  Id. ¶¶ 144, 146 , 148 -149.  According to the \ncomplaint, the LAION -400M and LAION -5B datasets include the copyrighted works of Plaintiffs \nZhang, Andersen, Fink, McLellan, and Lemos.  Id. ¶¶ 143, 150; see also i d. ¶¶ 31 -32, 50 -51, 56 -\n57, 60, 64, 77 -78, 91-92, 95, 100-101. \nEach Plaintiff identifies specific works and traces them to  specific datasets that Google \nallegedly used to train certain generative AI models.  For example, Plaintiff Andersen – a \ncartoonist and illustrator – identifies six of her copyrighted works that were included in the \nLAION -400M and LAION -5B datasets.  Id. ¶¶ 30 -32.  The complaint provides the copyright \nregistration information for each of Andersen’s asserted works, Compl. Ex.  A at 8 -12, ECF \nNo. 91-1, and alleges  that the works are included in the datasets, Compl. Ex. B at 2 -7.  Each \nnamed Plaintiff alleges similar information.  Based on these allegations, Plaintiffs allege Google  \n“directly infringed upon Plaintiffs’ exclusive rights through multiple distinct  acts of un authorized \nreproduction and use ” of their works  during the model training process .  Compl . ¶ 174.  Unlike \nsome other generative AI copyright infringement cases, Plaintiffs do not allege that the models \nproduce infringing output.  Cf. Concord Music Grp., Inc. v. Anthropic PBC , 772 F. Supp. 3d 1131, \n1134 -36 (N.D. Cal. 2025).  \nB. Procedural History  \nThis consolidated action originated as two separate putative class actions:  Leovy v. Google \nLLC, No. 23 -cv-03440, and Zhang v. Google LLC , No. 24 -cv-02531 .  The Leovy  action was filed \non July 11, 2023 , and asserted  copyright infringement and many other claims against Google, \nAlphabet, and DeepMind .  ECF No. 1.  The claims against Alphabet and DeepMind were \nvoluntarily dismissed without prejudice  early in the case .  Not ice of Voluntary Dismissal, ECF \nNo. 13.  Thereafter, Google moved to dismiss the complaint, but rather than opposing, the Leovy  Case 5:23-cv-03440-EKL     Document 216     Filed 09/11/25     Page 3 of 22 \n4 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  Plaintiff s amended the complaint as a matter of course pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \n15(a)(1).  Notice, ECF No. 15; see also  First Am. Compl., ECF No. 28.  Google then moved to \ndismiss the first amended complaint, ECF No. 33, and  Judge Mart ínez-Olgu ín granted the motion  \nbecause the complaint  failed to comply with Rule 8 , see Order, ECF No. 46.  On June 27, 2024,  \nthe second amended complaint was filed.  ECF No. 47.  Google moved to dismiss  again,  ECF \nNo. 55, and that motion was pending when the  Leovy  case was reassigned to this Court on August \n21, 2024.  \nThe Zhang action was filed on April 26, 2024, on behalf of visual artists – including \nphotographers, cartoonists, and illustrators.  Zhang Compl . ¶¶ 11 -14, No. 24 -cv-02531, ECF \nNo. 1.  The Zhang  Plaintiffs asserted a claim for direct copyright infringement against Google, and \na claim for vicarious copyright infringement against Alphabet.  On June 20, 2024, Google moved \nto dismiss the complaint.   Mot. to Dismiss, Zhang , No. 24 -cv-02531, ECF No. 24.  This motion \nwas also pending when the Zhang  case was reassigned to this Court on August 21, 202 4. \nAfter the Leovy and Zhang  cases were reassigned to this Court, the Court granted the \nparties’ stipulation to consolidate the cases for all trial and pretrial proceedings.  Joint Stip. & \nOrder Consolidating Cases, ECF No.  73.  The parties presented competing proposals  with respect \nto the pending motions to dismiss .  Defendants asked the Court to decide the pending motions.  \nDefs.’ Status Report, ECF No. 75.  Plaintiffs asked the Court to deny the motions as moot, and to \ngrant leave to file a consolidated ame nded complaint .  Pls.’ Status Report at 2, ECF No. 76.   Over \nDefendants’ objections, t he Court terminated the motions to dismiss and granted Plaintiffs leave to \nfile a consolidated amended complaint .  However, the Court  ordered the parties to first meet and \nconfer regarding Plaintiffs’ anticipated amendments.  See Order Re: Consolidation Plan at 2, ECF \nNo. 77 (“ Plaintiffs shall disclose all new parties, new claims, and new allegations not included in \neither the Leovy  second amended complaint or the Zhang  complaint. ”).  The purpose of the meet -\nand-confer process was to streamline further motion practice on the pleadings, and to account for \nissues that Google raised in its motions to dismiss prior to consolidation.  See id . (“In finalizing \nthe consolidated amended complaint, Plaintiffs shall make substantial good -faith efforts to address \nthe issues Google raised at the conference and in prior motions to dismiss. ”).

The \noperative complaint asserts two causes of action:  d irect copyright infringement  against Google , \nCompl. ¶¶ 171 -181, and v icarious copyright infringement against Alphabet , id. ¶¶ 182 -195.  \nDefendants  move  to dismiss on various grounds discussed below .  Defendants  also filed a motion \nto strike class allegations, which the Court addressed in a separate order.  See Order Granting Mot. \nto Strike Class Allegations, ECF No. 128 . \nII. LEGAL STANDARD  \nUnder Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), a court must dismiss a complaint if it fails \nto state a claim upon which relief can be granted.  To avoid dismissal, the plaintiff must allege \n“enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its  face.”   Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly , \n550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007).   A claim is facially plausible when the pleaded facts allow the court \n“to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.”  \nAshcroft v.  Iqbal , 556 U.S. 66 2, 678 (2009).  When  there are “two  possible  explanations, only one \nof which can be true and only one of which results in liability, plaintiff s cannot offer allegations \nthat are ‘merely consistent with’ [its] favored explanation but are also consistent with the \nalternative explanation.”   In re Century Aluminum Co. Sec. Litig. , 729 F.3d 1104, 1108 (9th \nCir. 2013) (quoting Iqbal , 556 U.S. at 678) .  “Something more is needed, such as facts tending to \nexclude the possibility that the alternative explanation is true, in order to render  plaintiffs’  \nallegations plausible within the meaning of  Iqbal  and Twombly .”  Id. (citing Twombly , 550 U.S. \nat 554).  \nFor purposes of a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, the court generally “accept[s] factual allegations \nin the complaint as true and construe[s] the pleadings in the light most favorable to the nonmoving \nparty.”   Manzarek v. St. Paul Fire & Marine Ins. Co. , 519 F.3d 1025, 1031 (9th Cir. \n2008).   However, the court need not “assume the truth of legal conclusions merely because they \nare cast in the form of factual allegations.”   Fayer v. Vaughn , 649 F.3d 1061, 1064 (9th Cir. 2011) \n(per curiam) (quoting W. Mining Council v.  Watt , 643 F.2d 618, 624 (9th Cir. 1981)).  Case 5:23-cv-03440-EKL     Document 216     Filed 09/11/25     Page 5 of 22 \n6 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  III. REQUEST FOR JUDICIAL NOTICE  \nIn ruling on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, courts generally do not consider material outside the \npleadings.  United States v. Corinthian Colls. , 655 F.3d 984, 998 (9th Cir. 2011).  However, courts \nmay consider “documents incorporated in the complaint by reference[.]”  Tellabs, Inc. v. Makor \nIssues & Rts., Ltd ., 551 U.S. 308, 322 (2007).  Incorporation by reference “treats certain \ndocuments as though they are part of the complaint itself.  The doctrine prevents plaintiffs from \nselecting only portions of documents that support their claims, while omitting portion s of those \nvery documents that weaken – or doom – their claims.”  Khoja v. Orexigen Therapeutics, Inc ., \n899 F.3d 988, 1002 (9th Cir. 2018).  “[A] defendant may seek to incorporate a document into the \ncomplaint ‘if the plaintiff refers extensively to the do cument or the document forms the basis of \nthe plaintiff’s claim.’”  Id. (quoting United States v. Ritchie , 342 F.3d 903, 907 (9th Cir. 2003)).   \nCourts may also consider facts that are “not subject to reasonable dispute” because they \n“can be accurately and readily determined from sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be \nquestioned.”   Fed. R. Evid. 201(b).   But even under those circumstances, courts may not take \njudicial notice of materials for the purpose of creating a defense against the well -pleaded \nallegations in the complaint.  Khoja v. Orexigen Therapeutics, Inc. , 899 F.3d 988, 1002 \n(9th Cir. 2018).   \nGoogle asks the Court to consider  seven exhibits  in connection with its motion to dismiss .  \nSee Req. for Judicial Notice, ECF No. 96.  Google’s request is GRANTED as to Ex hibits  1 \nthrough 3, GRANT ED in part as to Ex hibit 7, and DENIED  as to Exhibits 4  through 6 . \nPlaintiffs do not dispute that Exhibits 1  through 3 are incorporated by reference  in the \ncomplaint .  The se exhibits are  copyright registrations for the works asserted by Plaintiff Andersen.   \nBecause a valid copyright registration is required for Andersen’s copyright infringement claims, \nthe complaint necessarily relies on these registrations.  See infra  Section IV.A.1.  Additionally, \nPlaintiffs quote extensively from the registrations.  See Compl. Ex. A at 8-12.  Accordingly, the \nCourt will consider Exhibits 1 through 3.  \nExhibit 7 is an Alphabet 10 -K form filed  with the Securities and Exchange Commission .  \nThe Court may take judicial notice of this SEC filing because it is a  publicly available document Case 5:23-cv-03440-EKL     Document 216     Filed 09/11/25     Page 6 of 22 \n7 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned.   In re Bare Escentuals, Inc. Sec. Litig ., 745 \nF. Supp. 2d 1052, 1066 -67 (N.D. Cal. 2010) (“The court is . . . permitted to take judicial notice of \nthe content of relevant public disclosure documents required to be filed with the SEC.”).  \nHowever, the Court considers SEC filings “only for the purpose of determining what statements \nthe documents contain, not to prove the truth of the documents’ contents.”  Troy Grp., Inc. v. \nTilson , 364 F. Supp. 2d 1149, 1152 (C.D. Cal. 2005).  The Court will not consider Exhibit 7 for \nthe purpose of disputing Plaintiffs’  allegations regarding  Alphabet’s purported control of Google .   \nExhibits 4 through 6 purport to be posts by Plaintiff Andersen on the social media platform \nX (formerly Twitter) .  The Court may not take judicial notice of these posts because their accuracy \ncan “reasonably be questioned ,” Fed. R. Evid. 201(b), and Plaintiffs dispute their authenticity, \nOpp. at 10, ECF No. 103.  Additionally,  Google asks the Court to consider these posts  for an \nimproper purpose .  Specifically,  Google argues that  these exhibits show that Andersen published \nthree of her asserted works on X before she registered them , meaning that her copyright \nregistrations are invalid .  The Court may not consider these materials to create  a defense to the \nwell-pleaded allegations in the complaint.  Khoja , 899 F.3d at 1002.  \nIV. DISCUSSION  \nDefendants  move to dismiss Plaintiffs’ direct infringement claims on three grounds .  First, \nDefendants argue that Plaintiff Andersen fail s to plausibly allege that each of her asserted works is \ncovered by a valid copyright registration.  Second, Defendants  argue that Plaintiffs improperly \nassert infringement of other unspecified works.  Third, Defendants  argue that Plaintiffs fail to \nplausibly allege infringement as to certain generative AI models and products.  Defendants  also \nmove to dismiss Plaintiffs’ c laims for injunctive relief and Plaintiffs’ vicarious copyright \ninfringement claims against Alphabet.  The Court discusses these issues in turn.  \nA. Direct Copyright Infringement  \n1. Plaintiff Andersen’s Works  \nGoogle’s motion to dismiss challenges the direct infringement claims of just one named \nPlaintiff , Sarah Andersen.   Andersen asserts that six of her copyrighted works  were used to train \ncertain Google generative AI models.   Compl. ¶¶ 30 -34.  Google argues that Andersen fails to Case 5:23-cv-03440-EKL     Document 216     Filed 09/11/25     Page 7 of 22 \n8 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  plausibly allege that any of the asserted works is covered by a valid copyright registration.  \n“A threshold requirement of bringing a copyright suit is  . . . that a plaintiff has registered \nthe works at issue with the U.S. Copyright Office.”  Logan v. Meta Platforms, Inc ., 636 F. Supp. \n3d 1052,  1059 (N.D. Cal. 2022)  (citing  17 U.S.C. §  411(a) ).  A copyright registration “is prima \nfacie evidence of the validity of the copyright.”  Alaska Stock, LLC v. Houghton Mifflin Harcourt \nPubl’g Co ., 747 F.3d 673, 683 (9th Cir. 2014).  Once the fact of copyright registration is alleged, \ncourts typically do not resolve the scope of a copyright registration’s coverage at the pleading \nstage.  See, e.g. , AJ Mgmt. Consulting, LLC v. MBC FZ -LLC, No. 13 -cv-03213 -BLF, 2014 WL \n2878891, at *4 (N.D. Cal. June 24, 2014) (“[D]eciding the validity of Plaintiff’s copyright \nregistration would require the Court to make factual determinations . . . that are not appropriate on \na Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss.”).  \nHere, Andersen plausibly alleges that each of her asserted works is covered by a valid \nregistratio n, and she provides the copyright registration information for each asserted work.   \nCompl. Ex. A at 8 -12.  This is sufficient at the pleading stage.  See Alaska Stock , 747 F.3d at 684.  \nIn arguing that these allegations are insufficient, Google ask s the Court to make inferences against \nwell-pleaded allegations in the complaint  and premature factual determinations based on material \nthat is not subject to judicial notice.  \nHere,  all of Andersen’s  copyright  registrations are for compilations  – that is, collections of \npreexisting materials.  Mot. at 7.   A compilation registration covers  material contributed by the \nauthor that was not previously published.  Compendium of U.S.  Copyright Office Practices  \n§ 618.6  (3d ed. Jan. 28, 2021)  (“Compendium”) .  Google argues that three of the registrations \nexpressly state that the compilations  include previously published materials that are excluded from \ncoverage.  Mot. at 8.  But the regis trations do not s tate that the works asserted in this case  are \namong the previously published materials  excluded from the copyright registration .  The Court has \nno basis to infer that,  because some  materials in the compilation were previously published, the \nworks asserted here were previously published .  See Manzarek , 519 F.3d at 1031 (construing \nallegations in light most favorable to the plaintiff).  Case 5:23-cv-03440-EKL     Document 216     Filed 09/11/25     Page 8 of 22 \n9 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  Google  also claims that Andersen previously published some of the asserted works on the \nsocial media platform X, and therefore these works are not covered by the compilation \nregistrations  either .  Mot. at 9 -10.  This argument would require the Court to take judicial notice of \nposts on X  and X’s terms of use  to determine whether  Andersen  authorized  other X users to make \ncopies of her works .  See Compendium  § 1008.3(C)  (explaining that publication requires “ the \ncopyright owner [to] expressly or impliedly authorize users to make retainable copies ,” and \nobserving that “ it is not always factually clear whether the placement of works online is intended \nto be an authorized distributio n”).  This inquiry is too fact -bound at this stage.  As discussed \nabove, it is improper to take judicial notice of posts on X, especially for purposes of creating a \ndefense to the well -pleaded allegations of copyright registration in the complaint.   Googl e relies \non Brunson v. Cook , but that case observed in dicta – at the summary judgment  stage  – that the \nplaintiff’s work “was published when it was made available on YouTube, Instagram, and Twitter, \nwhere it could be viewed and shared by the public .”  No. 20 -cv-011056, 2023 WL 2668498, at *8, \n*13-14 (M.D.  Tenn. Mar. 28, 2023 ).  The details of Andersen’s posts, and whether the posts \nconstitute publication, may be revisited on a more complete record.  Accordingly, the Court \ndeclines to dismis s Plaintiff Andersen’s direct infringement  claims . \n2. Alleged Infringement of Unspecified Other Works  \nNext , Defendants  argue that Plaintiffs improperly assert infringement of “other works” not \nexpressly identified in the complaint.  Defendants acknowledge that e ach named Plaintiff \nidentifies  specific works and traces these works to training datasets that Google allegedly used to \ntrain specific generative AI models .  Mot. at 12; Compl. ¶¶  17-113.  However, Defendants  take \nissue with Plaintiff’s allegation s that Google infringed “at least” the se specified works , which \nimplies that Plaintiffs may assert other works too .  See, e.g., Compl. ¶ ¶ 18, 31, 49, 68, 76, 90, 99 .   \nAt the pleading stage, particularly when the scope of the alleged infringement is wide -\nranging and not precisely known, it is permissible to plead infringement of representative works.  \nBecton, Dickinson & Co. v. Cytek Bioscis. Inc ., No. 18 -cv-00933 -MMC, 2020 WL 1877707, at *6 \n(N.D. Cal. Apr. 15, 2020) ; see also Thunder Studios, Inc. v. Kazal , No. 17 -cv-00871 -AB (SSx), \n2018 WL 5099726, *3 (C.D. Cal. Mar. 22, 2018)  (holding that allegations gave “ fair notice of the Case 5:23-cv-03440-EKL     Document 216     Filed 09/11/25     Page 9 of 22 \n10 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  works at issue ” even though the list of works “ might not be exhaustive ”); Joint Stock Co. Channel \nOne Russ. Worldwide v. Infomir LLC , No. 16-cv-1318 (GBD) (BCM), 2017 WL 696126, at *14 \n(S.D.N.Y. Feb. 15, 2017)  (holding that representative works are sufficient where claims are “ based \non the alleged wholesale infringement of a large number of copyrighted works ”), R. & R. adopted , \n2017 WL 2988249 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 26, 2017) .  Here, Plaintiffs trace specific copyrighted works to \nspecific training datasets.2  These allegations put Google on notice of Plaintiffs’ claims.   \nAccordingly, the Court will not dismiss Plaintiffs’ claims as to other unspecified works.      \n3. Insufficient Allegations as to Certain Models  and Products  \nDefendants argue  that Plaintiffs fail to plausibly allege copyright infringement with respect \nto many of the generative AI models and Google products referenced in the complaint.   As to the \nscope of the models and products at issue, Plaintiffs allege the following:  \nThe Generative AI Models include all versions, iterations, and  relatives of Bard, \nGemini, Imagen, PaLM, GLaM, LaMDA, Codey, Chirp, Veo, MedLM, LearnLM,  \nSecLM, Gemma, CodeGemma, RecurrentGemma, PaliGemma.   The AI -Powered \nProducts include all  versions and iterations of Google Search, Google Cloud, Gmail, \nGoogle Docs, Google Ads, Google Slides, Chrome, YouTube, Google Photos, \nGoogle Sheets, Google Meet, Google Pixel, Google Maps, Google AI Studio, Google \nVids, Google Workspace, and Vertex AI.   \nCompl. ¶ 105.   In Google’s view, Plaintiffs’ allegations  “that a particular training dataset contains \nPlaintiffs’ works cannot open the door to discovery into any  and all of Google’s generative AI \nmodels or products, where Plaintiffs have failed to make any  allegations connecting those models \nor products to Plaintiffs’ works.”  Mot. at 23.  \n The Court concludes that Plaintiffs plausibly allege copyright infringement as to the \nfollowing models:  PaLM, GLaM, LaMDA, Bard, Gemini,  and Imagen .  Plaintiffs have identified \n \n2 Google relies on inapposite cases where the plaintiff  failed to allege  infringement of a single  \nspecific  work .  See Mot. at 11 -12.  Those cases are different because the plaintiffs did not provide \ndefendants any notice of the specific copyrights asserted.  DBW Partners, LLC v. Bloomberg, L.P.,  \nNo. 19 -311 (RBW), 2019  WL 5892489, at *3 (D.D.C. Nov. 12, 2019)  (rejecting conclusory \nallegation that defendant infringed plaintiff’s unspecified copyrighted work); Livingston v. \nMorgan , No. C -06-2389 -MMC, 2006 WL 8459602, at *3 (N.D. Cal. July 31, 2006)  (rejecting \nallegation that defendant infringed “at least one” of plaintiff’s copyrights, without specifying a \nparticular work).  Here, by contrast, every named Plaintiff meets the threshold requirement of \nplausibly alleging at least one instance of infringement as to specific copyrighted works.

However, the Court concludes that  Plaintiffs \nfail to plausibly allege copyright infringement as to the other  AI models referenced in the \ncomplaint:  Codey, Chirp, Veo, MedLM, LearnLM,  SecLM, Gemma, CodeGemma, \nRecurrentGemma, and PaliGemma .  Plaintiffs do not allege  any facts regarding these models at \nall.  These models  are referenced only one time in the complaint, in a long list of what appears to \nbe every generative AI model that Google has ever developed.  Because Plaintiffs do not allege \nthat any of their works were included in training datasets used to develop these models , Plaintiffs \ndo not plausibly allege copyright infringement.   See Iqbal , 556 U.S. at 678 -79.  Accordingly , the \nCourt dismisses Plaintiffs’ claims with respect to these models.3 \nB. Claim for Injunctive Relief  \nGoogle ar gues that Plaintiffs fail to plausibly allege  two requirements for injunctive relief:  \nirreparable harm and the inadequacy of legal remedies .  Mot. at 13 -15.  The Court disagrees.  \nHere, Plaintiffs allege that “Google’s mass appropriation of literary works has depressed \nthe overall market ” for fiction and nonfiction writers , illustrators, and cartoonists, thereby  \n“causing substantial harm to the commercial value of [Plaintiffs’] portfolio of works .”  Compl. \n¶¶ 29, 34, 47, 53, 66, 74, 80, 88, 97, 103 ; see also id . ¶ 157 (alleging that Google’s copying \n“diminished the value of [Plaintiff’s]  copyrights ”).  Plaintiffs claim that Google’s infringement \ncreates “distinct categories of harm that resist traditional monetary remediation” and “monetary \ndamages cannot prevent the threat of future infringement.”  Compl. ¶ 181.  Plaintiffs also allege \n \n3 By contrast, Plaintiffs’ allegations regarding Google products do not create the same problematic \nambiguity as to the scope of Plaintiffs’ claims.  Here, the copyright infringement allegedly occurs \nwhen  training the generative AI models.  Plaintiffs do not allege that Google’s products  infringe \ntheir copyrights – for example, by reproducing the works in response to user prompts.  Likewise, \nthe proposed class is defined in terms of the models at issue, not in terms of Google products.  See \nOpp. to Mot. to Strike Class Allegations at 3, ECF No. 105  (defining the proposed class in terms \nof persons “ who owned a United States copyright in any work used by Google to train Google’s \nGenerative AI Models ”).  The Court also declines to strike these allegations because they are not \nnecessarily impertinent.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(f).  Google’s alleged use of its generative AI \nmodels in certain products may be relevant to the commercial nature of Google’s use, which may \ninform the fair use analysis at a later stage of the case.  Case 5:23-cv-03440-EKL     Document 216     Filed 09/11/25     Page 11 of 22 \n12 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  that they “have no adequate remedy at law.”  Compl. ¶ 195.  These allegations are sufficient at this \nstage.  See Disney Enters., Inc. v. VidAngel, Inc. , 869 F.3d 848, 865 -66 (9th Cir. 2017) ( finding \nevidence of irreparable harm where infringement “undermine [d] the value” of copyrighted works).   \n“[T]he propriety of injunctive relief in cases arising under the Copyright Act must be evaluated on \na case -by-case basis [.]”  Perfect 10, Inc. v. Google, Inc. , 653 F.3d 976, 980 -81 (9th Cir. 2011).   \nBecause Plaintiff s plausibly allege the risk of future copyright infringement, and because the \nalleged market harms and diminution in value may be difficult to quantify, it  would be premature \nto preclude Plaintiffs from  seeking  injunctive relief.   \nGoogle relies on  inapposite cases to support early dismissal .  In Sonner v. Premier \nNutrition Corp. , the operative complaint did not allege that the plaintiff lacked an adequate legal \nremedy at all – and, “[m]ore importantly,” the plaintiff conceded that she sought “ the same sum in \nequitable restitution . . . as she requested in damages to compensate her for the same past harm. ”  \n971 F.3d 834, 844 (9th Cir. 2020).  Here, there is no indication that Plaintiffs’ requested injunctive \nrelief is identical to their damages claim.   Likewise, in Philips v. Ford Motor Co ., the Ninth \nCircuit held only that the plaintiffs  “were required to plead the inadequacy of their legal remedies \nto state a claim for injunctive relief. ”  726 F. App’x  608, 609 (9th Cir. 2018) ; see also Guthrie v. \nTransamerica Life Ins. Co. , 561 F. Supp. 3d 869, 875 (N.D. Cal. 2021)  (collecting cases) .  But that  \nis precisely what Plaintiffs have done here.   Because Plaintiffs plausibly allege potential \nentitlement to injunctive relief, the Court declines to dismiss on this basis.  \nC. Vicarious  Copyright  Infringement  \nPlaintiffs claim that Alphabet is vicariously liable for Google’s alleged direct copyright \ninfringement.  Generally, to state a claim for vicarious copyright infringement, “a plaintiff must \nallege that the defendant has (1) the right and ability to supervise the infringing conduct and (2) a \ndirect financial interest in the infringing activity.”  Perfect 10 v. Visa Int’l Serv. Ass’n , 494 F.3d \n788, 802 (9th Cir. 2007) (citing Ellison v. Robertson , 357 F.3d 1072, 1078 (9th Cir. 2004)).  The \nfirst element requi res that the defendant “ has both a legal right to stop or limit the directly \ninfringing conduct, as well as the practical ability to do so.”  Perfect 10, Inc. v. Amazon.com , Inc., \n508 F.3d 1146, 1173 (9th Cir. 2007).  Case 5:23-cv-03440-EKL     Document 216     Filed 09/11/25     Page 12 of 22 \n13 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  In this section , the Court initially holds  that Plaintiffs fail to plausibly allege  the first \nelement of vicarious liability – that Alphabet had the practical ability to limit Google’s direct \ninfring ement .  Next, the Court addresses Plaintiffs’ argument that Alphabet is vicariously liable \nbecause it had “control authority”  over the infringing conduct  as Google’s parent company.  See \nOpp. at 15 -17.  The Court concludes that vicarious copyright infringement claims are subject to \nthe bedrock principle of corpo rate law that a parent company is not liable for a subsidiary’s acts \nbased solely on the parent -subsidiary relationship.  Here,  Plaintiffs allege nothing more than a \ntypical parent -subsidiary relationship, thus Plaintiffs’ vicarious copyright infringement claim s fail \nfor this additional reason.  Because Plaintiffs’ failure to allege the first element is dispositive, the \nCourt does not reach the second element – Alphabet’s direct financial interest in infringement.  \n1. Legal Right and Practical Ability to Control Direct Infringement  \nThe standard for vicarious copyright infringement emerged from cases where the \ndefendant exerted control over the physical space where direct infringement occurred.  Fonovisa, \nInc. v. Cherry Auction, Inc. , 76 F.3d 259, 261 -62 (9th Cir. 1996).  For example, in Fonovisa , the \nplaintiff sued “the operators of a swap meet . . . where third -party vendors routinely [sold] \ncounterfeit recordings that infringe on the plaintiff’s copyrights.”  Id. at 260.  The Ninth Circuit \nheld that the swap meet operator could be h eld vicariously liable because it wielded sufficient \ncontrol over the direct infringers by renting out booth space and retain ing the right “to exclude any \nvendor for any reason, at any time.”  Id. at 261, 263.  Additionally, the operator patrolled the \npremises of the swap meet, and even shared information about the vendors with local law \nenforcement,  which conducted  a raid  and “seized more than 38,000 counterfeit recordings.”  Id. at \n261-62.  Thus, in Fonovisa , vicarious liability was established by the def endant’s control over the \nphysical space where the infringement occurred, and its practical ability to police that space.  Id.   \nIn more recent cases, the Ninth Circuit has applied th is standard – the right  to control the \nspace and the ability to police and stop conduct in that space – to operators of online platforms , \nservices , and websites .  These cases are conceptually similar to Fonovisa , but they raise d new \nquestions regarding a defendant’s legal right and practical ability to control direct infringement in  \ndigital environments .  The defendant’s vicarious liability often turn ed on the technological Case 5:23-cv-03440-EKL     Document 216     Filed 09/11/25     Page 13 of 22 \n14 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  feasibility of detecting and stopping direct infringement by third -party users of the operator’s \nplatform or servic e. \nFor example, in Napster , the plaintiff s sued the operator of a peer -to-peer file sharing \nservice for facilitating “the transmission of MP3 files between and among its users.”  A&M \nRecords, Inc. v. Napster, Inc ., 239 F.3d 1004, 1013 (9th Cir. 2001).  The Ninth Circuit held that \n“Napster had the right and ability to police its system and failed to exercise that right to prevent \nthe exchange of copyrighted material.”  Id. at 1023 -24.  Specifically, Napster had “both the ability \nto use its search function to identify infringing musical recordings an d the right to bar participation \nof users who engage in the transmission of infringing files.”  Id. at 1027.  However, the Ninth \nCircuit recognized that Napster’s practical ability to control direct infringement was limited by \n“the limits of [its] system.”  Id.  That is , Napster’s ability to search for infringing works was \nlimited by the fact that users named the MP3 files and Napster could not access the files to \ndetermine their true content.  Id. at 1012, 1027.   Accordingly, the Ninth Circuit instructed t he \ndistrict court to modify its preliminary injunction to account for Napster’s limited ability to detect \ninfringement.   Id. at 1027.  \nThe Ninth Circuit has applied similar reasoning in other digital copyright infringement  \ncases.  For example, in Perfect 10, Inc. v. Amazon.com , Inc., third -party websites published \nplaintiff’s copyrighted images, and Google indexed and stored those images in a database that \npowered its search engine.  508 F.3d at 1155 -57.  The Ninth Circuit held that Google did not have \na legal right “to  stop direct infringement by third -party websites,” and without image -recognition \ntechnology, Google also lacked “the prac tical ability to police the infringing activities.”  Id. at \n1173 -74.  Similarly, in VHT, Inc. v. Zillow Group, Inc. , the plaintiff asserted a vicarious \ninfringement claim against Zillow, an online real estate marketplace, based on “photos that users \nsaved or uploaded” to one of Zillow’s websites.  918 F.3d 723, 730 -31, 746 (9th Cir. 2019).  The \nvicarious infringement c laim failed because the plaintiff produced insufficient evidence that \n“Zillow had the technical ability to screen out or identify” plaintiff’ s infringed works.  Id. at 746.  \n“Once [plaintiff’s] photos were uploaded . . . ferreting out claimed infringement . . . was beyond \nhunting for a needle in a haystack.”  Id. Case 5:23-cv-03440-EKL     Document 216     Filed 09/11/25     Page 14 of 22 \n15 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  Applying these principles here, Plaintiffs do not plausibly allege that Alphabet had the \npractical ability to stop or limit Google’s alleged direct infringement.  Here, the direct \ninfringement is Google’s use of training datasets that allegedly included copyrighted  works.  But \nPlaintiffs do not allege any facts regarding Alphabet’s involvement in the training process.4  For \nexample, Plaintiffs do not allege that Alphabet instructed Google how to select a training dataset \nor which training datasets to use.  Plaintiffs also do not allege that Alphabet oversaw  any part of \nthe training process or required Google to obtain its approval  during the training process .   \nPlaintiffs offer the conclusory allegation that Alphabet had the “authority to implement \ncopyright compliance measures.”  Compl. ¶¶ 184, 188.  But , at most,  this allegation about \n“authority” speak s to Alphabet’s alleged  right to control Google  generally .5  Plaintiffs fail to \naddress the separate requirement that Alphabet ha d the practical ability  to stop or limit \ninfringement during the model training process.  See Amazon.com , 508 F.3d at 1173 -74.  Plaintiffs \ndo not allege any “copyright compliance measures” that Alphabet could have implemented , or \nhow they would function .  Luvdarts, LLC v. AT & T Mobility, LLC , 710 F.3d 1068, 1072 (9 th Cir. \n2013) (affirming dismissal where plaintiff “failed to allege facts that plausibly show that the \n[defendants] could implement an effective system” to police infringement).   Plaintiffs do not \nallege any facts regarding Alphabet ’s technological ability to search for or recognize Plaintiffs’ \nworks during Google’s  selection or use of these massive training datasets  that were  compiled by \nthird parties .6  See Amazon.com , 508 F.3d at 1173 -74 (defendant lacked image -recognition \ntechnology to identify infringing works); Zillow , 918 F.3d at 746 (defendant lacked “the technical \n \n4 The Court does not suggest that direct participation is required for vicarious  infringement .  \nRather , the lack of allegations regarding Alphabet’s involvement in the training process further \nundermines Plaintiffs’ assertion that Alphabet had the practical ability to control Google’s alleged \ninfringement.  \n5 Plaintiffs also conflate the control that any parent company may exercise over its subsidiary with \nthe right and practical ability to supervise infringing conduct.  None of the Ninth Circuit cases \ndiscussed above addressed or endorsed this expansive view of vicarious liability.  As discussed in \nthe next section, Plaintiffs’ theory ri sks creating unprecedented automatic vicarious liability \nwhenever a parent company fails to stop a subsidiary’s independent wrongful acts.  \n6 The C4 dataset (which is included in the Infiniset dataset) is a “filtered version of the Common \nCrawl dataset,” which is a “freely available collection of web crawl data” created by a third party.  \nCompl. ¶¶ 123 -124.  Likewise, the LAION datasets were cre ated by another third party, the Large -\nScale Artificial Intelligence Open Network.  Id. ¶¶ 138, 144.   Case 5:23-cv-03440-EKL     Document 216     Filed 09/11/25     Page 15 of 22 \n16 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  ability to screen out or identify” plaintiffs’ infringed works); cf. Napster , 239 F.3d at 1027 \n(defendant had “the ability to use its search function to identify infringing” materials).  Plaintiffs \ntherefore fail to plausibly allege that Alphabet had the practical ability to police Google’s alleged \ndirect infringement.  Accordingly, Plaintiffs’ claim s against Alphabet must be dismissed.  \n2.  Limitations on Parent -Subsidiary Liability  \nPlaintiffs also argue that Alphabet is vicariously liable by virtue of its “inaction despite \n[the] control authority” that it possesses as Google’s parent company.  Opp. at 17 .  In other words, \nPlaintiffs argue that Alphabet should be held liable not for its own misconduct, but for its mere \nfailure to stop its subsidiary’s misconduct.  This expansive view of copyright infringement \nliability is irreconcilable  with the bedrock  principle of corporate law “that a parent corporation \n(so-called because of control  through ownership of another corporation ’s stock) is not liable for \nthe acts of its subsidiaries.”  United States v. Bestfoods , 524 U.S. 51, 61 (1998) .  If adopted, \nPlaintiffs’ theory  risks creating automatic vicarious liability “solely because of the parent -\nsubsidiary relationship.”  Banff Ltd. v. Limited, Inc. , 869 F. Supp. 1103, 1107 (S.D.N.Y. 1994) ; \nsee also Dauman v. Hallmark Card, Inc. , No. 96 Civ. 3608  (JFK), 1998 WL 54633, *7 (S.D.N.Y. \nFeb. 9, 1998).    \nThe Court finds no basis in the Copyright Act or case law  to hold a parent company \nvicariously liable solely due to  the parent -subsidiary relationship .  Nothing in the Copyright Act \nsuggests that Congress sought to expand liability in copyright cases beyond the normal bounds of \ncorporate law.  Cf. Bestfoods , 524 U.S.  at 61 (holding that “congressional silence” against the \n“venerable common -law backdrop” of corporate liability counsels against an expansive \ninterpretation of statutory liability).   Indeed , the Copyright Act itself “ does not expressly impose \nliability on anyone other than direct infringers[.]”  Fonovisa , 76 F.3d  at 261; see also Sony Corp. \nv. Universal City Studios, Inc. , 464 U.S. 417, 435 (1984).  Rather , vicarious liability  for copyright \ninfringement  has developed in the case law  as an outgrowth of “the agency principles of \nrespondeat superior.”  Fonovisa , 76 F.3d  at 261 -62; see also Napster , 239 F.3d at 1022.  \nTherefore , the Court holds that liability for vicarious copyright infringement is subject to general \nlimitations on parent -subsidiary liability . Case 5:23-cv-03440-EKL     Document 216     Filed 09/11/25     Page 16 of 22 \n17 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  Relevant here , a parent company may not be held vicariously liable for direct infringement \nby its subsidiary solely by virtue of the ordinary control that any parent company may exercise \nover its subsidiary.   See Bestfoods , 524 U.S. at 61; see also Katzir’s Floor & Home Design, Inc. v. \nM-MLS.com , 394 F.3d 1143, 1149 (9th Cir. 2004)  (“The mere fact of sole ownership and control \ndoes not eviscerate the separate corporate identity that is the foundation of corporate law.”).7  The \nordinary control that a parent company may exercise over its subsidiary includes electing the \nsubsidiary’s directors, making its by -laws, and establishing the subsidiary’s general policies and \nprocedures.  Bestfoods , 524 U.S. at 61 -62, 72; Ranza , 793 F.3d at 1073 -74. \nHere, Plaintiffs’ allegations do not establish that Alphabet exercised greater control over \nGoogle than any parent company may exercise over its subsidiary.  Plaintiffs’ allegations fall into \ntwo categories:   (1) facts regarding the corporate relationship between Alphabet and Google, and \n(2) facts suggesting that Alphabet exercised “strategic oversight” regarding AI development \ngenerally.   These allegations do not plausibly allege that Alphabet is vicariously liable for \nGoogle’s alleged infringement by trai ning its AI models using datasets that contained Plaintiffs’ \nworks.  \nWith respect to the first category of allegations – Alphabet’s relationship to Google – \nPlaintiffs fail to allege any facts that support parent company liability.  Plaintiffs allege that \nAlphabet and Google have “intertwined executive leadership.”  Compl. ¶ 110.  Specifically, \n“Sundar Pichai serves as both CEO of Alphabet and CEO of Google LLC,” id. ¶ 107, and the two \ncompanies share “executive officers, including the Chief Financial Officer and Chief Investment \nOfficer,” id. ¶ 184.  But “it is entirely app ropriate for directors of a parent corporation to serve as \n \n7 Of course, a  parent company may be directly liable  under an “alter ego” theory when the \nsubsidiary is a mere instrumentality of the parent company, rather than a separate corporate \npersonality.  Ranza v. Nike , 793 F.3d 1059, 1073 -74 (9th Cir. 2015) .  Alter ego liability applies \nwhere the parent company exercises “pervasive control” and “dictates every facet of the \nsubsidiary’s business – from broad policy decisions to routine matters of day -to-day operation.”  \nId. (quotation omitted).  A parent company also may be directly liable  when “the alleged wrong \ncan seemingly be traced to the parent through the conduit of its own personnel and management’ \nand ‘the parent is directly a participant in the wrong complained of.’”  Bestfoods , 524 U.S. at 64 \n(quotation omitted).  Plaintiffs do not expressly invoke or plausibly allege facts to support either \ntheory.  Instead , Plaintiffs allege an ordinary parent -subsidiary relationship, and they fail to allege \nthat Alphabet had any direct or indirect involvement in Google’s training of generative AI models.  Case 5:23-cv-03440-EKL     Document 216     Filed 09/11/25     Page 17 of 22 \n18 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  directors of its subsidiary, and that fact alone may not serve to expose the parent corporation to \nliability for its subsidiary ’s acts.”   Bestfoods , 524 U.S. at 69 (quoting Am. Protein Corp. v. AB \nVolvo , 844 F.2d 56, 57 (2d Cir. 1988)).  Plaintiffs also allege that Alphabet and Google “share[] \nfinancial incentives,” id. ¶ 110, but that, too, is true of any parent company and its wholly  owned \nsubsidiary, see Copperweld  Corp. v. Indep. Tube Corp. , 467 U.S. 752, 777 (1984) (“A parent and \nits wholly owned subsi diary have a complete unity of interest.”).  These allegations are insufficient \nas a matter of law to establish vicarious liability as to Alphabet.  \nWith respect to the second category of allegations, Plaintiffs allege that Alphabet \n“exercises direct oversight and control over Google’s AI business and development activities.”  \nCompl. ¶  104.  But, to be clear, Plaintiffs do not allege that Alphabet had any direct or indirect \nrole in Google’s training of the generative AI models at issue in this case.  Cf. id. ¶¶ 17 -103, 113 -\n162 (alleging that Google selected the relevant datasets and trained the generative AI models).  \nInstead, Plaintiffs allege that Alp habet was responsible for “strategic” direction and oversight on \nAI issues  generally .  Id. ¶¶ 106, 108 , 184, 188 -189, 191.  Plaintiffs allege that Alphabet \n“orchestrat[ed] the merger” of Google Brain with DeepMind.  Id. ¶¶ 107 -108, 184.  Plaintiffs also \nallege that Alphabet has shaped “its subsidiaries’ operations to accelerate AI research and \ndevelopment” and to integrate AI into core Google products.  Compl. ¶¶ 106 -108, 184.  These \nallegations describe the type of high -level control that a parent company commonly exerts over a \nsubsidiary’s corporate structure and general policies.8  See Bestfoods , 524 U.S. at 72.   \nAccordingly, these allegations are also insufficient for vicarious copyright infringement.  \nBecause Plaintiffs  allege nothing more than a typical parent -subsidiary relationship, the \nCourt does not take up  Defendants ’ request to apply  the standard set forth in Frank Music Corp. v. \n \n8 Plaintiffs also improperly attribute control over Google’s “strategic operations” to Alphabet \nbased on actions by Mr. Pichai, who leads both companies.  See, e.g. , Compl. ¶¶ 106 -108, 110, \n184.  Generally, when a corporate officer holds positions at both a parent  company  and a \nsubsidiary, courts presume that the officer acts on behalf of the subsidiary when acting for the \nsubsidiary.  Bestfoods , 524 U.S. at 69 -70.  In light of this presumption, Plaintiffs needed to allege \n“facts tending to exclude the possibility” that Pichai and other joint officers were acting on \nGoogle’s  behalf.  In re Century Aluminum , 729 F.3d at 1108.   Absent these allegations, the Court \ncannot infer that Alphabet is liable merely because Pichai and other dual officers  allegedly  made  \npolicy decision s for Google .  See Bestfoods , 524 U.S. at 69 -70.   Case 5:23-cv-03440-EKL     Document 216     Filed 09/11/25     Page 18 of 22 \n19 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  Metro -Goldwyn -Mayer, Inc ., 772 F.2d 505 (9th Cir. 1985) (“ Frank I ”).  In that case, the MGM \nGrand Hotel was found liable for direct copyright infringement of five songs that it used in a \nmusical revue.  Id. at 509.  In a section of the opinion titled “Liability for Joint Infringers,” the \nNinth Circuit held that the parent company, MGM Inc., may also be held liable if there was a \n“substantial and continuing connection” between the two companies “with respect  to the \ninfringing acts.”  Id. at 519 -20; Frank Mus ic Corp. v. Metro -Goldwyn -Mayer, Inc. , 886 F.2d 1545, \n1553 -55 (9th Cir. 1989) (“ Frank II ”) (noting that M GM Inc.  knew whether the works could be \nused, provided clearance to use the infringing works, and “actively consulted with” and “assiste d” \nthe subsidiary ).  However, Frank did not expressly involve a claim of vicarious infringement, but \nrather  an unspecified theory of  liability for “joint infringers. ”  Frank I , 772 F.2d  at 519 -20.  \nBecause MGM Inc.  was actively involved in the infringing conduct  itself , Frank  is closer to a \ncontributory infringement case.  See Frank I I, 886 F.2d  at 1553 -55; see also Visa , 494 F.3d at 795 \n(discussing requirements for contributory infringement liability) .  The Nimmer treatise – relied \nupon by  the Ninth Circuit in articulating the standard  in Frank  I – cautions courts not to blur the se \ndistinct  theories of indirect liability.   3 Melville B. Nimmer & David Nimmer, Nimmer on \nCopyright  § 12.04 [A] (2025) .  Heeding that guidance , the Court does not resolve whether the \nFrank standard applies here.9   \n*** \nIn sum, the Court holds that Plaintiffs fail to plausibly allege that Alphabet had the \npractical ability to stop or limit  Google’s alleged direct infringement.  Therefore, Plaintiffs fail to \nstate a claim against Alphabet for vicarious liability.  The Court also holds that a parent company \ncannot be held vicariously liable merely based on the ordinary control that a parent company  \nexercises over its subsidiary .  Here,  Plaintiffs fail to allege more than a typical parent -subsidiary  \nrelationship .  Accordingly , Plaintiffs’ claim s for vicarious infringement are dismissed.  \n \n9 To the extent that the Frank standard applies, Plaintiffs have not met it .  Plaintiffs  fail to allege \nany involvement by Alphabet in Google’s training of the generative AI models at issue , let alone a \nsubstantial and continuing connection between Alphabet and Google with respect to the alleged \ninfringement . Case 5:23-cv-03440-EKL     Document 216     Filed 09/11/25     Page 19 of 22 \n20 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  D. Dismissal is Without Leave to Amend  \nThe Court finds that Plaintiffs’ direct infringement claims as to certain models , and \nPlaintiffs’ vicarious infringement claims , should be dismissed with prejudice and without leave to \namend.   In making this determination, the Court considers factors such as “ undue delay, bad faith \nor dilatory motive on the part of the [Plaintiffs] , repeated failure to cure deficiencies by \namendments previously allowed, undue prejudice to the opposing party by virtue of allowance of \nthe amendment, and futility of amendment .”  Foman v. Davis , 371 U.S. 178, 182 (1962).   The \nCourt also considers “the number of times the plaintiff has already been allowed to amend.”  \nSchwartz v. Miller , --- F.4th ---, No. 23 -1343, 2025 WL 2473008, at *9 (9th Cir. Aug. 28, 2025).  \nAlthough  the Court does not find bad faith or dilatory motive, all other factors weigh in favor of \ndenying leave to amend.  \nFirst, Plaintiffs have failed to cure pleading deficiencies despite several previous \nopportunities to amend.  Before the cases were reassigned to this Court, Judge Mart ínez-Olgu ín \ndismissed the Leovy complaint and granted leave to amend to cure pleading deficiencies.  ECF \nNo. 46.  After the cases were consolidated, th is Court granted leave to amend once again – over \nDefendants’ objections.  ECF No. 77.  In doing so, the Court required the parties to engage in a \nsubstantial , multi -stage  meet and confer process so that Plaintiffs could address Defendants’ prior \nmotion -to-dismiss arguments in crafting their consolidated amended complaint.  Despite these \nopportunities to amend, Plaintiffs failed to cure pleading deficiencies  for the reasons discussed \nabove .   \nSecond, the Court finds that further leave to amend would be futile in light of the p revious \nopportunities to amend and Plaintiffs’ failure to cure pleading deficiencies.  Zucco Partners, LLC \nv. Digimarc Corp. , 552 F.3d 981, 1007 (9th Cir. 2009), as amended  (Feb. 10, 2009)  (holding that \nfailure to correct pleading deficiencies after dismissal is a “strong indication” that further \namendment would be futile); see also Salameh v. Tarsadia Hotel , 726 F.3d 1124, 1133 (9th Cir. \n2013) (“A district court’s discretion to deny leave to amend is ‘particularly broad’ where the \nplaintiff has previously amended.”  (quoting Sisseton -Wahpeton Sioux Tribe v. United States , \n90 F.3d 351, 355 (9th Cir. 1996))).  Case 5:23-cv-03440-EKL     Document 216     Filed 09/11/25     Page 20 of 22 \n21 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  Moreover, Plaintiffs failed to identify any facts that could save the dismissed claims, which \nfurther demonstrates  that amendment would be futile.  See Opp. at 24 (requesting leave to amend \nwithout identifying any potential  amendments).  In advance of the motion hearing, the Court sent a \ntentative ruling to the parties, indicating that it was inclined to deny  leave to amend .  The Court \ninvited Plaintiffs to explain why leave to amend should be granted.   At the hearing, Plaintiffs first \nargued that paragraphs 115 to 119 of the complaint allege that Google “employs consistent \ntraining methodologies across its models.”  4/23/25 Hr’g Tr. 21:11 -13, ECF No. 132.  But these \nallegations only refer to Gemini and Bard  – they do not state that any other model was trained on \nthe same or similar datasets that include copyrighted works.  Plaintiffs also cited  paragraph 128, \nbut that allegation states only that “Google’s Infiniset (which encompassed C4) was a foundational \ndataset used to train Bard, Gemini’s predecessor.”  Compl. ¶  128.  Again, th is allegation do es not \npermit any inference that other generative AI models were trained on copyrighted works .  \nFinally, as a last resort, Plaintiffs cited their conclusory allegations that Defendants \n“engaged in a knowing and active fraudulent concealment ” that prevented Plaintiffs from knowing \nwhich models were trained on which datasets.  Id. ¶¶ 158 -162.  However, Plaintiffs do not allege \nany acts of fraudulent concealment, and the complaint is replete with citations to academic \narticles, white papers, and other public sources in which Google explains in detail how it trained \nvarious generati ve AI models.  Plaintiffs’ conclusory allegations are insufficient to permit wide -\nranging claims of copyright infringement.10  It bears repeating that Plaintiffs’ infringement claims \nas to many of the models are not supported by a single  factual allegation.  Accordingly, given the \ncomplete lack of supporting factual allegations, Plaintiffs’ direct copyright infringement claims are \ndismissed with prejudice as to the following models:  Codey, Chirp, Veo, MedLM, LearnLM,  \nSecLM, Gemma, CodeGemma, RecurrentGemma, PaliGemma .   \n \n10 Plaintiffs cite Soo Park v. Thompson  for the proposition that a complaint is entitled to leniency \n“where the facts are peculiarly within the possession and control of the defendant.”  851 F.3d 910, \n928 (9th Cir. 2017).  But Soo Park held that, in such circumstances, a plaintiff may plead facts on \n“information and belief .”  Id.  It did not hold that a claim may be sustained absent any supporting \nfactual allegations.   Here, Plaintiffs do not allege infringement as to Codey, Chirp, or any of the \nother extraneous  models based on information and belief.  Cf. Compl. ¶¶ 128-131 (alleging, based \non “information and belief,” that Google trained Gemini using copyrighted works) .  Accordingly, \nthe Court cannot infer that any factual basis exists for these claims.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 11(b)(3).    Case 5:23-cv-03440-EKL     Document 216     Filed 09/11/25     Page 21 of 22 \n22 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  Finally, the Court finds that granting further leave to amend would unduly prejudice \nDefendants .  This case has been pending for more than two years.  The parties have engaged in  \nextensive motion practice  at the pleading stage  – including three motions to dismiss in the Leovy \naction, one motion to dismiss in the Zhang action, and the present motion to dismiss .  Substantial \njudicial and party resources have been spent on discovery.  See Order Amending Case Schedule, \nECF No. 197.  The pleadings must be settled now to focus the parties’ efforts in this massive and \ncomplex case .  Permitting Plaintiffs to amend once more would be unduly burdensome on \nDefendants and would further delay resolution of this important matter.  \nV. CONCLUSION  \nFor the foregoing reasons, Plaintiffs’ direct infringement claims relating to the following \ngenerative AI models are DISMISSED with prejudice :  Codey, Chirp, Veo, MedLM, LearnLM, \nSecLM, Gemma, CodeGemma, RecurrentGemma, and PaliGemmia.   Compl. ¶ 105.   Plaintiffs’ \nclaims for vicarious copyright infringement against Alphabet are also DISMISSED with prejudice . \nWithin 14 days of this Order, Plaintiffs shall file a  second  amended consolidated complaint \nto amend the class definition, and to make any necessary and related conforming edits, consistent \nwith the Court’s Order on Google’s motion to strike class allegations.  See ECF No. 128.   \nPlaintiffs may not add any new claims, parties, or other allegations in the amended complaint.   \nPlaintiffs shall also file a redline comparing the new complaint to the previously -filed one.  \nWithin 21 days after Plaintiffs file the second amended consolidated complaint , Google \nshall file its answer . \nIT IS SO ORDERED.  \nDated:  September 11, 2025  \n \n  \nEumi K.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: The court denied the defendants' motion to dismiss the plaintiff's amended complaint, which involves accusations of copyright infringement and unfair competition related to the plaintiff’s software named Lottery Tracking System (LTS). The plaintiff alleges the defendants illegally copied its software to create a competing product, violating copyright and other legal doctrines. This case does not involve AI, machine learning, or automated systems specifically in the facts or claims.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the defendants' actions in allegedly copying the plaintiff’s proprietary and copyrighted software and using similar branding constitutes copyright infringement, unfair competition, and other state law violations.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court denied the defendants' motion to dismiss and allowed the case to proceed. The court found that the plaintiff has sufficiently alleged facts to support claims of copyright infringement, unfair competition under the Lanham Act, and violations of several state laws.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine you made a special computer program that helps store owners keep track of lottery tickets. You even made sure to tell everyone, \"You can't copy or change my program!\" One day, you find out someone else has made almost the exact same program and is telling people it's theirs. You go to the judge and say, \"That's not fair—they copied me!\" The judge checks if your complaint makes sense and decides, \"Yes, let's look into this more,\" instead of just dismissing what you said right away.",

BHALODWALA, REALTIME \nNETWORKING, INC., and JOHN DOES \n1-5, )\n) \n) \n )\n  Defendants. )\n )\n \nORDER \n The Defendants have moved to dismiss the Plaintiff’s amended complaint (Doc. \n6), or alternatively, have moved for a more definite statement.  (Doc. 4).  For the \nreasons stated below, the motion is DENIED .   \nI. BACKGROUND1 \nPlaintiff Mohammad Abbasi created a “lottery ticket tracking tool,” software called \nthe Lottery Tracking System (“LTS”), for use in convenience stores, gas stations, and \nother locations where tickets are sold.  (Doc. 6, ¶ 10).  The Plaintiff owns the LTS and registered the software with the U.S. Copyright Office on August 10, 2010.  (Doc. 6, ¶¶ 11-12).  He has been marketing the softwar e since February 2010 and licenses it to \n“numerous customers owning stores selling lo ttery tickets.”  (Doc. 6, ¶ 13).  These \ncustomers “must agree to the terms of the End-User Licensing Agreement (the ‘EULA’)” \n                                                   \n1 The facts are taken from the allegations in the amended complaint (Doc. 6) and accepted as true for \npurposes of the motion.   Case 5:15-cv-00115-MTT   Document 12   Filed 12/03/15   Page 1 of 15- 2 - \n before they are allowed to install the software.  (Doc. 6, ¶ 16).  The EULA informs the \ncustomer the software is copyrighted and “contains an agreement that the customer will not ‘reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble the software product.’”  (Doc. 6, ¶ 17).   \nIn December 2012, the Plaintiff licensed the LTS software to “Sunny \nMilledgeville,” the owner of a Stop N Save convenience store at 844 Montgomery St. in Milledgeville.  (Doc. 6, ¶ 18).  Sunny received 138 minutes of phone service between December 5, 2012 and January 5, 2013 to explain the LTS software and system.  (Doc. 6, ¶ 19).  On December 21, 2012, the Plaintiff was notified of an improper login attempt into the Google email account he used for the LTS from an IP address in Milledgeville.  (Doc. 6, ¶ 20).  The Plaintiff then learned that Defendant RealTime had begun selling an application, “substantively identical” to the LTS, which also tracked lottery ticket sales.  (Doc. 6, ¶ 21).  Defendant “RealTime’s web page show[s] images that have been copied directly from Plaintiff’s copyrighted software.”  (Doc. 6, ¶ 21).  Defendant Bhalodwala owns Defendant RealTime, and the contact information on RealTime’s website is the address of the Stop N Save store in Milledgeville and Sunny Milledgeville’s email address and phone number.  (Doc. 6, ¶¶ 22-23).  This is also the phone number through which the Plaintiff provided telephone service for his software.  (Doc. 6, ¶ 23).  In other words, Sunny Milledgeville is Defendant Bhalodwala or an agent acting on his behalf.  (Doc. 6, ¶ 24).   \nThe Defendants call their “substantively identical” software application the \n“Lottery Tracking App” or “Lottery Tracking System” in their written materials and in communications with potential customers, who are also potential customers of the Plaintiff’s software.  (Doc. 6, ¶ 27).  The Plaintiff alleges he “has received calls from his Case 5:15-cv-00115-MTT   Document 12   Filed 12/03/15   Page 2 of 15- 3 - \n customers who have been approached by Defendants and to whom Defendants have \nheld their product out as the [LTS].”  (Doc. 6, ¶ 28).    Given the Defendants’ alleged conduct, the Plaintiff has asserted a copyright infringement claim, an unfair competition claim pursuant to the Lanham Act, and various state law claims, including violations of the Georgia Fair Business Practices Act, fraud, tortious interference with business relations, unjust enrichment, breach of contract, and litigation expenses.\n2   \nII. DISCUSSION \nA. Motion to Dismiss Standard  \nThe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure require a pleading to contain a “short and \nplain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2).  To avoid dismissal pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter to “‘state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.’”  Ashcroft v. Iqbal , 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) (quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly , 550 \nU.S. 544, 570 (2007)).  “At the motion to dismiss stage, all well-pleaded facts are accepted as true, and the reasonable inferenc es therefrom are construed in the light \nmost favorable to the plaintiff.”  Garfield v. NDC Health Corp. , 466 F.3d 1255, 1261 \n(11th Cir. 2006) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  However, “where the well-pleaded facts do not permit the court to infer more than the mere possibility of misconduct, the complaint has alleged—but it has not ‘show[n]’—‘that the pleader is entitled to relief.’”  Iqbal , 556 U.S. at 679 (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2)).  “[C]onclusory \n                                                   \n2 The Plaintiffs have also alleged a violation of the Uniform Deceptive Trade Practices Act, O.C.G.A. \n§ 10-1-370 et seq . in Count IV.  (Doc. 6, ¶¶ 54-59).  The Defendants have only mentioned this claim in \nthe introduction to their motion to dismiss and have not provided supporting facts or law in the motion \nexplaining why this claim should be dismissed.  (Doc. 4 at 2).  Such a bald assertion does not suffice for a motion to dismiss.  Accordingly, this claim may proceed. Case 5:15-cv-00115-MTT   Document 12   Filed 12/03/15   Page 3 of 15- 4 - \n allegations, unwarranted deductions of facts or legal conclusions masquerading as facts \nwill not prevent dismissal.”  Oxford Asset Mgmt., Ltd. v. Jaharis , 297 F.3d 1182, 1188 \n(11th Cir. 2002).  The complaint must “give the defendant fair notice of what the ... claim is and the grounds upon which it rests.”  Twombly , 550 U.S. at 555 (internal quotation \nmarks and citation omitted).  Where there are dispositive issues of law, a court may dismiss a claim regardless of the alleged facts.  Marshall Cty. Bd. of Educ. v. Marshall \nCty. Gas Dist., 992 F.2d 1171, 1174 (11th Cir. 1993). \nB. Analysis \nThe Defendants first argue the complaint should be dismissed as a “shotgun” \npleading because (1) it includes an “Allegations Common to all Claims for Relief” section instead of identifying which facts are applicable to which claims, (2) each count incorporates allegations, and (3) the counts do not establish which counts apply to Defendant Bhalodwala and which apply to Defendant Realtime Networking, LLC.  (Doc. 4 at 5-6).  The Eleventh Circuit has described a shotgun pleading as one where “it is virtually impossible to know which allegations of fact are intended to support which claim(s) for relief.”  Anderson v. Dist. Bd. of Trs. of Cent. Fla. Cmty. Coll. , 77 F.3d 364, \n366 (11th Cir. 1996).  As discussed more fully below, all of the Plaintiff's counts are based on a common factual scenario, and each Defendant is purportedly liable under each count.  Therefore, it is possible to determine which allegations of fact are intended to support which claims for relief, and dismissal on this ground is not warranted. \n1. Copyright Infringement  \nTo establish direct copyright infringement, a plaintiff must prove two elements: \n“(1) ownership of a valid copyright, and (2) co pying of constituent elements of the work Case 5:15-cv-00115-MTT   Document 12   Filed 12/03/15   Page 4 of 15- 5 - \n that are original.”3  Feist Publ'ns, Inc. v. Rural Tel. Serv. Co. , 499 U.S. 340, 361 (1991).  \nTo satisfy the second element, “a plaintiff must establish, as a factual matter, that the alleged infringer actually copied  plaintiff's copyrighted material.”  Latimer v. Roaring \nToyz, Inc. , 601 F.3d 1224, 1233 (11th Cir. 2010) (emphasis added); see also Bateman \nv. Mnemonics, Inc. , 79 F.3d 1532, 1541 (11th Cir. 1996) (“To prove actionable copying, \nthe plaintiff must first establish, as a factual matter, that the alleged infringer actually used the copyrighted material to create his own work.” (internal citation omitted)).  A plaintiff may prove copying by direct evidence, which is rare, or indirect evidence.  Baby \nBuddies, Inc. v. Toys R Us, Inc. , 611 F.3d 1308, 1315 (11th Cir.2010).  If the plaintiff \nmust rely on indirect evidence and cannot show the defendant had access to the copyrighted work, then the plaintiff must show the defendant's work is “strikingly similar” \nto the copyrighted work.  Id. (citing Corwin v. Walt Disney Co. , 475 F.3d 1239, 1253 \n(11th Cir. 2007)).  However, if the defendant did have access to the work, then the \nplaintiff need only show the protected expression in the original work is “substantially similar” to the second.  Id. (citing Leigh v. Warner Bros., Inc. , 212 F.3d 1210, 1214 (11th \nCir. 2000)).  “To determine whether an allegedly infringing work is substantially similar to a copyrighted work, we ask whether ‘an average lay observer would recognize the alleged copy as having been appropriate d from the copyrighted work.’”  Id. (quoting \nOravec v. Sunny Isles Luxury Ventures, L.C. , 527 F.3d 1218, 1224 (11th Cir. 2008)).  \n“Importantly, … copyright infringement only occurs when the defendant copies protected  \nelements of a copyrighted work, those portions satisfying the constitutional requirement of originality.”  Indyne, Inc. v. Abacus Tech. Corp. , 876 F. Supp. 2d. 1278, 1284 (M.D. \n                                                   \n3 The Defendants do not contend the Plaintiff has failed to sufficiently allege ownership of a valid \ncopyright.   Case 5:15-cv-00115-MTT   Document 12   Filed 12/03/15   Page 5 of 15- 6 - \n Fla. 2012) (emphasis added) (citing MiTek Holdings, Inc. v. Arce Eng’g Co. , 89 F.3d \n1548, 1554 (11th Cir. 1996)).   \nThe Defendants contend the Plaintiff’s copyright infringement claim should be \ndismissed because the Plaintiff failed to sufficiently allege facts to demonstrate “access” or “substantial similarity” to satisfy the second element of a copyright infringement claim.  (Doc. 4 at 7).  The Court disagrees.  First,  the allegations, taken as true, demonstrate \nthat the Plaintiff granted the Defendants access by providing the actual software, the copyrighted material at issue, directly to them.  (Doc. 6, ¶¶ 19, 22-24).  Second, because the Plaintiff has sufficiently alleged access, he need only also sufficiently allege that the Defendants’ software is “substantially similar” rather than “strikingly similar” to his copyrighted software, which he does.  Cf. Baby Buddies, Inc. , 611 F.3d at \n1315 (noting that the analysis turned on substantial similarity when the defendant had access to the copyrighted work).  Considering together the allegations that the Defendants received access to the copyrighted software, sold an application that performs “substantively identical” functions to the Plaintiff’s copyrighted software, and \nused images from the Plaintiff’s software in their own program, the Court concludes that the Plaintiff has also sufficiently alleged “substantial similarity.”  Cf. Original Appalachian \nArtworks, Inc. v. Toy Loft, Inc. , 684 F.2d 821, 829 (11th Cir. 1982) (“[P]roof of access \nand substantial similarity raises … a presumption of copying….”); compare Dixon v. \nSony Corp. of Am. , 2012 WL 1886550, at *3 (S.D. Fla.) (dismissing copyright \ninfringement claim for lack of substantial similarity where the complaint did not “allege specifically what aspects of Defendant’s work encompasses Plaintiff’s particular Case 5:15-cv-00115-MTT   Document 12   Filed 12/03/15   Page 6 of 15- 7 - \n expression”).  Therefore, the Plaintiff sufficiently pleaded the second element of a \ncopyright infringement claim.4   \n2. Unfair Competition  \nThe Plaintiff asserts a claim for unfair competition pursuant to section 43 of the \nLanham Act, as codified in 15 U.S.C. § 1125(a).  The Defendants contend the Plaintiff has failed to state a claim because he fails to refer to a specific subsection of § 1125(a).\n5  (Doc. 4 at 10).  There are two types of claims under § 1125(a):  likelihood of \nconfusion and false advertising.  Here, the Plaintiff is alleging a likelihood of confusion claim under 15 U.S.C. § 1125(a)(1)(A).  (Docs. 5 at 9; 6, ¶ 42-44).  The Plaintiff’s unfair competition claim is clearly that customers will be confused about the source of the program they are purchasing.  ( Id.).   \n“In order to state a claim for … unfair competition under the Lanham Act, [the \nPlaintiff] must demonstrate that (1) [he] has a valid, protectable mark, and (2) Defendants' use of the mark is ‘likely to caus e confusion, or to cause mistake, or to \ndeceive.’”  TracFone Wireless, Inc. v. Zip Wireless Prods., Inc. , 716 F. Supp. 2d 1275, \n1283 (N.D. Ga. 2010) (quoting 15 U.S.C. §§ 1114(1)). \nTo satisfy the first element of § 43(a)—proof of a valid trademark—a \nplaintiff need not have a registered mark. We have recognized that “the use of another's unregistered, i.e., common law, trademark can constitute \na violation of § 43(a) where the alleged unregistered trademarks used by \n                                                   \n4 The Defendants also argue that the Plaintiff has not sufficiently alleged that “Lottery Artificial \nIntelligence” is strikingly similar to the LTS.  (Doc. 4 at 8).  In fact, the Plaintiff does not mention striking similarity in his amended complaint at all (although it seems he could have), no doubt because he has alleged that the Defendants had access to the software, and therefore, he only needs to allege \nsubstantial similarity.  See Baby Buddies, Inc. , 611 F.3d at 1315.  Thus, it is not necessary to address the \nDefendants’ argument that the Plaintiff has failed to sufficiently allege a striking similarity between the two \nprograms. \n \n5 The Defendants also moved to dismiss because the Plaintiff did not plead the LTS is a “Famous Mark” \nunder § 1125(c).  (Doc. 4 at 12).  However, the Plaintiff did not intend to assert a claim under § 1125(c), and he does not assert this claim in the amended complaint.  (Doc. 5 at 9).     Case 5:15-cv-00115-MTT   Document 12   Filed 12/03/15   Page 7 of 15- 8 - \n the plaintiff are so associated with [his] goods that the use of the same or \nsimilar marks by another company constitutes a false representation that [their] goods came from the same source.”    \nTana v. Dantanna's , 611 F.3d 767, 773 (11th Cir. 2010) (quoting Conagra, Inc. v. \nSingleton , 743 F.2d 1508, 1512-13 (11th Cir. 1984)).   \nHowever, the mark must be sufficiently distinctive to receive protection under the \nLanham Act.  Id.  To be sufficiently distinctive, a mark must be “capable of \ndistinguishing the owner’s goods from those of others.”  Id.  There are four categories of \ndistinctiveness in the Eleventh Circuit: \n(1) generic—marks that suggest the basic nature of the product or service; \n(2) descriptive—marks that identify the characteristic or quality of a \nproduct or service; (3) suggestive—mar ks that suggest characteristics of \nthe product or service and require an effort of the imagination by the consumer in order to be understood as  descriptive; and (4) arbitrary or \nfanciful—marks that bear no relationship to the product or service, and the strongest category of trademarks.  \nTana , 611 F.3d at 774 (quoting Gift of Learning Found., Inc. v. TGC, Inc. , 329 F.3d 792, \n797-98 (11th Cir. 2003)).  “These categories create a distinctiveness spectrum.”  T-12 \nEntm’t, LLC v. Young Kings Enters. , 36 F. Supp. 3d 1380, 1389 (N.D. Ga. 2014).  Marks \nin the first category generally do not receive trademark protection, while marks in the third and fourth categories generally do.  Id.  Marks in the second category will receive \nprotection when they acqu ire “secondary meaning.”  Tana , 611 F.3d at 774.  “A name \nhas acquired secondary meaning when the primary significance of the term in the minds of the consuming public is not the product but the producer.”  Id. (quoting Welding \nServs., Inc. v. Forman , 509 F.3d 1351, 1358 (11th Cir. 2007)).     \nTo evaluate the second element, whether there is a likelihood of confusion, \ncourts consider the following seven factors:  Case 5:15-cv-00115-MTT   Document 12   Filed 12/03/15   Page 8 of 15- 9 - \n (1) the strength of the plaintiff's mark; (2) the similarity between the \nplaintiff's mark and the allegedly infringing mark; (3) the similarity between \nthe products and services offered by the plaintiff and defendant; (4) the \nsimilarity of the sales methods; (5) the similarity of advertising methods; \n(6) the defendant's intent, e.g., does the defendant hope to gain \ncompetitive advantage by associating his product with the plaintiff's \nestablished mark; and (7) actual confusion. \n \nAll. Metals, Inc., of Atlanta v. Hinely Indus., Inc. , 222 F.3d 895, 907 (11th Cir. 2000).  \n“[T]he geographic proximity of the use of the parties’ marks … may be relevant to the likelihood-of-confusion analysis,” as well.  Tana , 611 F.3d at 780.  “To adequately plead \nthis element of a prima facie case[, the Plaintiff] need only offer enough facts to make a likelihood of confusion possible.”  T-12 Entm’t , 36 F. Supp. 3d at 1391 . \n Here, the Defendants argue the Plaintiff’s mark is weak because it is “descriptive \nat best,” simply describing what the software does.  (Doc. 7 at 6).  They further contend \nthat there is no similarity between the two marks and that there are insufficient allegations of actual confusion.  ( Id. at 5).     \nThe Court disagrees.  The Plaintiff has alleged sufficient facts for an unfair \ncompetition claim under the Lanham Act.  The Plaintiff contends he has a valid and protectable mark because he has used the mark since February 2010 and the name \n“Lottery Tracking App” has acquired secondary  meaning.  (Doc. 6, ¶¶ 27, 28, 41, 42).  \nThis is sufficient for the first element of the claim.  The Plaintiff further contends that there is a likelihood of confusion because he has been approached by customers who received information about the Defendants’ product.  ( Id. ¶ 28).  This is sufficient to \nmeet the “likelihood of confusion” element.  Therefore, the Plaintiff has stated a claim for unfair competition under the Lanham Act.   \n Case 5:15-cv-00115-MTT   Document 12   Filed 12/03/15   Page 9 of 15- 10 - \n 3. Georgia Fair Business Practices Act  \nThe Plaintiff asserts a violation of the Georgia Fair Business Practices Act \n(“FBPA”), O.C.G.A. § 10-1-390 et. seq. , by the Defendants’ choice of name, advertising, \nmarketing, and general business practices.  (D oc. 6, ¶ 53).  The Plaintiff contends the \nDefendants’ actions “amount[] to passing of[f] Defendants’ goods as Plaintiff[’s] and/or will confuse the public as to source, sponsorship, approval, affiliation, or association with Plaintiff.”  (Doc. 5 at 10).  The Defendants claim the Plaintiff has failed to allege sufficient facts to support a violation of the FBPA and to i dentify upon which portion of \nO.C.G.A. § 10-1-390 he relies.  (Doc. 4 at 13).  The Plaintiff, however, asserts that his claim is based on the same facts as his Lanham Act claim and that the entire F BPA is \ninterrelated and applicable.  (Doc. 5 at 10).   \n“The FBPA protects businesses from unfair or deceptive practices in the conduct \nof trade or commerce, including passing off goods or services as those of another, or \ncausing actual confusion as to the source , sponsorship, approval, or certification of \ngoods or services.”  Inkaholiks Luxury Tattoos Ga., LLC v. Parton , 324 Ga. App. 769, \n770, 751 S.E.2d 561, 563 (2013).  The Plaintiff has asserted that the Defendants’ conduct is deceptive because they pass off thei r product as the Plaintiff’s product, which \nhas caused actual confusion among consumers as to the source of the product.  (Doc. \n6, ¶¶ 27, 28, 53).  This is sufficient to state a claim under the F BPA. \n4. Tortious Interference with Business Relations \nTo maintain a claim for tortious  interference with business  relations, a plaintiff \nmust prove: \n(1) improper action or wrongful conduct by the defendant without \nprivilege; (2) the defendant acted purposely and with malice with the Case 5:15-cv-00115-MTT   Document 12   Filed 12/03/15   Page 10 of 15- 11 - \n intent to injure; (3) the defendant induced a breach of a contractual \nobligation or caused a party or a third party to discontinue or fail to \nenter into an anticipated relationship with the plaintiff; and (4) the \ndefendant's tortious conduct proximately caused damage to the \nplaintiff. \n \nOnbrand Media v. Codex Consulting, Inc. , 301 Ga. App. 141, 150, 687 S.E.2d 168, 176 \n(2009).  “[I]mproper conduct means wrongful ac tion that generally involves predatory \ntactics such as physical violence, fraud or misrepresentation, defamation, use of confidential information, abusive civil suits, and unwarranted criminal prosecutions.”  Gordon Document Prods. v. Serv. Techs., Inc. , 308 Ga. App. 445, 449, 708 S.E.2d 48, \n53 (2011) (quoting Disaster Servs. v. ERC P’ship , 228 Ga. App. 739, 741-42, 492 \nS.E.2d 526, 529 (1997) (punctuation omitted)).   \nThe Plaintiff alleges the Defendants “marketed their infringing product to the \nsame customers with whom Plaintiff is doing or has done business[ and that the] Defendants marketed their application using the same trademarks as Plaintiff, to the same customers who would license Plaintiff’s software.”  (Doc. 6, ¶¶ 64-65).  The Plaintiff further contends that the “Defendants have engaged in fraud or misrepresentation by improperly using Plai ntiff’s [c]opyrighted images and trademarks[] \nand that Defendants have misused Plaintiff’s confidential information by copying or modifying [his] software.”  (Doc. 5 at 12).  The Defendants assert that the Plaintiff has \nnot alleged that they “acted improperly to induce a third party not to enter into or \ncontinue a business relationship with Defendants,” so he has not met one prong of the prima facie case for tortious interference because “improper conduct” entails tactics that may include fraud, misrepresentation, and use of confidential information, among other actions.  (Doc. 4 at 15-16).   Case 5:15-cv-00115-MTT   Document 12   Filed 12/03/15   Page 11 of 15- 12 - \n The Court disagrees.  The Plaintiff has alleged the Defendants acted improperly \nby fraud, misrepresentation, and the use of his confidential information.  (Docs. 5 at 11-12; 6, ¶¶ 25, 65).  He contends that customers thought they were doing business with the Plaintiff when they were actually doing business with the Defendants and that the Defendants “induced third parties not to enter into or continue a business relationship with Plaintiff. . . .”  (Doc. 6, ¶¶ 28, 66).  This is sufficient to meet the “improper conduct” prong of a claim for tortious interference. \n5. Fraud \nThe Plaintiff asserts the Defendants have engaged in unfair competition and \ncopyright infringement, constituting fraud under  O.C.G.A. § 23-2-55.  (Doc. 6, ¶¶ 61-62).  \nThe Defendants contend that the Plaintiff has not asserted sufficient facts to support a claim for unfair competition or that demonstrate an intent to deceive the public, which is required for relief pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 23-2-55.  (Doc. 4 at 15).   \nO.C.G.A. § 23-2-55 states that “[a]ny attempt to encroach upon the business of a \n… person by the use of similar trademarks, names, or devices, with the intention of deceiving and misleading the public, is a fraud for which equity will grant relief.”  “Any conduct the nature and probable tendency and effect of which is to deceive the public so as to ‘pass off’ the goods or business of one person as and for the goods or business of another constitutes a violation of O.C.G.A. § 23-2-55.”  Morton B. Katz & Assocs., \nLtd. v. Arnold , 175 Ga. App. 278, 279, 333 S.E.2d 115, 116 (1985) (quoting Atlanta \nPaper Co. v. Jacksonville Paper Co. , 184 Ga. 205, 213, 190 S.E. 777, 783 (1937)).  \n“Relief under this section ‘depends upon an intent to deceive.’”  Id. (citation omitted). Case 5:15-cv-00115-MTT   Document 12   Filed 12/03/15   Page 12 of 15- 13 - \n The Plaintiff’s allegation that the Defendants refer to their app as “Lottery \nTracking App” or “Lottery Tracking System” rather than “Lottery Artificial Intelligence” is sufficient to show an intent to deceive.  (Doc. 5 at 11).  Moreover, “[t]he federal Lanham Act analysis governs the analysis of Plaintiff’s state law trademark claims under O.C.G.A. § 23-2-55….” Valencia v. Universal City Studios LLC , 2014 WL 7240526, at *5 \n(N.D. Ga.); see also Planetary Motion, Inc. v. Techsplosion, Inc. , 261 F.3d 1188, 1193 \nn.4 (11th Cir. 2001) (“Courts may use an analysis of federal infringement claims as a ‘measuring stick’ in evaluating the merits of state law claims of unfair competition.”).  Therefore, because the Plaintiff stated a claim under the Lanham Act, the Plaintiff has also stated a state law claim for fraud under O.C.G.A. § 23-2-55.   \n6. Unjust Enrichment  \nThe elements of a claim for unjust enrichment are: “(1) a benefit has been \nconferred, (2) compensation has not been given for receipt of the benefit, and (3) the failure to so compensate would be unjust.”  Clark v. Aaron's, Inc. , 914 F. Supp. 2d 1301, \n1309 (N.D. Ga. 2012).  The Defendants contend the Plaintiff has not alleged that a benefit was conferred or any facts that support the allegation that the Defendants have benefitted from the alleged misappropriation.  (Doc. 7 at 8).   \nThe Court disagrees.  The Plaintiff alleges he “conferred a benefit on Defendants \nby providing a well-known and well-respected brand under [which] Defendants are marketing their product, but Defendants provided no compensation to Plaintiff for this benefit.”  (Doc. 6, ¶ 70).  The Plaintiff further asserts that the Defendants have benefitted from the misappropriation because they “have capitalized on Plaintiff[’s] work by marketing their application under Plaintiff[’s] brand, and by using Plaintiff’s brand to Case 5:15-cv-00115-MTT   Document 12   Filed 12/03/15   Page 13 of 15- 14 - \n entice consumers.”  ( Id. ¶ 69).  This is sufficient to state a claim for unjust enrichment.  \nCf. SCQuARE Intern., Ltd. v. BBDO Atlanta, Inc. , 455 F. Supp. 2d 1347, 1373 (N.D. Ga. \n2006) (denying summary judgment when there was a question of fact about whether one party had benefitted as a result of an allegedly unauthorized endorsement).   \n7. Breach of Contract \nThe Defendants contend that the “Plaintiff only alleges that Defendants used the \nsoftware and received customer support,” which is not sufficient to state a claim for breach of contract because this allegation does not “plausibly amount to reverse engineering, disassembling or decompiling the software.”  (Doc. 4 at 17).  However, the Plaintiff specifically alleges the “Defendants have reverse engineered, decompiled, and/or disassembled the [Plaintiff’s] software to create their infringing application” in violation of the EULA.  (Doc. 6, ¶  75).  This allegation is sufficient to state a claim for breach of contract.   \n8. Attorney’s Fees and Costs \nO.C.G.A. § 13-6-11 authorizes attorney’s fees “where the defendant has acted in \nbad faith, has been stubbornly litigious, or has caused the plaintiff unnecessary trouble \nand expense.”  The Plaintiff asserts he is entitled to attorney’s fees and costs under this code section.  (Doc. 6 at 12).  The Defendants contend this count should be dismissed because it is derivative of the other counts, which they believe should also be dismissed.  Because other counts are going forward, this one may go forward, as well. \nIII. CONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, the Defendants’ motion to dismiss is DENIED .  (Doc. \n4).

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: This court case involves a legal dispute between Lambda Labs, Inc. (Plaintiff) and Lambda, Inc. (Defendant) over discovery issues in the context of a trademark disagreement, which centers on offerings related to artificial intelligence and machine learning products and services. The court is handling two primary issues: a motion by Lambda School to compel Lambda Labs to provide more detailed responses to certain interrogatories, and a protective order concerning depositions, particularly about reputational concerns tied to trademarks.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether Lambda Labs has provided sufficient detail in its responses to the interrogatories regarding its AI and ML products and services, their associated trademarks, and the completeness of their trade and customer information.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court orders Lambda Labs to amend its responses to provide more detailed and complete information as required by the interrogatories, specifically focusing on AI and ML offerings. The court also denies Lambda School's request for a protective order on deposition questions, emphasizing the relevance of these questions to the trademark infringement case.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine two companies with very similar names that are arguing in court. One company (Lambda Labs) is supposed to tell the other (Lambda School) about all the different AI things it sells and how it sells them. However, it didn't give enough details, so the judge says, \"You need to give more and better answers.\" Meanwhile, Lambda School doesn't want to answer some questions during interviews, but the judge says, \"You have to answer because these questions might show if people are mixing up who is who because of your similar names.\"",

No. 134  \n \n \nWe are here for two matters:  first, a joint discovery letter brief in which Lambda School \nmoves to compel Lambda Labs to respond further to its interrogatories (“rogs”) 1, 2, 4, 6 and 7 , \nECF No. 134 ; and second, School’s motion for a protective order concerning depositions, ECF \nNo. 140 .  The  Court held a hearing this morning , and now issues this order.  \nA. Interrogatories  \n1. Rog 1  \nSchool’s rog 1 as Labs to:  “Describe in detail each of the Labs Goods and Services \nOffered under each of the Labs Marks by You at any time —past, present, or expected in the \nfuture —by stating the name of each good or service and the Labs Marks under which it was \nOffered, stating the nature and description of the good or service, stating all applicable or available \nconfigurations of the good or service, stating all charged or Offered price(s), stating the marketing \nchannels used for that good or service, Identifying the target customers for the good or service, \nIdentifying the actual customers for the good or service, stating the first and last Date each good or \nservice was Offered, stating Your plans to continue Offering the good or service, and Identifying \nYour employees who are knowledgeable about each good or service.”  \nAt first blush this seems like it’s asking for a ton of information.  But when you break it Case 4:19-cv-04060-JST   Document 151   Filed 02/17/21   Page 1 of 5 \n2 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  down, it’s really not that bad.  The answer could be in a chart format , which doesn’t look pretty in \nWord but could easily be populated in Excel:  \nName  Marks  Nature  Configs  Prices  Channels  Targets  Actuals  Dates  Plans  People  \n           \n           \n           \n           \n \nSome of this information would have to be stated generally.  For example, for the technical \nhardware and software products and consulting services at issue here, it’s not feasible to list all \npossible configurations, so Labs could jus t list the major variables.  For prices, probably just a \nrange or general metrics would be sufficient  for each product or service .  Channels of trade would \nbe general things like trade shows or partners.  Targets are presumably types of customers.  And \nthe list of knowledgeable people would be just one or more examples.  \nBut the important part of the rog response is the clear identification of what products or \nservices Labs offers, which marks they are associated with, the dates of those offerings, and then \nthe ability to connect those facts with the more general information discussed in the preceding \nparagraph, which gives a sense of what the product or service is and who it’s aimed at.  \nLabs’ third supplemental response is unsatisfactory.  Labs says it “has o ffered and \ncontinue s to offer a variety of products and services related to artificial intelligence and machine \nlearning,” but we never get a complete list of what they are.  Every list of the products and \nservices begins with the word “including” or “incl ude.”  The same is true of trade channels.  The \nlist of targets (“any customers for whom they are appropriate”) is completely evasive, and is then \nfollowed by the “including” problem.  And the trade channels and products are not broken down \nby product  or service .  If the answer is that Labs uses the same trade channels and eyes the same \ntargets for every single one of its products and services, it is free to say that , but it can’t just leave \nthe reader guessing.  The first paragraph of Labs’ answer identifi es several customers, but doesn’t \nlink them to any particular product or service.  All of Labs’ references to customers suffer from Case 4:19-cv-04060-JST   Document 151   Filed 02/17/21   Page 2 of 5 \n3 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  the “including” problem.   Labs does not provide sufficient pricing information.   While providing \npricing information for eve ry possible configuration of its good s or services may be unduly \nburdensome, Labs can certainly provide pricing ranges for them.  Labs also fails to provide any \ninformation in response to this rog concerning its planned training, educational and research \nservices, including their expected timing.  Whether or not that information may also be responsive \nto rog 12, it is responsive to rog 1, which asks about goods and services “expected in the future.”  \nIt is no response for Labs to say that School can ask wit nesses for any information that is not in a \nrog response because School is entitled to seek information using the discovery tools of its choice.    \nLabs also never tells us what work its common law trademark rights are doing.  Recall that \nthe amended compla int at ECF No. 47 identifies three Lambda marks:  the ‘853 word mark for \ncomputer software and hardware, the ‘852 design mark for computer software and hardware, and \ncommon law rights in the marks.  ECF No. 47 at ¶¶ 11, 12, 15.   Labs’ response to rog 1 sta tes that \nit uses the ‘852 and ‘853 marks for all of its products and services, including consulting.  But we \nnever hear about what the common law rights apply to, which may be significant given that the \n‘852 and ‘853 marks are for computer software and har dware.  \nAccordingly, the Court orders Labs to amend its response to rog 1 to provide a complete \nanswer , subject to the guidance provided above about how certain items likely need to be stated \ngenerally .  Because we are nearing the close of fact discovery, t he Court orders Labs to serve an \namended response within seven days so that School can move to compel again if the amended \nresponse is still insufficient.  \n2. Rogs 2, 4, 6 and 7  \nThe Court agrees with Labs that the dispute as to these rogs is unripe.  The Court  orders \nthe parties to meet and confer further and for Labs to serve any amended responses by February \n19, 2021, a deadline that Labs said it could meet at the hearing . \nB. Protective Order  \nSchool seeks a protective order barring Labs from asking certain types of questions during \ndepositions.  One form of relief that School seems to be asking for is that it want s to take the limits \non document discovery concerning student and employee complai nts that Labs agreed to or the Case 4:19-cv-04060-JST   Document 151   Filed 02/17/21   Page 3 of 5 \n4 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  Court ordered and impose those same limits on deposition  questions.  However, that is illogical.  \nWhen the Court determines what is proportional for document production, the Court considers t he \nprimary burdens associated with  document discovery , which  relate to what has to be searched for \nand where.  By contrast, the particular questions a witness is asked during a deposition do not \ngenerally make the deposition more or less burdensome.  If Labs asks a witness about any \ncompla ints ever made about School, the witness can testify about what he or she knows.  There is \nnothing burdensome about that.  \nSchool is correct that a 30(b)(6) deponent is obligated to know certain things.  But the only \nspecific 30(b)(6) topics that School obj ects to in the letter brief (topics 37 and 38) are not \nburdensome.  School complains that Labs’ questions of the 30(b)(6) deponent exceeded the scope \nof topics 31 and 44 -46.  But so what?  The questioning attorney is permitted to do that, and if the \nquesti ons were outside the scope of the noticed topics, the deponent had no obligation to know the \nanswers.   More generally, the Court does not believe that 30(b)(6) deposition topics that reference \nrepeated events (e.g., topic 31 “Your efforts to address or res pond to complaints concerning the \nquality of Your good[s] and services, curriculum, and instructors; student employment and career \nplacement; and income sharing agreements”) require the deponent to have memorized every \ninstance , when that is likely impossi ble. \nIn the last paragraph of the discovery letter brief, School states that it “seeks a protective \norder that permits School to refuse to answer deposition questions regarding (1) complaints about \nSchool that do not fall within the aforementioned categori es (which the ambiguous subject matter \nof ‘culture’ is not within nor are complaints about School’s administration of its internal Slack \nchannel ); (2) complaints made by employees; (3) non -student litigations or threatened litigations \nagainst School; and (4) the terms of any agreements to cancel student income share agreements \nand how School decides to cancel student income agreements.”  As to category 1, the Court \nsurmises that the “aforementioned categories” of complaints mean the limits that apply to \ndocument discovery.  In any event, the Court denies the motion for a protective order in its \nentirety.  All four areas of inquiry are relevant to reputational injury, which is relevant in this \ntrademark case in which Labs alleges customer confusion due to Sc hool’s infringement.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: Dr. Ahmad Aljindi filed a pro se complaint alleging various claims against the United States, including copyright infringement related to his contributions to the fields of Artificial Intelligence (AI), Information Security, and Legacy Information Systems (LIS). The Court of Federal Claims dismissed the complaint, ruling that Aljindi failed to state a viable claim as his allegations pertained to ideas or principles, which cannot be protected under copyright law. The Federal Circuit affirmed the dismissal.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether Dr. Aljindi's complaint alleged a valid copyright infringement claim when the alleged infringement involved ideas and concepts, rather than a specific, protectable expression.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The Court held that Aljindi's claims were not actionable under copyright law because they pertained to ideas and principles, which cannot be copyrighted. The Court affirmed the lower court's dismissal of Aljindi's complaint.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine you invent a new game and write a book about its rules. While you own the rights to your book's exact words, you can't stop others from playing your game or writing about the rules in their own way. Dr. Aljindi believed the government used his scientific ideas without permission, but the court said that because he was complaining about general ideas and concepts, not specific written content like a book or article, those don't get special protection under copyright laws. So, the court couldn't help him.",

US 2 \nPER CURIAM . \nDr. Ahmad Aljindi appeals the decision of the U.S. \nCourt of Federal Claims denying his motion for summary \njudgment and granting the government’s motion to dis-\nmiss.  For the reasons set forth below, we affirm.  \nBACKGROUND  \nIn 2021, Dr.  Aljindi filed a complaint pro se at the \nCourt of Federal Claims.  The complaint alleged various claims, including employment discrimination; intellectual property theft; “negligence and tort,” Aljindi v.  United \nStates, No.  2022- 1117, 2022 WL 1464476, at *1 (Fed.  Cir. \nMay 10, 2022) ( Aljindi I ); and “ongoing judicial corruption, \nabuse, and torture in addition to the Government’s abuse \nand torture,” id.  (cleane d up).  The G overnment moved to \ndismiss Dr.  Aljindi’s complaint for failure to state a claim, \nand the Court of Federal Claims granted that motion.  \nDr. Aljindi appealed that dismissal to this court.  See \nid.  We affirmed the Court of Federal Claims’ dismiss al of \nmost of Dr.  Aljindi’s claims because that court lacked juris-\ndiction to consider them.  Id.  at *2 –3.  But we vacated -in-\npart the trial court’s dismissal because Dr.  Aljindi’s com-\nplaint “mentioned copyrights law violations in the relief \nsection,” which  could “be liberally construed as a copyright \ninfringement claim over which the Court of Federal Claims would have jurisdiction.”  Id.  at *3 (cleaned up).   Accord-\ningly, we remanded for the trial court “to consider the Gov-\nernment’s position that Dr.  Aljindi’s complaint fails to \nstate a claim for copyright infringement.”  Id.   \nOn remand, the Government moved to dismiss \nDr. Aljindi’s copyright infringement claim for failure to \nstate a claim.  See Aljindi v.  United States, No.  21-1295C, \n2022 WL 17330006, at *1 (Fed.  Cl. Nov. 28, 2022)  Case: 23-1230      Document: 21     Page: 2     Filed: 04/05/2023ALJINDI  v. US 3 \n(Aljindi II); SAppx.1 1–4.  The Government argued that \nDr. Aljindi’s complaint failed to state a copyright infringe-\nment claim because, even construed liberally, his com-\nplaint only alleged generally that the Government copied \nhis ideas —and ideas cannot be copyrighted as a matter of  \nlaw.  See Aljindi II , 2022 WL 17330006, at *1.   The Court \nof Federal Claims agreed and dismissed Dr.  Aljindi’s copy-\nright infringement claim.   \nDr. Aljindi appeals.  We have jurisdiction under \n28 U.S.C. §  1295(a)(3).  \nDISCUSSION  \nWe review de novo the Court  of Federal Claims’ dismis-\nsal of a complaint for failure to state a claim.  Turping v. United States, 913 F.3d 1060, 1064 (Fed.  Cir. 2019).  “A \nmotion to dismiss .  . . for failure to state a claim upon which \nrelief can be granted is appropriate when the facts asserted by the plaintiff do not entitle him to a legal remedy.”  Boyle \nv. United States, 200 F.3d 1369, 1372 (Fed.  Cir. 2000).  In \nreviewing such a dismissal, we “accept all well- pleaded fac-\ntual allegations as true and draw all reasonable inferences in [the appellant’s] favor.”  Id.  But “regardless of whether \nthe plaintiff is proceeding pro se or is represented by coun-\nsel, conclusory allegations or legal conclusions masquerad-ing as factual conclusions will not suffice to prevent a motion to dismiss.”  Scott v.  United States , 134 Fed.  Cl. \n755, 758 (2017) (quoting McZeal v.  Spring Nextel Corp. , \n501 F.3d 1354, 1356 (Fed.  Cir. 2007)).   \nOn appeal, Dr.  Aljindi argues that the Court of Federal \nClaims erred in dismissing his claim for copyright \n \n1  Citations to “SAppx.” refer to the Appendix at-\ntached to the appellee’s brief.  Case: 23-1230      Document: 21     Page: 3     Filed: 04/05/2023ALJINDI  v. US 4 \ninfringement.  Appellant’s Br.2 4.  Specifically, Dr.  Aljindi \nargues that the “Government used [his] proper ty in ALL \nformal AI Strategies published by the federal government \n. . . as [he had] discovered this entire scientific field in its \nentirety.”  Appellant’s Br.  13.  In other words, Dr.  Aljindi \nargues that he discovered the scientific field of “Infor-mation Security, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Legacy In-\nformation Systems  (LIS) ,” and thus that the government’s \nsubsequent use of technologies in that field infring ed upon \nhis copyright.   Complaint at 2, Aljindi v.  United States , \nNo. 1:21-cv-01295- SSS (Fed. Cl.)  (Complaint ); see also  Ap-\npellant’s Br.  10 (“[H]ow did these federal agencies .  . . know \nabout the relationship between AI, Information Security, and LIS witho ut reading and taking my property and \nbuilding on its formal scientific findings!”) .\n3   \nAs the Court of Federal Claims explained, the protec-\ntions of copyright do not “extend to any idea, procedure, process, system, method of operation, concept, principle, or \ndiscovery, regardless of the form in which it is described, \n \n2  Because Dr.  Aljindi’s opening brief on appeal in-\ncludes an attachment , we use the pagination provided in \nthe header of his brief.  \n3  Dr. Aljindi also argues that the trial court  erred by \ndismissing his “Fifth Amendment Taking Claim.”  Appel-\nlant’s Br.  4.  In Aljindi I , however, we affirmed that court’s \ndismissal of this claim and remanded only for considera-\ntion of his copyright infringement claim.  2022  WL \n1464476, at *2–3 ; see also Aljind i v. United States, 143 \nS. Ct. 436 (2022) (Mem.) (denying Dr.  Aljindi’s petition for \na writ of certiorari) .  Dr. Aljindi thus cannot re -raise this \nissue on appeal from that remand.  See, e.g. , Arizona v.  Cal-\nifornia , 460 U.S. 605, 618 (1983) ( “[W]hen a cour t decides \nupon a rule of law, that decision should continue to govern \nthe same issues in subsequent stages of the same case.”).  \nAccordingly, we do not consider this issue further.  Case: 23-1230      Document: 21     Page: 4     Filed: 04/05/2023ALJINDI  v. US 5 \nexplained, illustrated, or embodied in such work.”  \n17 U.S.C. §  102(b); see Aljindi II , 2022 WL 17330006, at  *2.  \nAn individual can own a copyright on a literary form of \ntheir work, but not on “the facts and ideas ” contained in \nthat work.  Harper & Row Publishers, Inc. v.  Nation En-\nters., 471 U.S. 539, 5 47 (1985).  Put sim ply, “[c]opyright \nprotection does not extend to ideas expressed in a copy-righted work.”  Boyle v.  United States, 200 F.3d 1369, 1373 \n(Fed.  Cir. 2000).  \nHere, Dr.  Aljindi’s complaint identifies  the intellectual \nproperty allegedly infringed by the government  as his “sci-\nentific work about Information Security, Artificial Intelli-\ngence (AI), and Legacy Information Systems (LIS).”  Complaint  at 2.  On appeal, as he did before the Court of \nFederal Claims, Dr.  Aljindi references his doctoral disser-\ntation.  See, e.g. , Appellant’s  Br. 10.  Dr. Aljindi clarifies in \nhis briefing, however, that his copyright claim is not \nfounded on any alleged infringement of the copyrightable \naspects of his dissertation; rather, he explains that  “[t]he \nscientific intellectual property” a t issue i s “the discovery of \nthe entire Information Security, AI, and LIS scientific field in its entirety and establishing this scientific field from scratch.”  Appellant’s Br.  9; see also id.  at 10 (Dr. Aljindi \narguing that “[e]verything is based on [his ] scientific re-\nsearch and [his] own property”); id.  at 13 (Dr. Aljindi argu-\ning that the “Government used [his] property in ALL \nformal AI Strategies published by the federal govern-\nment.”).  Dr.  Aljindi does not identify any specific expres-\nsion of these idea s and concepts that the government \nallegedly copied; instead, he repeatedly contends generally that “everything built on top of [his] property is [his] prop-erty.”  Id.  at 10.   \nAccordingly, e ven giving Dr.  Aljindi’s pleadings the le-\nniency afforded to pro se plaintiffs, Ledford v.  United \nStates, 297 F.3d 1378, 1381 (Fed.  Cir. 2002), Dr.  Aljindi \nhas alleged only that the government infringed certain of \nhis “idea[s], .  . . concept[s], principle[s], or discover[ies],”  Case: 23-1230      Document: 21     Page: 5     Filed: 04/05/2023ALJINDI  v. US 6 \n17 U.S.C. §  102(b) , which by definition c annot be copy-\nrighted.  The Court of Federal Claims thus did not err in \ndismissing Dr.  Aljindi’s copyright infringement claim.  \nWe have considered each of Dr.  Aljindi’s remaining ar-\nguments and find them unpersuasive.  \nCONCLUSION  \nFor the above reasons, we affirm the Court of Federal \nClaims’ dismissal of Dr.  Aljindi’s complaint.  \nAFFIRMED  \nCOSTS  \nNo costs.

    "summary": "1. **Summary:** In the case of Vehicle Intelligence and Safety LLC v. Mercedes-Benz USA, LLC and Daimler AG, Vehicle Intelligence and Safety LLC accused the defendants of infringing on its patent (No. 7,394,392), which involves using expert systems to screen equipment operators for impairments and control equipment operation based on those screenings. This case prominently features AI as the patent in question utilizes \"expert systems\" as a form of computerized AI to assess operator impairment. The court granted the defendants' motion for judgment, determining that the patent covered abstract ideas without the necessary inventive concepts to be patent-eligible under 35 U.S.C. § 101.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue:** Whether the '392 patent, which aims to cover methods and systems of expert screening for equipment operator impairment using AI, constitutes an abstract idea without an inventive concept and is therefore ineligible for patent protection under 35 U.S.C. § 101.\n\n3. **Court's Holding:** The court held that the '392 patent embodies an abstract idea—essentially testing operators for impairments using computerized systems—and lacks an inventive concept that transforms it into a patent-eligible application. Thus, the claims were deemed invalid, and the court ruled in favor of the defendants, declaring the patent ineligible as per 35 U.S.C. § 101.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation:** Imagine you have a new idea for using a computer program (like a smart robot brain) to check if someone is too tired or drunk to drive. You think this idea is worth being your own special invention, so no one else can use it unless they pay you. However, the court says, \"Hold on, checking if someone is tired or drunk isn't a brand new idea. Even doing it with a computer that's not more than just a smart robot doesn’t make it special enough to get such protection.\" So, they decide you can't claim this as your own exclusive invention.",

Sep t. 18, 2014) (\"VIS II\").  Defen dants now ren ew their\nmotion for judgment on the pleadings contending that the '392 patent is based on\nan abstract idea an d that the claims do not contain an \"inventive concep t\"\nsufficient to confer patent eligibility pursuant to 35 U.S.C. §  101.\nThe '392 Patent Abstract is as follows:\nMethods and systems using one or more ex pert systems to\nscreen  equipment operators for impairments, such as\nintoxication, physical impairment, medical impairment, or\nemotional impairment, to selectively test the equipment\noperators and control the equipment (e.g., automobiles,\ntrucks, industrial vehicles, public transportation vehicles, such\nas buses, subway s, trains, planes, and ships, and dangerous\nmachinery in general) if impairment of the eq uipment operator\nis determined.  On e em bodiment is a method to screen  an\nequipment operator for intoxication, using one or more ex pert\nsystems.  A s econd embodiment is a method to screen  an\nequipment operator for impairment, such as intoxication,\nphysical impairment, medical impairment, or emotional\nimpairment, using one or more ex pert systems.  A t hird\nembodiment is an equipment operator screen ing system to\ndetermine impairment, such as intoxication, physical\nimpairment, medical impairment, or emotional impairment,\nusing one or more ex pert systems.\nThe '392 Patent does not invent impairment detection methods or\ndevices.  The patent discloses eleven prior art patents for impairment detection\nsystems which are i ncorporated by referen ce.  Th e patent acknowledges that the\nprior art patents have been issued to detect driver impairment.  Cols. 1-3.  Many of\nthese patents are l inked to locking systems that prevent vehicle operation unless\n2Case: 1:13-cv-04417 Document #: 102 Filed: 01/29/15 Page 2 of 19 PageID #:<pageID>the operator passes a breath analyzer, v oice an alyzer, an d/or skin sensor test. \nCols. 1-2 (describing U.S. Pat ent Nos. 6,886,653; 6,748,301, & 4 ,738,333).\nThe Am ended Complaint alleges that defendants have directly infringed\nat least claim 8 of the '392 Patent by selling each  Merced es-Ben z vehicle that\nincorporates a feat ure of the vehicle referred  to as ATTENTION ASSIST.\nClaim 8 of the '392 Patent is an exemplary claim.  It is as follows:\nA method to screen  an equipment operator for\nimpairment, comprising:\n  screen ing an equipment operat or by one or more\nexpert systems to detect potential impairment of\nsaid equipment operator;\n  selectively testing said equipment operator\nwhen said screen ing of said equipment operator\ndetects potential impairment of said equipment\noperator; and\n  controlling operation of said equipment if said\nselective testing of said equipment operator\nindicates said impairment of said equipment\noperator, wh erein said screen ing of said\nequipment operator includes a time-sharing\nallocation of at least one processor executing at\nleast one expert system.\nCol. 15, ll. 30-43.\nThe description of the preferred  embodiments includes:\nEmbodiments of the invention can be implemented by\nutilizing combinations of one or more modules (e.g., using all\nof a m odule, or using a p ortion of a m odule) already existing\nin the equipment as standard features.  For example, in a\ntypical vehicle there is an operat ions module (e.g ., an\nequipment operations module allowing the eq uipment\noperator to determine one or more functions of equipment,\nsuch as speed of operation and direction of movement), an\n3Case: 1:13-cv-04417 Document #: 102 Filed: 01/29/15 Page 3 of 19 PageID #:<pageID>audio module (e.g ., a sound entertainment module, or a\ncommunication module), a n avigation module (e.g ., a m ap\ndisplay module), an  anti-theft module (e.g ., a m otion detector\nmodule), an d a cl imate control module (e.g ., an\nair-conditioning module).  M any of these modules have\nbecome very sophisticated in their operator interfaces  and in\ntheir convenience to the equipment operator.  Th ese existing\nmodules also can provide useful information on past and/or\ncurrent operat or actions to assist in the process of determining\nwhether the equipment operat or is truly impaired or not\nimpaired.\nCol. 6, ll. 33-49.\nAdditional descriptive data is as follows:\nEmbodiments of the invention can be constructed using\none or more data processing systems already existing in the\nequipment modules listed above, in a time-sharing allocation\nof their available processors and memory.  Such existing\nequipment modules frequently have some unused memory and\nunused processor time available after performing their\nexisting module functions.  Alternatively, one or more\nadditional data processing systems (e.g., based on any\ncommercially available microprocessor of any word bit width\nand clock speed, a co ntrol Read -Only-Memory, or a data\nprocessing equivalent) can  be dedicated to combining the\ninformation gathered from one or more m odules listed above,\nor disclosed by one or more of the prior art patents\nincorporated by referen ce.\nCol. 7, ll. 9-22.  \nA Ru le 12(c) m otion for judgment on the pleadings challenging patent\neligibility must be shown by clear an d convincing evidence ap peari ng in the\npatent.  Every patent is presumed to be issued properly, absent clear an d\nconvincing evidence to the contrary.  See Microsoft Corp. v. i4i Ltd.

Th e Supreme Court has held that there\nare three n arrow ex ceptions to statutory patent eligibility:  \"laws of nature,\nphysical phenomena, an d abstract ideas.\"  Bilski v. Ka ppos, 561 U.S. 5 93, 601\n(2010) (q uoting Diamond v. Cha krabarty, 447 U.S. 3 03, 308 (1980)).  To\novercome a ch arge of abstract idea preem ption it must appear that the cl aim\nlimitations reflect an \"inventive concept\" that adds significantly to, and limits, the\nexpanse of any abstract idea.  Mayo Collaborative Ser v. v. Pr ometheus  Labs.,\nInc., 132 S. Ct . 1289, 1293-944 (2012).\nThe Supreme Court held in Alice Co rp., 134 S. Ct . at 2355, that the\ntwo-part fram ework set forth in Mayo applies to all contentions that patents\nembody ineligible, ab stract ideas contrary to § 101.  First, it must be determined\nwhether the patent is directed to an abstract idea, an d, second, it must be\ndetermined whether an y element, or combination of elements, in the claim is\nsufficient to ensure that the claim amounts to significantly more than the abstract\nidea itself--more than an instruction to apply the abstract idea.  Th is has been\nreferred  to as an inventive concept.\n5Case: 1:13-cv-04417 Document #: 102 Filed: 01/29/15 Page 5 of 19 PageID #:<pageID>Abstract ideas are ex cluded from eligibility based on the concern that\nmonopolization of the basic tools of scientific and technological work could\nimpede innovation more than promote it.  Ab stract ideas referred  to in Alice Co rp.,\n134 S.

Claim 8 is\nrepresentative.  Th e key term is \"expert system(s),\" which appears  in all of the\nclaims which are ch arged to be infringed.  VIS co nced es that to overcome prior art\nin the field of impairment-detection systems, the '392 patent provides that an\n\"expert system\" is used to screen  and selectively test for operator impairment and\ncontrol of equipment.  Th e patent does not define the term \"expert system\" as\nsuch; however, the figures, particularly Figure 8, and the related specifications\nprovide intrinsic evidence of what is intended.\nFIG. 8\n8Case: 1:13-cv-04417 Document #: 102 Filed: 01/29/15 Page 8 of 19 PageID #:<pageID>Expert systems are a cl ass of computer programs first developed in the\n1960's that seek to em ulate the decision-making of human experts in a field of\nexpertise (e.g., chemistry, medicine, geology).  An  expert system stores knowledge\nobtained from human experts in a \"knowledge base.\"  In the field of medical\ndiagnosis, an expert system will include rules concerning the symptoms and\ncharact eristics associated with various ailments.  Th e system will have a \"decision\nmodule\" inferen ce en gine that is programmed to selectively apply expert rules\nstored in the knowledge base in order to resolve problems.  An  example of the\napplication of an Artificial Intelligence system is a backward -chaining process that\nsearch es the knowledge base for rules to either verify or disprove that a patient has\nor doesn't have flu.  The decision module wi ll search  for and apply rules in the\nknowledge base related to symptoms of flu.

In\ncontrast, expert systems combine fact s with rules that state\nrelations between  the fact s to achieve a cru de form of\nreasoning analogous to artificial intelligence.  Th e two main\ncomponents of an expert system are (1 ) the knowledge base,\nwhich differs from a database in that it contains executable\nprogram code (instructions) and (2) the inferen ce en gine,\nwhich interprets and evaluates the instructions and data in\nthe knowledge base.\nAs used in the '392 patent, the term \"expert s ystem(s)\" was construed\nto mean:\na computer program  consisting of[1] (1) a database module\nthat contains information a specialist would consider in an\nanalysis of an equipment operator for impairment; (2) a\ndecision module that applies logic for screen ing and testing\nan equipment operat or for impairment and for controlling\nequipment, and (3) an interfa ce m odul e which interfa ces\nwith one or more eq uipment modules and the equipment\noperator.\nVIS II, 2014 WL 4652563 at *3.\nClaim 8 provides that “screen ing” an equipment operat or fo r potential\nimpairment is implemented using an “expert system” that “includes a time-sharing\nallocation of at least one processor.”  Gen eric computer au tomation of the\nconventional “screen ing” step does not amount to an “inventive concept.”  An\n1At the Oct ober 9 , 2014 status hearing, on the oral motion of plaintiff and\nwithout objection by defendants, the wo rd comprising was  substituted for the\nwords \"consisting of.\"  It was suggested by plaintiff that the wo rd \"comprising\" is\na broader term which allows for other possible elements in the expert system.

    "summary": "1. **Summary:** Erik M. Underwood and My24HourNews.com, Inc. filed a trademark infringement lawsuit against Bank of America (BofA) claiming that BofA's use of the service mark \"ERICA\" in its virtual financial assistant infringed on their unregistered \"E.R.I.C.A.\" mark. The court affirmed the district court’s decision, granting summary judgment to BofA and finding that the plaintiffs failed to establish that their use of the \"E.R.I.C.A.\" mark clearly distinguished their services, thus lacking a protectable interest in the mark. The case involves artificial intelligence (AI) as the plaintiffs claimed to have a virtual assistant service mark \"E.R.I.C.A.\", while BofA's ERICA is also a virtual financial assistant.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue:** Whether the plaintiffs have a protectable interest in the unregistered service mark \"E.R.I.C.A.\" through actual use in commerce, prior to BofA's use of the similar mark \"ERICA\".\n\n3. **Court's Holding:** The court held that the plaintiffs did not demonstrate actual use in commerce of the \"E.R.I.C.A.\" mark in a way that clearly distinguished and identified their offered services. Therefore, they did not establish a protectable interest in the mark, affirming the summary judgment for BofA.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation:** Imagine you have a unique name for a service that you think no one else is using, and you don’t register it officially. But when a big company starts using a similar name for their service, you try to claim they’re taking your name. The court looked into it and decided that you weren’t really using your cool name in a way that made it clear what your service was, so the big company didn’t actually steal your thunder.",

After the \nUSPTO approved the application, BofA launched ERICA as a virtual financial \nassistant in its mobile ba nking application, and the USPTO formally issued the \nERICA registration to Bo fA in July 2018.  \nPlaintiffs then filed this  action, asserting as rele vant here that BofA was \ninfringing on their trademark. The district  court granted BofA’s motion to cancel \nplaintiffs’ Georgia trademark registrati on and its motion for summary judgment.  \nPlaintiffs appealed, and we  affirmed the trademark cancellation and much of \nthe summary-judgment order, but we vacated and remanded on a single issue—\nwhether plaintiffs had establ ished protectable trademark rights through a theory of \nactual use of the E.R.I.C. A. mark in commerce. See Underwood v. Bank of Am. \nCorp. , 996 F.3d 1038, 1059 (10th Ci r. 2021). Setting out the correct legal framework \nfor assessing “actual use,” we remanded for the district c ourt to determine whether \nplaintiffs could establish that: (1) www.my24erica.com was publicly accessible \n \n1 The parties dispute the date on which this website became publicly \naccessible: plaintiffs as sert it was in March 2015; BofA  contends it was not until June \n2018.

Ltd. v. Morningside \nCap. Grp., L.L.C. , 182 F.3d 133, 138 (2d Cir. 1999), and then quoting 2 J. Thomas \nMcCarthy, McCarthy on Trademarks and Un fair Competition § 16:32.70 (5th ed. \nMar. 2021 update)). \nOn remand, the district court again granted summary judgment for BofA, \nfinding that (1) even assuming the website  was publicly accessible before October \n2016, plaintiffs failed to cr eate a genuine issue of materi al fact as to  (2) whether \nplaintiffs rendered search-e ngine and personal-assistant services to others and \n(3) whether the mark clearl y identified and distinguished  the services offered by \nwww.my24erica.com. It later denied plai ntiffs’ motion for reconsideration.  \nPlaintiffs appeal. \nAnalysis \nPlaintiffs challenge summary judgm ent for BofA on their trademark-\ninfringement claim. We re view a summary-judgment or der de novo and apply the \nsame legal standard as  the district court.  GeoMetWatch Corp. v. Behunin , 38 F.4th \n1183, 1200 (10th Cir.  2022). Summary judgment is pr oper when there is “no genuine \ndispute as to any material fact and the mova nt is entitled to j udgment as a matter of \nlaw,” Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a), meaning that a reasonable jury  could not return a verdict \nfor the nonmoving party, see Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc. , 477 U.S. 242, 248 Appellate Case: 22-1402     Document: 010111034400     Date Filed: 04/18/2024     Page: 3 4 \n (1986). On summary judgment, we view all facts and inferences in the light most \nfavorable to the nonmoving party. GeoMetWatch , 38 F.4th at 1200. \n As we explained in our prior decision in  this case, “[t]he principle underlying \ntrademark protection is that  distinctive marks—words, names, symbols, and the \nlike—can help distinguish a particular artisan’s goods from those of others.” \nUnderwood , 996 F.3d at 1045 (quoting B&B Hardware, Inc. v.  Hargis Indus., Inc. , \n575 U.S. 138, 142 (2015)). And the overarc hing “rule of trademark ownership in the \nUnited States is priority of use,” establis hed by using a symbol or word to identify \nand distinguish the sour ce of goods of services. Id. (quoting 2 J. Thomas McCarthy, \nMcCarthy on Trademarks and Unfair Competition § 16:1 (5th ed. Mar. 2021 \nupdate)). To establish a claim for trad emark infringement under federal law, “a \nplaintiff must show ‘(1) that the plaintif f has a protectable in terest in the mark; \n(2) that the defendant has used  an identical or similar mark  in commerce; and (3) that \nthe defendant’s use is likel y to confuse customers.’” Id. (quoting 1-800 Contacts, Inc. \nv. Lens.com, Inc. , 722 F.3d 1229, 1238 (10th Cir. 2013). For purposes of this appeal, \nwe assume that the last two el ements are established. So at  issue here, as in the prior \nappeal, is only the first elem ent: a protectable interest. See id.  at 1052–53.  \n A plaintiff can establish a protectable interest in an  unregistered service mark \nthrough “actual use in the market.” Id. at 1053 (quoting  Allard Enters., Inc. v. \nAdvanced Programming Res., Inc. , 146 F.3d 350, 354 (6th Cir. 1998)). To do so, a \n“plaintiff must show use of the mark as a service mark, which means use ‘to identify \nand distinguish the services of one person . . . from the services  of others and to Appellate Case: 22-1402     Document: 010111034400     Date Filed: 04/18/2024     Page: 4 5 \n indicate the source of the services, even if that  source is unknown.’” Id. (quoting 15 \nU.S.C. § 1127). And actual use must take place in commerce,  meaning that it consists \nof “attempt[s] to complete genuine commerc ial transactions,” as  opposed to uses \nmerely intended “to reserve a mark for later use.” Id. at 1053–54 (alteration in \noriginal) (quoting Allard Enters. , 146 F.3d at 359). As partic ularly relevant here, use \nof a mark on a website “may constitute a bona fide use in commerce,” but “the \nwebsite must ‘identify [the] goo ds or services . . . provid ed through or in connection \nwith the website.’” Id. at 1054 (alteration in original) (quoting Specht v. Google, Inc. , \n747 F.3d 929, 934 (7 th Cir. 2014)).  \nHere, as to actual use in commerce, re call that the district court assumed \nplaintiffs’ website was public ly accessible before Oct ober 2016 but c oncluded both \nthat plaintiffs did not render search-engine and personal-ass istant services to others \nand that plaintiffs’ use of the mark di d not clearly identify and distinguish the \nservices they provided. We will similarly assume public  accessibility and will go one \nstep further and assume that plaintif fs did render servic es to others.  \nTurning our focus to whethe r plaintiffs’ use of the ma rk clearly identified and \ndistinguished their services, we first note th at the district cour t’s analysis on this \npoint lacked detail. It simply stated that plaintiffs’ use di d not meet this standard and \noffered as an “example” that “[p]lainti ffs point[ed] to no evidence that any \nindividuals who visited its we bsite during that timeframe associated the mark with \nthe website’s services.”  App. vol. 7, 1658.  \nTaking off from this example, plaintiffs argue on appeal that the district court Appellate Case: 22-1402     Document: 010111034400     Date Filed: 04/18/2024     Page: 5 6 \n “erred by requiring  proof that a particular indivi dual subjectively associated the \nERICA mark with the website’s services.”2 Aplt. Br. 19 (emphasis added). But as \ndefendant identifies, the phrase “for example” indicates that the district court did not \nrequire  such subjective proof; rather, it merely  noted the absence of such proof when \nconcluding that the use of the mark on the website did not clearly identify and \ndistinguish the services provided. And it is not clear that doing so was erroneous: \neven plaintiffs acknowledge that this  inquiry turns on the totality of the \ncircumstances and thus could include  the possibility of subjective proof. See \nPlanetary Motion, Inc. v. Techsplosion, Inc. , 261 F.3d 1188, 1195–96 (11th Cir. \n2001) (explaining that courts look at tota lity of circumstances to determine use in \ncommerce, including “evidence that members of the ta rgeted public actually \nassociated the mark . . . with the [good or service] to  which it was affixed”). In any \nevent, we need not definiti vely resolve whether the dist rict court erred by discussing \nthe lack of subjective evid ence in this case. We must simply assess, on de novo \nreview, whether plaintiffs can show a genuine  issue of material fact on actual use in \ncommerce based on the totali ty of the circumstances.  \n \n2 Plaintiffs also argue that the distri ct court erred by pr oviding inadequate \nnotice of the basis for its ruling. But our prior decision included significant detail \nabout the three issues to be decided on re mand, and the district court ordered the \nparties to file supplemental briefing addressing those issues . Then, the district court \nissued its summary-judgment ruling based on those three issues. So we reject \nplaintiffs’ notice argument. Cf. Oldham v. O.K. Farms, Inc. , 871 F.3d 1147, 1150–51 \n(10th Cir. 2017) (fi nding plaintiff was prejudiced by district court’s grant of \nsummary judgment on ground not raised or  addressed by either party and instead \nraised sua sponte by c ourt during hearing).  Appellate Case: 22-1402     Document: 010111034400     Date Filed: 04/18/2024     Page: 6 7 \n  Seeking to do so, plaintiffs point to  the About ERICA and Terms of Service \nsections of the website, whic h both mention either “E.R.I.C .A.” or “ERICA.” As an \ninitial matter, to reach either  of these webpages, a website  visitor must scroll to the \nbottom of the information-heavy homepage and locate and click on a link in small-\npoint, all-lowercase font in  the bottom right corner.3 Such an obscure use of the mark \nis unlikely to “‘clearly id entif[y] and distinguish’ th e services offered ‘on the \nwebsite.’” Underwood , 996 F.3d at 1057 (quoting 2 J.  Thomas McCarthy, McCarthy \non Trademarks and Unfair Competition § 16:32.70 (5th ed. Mar. 2021 update)); see \nalso In re Osterberg , 83 U.S.P.Q.2d 1220, at *3 (T.T.A.B. 2007) (finding no \nconnection between use of mark and goods where “viewers of the webpage will have \nto search through the descriptive te xt even to find the purported mark”); In re Azteca \nSystems, Inc. , 102 U.S.P.Q.2d 1955, at *1–3 (T.T .A.B. 2012) (finding no connection \nbetween use of mark and goods  where “the mark [wa]s dist ant from the description of \nthe software, . . . separated from the descri ption by more than fifteen lines of text \nconcerning marginally[ ]rela ted topics,” and located “i n the lower[,] left-hand, \nbottom corner of th e first webpage”).  \n Moreover, even if a website visitor manages to reach these linked webpages, \nthese pages still do not establish “E.R.I.C.A .” as a protectable service mark. The use \nof a service mark must allo w for a “direct asso ciation” between the mark and the \nservices offered. In re Vicki Roberts , 87 U.S.P.Q.2d 1474, at *3 (T.T.A.B. 2008) \n \n3 For reference, we attach  an image of the homepage as an appendix to this \nOrder and Judgment. See App. vol. 6, 1443–45. Appellate Case: 22-1402     Document: 010111034400     Date Filed: 04/18/2024     Page: 7 8 \n (quoting In re N.V. Organon , 79 U.S.P.Q2d 1639, 1649 (T.T.A.B. 2006)). And it is \nnot “enough that the mark and a reference to the services both appear in the same” \nlocation. In re Osmotica Holdings Corp. , 95 U.S.P.Q.2d 1666, at *3 (T.T.A.B. 2010).  \n Here, the webpages at issue do not allo w for a direct asso ciation between the \nmark and the services offere d. The About ERICA webpage st ates that “[t]he acronym \nE.R.I.C.A[.] stands for Electronic Repetiti ous Informational Clone Application” and \ndescribes “ERICA” as “an artif icial intelligence mobile se arch engine that infuses \nsoftware and holographic digital technolog y seamlessly together[,] to create an \nenvironment where your digital device is aliv e and interactive with the consciousness \nof E.R.I.C.A.,” as well as “t he first artificial intelligence to have a personality and a \nreal image.” App. vol. 1, 238. The Term s of Service webpage, under the heading \n“Description of Website Servic es Offered,” states that “ERICA” is “a talking . . . \n[a]rtificial [i]ntelligence[] in teractive search engine.” Id. at 221. These summaries \nmerely describe a technology and do not di rectly connect to th e search services \nprovided in a traditional search box on the homepage of www.my24erica.com. For \none thing, the alleged service mark itself has two, indiscriminately used iterations: \n“E.R.I.C.A.” and “ERICA.”  And perhaps more importan tly, the alleged service \ndescribed on these webpages is aspirational, not definitive.  The “About ERICA” page \nspecifically states that  the application is “[ c]urrently . . . in fu rther development to \nimplement the full vision on mobile and search engines to verbally tell you \ninformation and deliver entertainment news, restaurant reviews, financial updates, \nand so much more.” Id. at 238. These descrip tions do not indicate the source  of any Appellate Case: 22-1402     Document: 010111034400     Date Filed: 04/18/2024     Page: 8 9 \n offered search-engine or personal-assistant services; they simply describe the idea \nbehind an application st ill “in development.” Id.  \nPlaintiffs further argue that the us e of the service mark on the website \nestablished its use in commerce because at the top of the hom epage, there is a line of \ntext just below a search bar that reads “ERICA’S CURRENT MOVIE PICKS”; \nplaintiffs say this “demonstrat [es] [E.R.I.C.A.’s] ability to  provide the customer with \nrecommendations.” App. vol. 7, 1557. But this phrase does not clearly identify or \ndistinguish search-engine or personal-assi stant services. Indeed , the word “ERICA” \nin this title appears in the same font, size, and style as the other descriptive terms. See \n1 J. Thomas McCarthy, McCarthy on Tradem arks and Unfair Competition § 3:4 (5th \ned. Mar. 2024 update) (“Some of the comm on markers of whether a word, phrase[,] \nor picture is being used as a trademark are: larger-sized print, all capita l letters or \ninitial capitals, distinctive or different pr int style, color, and prominent position on \nlabel or in advertising.”); see also  In re Post Properties, Inc. , 227 U.S.P.Q. 334, at *2 \n(T.T.A.B. 1985) (finding “use in the manner of a service mark” in part because mark \nwas “set off distinctively from the text of the ad copy in an extremely large typeface” \nand was “not an ordinary informational statement”); Jaymo’s Sauces LLC v. Wendy’s \nCo., No. 19-cv-01026, 2021 WL 4712685,  at *7 (C.D. Ill. Oct. 8, 2021) \n(unpublished) (“[T]he nonprivileged placeme nt and emphasis on other terms coupled \nwith the comparatively small, plain font of the term fail to  adequately demonstrate it \nis being used as a source i ndicator on the bottle labels.” ). If anything, the phrase \n“ERICA’S CURRENT MOVIE PI CKS”, in matching text , implies that a person Appellate Case: 22-1402     Document: 010111034400     Date Filed: 04/18/2024     Page: 9 10 \n named Erica is curating suggestions and no t that the mark clearly identifies the \nsource of any services. See 2 J. Thomas McCarthy, Mc Carthy on Trademarks and \nUnfair Competition § 13:2 (5th ed. Mar. 202 4 update) (personal names are subject to \ntrademark protection only if their use “ac quire[s] distinctiven ess and secondary \nmeaning”). \nIn a final attempt to demonstrate actual use in commerce, plaintiffs highlight \nevidence showing, in their view , that visitors to the website associat ed the E.R.I.C.A. \nmark with the services being offered. In support, plainti ffs discuss references to “an \nE.R.I.C.A. search engine” in an affida vit from Kim Opler, Underwood’s former \nroommate, App. vol. 5, 1211, and to “E.R.I .C.A. search results”  in testimony from \nTodd Olson, Underwood’s business colleague , App. vol. 3, 509. But neither of these \nstatements mention the placement of the word “ERICA” on the website, nor do they \nsuggest “that any such placement clearly id entified and distinguished the services \noffered on the website.” Aplee.  Br. 33. And what matters here is whether the mark \nwas actually used in commer ce, meaning that it “identi f[ied] [the] goods or services \n. . . provided through or in connection with the website.” Underwood , 996 F.3d at \n1054 (quoting Specht , 747 F.3d at 934). Without testimony about the placement of \nthe mark, we cannot determine if Opler and Olson naturally associated the mark with \nthe services or if they relied on prior knowledge.  \nIn sum, we agree with the district cour t that plaintiffs pr esented no evidence \nthat the E.R.I.C.A. mark, as used on the website, clearly distinguishes the source of \nthe services offered by www.my24erica.com. Pl aintiffs therefore fail to show actual Appellate Case: 22-1402     Document: 010111034400     Date Filed: 04/18/2024     Page: 10 11 \n use in commerce of their mark, meaning th at they cannot establish a protectable \ninterest in their mark as required for their trademark-infringement claim.4 \nConclusion \nWe affirm summary judgment for BofA on plaintiffs’ trademark-infringement \nclaim because plaintiffs cannot  establish actual use of th eir mark prior to BofA’s \npriority date of October 2016.  \nEntered for the Court \n  Nancy L. Moritz Circuit Judge \n \n4 Because we conclude that the dist rict court correctly  awarded summary \njudgment to BofA, we need not separately  address plaintiffs’ argument that the \ndistrict court later erred in denying  their motion for reconsideration.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: The court case involves Concord Music Group, Inc. and others suing Anthropic PBC for copyright infringement, alleging that Anthropic used copyright-protected songs to train its AI tool. The court reviewed a complaint from Anthropic about the sufficiency of the plaintiffs' damages disclosure under Rule 26, deciding that while immediate supplementation of damages disclosures was not warranted at this stage, publishers must update their disclosures with as much detail as possible by the close of fact discovery.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether Plaintiffs have sufficiently disclosed their damages computation under Rule 26(a)(1)(A)(iii) in a case where copyright infringement claims arise from the use of works in training an AI tool.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court denied Anthropic's request for immediate supplementation or exclusion of Plaintiffs’ damages evidence. Instead, it ordered the Publishers to provide a more detailed damages disclosure by the end of fact discovery. It recognized that the novel intersection of copyright law and AI technology requires a pragmatic approach to the disclosure requirements.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine you borrowed someone's recipes without asking and used them to teach a cooking robot. The recipe owner says you owe them money (damages) because you shouldn't have used their recipes without permission. The court says the recipe owner needs to tell you how much money they think you owe and how they figured out that amount. They haven't fully done that yet, but the court gives them more time to get their numbers straight, especially since dealing with robots and recipes is tricky and new.",

No. 430 \n \nBefore the Court is Defendant Anthropic  PBC’s  (“Anthropic”)  complaint regarding the \nsufficiency of Plaintiffs’  (“Publishers”)  damages disclosure pursuant to Rule 26(a)(1)(A)(iii).  Dkt. \n430.  The Court has reviewed the Parties’ submissions, Rule 26, the relevant law and the discovery \nhistory between the Parties.  The Court determines that this matter may be resolved without oral argument.  Civ. L.R. 7- 1(b).  A nthropic’s request for either immediate supplementation or \nexclusion remedies is DENIED .  Publishers  are ORDERED to supplement their damages \ndisclosure as directed herein within seven days of the close of fact discovery .   \nThe Parties and the Court are familiar with the disclosure requirements of Rule 26.  Fed. R. \nCiv. Proc. 26 (a)(1)(A)(iii); See, Dk t. 430.  The advisory notes highlight the goal of litigation \nefficiency , specifically to “accelerate the exchange of basic information ” without unnecessary \npaperwork  as well as to assist parties in making “an informed decision about settlement.”   Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 26(a) advisory committee’s note to 1993 amendment.  The advisory committee further acknowledges that the disclosure obl igations “will not be appropriate for all cases” and leaves \nbroad discretion with the Court as “circumstances warrant.”  Id .  Such is the case at hand.  \nPublishers  assert claims of copyright infringement arising from Anthropic ’s alleged use of \ntheir protected songs in training its Artificial Intelligence (“AI”)  tool.   Assessing damages arising \nfrom i ntellectual property claims in the AI arena calls for the application of established legal Case 5:24-cv-03811-EKL     Document 434     Filed 09/16/25     Page 1 of 3 \n2 1 \n2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 \n10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  principals to a relatively new and rapidly evolving technology.  This assessment is, at least at \npresent, both novel and complex.  As a result, a strict application of Rule 26  requirements for \ndisclosure of even a preliminary computation of damages or methodologies  as demanded by \nDefendant is unwarranted.  Notably, none of the cases relied upon by Defendant address Rule 26 damages disclosures in the AI context, let alone copyright cases arising from the use of AI.  In \nfact, this Court is unaware of any decisions assessing Rule 26(a)(1)(A)(iii)’s damages computation requirement in the AI space.\n1 \nIn its own evaluation of disclosure challenges in this Circuit, in either the copyright or AI \ncontexts, the Court finds a sensible and pragmatic approach  which it applies here.  Publishers’ \ndisclosure obligation is to respond with as much specificity as to the methodology and computation of either statutory or actual damages as is currently available to them.  See Kadrey, 23-cv-3417-VC (TSH), Dkt. 139 at 3-4 (AI context) (an interrogatory that asked Plaintiffs to  \ndescribe their damages, including by “ identif [ying] all bases for such damages or injury, any \nfinancial figures or documents used or references as the basis for computing such damages[ and] methodology for computing such damages,” required Plaintiff to “answer it to the best of their ability with information known to them” when fact discovery did not close for another 20 days );  \nEvox Prods., LLC v. Lemberg L. LLC , No. 21- cv-07875-SSS (AGR), 2023 WL 5504947, at *2 \n(C.D. Cal. July 13, 2023) (general copyright context) (holding that “computation under Rule 26(a)(1) requires some analysis” and Plaintiff was required to supplement its damages disclosures but only “in light of the information currently available to it.” (internal citations and quotation marks omitted));  see also AFL Telecomm . LLC v. SurplusEQ.com Inc., 946 F. Supp. 2d 928, 945 \n(D. Ariz. 2013) (general copyright context). \nHere, whether Publishers have had access to the sampling information necessary for a \ndamages analysis for one month (Publishers, Dkt. 430 at 8, 10) or two months (Anthropic, id. at 2, \n \n1 The nearest case is Kadrey v. Meta Platforms, Inc., an AI -copyright case wherein Plaintiff \nauthors allege that Defendant Meta made un authorized use of their books for the purpose of \ntraining its LLaMA AI model, in which Magistrate Judge Hixson ruled on a dispute involving \nvarious discovery requests, including a damages interrogatory demanding similar information to what Anthropic seeks here.  See 23- cv-3417-VC (TSH), Dkt. 139 at 3-4.

Fact discovery \ncurrently closes in just over a month.  At that time, Publishers must supplement their disclosures to reflect all additional supporting information, including methodologies and computations, then available to them.  It may be that actual computation of certain categories of actual or statutory damages must await expert report s which , again in the context of this novel and complex area of \nlaw, will ultimately satisfy the Rule 26 requirements.  See AFL Telecomm , 946 F. Supp. 2d at  945 \n(D. Ariz. 2013) (general copyright  context) (explaining that Rule 26 disclosures “must be \nsupplemented unless []additional or corrective information has [] otherwise been made known to the other parties during the discovery process or in writing[,]” and in the case where Plaintiff “made additional damages disclosures in writing during the discovery process related to expert opinions,” such expert disclosures satisfied the Rule 26(a)(1)(A)(iii) requirements for summary judgment (internal citations and quotation marks omitted)).   \nAfter the close of fact discovery but before expert disclosures, Defendants  may again seek \nto challenge the sufficiency of Publishers ’ Rule 26 damages disclosure.  Such a challenge may be \nmeritorious but should first be evaluated with the advisory committee’s further admonition in mind:  \n \nThe disclosure requirements should, in short, be applied with common sense in light of the principles of Rule 1, keeping in mind the salutary purposes that the rule is intended to accomplish.  The litigants should not indulge in gamesmanship with respect to the disclosure obligations.   \n Fed. R. Civ.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: This case, involving the discovery phase of a lawsuit related to AI technology, addresses disputes about the scope of electronic searches for relevant documents. The court denied the defendants’ request for the plaintiffs to run broad search terms linked to third-party AI tools and licensing agreements for AI training data, ruling these requests as overly broad and irrelevant to the case needs. The involvement of AI is central to the disputes over what data and documents are relevant to determining issues of fair use and licensing in relation to generative AI models.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: The key legal issue is whether the proposed discovery search terms concerning the plaintiffs' use and knowledge of AI tools, and documents related to licensing agreements for AI training data, are relevant and proportionate to the defendants' fair use defense under U.S. copyright law.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court held that the defendants’ proposed search terms were overly broad and not specifically relevant to the claims of fair use or market impact. The court allowed the defendants to propose a limited number of replacement terms, and required plaintiffs to supplement their discovery responses with a reasonable effort to identify locations where their works are available online.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: In this legal case, one party wanted the other to search through tons of emails and files to find any mention of AI tools like ChatGPT and agreements about using their data for AI training. The judge said the search terms were too broad and would make them look through too much unnecessary stuff. Instead, the judge allowed the party to suggest a few more focused search terms. The case shows how, in a legal dispute, both sides have to find a fair way to get the right information without going overboard.",

No. 176  \n \n \nBefore the Court is the parties’ joint discovery letter brief regarding additional proposed \nsearch terms and Plaintiffs’ allegedly deficient responses to interrogatories.  The Court assumes \nthe parties’ familiarity with the procedural and factual background of the case.  \nDefendants ’ request that Plaintiffs run search terms 1  to 27 is denied .  Defendants’ request \nthat Plaintiffs run search terms 28 to 99 is denied, and in lieu of these search terms, Defendants are \nordered to identify up to ten search terms regarding “licensing agreements for AI training data and \nrelated commentary .”  The parties are ordered to further meet and confer to reach an agreement on \nthe replacement terms.  Plaintiffs are ordered to supplement their responses to Interrogatory \nNo. 11 (No. 14 for Plaintiff Keene).   \nI. Additional Search Terms  \nThe parties agreed on thirty search terms that Plaintiffs would run against their ESI.  \nDefendants now request that Plaintiffs  run an additional ninety -nine search terms .  ECF No. 176 \nat 3.  Defendants ’ proposed additional search terms, attached to the instant discovery brief at \nExhibit A, fall into two categories.  Terms 1 to 27 relate to third -party AI tools (such as \n“ChatGPT!” “Ernie!” “ Claude !”) and terms 28  to 99 relate to licensing agreements (such as \n“Musk! AND (licens! OR train! OR deal! OR agreem! OR data! OR right! OR AI! OR GenAI! Case 3:24-cv-01451-CRB     Document 180     Filed 11/04/25     Page 1 of 7 \n2 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  OR pay! OR contract! OR royalt!).   See ECF No. 176 -1.  Plaintiffs object that terms 1  to 27 are \nirrelevant and overbroad and that terms 28  to 99 are not proportionate  to the needs of the case.   See \nECF No. 176 at 4.   \nA. Terms 1 to 27  \nTerms 1 to 27 “seek documents regarding Plaintiffs’ use of, and commentary about, third -\nparty AI tools.”  ECF No. 176 at 1.  Defendants contend  that terms 1  to 27 seek documents \nrelevant to their fair -use defense, arguing that “Plaintiffs’ use of, and views about, AI tools are \ndirectly relevant to (1) the transformative nature of these technologies, (2) the public benefits they \ndeliver, and (3) Plaintiffs’ theory  that they cause market harm.”   ECF No. 176 at 1.   They also \nargue that the terms are respons ive to their RFP Nos. 16 (seeking documents relating to Plaintiffs’ \nuse of LLMs), 24 (seeking documents concerning the market for copyrighted works in training \nLLMs or other AI technology) and 32 (seeking documents regarding Plaintiffs’ knowledge of the \nuse of their copyrighted works for training LLMs).  Id.; see, e.g. ECF No. 176 -4 at 32 -35 (Plaintiff  \nRebecca Makkai ’s Objections to Defendants ’ First Set of  RFPs).  Plaintiffs argue that their own \nuse of LLMs is irrelevant to Defendants’ fair use defense  and that, in any event, they have already \nproduced documents hitting on the search string “‘ generative ai* ’ OR ‘genai* ’ OR ‘gen ai* ’ OR \n‘artificial intelligence ’ OR ‘ai*’.”  ECF No. 176 at 4.  Without conceding relevance, they argue \nthat this search string has already hit on documents related to their use of third -party LLMs, and \nrunning 27 additional search terms consisting of the names of third -party companies and LLMs \nwould be  redundant.  \nThe Court agrees with Plaintiffs.  Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(b) provides that \n“[p]a rties may obtain discovery regarding any nonprivileged matter that is relevant to any party's \nclaim or defense and proportional to the needs of the case .”  Defendants have not shown that their \nproposed terms are designed to hit on relevant documents.   They contend that terms 1 to 27 will \nhit on documents that are “directly relevant to the first and fourth fair -use factors” of their fair -use \ndefense.  The Copyright Ac t provides that use of a copyrighted work  for purposes considered \n“fair,” such as for “criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, … scholarship, or research, is \nnot an infringement of copyright. ”  17 U.S.C. § 107.  Although fair use is a flexible concept, the Case 3:24-cv-01451-CRB     Document 180     Filed 11/04/25     Page 2 of 7 \n3 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  Copyright Act instructs courts to consider four factors to  assess if an otherwise infringing use is \nfair: \n \n(1) the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use \nis of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes; \n(2) the nature of the copyrighted work; (3) the amount and \nsubstantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work \nas a whole; and  (4) the effect of the use upon the potential market for \nor value of the copyrighted work.    \nId.; Google LLC v. Oracle America, Inc. , 593 U.S. 1, 20 (2021).   The focus of the first factor is “to \nsee … whether the new work merely supersede[s] the objects of the original creation or instead \nadds something new, with a further purpose or different character, altering the first with new \nexpression, meaning, or messa ge.”  Campbell v. Acuff -Rose Music, Inc. , 510 U.S. 569, 579 (1994) \n(quotation marks and citations omitted) ; see Andy Warhol Found. for the Visual Arts, Inc. v. \nGoldsmith , 598 U.S. 508, 528 (2 023).  “[I]t asks, in other words, whether and to what extent the \nnew work is transformative.”   Campbell , 510 U.S. at 579  (quotation marks and citations omitted) .  \nThus, the relevant inquiry under factor one is whether, and to what extent, MosaicML’s  alleged \nuse of Plaintiffs’ works alters or transforms Plaintiffs’ works .  The undersigned does not see, and \nDefendants have not explained , how documents regarding Plaintiffs’ use of or commentary about  \nother  generative AI models would bear on “whether and to what extent” MosaicML’s alleged use \nof Plaintiffs’ works is transformative.  Id.   \nThe fourth factor, considered the most important, “requires courts to consider … the extent \nof market harm caused by the particular actions of the alleged infringer” and “whether unrestricted \nand widespread conduct of the sort engaged in by the defendant ... would result in a substantially \nadverse impact on the potential market for the original.”   Id. (quotation marks omitted).   \nDefendants contend that terms 1 to 27 will allow them to assess “whether any market impact can \nbe traced to the MPT models, which are not generally available, as distinct from generally \navailable AI models.”  ECF No.  176 at 2.   The Court agrees, at a general level, that documents \nshowing the market harm to Plaintiffs caused by  third -party generative AI models could be \nrelevant both to show the impact of “unrestricted and widespread conduct of the sort engaged in \nby the defendant” and to show the impact of Defendants’ versus third parties’ models.  Campbell , Case 3:24-cv-01451-CRB     Document 180     Filed 11/04/25     Page 3 of 7 \n4 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  510 U.S. at 579.  But terms 1 to 27 are not tailored to hit on documents regarding the harm caused \nby third party models but  rather designed to hit on all documents that include the names of certain \nmodels.   This will presumably encompass documents regarding Plaintiffs’ “use of” and opinions \nof these models, which Defendants have not shown are relevant to the fourth factor.  ECF No. 176 \nat 1.  Plaintiffs have already produced documents responsive to the stri ng “‘ generative ai* ’ OR \n‘genai* ’ OR ‘gen ai* ’ OR ‘artificial intelligence ’ OR ‘ai*’.”  Absent a more robust showing of \nrelevanc e, requiring them to run the names of twenty -seven specific generative AI models and \ncompanies against their ESI is disproportionate to the needs of the case.  Defendants ’ request that \nPlaintiffs run terms 1 to 27 is denied.   \nB. Terms 28 to 99  \nTerms 28 to 99 “concern licensing agreements for AI training data and related \ncommentary.”  ECF No. 176 at 2.  The terms generally use the same format: the name of a \npublisher, technology company or CEO involved in generative AI, or news source, in conjunct ion \nwith the string : “(licens! OR train! OR deal! OR agreem! OR data! OR right! OR AI! OR GenAI! \nOR pay! OR contract! OR royalt!) .”  See ECF No. 176 -1.1  Although Plaintiffs do not dispute that \ndocuments regarding licensing of their asserted copyrighted  works are relevant, they argue that \nterms 28  to 99 are overbroad and dis proportionate  to the needs of the case .  They note that they \nhave already collected and produced documents hitting on the parties’ negotiated “search terms \nrelating to agreements with publishers and third parties regarding the asserted works,” and have \nagreed to run the string “ (Licens! OR agree! OR collab! OR partner! OR permiss!) w/10 data! \nAND train! OR ‘training data ’ OR dataset!) ” and produce responsive documents, which they \nrepresent will cover documents “involving seeking or contemplating the use of works as trai ning \ndate for AI.”  ECF No. 176 at 4 n.6.  Plaintiffs contend that terms 28 and 99, which are not \n“connected to Plaintiffs’ asserted works”  or licensing for AI training purposes,  are thus “overbroad \nand duplicative.”  Id. at 4. \n \n1 For example, term 48 is “( (Open! /3 AI!) OR OpenAI!) AND (licens! OR train! OR  deal! OR \nagreem! OR data! OR right! OR AI! OR  GenAI! OR pay! OR contract! OR royalt!) .”  ECF No. \n146-1 at 4.  Term 92 is “ (Le /3 Monde!) AND (licens! OR train! OR deal! OR  agreem! OR data! \nOR right! OR AI! OR GenAI! OR pay!  OR contract! OR royalt!) .”  Id. at 6.  Case 3:24-cv-01451-CRB     Document 180     Filed 11/04/25     Page 4 of 7 \n5 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  The Court agrees that terms 28 to 99 are unreasonably overbroad.  Term 89 is illustrative.  \nThis proposed term is:  “Time! AND (licens! OR train! OR deal! OR agreem! OR data! OR right! \nOR AI! OR GenAI! OR pay! OR contract! OR royalt!) ” and hits on 101,797 unique documents  \nacross the five Plaintiffs.  This presumably encompasses documents pertaining to any \n“agreement,” any “deal,” or any “license” the Plaintiffs have with Time, in no way limited to \ndocuments regarding Plaintiffs’ asserted works or “licensing agreements for AI training data and \nrelated commentary.”   Similarly, term 53 —“author ! AND (licens! OR train! OR deal! OR agreem!  \nOR data! OR right! OR AI! OR GenAI! OR pay! OR  contract! OR royalt!) ”—hitting on 54,431 \nunique documents, is not tailored to hit on relevant and responsive documents .  Requiring \nPlaintiffs to run search terms that will likely hit on tens of thousands of unresponsive and \nirrelevant documents is overly burdensome and not proportional to the needs of the case.  See Fed. \nR. Civ. P. 26 (b).  \nPlaintiffs ask the Court to  deny Defendants’ request for them to run terms 28 to 99, and \ninstead permit Plaintiffs “to run the search terms proposed in their July 17, 2025 proposals \nidentified in Exhibit F.”  ECF No. 176 at 5.  There is no Exhibit F attached to the instant dispute, \nand the Court assumes that Plaintiffs are referring to their proposal at Exhibit E, where they offer \nto run the following search terms: “ (big! /3 tech!) w/4 (license OR licensing OR  licenses OR deal \nOR deals OR agreem! OR  right O R rights) ” and “ Transform! w/4 (license OR licensing OR  \nlicenses OR deal OR deals OR agreem! OR  right OR rights) .”  176 -5 at 2.   The Court declines to \nadopt Plaintiffs proposal and instead orders the following:  \nFirst, if Plaintiffs have not already done so, they must run the string “ (Licens! OR agree! \nOR collab! OR partner! OR permiss!) w/10 data! AND train! OR ‘training data ’ OR dataset!) ” and \nproduce responsive documents  immediately .   \nSecond, i n lieu of terms 28 to 99, by November 6, 2025, Defendants may propose up to  ten \nreplacement search terms designed to hit on documents concerning “licensing agreements for AI \ntraining data and related commentary.”  ECF No. 176 at 2.  If Plaintiffs object to Defendants’ \nproposed terms, they must send their objections to Defendants by November 10, 2025, and, for \neach term they object to they must (1) provide hit counts (using the same format as the parties’ Case 3:24-cv-01451-CRB     Document 180     Filed 11/04/25     Page 5 of 7 \n6 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  Exhibit A)  and (2) identify which portion (s) of the proposed terms generate noise.  The parties \nmust then meet and confer in person or over video conference and engage in a good -faith effort to \nreach an agreement as to the ten search terms.  If the parties are unable to resolve their dispute, \nthey m ay submit a joint status report to the Court, not to exceed five pages, by November 13, \n2025.  The status report must include Defendants’ proposed terms and Plaintiffs’ objections and \nhit reports.  \nII. Response to Interrogatory No. 11 /No. 14  \nIn addition to the search term dispute, Defendants complain that the five Plaintiffs’ \nresponses to Interrogatory No. 11 ( Interrogatory No. 14 for Plaintiff Keene) are deficient.   ECF \nNo. 176 at 2.   Interrogatory No. 11/14 requests that each Plaintiff “identify all locations on the \ninternet, including any websites or data repositories, where any copies of Your Asserted Works, in \nwhole or in part, are or have been available, and for each, state whether  the Work was made \navailable with Your authorization and any steps You have taken to have those copies \nremoved.”   ECF No. 176 -4 at 4 (Interrogatories to Plaintiff Rebecca Makkai).   Plaintiffs argue that \nas the internet includes an estimated 1.2 billion web pages, it is unreasonable for them to identify \nall locations where their works are available .  ECF No. 176 at 4.  They propose identifying  the \n“traditional distribution channels” where their works are available and any takedown requests they \nhave made.   Id. at 5.  Defendants characterize Plaintiffs’ objections as unnecessary hand -waiving \nand clarify that Plaintiffs do not need to “search the entire internet,” but rather just respond “to the \nfullest extent possible” after making a reasonable investigation.   Id.    \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 33(b) requires that interrogatories must be answered \n“fully.”   “In general, a responding party is not required ‘to conduct extensive research in order to \nanswer an interrogatory, but a reasonable effort to respond must be made.’”   Gorrell v. Sneath , \n292 F.R.D. 629, 632 (E.D. Cal. 2013) (quoting Haney v. Saldana , 04-cv-05936, 2010 WL \n3341939, at *3 (E.D. Cal. Sept. 21, 2007) ).  “A party has an obligation to conduct a reasonable \ninquiry into the factual basis of its discovery r esponses. ”  Nat’l Acad. of Recording Arts & Scis., \nInc. v. On Point Events, LP , 256 F.R.D. 678, 680 (C.D. Cal. 2009) .  The Court agrees with \nDefendants that, as Plaintiffs need not “conduct extensive research” to respond to the Case 3:24-cv-01451-CRB     Document 180     Filed 11/04/25     Page 6 of 77 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  interrogatory, Plaintiffs are not required to “scour all locations on the internet and locate every \nsingle webpage where Plaintiffs’ copyrighted works appear.”  Gorrell , 292 F.R.D. at 632 \n(quotation marks omitted) ; ECF No. 176 at 5.  Plaintiffs may satisfy their obligation to fully \nrespond by identifying all locations on the internet where they know their works are available, \nconduct a reasonable and good faith search to identify other locations, identify the “tradit ional \ndistribution channels” containing Plaintiff’s asserted works, and describe all efforts Plaintiffs have \ntaken to remove unauthorized copies.  Plaintiffs must supplement their responses to Interrogatory \nNos. 11/14 by November 12, 2025.    \nIT IS SO ORDERED.  \nDated: November 4, 2025 \nLISA J.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: This court case involves a dispute between Next IT Corporation and a former employee, Joshua Knowles, regarding his access to and use of proprietary information after leaving the company. The case is centered around allegations that Knowles might possess or misuse Next IT's proprietary technology related to artificial intelligence applications. A permanent injunction was agreed upon to prevent him from engaging in activities that would breach this proprietary information.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: The key legal issue involves the protection of trade secrets and proprietary information, specifically concerning the use and potential dissemination of confidential technology-related information that Knowles had access to during his employment at Next IT Corporation.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court approved a stipulated order enjoining Joshua Knowles from disclosing any proprietary information of Next IT indefinitely. Additionally, he is prohibited for three years from engaging in activities that compete with Next IT software applications or involve similar technology, and for one year from recruiting current employees of Next IT. The injunction also includes a mutual non-defamation agreement between the parties.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine you invented a super-secret cupcake recipe that makes your bakery the best in town. You hired someone to help you bake, but they left and might share your secret recipe with other bakeries. To protect your secret, you went to a judge, and they made a rule that your ex-baker can't use or share your recipe. Plus, for three years, they can't work at another place making cupcakes like yours. During this time, they also promised not to say bad things about your bakery. This case is like that, but with complex technology instead of cupcakes.",

The parties have stipulated to entry of this permanentinjunction order.\nSTIPULATION\nOn February 6, 2006 the parties filed a Stipulation (Ct. Rec. 50)\nsetting forth the following agreement between Joshua Knowles and Next IT:Case 2:05-cv-00380-LRS    Document 53    Filed 02/14/061\n23456789\n1011121314151617181920212223242526\nORDER ~ 2As a condition of Next IT’s stipulation to the entry of this Order,\nDefendant Joshua Knowles (“Knowles”) hereby represents that he does notpossess or have access to non-public Next IT computer code or tradesecrets in any written, electronic or other tangible form.  Knowlesfurther represents that he has not conveyed such code or secrets to anythird party and that he has returned any and all such material to NextIT.\nKnowles was employed at Next IT for approximately 11 months, during\nwhich time he acted as lead developer of the Active Sentry project.  Inthat role, he led the architecture, design and development of thetechnical aspects of the product, consulted with other Next IT projectdevelopment teams on other projects, and actively participated in the\nsales demo and market positioning process.  Included in this work waswriting technical diagrams and product specifications, and thedevelopment of source code specific to the Active Sentry project and thedesign and testing of how Active Sentry interacts with Next IT’s core\ntechnology (sometimes called the “Brain”). \nThe Active Sentry source code Mr. Knowles directly wrote was\nstrictly for the server application, and involved XML parsing anddatabase interaction.  Knowles did not directly write any source codewith respect to indexing or  webscraping for Next IT.  Further, Knowles\nassisted in the deployment and installation of Active Sentry for oneclient only, who is not named in this public record, but he didparticipate in many sales presentations and technical reviews withpotential customers.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: In the case of Joseph Lee Jones v. United States Copyright Office and Patents, the plaintiff sought mandamus relief to obtain forms for copyright and patent submissions related to his research on artificial intelligence, but his case was dismissed due to his failure to pay the required filing fee. Despite multiple motions for relief from judgment, the court denied his requests, citing a lack of exceptional circumstances under Rule 60(b). The case involves AI as the plaintiff's submissions were focused on obtaining intellectual property rights for his AI research.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the plaintiff was entitled to relief from the previous dismissal of his case under Rule 60(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure for failure to pay the district court filing fee as a prisoner subject to the \"3-strike\" rule.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court held that the plaintiff did not demonstrate any exceptional circumstances or valid grounds under Rule 60(b) to justify relief from judgment. Consequently, the motions were denied, and the case remained closed.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine you’re playing a game where you have three chances to get a prize, but every time you lose, you get a strike. If you get three strikes, you owe a fee to try again. Joseph Lee Jones tried to get a court to help him with rules for his AI ideas, but he already had three strikes and didn’t pay the fee, so the court said no. He kept asking the court to change its mind, but after many asks, the court said he didn't give a good enough reason to change its decision.",

CASE NO.  15-3098-JWL \n UNITED STATES COPYRIGHT OFFICE AND PATENTS,    Defendant.    \nMEMORANDUM AND ORDER \n  Plaintiff initiated this action seeking mandamus relief on allegations related to his \ninability to obtain copyright and patent forms fo r submitting his published research on artificial \nintelligence, and the lack of any response by the United States Copyright Office to Plaintiff’s \nsubmissions.  Plaintiff subsequent ly expanded his allegations to in clude his inability to obtain or \nfile forms to patent or trademark a “Fractal.”   \n In an order dated January 26, 2016, the Court examined Plaintif f’s litigation history in the \nDistrict of Kansas and found Plaintiff subject to the “3-strike” provision in 28 U.S.C. § 1915(g), \nwhich required Plaintiff to pay the full $400.00 di strict court filing fee in the instant action \nabsent a showing that Plaintiff is under an imminen t danger of serious physical harm if he is not \nallowed to proceed on the claims in his complain t. Finding nothing in Plaintiff’s allegations to \nsuggest such a showing could be made in this case,  the Court denied Plaintiff leave to proceed in \nforma pauperis and directed Pl aintiff to submit the $400.00 dist rict court filing fee to avoid Case 5:15-cv-03098-JWL-DJW   Document 44   Filed 09/25/24   Page 1 of 42 \n dismissal of the complaint based upon Plaintiff’s failure to satisf y the district court filing fee \nrequired by 28 U.S.C. § 1914. \nOn February 9, 2016, the Court liberally cons trued Plaintiff’s “Motion for Relief of \nJudgment” of that “3-strike” order as seeking reconsideration of the non-dispositive order entered on January 26, 2016.  The Court noted th at Plaintiff had not challenged the Court’s \nfinding that Plaintiff was a prisoner as define d by 28 U.S.C. § 1915(h) when he initiated the \ninstant action, and that Plaintiff’s litigation histor y in this Court includes three or more cases \nPlaintiff filed as a prisoner th at are “strikes” within the mean ing of § 1915(g).  Finding nothing \nin Plaintiff’s motion satisfied a ny criteria for reconsideration of a non-dispositive order, the \nCourt denied the motion and granted Plaintiff a limited extension of time to submit the $400.00 \ndistrict court filing fee.  Because Plaintiff did not submit the requir ed payment, the Court \ndismissed this action on February  24, 2016.  (Doc. 32.)  Plaintiff appealed, and his appeal was \ndismissed for lack of prosecution.  (Doc. 37.) \nOn February 22, 2021, Plaintiff filed a motion for relief from judgment (Doc. 39).  The \nCourt entered an Orde r (Doc. 40) denying the motion on Fe bruary 23, 2021.  Now, over three \nyears later, Plaintiff has filed another Motion to Reopen (Doc. 41)  and a motion (Doc. 42) titled a \n“Motion for Relief of Judgment Seeking Mandamus  and also Motion to Revisit Utility Patent \nand Trademark protection for injunctive Relief  upon review of materi als published by Reuters \nWestlaw . . ..”   \nPlaintiff’s motion is treated as a motion filed under Rule 60( b) of the Federal Rules of \nCivil Procedure, seeking relief from  judgment entered in this matter. See Weitz v. Lovelace \nHealth System Inc., 214 F.3d 1175, 1178 (10th Cir. 2000). Rule 60( b) provides in relevant part \nthat: Case 5:15-cv-03098-JWL-DJW   Document 44   Filed 09/25/24   Page 2 of 43 \n On motion and just terms, the court may relieve a party or its legal \nrepresentative from a final judgmen t, order, or proceeding for the \nfollowing reasons: (1) mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect; (2) newly discovered ev idence that, with reasonable \ndiligence, could not have been discovered in time to move for a new trial under Rule 59(b); (3) fraud (whether previously called \nintrinsic or extrinsic), misrepr esentation, or misconduct by an \nopposing party; (4) the judgment is void; (5) the judgment has \nbeen satisfied, released, or discharged; it is based on an earlier judgment that has been reversed  or vacated; or applying it \nprospectively is no longer equitabl e; or (6) any ot her reason that \njustifies relief. \n \nFed. R. Civ. P. 60(b). \nA Rule 60(b) motion provides extraordinary relief which “may only be granted in \nexceptional circumstances.” Amoco Oil Co. v. United States Environmental Protection Agency, \n231 F.3d 694, 697 (10th Cir. 2000). The decision to grant such relief “is extraordinary and may \nonly be granted in exceptional circumstances.” Servants of the Paraclete v. Does, 204 F.3d 1005, \n1009 (10th Cir. 2000) (quot ation marks omitted). \nHaving reviewed the record, the Court denies Plaintiff's motion for re lief from judgment.  \nPlaintiff’s motion is larg ely incomprehensible, but appears to s eek the relief he initially sought in \nthis action and realleges hi s original claims seeki ng copyright and patent fo rms.  Plaintiff alleges \nno grounds for relief under Rule 60 (b) and filed this motion more th an eight years after his case \nwas closed.  The Court finds Plaintiff has failed to show good cause or “exceptional \ncircumstances” warranting relief under Rule 60(b). \nIT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that the Clerk is directed to reopen this case for \npurposes of entering this Memorandum and Order. \nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Plaintiff’s moti ons (Docs. 41, 42) are denied. \nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the Clerk is direct ed to close this case.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: Joseph Lee Jones initiated a court case to seek mandamus relief related to difficulties in obtaining copyright and patent forms for his published research on artificial intelligence (AI) and his ability to file forms for patent or trademark a “Fractal.” The court dismissed his case, invoking the \"3-strike\" rule which prevents prisoners with multiple dismissals from filing new claims unless under imminent danger of serious harm. Jones later filed a motion seeking relief from the judgment, which was denied due to lack of new grounds and untimeliness.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the plaintiff, who is subjected to the \"3-strike\" rule, can be relieved from the requirement to pay the full district court filing fee based on his claims related to obtaining forms for copyright and patent purposes.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court denied the plaintiff's motion for relief from judgment under Rule 60(b), finding no grounds for relief, lack of exceptional circumstances, and the motion being untimely.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Joseph Lee Jones wanted the court to help him get forms to protect his ideas about AI, but because he had lost too many court cases already, the court wouldn't let him proceed without paying a fee. He tried to get the decision changed, saying he should be able to proceed without paying because the original decision was wrong, but the court said no again because he didn’t show there was any mistake or new evidence and he waited too long to ask.",

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: The plaintiff, Kay C. Robinson, Jr., brought a lawsuit against the Global Semiconductor Alliance (GSA), where Robinson alleged that unnamed entities are utilizing Robinson's patented Fiber-Optic Connected Logic (FOCL) to run various AI programs. The court granted Robinson permission to proceed without prepayment of costs but dismissed the complaint for failing to state a claim. The case highlights the involvement of AI as Robinson's patent is allegedly used to support AI programs without proper authorization.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether Robinson's complaint provides sufficient factual details to plausibly suggest that GSA or any other specified party is infringing on Robinson's patented technology.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court dismissed Robinson's complaint without prejudice, determining that Robinson failed to specify any actionable claim against the named defendant, GSA, based on the allegations provided.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine someone invents a cool piece of technology and gets it patented. This person, Robinson, believes others are using this tech without permission, especially to run AI programs, and sues an organization, the GSA. However, when telling their story to the judge, Robinson doesn't provide enough details showing exactly what GSA did wrong. Because of that, the judge says Robinson can try again later but dismisses the case for now.",

Jonathan J.C. Grey  \nv.        \n         Global Semiconductor Alliance (GSA) , \n \n Defendant.  \n_________________________________/  \nOPINION AND ORDER GRANTING APPLICATION TO \nPROCEED WITHOUT PREPAYING FEES OR COSTS AND \nDISMISSING COMPLAINT \nPro se plaintiff Kay C. Robinson, Jr. filed this case against Global \nSemiconductor Alliance (GSA)  on July 10, 2024 . (ECF No. 1.)  Robinson \nalleges that vari ous unnamed parties are pooling funds for the \ndefendant’s benefit  by using  Robinson’s  patented Fiber -Optic Connected \nLogic (FOCL); specifically, that  “various semiconductor manufacturing \ncompanies for the purpose of optical and photonic computing” are using \nit to run dozens of artificial intelligence (AI) programs.  \nFor the following reasons, the Court GRANTS  Robinson’s \napplication to proceed without prepaying fees and costs and \nDISMISSES the complaint under 28 U.S.C. § 1915(e)(2) . Case 2:24-cv-11786-JJCG-DRG   ECF No. 6, PageID.<pageID>   Filed 09/12/24   Page 1 of 52 \n I. Factual Background  \nIn the complaint , Robinson alleges th e following. In early 2019, \nRobinson posted a link to the patent (Patent No. US 11,108,397 B2)  \n(the Patent)  on Facebook and LinkedIn with the hopes of encouraging \nfuture sales. Robinson claims that unidentified parties planned to  use \nthis IP after seeing  the post. At that  time, Robinson  was still going \nthrough the examination phase and the P atent had not yet been \ngranted. Soon after the posts, Robinson came across an article about \nresearch being conducted in Finland that was similar to the  Patent.  \n Robinson was granted the  Patent in late 2021 . Soon after \nbeing granted the  Patent, Robinson contra cted with a broker, \nBankOnIP, to market it. Robinson, after conducting  research, \nidentified ChatGPT and other AI programs that were being run on the \noptical computing hardware  Robinson patented . Robinson concludes \nthat while unspecified parties are neither selling the P atent nor \nmaking a profit from direct usage, the Patent is being used to “run \ncloud programs” that do make a profit.  \nII. Legal Standard  \nUnder 28 U.S.C. § 1915, the Court may allow a person to proceed \nwithout prepayment of fees or costs, i.e., in forma pauperis. However, the Case 2:24-cv-11786-JJCG-DRG   ECF No. 6, PageID.<pageID>   Filed 09/12/24   Page 2 of 53 \n Court is required to review each case for summary dismissal if the action \nis frivolous, malicious, fails to state a c laim on which relief may be \ngranted, or seeks monetary relief against a defendant who is immune from such relief. 28 U.S.C. § 1915(e)(2).  \nIII.  Analysis  \nThe Court finds that Robinson is unable to pay the filing fee ( see \nECF No. 2) and GRANTS  Robinson’ s application to proceed in forma \npauperis under 28 U.S.C. § 1915. However, the Court also finds that \nRobinson’s  complaint fails to state a claim upon which relief can be \ngranted.  \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 8 requires only a short and plain \nstatement of the claim that shows the plaintiff is entitled to relief. Bell \nAtlantic Corp. v. Twombly , 550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007).  The plaintiff has a \nduty to provide fair notice of what the c laim is and what the grounds for \nthe claim are. Id. That is, the plaintiff must state enough factual matter, \nwhich the Court accepts as true, to plausibly suggest the defendant is \nliable for its actions. Id. The plaintiff must provide more than label s, \nconclusions, or bald legal assertions. Id. Case 2:24-cv-11786-JJCG-DRG   ECF No. 6, PageID.<pageID>   Filed 09/12/24   Page 3 of 54 \n Here, Robinson does not offer fair notice of what the claims are \nagainst the defendant. Robinson  does not specify any instances of the \ndefendant using the P atent in an unauthorized manner. The defendant \nallegedly “gives out funding to various universities and organizations for \nsemiconductor research.” It is unclear how the aforementioned conduct \nviolates Robinson’s patent. While Robinson makes several  vague  \nallegations of possible patent infringement against un named  parties , \nRobinson does not specify what claims are being brought  against the only \nnamed defendant, GSA.  Therefore, Robinson’s claims do not meet the \npleading requirements. Twombly , 550 U.S. at 555.  Robinson’s claims are \nDISMISSED WITHOUT PREJUDICE.  IV.  Conclusion  \nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court  GRANTS Robinson’s \napplication to proceed without prepaying and DISMISSES WITHOUT \nPREJUDICE this action against the defendant. \nSO ORDERED.  \ns/ Jonathan J.C.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**:\n   Duckweed, USA, Inc. sued Edward Abraham and several other defendants for patent infringement, among other claims. The court granted in part and denied in part Abraham's motion to dismiss. Notably, Duckweed claimed its licensed technology involved an essential \"artificial intelligence\" component necessary for operating certain clean-energy systems, and the court found Duckweed had standing to sue for patent infringement as it was granted an exclusive license, even though the alleged infringer was the original patent owner.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**:\n   The main legal issue was whether Duckweed had standing to sue for patent infringement, given its relationship with the patent owner Behrens and the scope of its licensing agreement.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**:\n   The court held that Duckweed had standing to bring a patent infringement claim because it was granted an exclusive license under the patent, falling within an exception since the patentee was the alleged infringer and therefore unable to sue himself. However, the court dismissed Duckweed’s claim for civil conspiracy to breach the license agreement, as it requires an underlying tort rather than a mere breach of contract.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**:\n   Imagine you borrow a special toy, and you have a promise from the owner that you're the only one allowed to play with it. If someone else plays with it, you get to tell on them. In this case, Duckweed borrowed a \"toy\" (a technology protected by a patent) and was promised nobody else could use it but them. When people used the technology without asking, Duckweed told the court. The court said, \"You can tell on them because you were the only one allowed to use it.\" But when trying to claim someone else conspired to break a promise to them without any deeper wrong, the court said, “Just because someone breaks a promise, doesn’t mean you can sue them for conspiracy; you need more than just a broken promise.”",

MARCH  30, 2016 \n \n Presently before this Court is Defendant, Edward Abraham’s (“Abraham”) Motion to \nDismiss, the Response in Opposition filed by Plaintiff, Duckweed, USA, I nc. (“Duckweed”), and \nthe supplemental briefing submitted by the parties regarding Duckweed’s standing to sue for \npatent infringement.  For the reasons set forth below, Abraham’s Motion is granted in part and denied in part.    \nI.   PROCEDURAL HISTORY \n On September 30, 2015, Duckweed initiated this action by f iling a Complaint  \nagainst Rudolph Behrens ( “Behrens”), Abraham, Joseph Kearney (“Kearney”), and B.E.A.R.  \nOceanics (“ BEAR” ) (collectively referred to  as “Defendants”).  Duckweed’s Complaint sets \nforth the following causes of action: Patent  Infringement (C ount I) against Defendants; Breach of \nLicense Agreement (Count II) against  Behrens; Tortious Interference with Existing Contract \n(Count III) against Kearney and Abraham; Aiding and Abetting Breach of License Agreement Case 2:15-cv-05387-RK   Document 35   Filed 03/30/16   Page 1 of 122 \n (Count IV) against Kearney and Abraham ; Civil Conspiracy to Breach the License Agreement \n(Count V) against Defendants; Breach of  Fiduciary Duty (Count VI) against Behrens; Aiding \nand Abetting Breach of Fiduciary Duty  (Count VII) against Kearney and Abraham; Civil \nConspiracy to Breach the Licen se Agreement  (Count VIII) against Defendants;1 and Promissory \nEstoppel (Count IX) against Behrens.2  See Compl.  \n  On or about October 7, 2015, Plaintiff filed a Motion for Preliminary Injunction against  \nDefendants.3  (Doc. No. 7.)  Default was entered against Behrens and BEAR on October 21,  \n2015, and Kearney on January 18, 2016.  On November 10, 2015, Abraham moved to dismiss  \nthe claims against him pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), and Duckweed fi led \na response in opposition on December 4, 2015.4  (Doc. Nos. 15, 18.)   We raised the issue of \nDuckweed’s standing to bring a claim for patent infringement on its own, and ordered \nsupplemental briefing .  (Doc. No. 19.)  Both parties filed  supplemental bri efing, which is part of \nthe record reviewed, with Duckweed asserting that it has standing and Abraham arguing that it \ndoes not.   (Doc. Nos. 22, 23.)   \n \n                                                           \n1Duckweed states that “Count VIII was incorrectly captioned Civil Conspiracy to Breach the License Agreement.  \nAs Abraham acknowledges, the allegations in Count VIII make clear that the claim is for conspiracy to breach \nfiduciary duties.”  (Pl.’s Mem. Law O pp’n Def.’s Mot. to Dismiss at 9 n.1.)  For clarity, we will refer to Count VIII \nas a claim for conspiracy to breach fiduciary duties throughout this Memorandum Opinion.   \n \n2The Court has diversity jurisdiction over this action since the parties are divers e and the amount in controversy \nexceeds $75,000.  28 U.S.C. § 1332.  The parties agree that Pennsylvania law applies to the state law claims.  See  \nRedmond v. ACE Am . Ins. Co., No. 14 –3864, 2015 WL 3514690, at *1 n.2 (3d Cir. June 5, 2015) (declining to \nundertake a choice of law analysis since both parties agreed that New York law applied).  \n \n3A Preliminary Injunction hearing was set for October 27, 2015; however, the Court was informed by Duckweed \nthat it was unnecessary.  (Doc. No. 9.)  Duckweed’s Petition for Preliminary Injunction remains outstanding.   \n \n4To decide a motion to dismiss, court s consider only the allegations contained in the complaint, exhibits attached to \nthe complaint, matters of public record, and where appropriate and necessary “an undisputedly authentic document \nthat a defendant attaches as an exhibit to a motion to dismiss  if the plaintiff’ s claims are based on the document.” \nPension Ben. Guar. Corp. v. White Consol. Indus., Inc. , 998 F.2d 1192, 1196 (3d  Cir. 1993).   Although Duckweed \nhas included documents outside of those permissible to be considered when deciding a motion to dismiss, we  did not \nconsider evidence outside of the pleadings, and we decline  to convert  Abraham’s Motion to D ismiss into one for \nsummary judgment  because we find that conversion is not appropriate at this juncture.  Case 2:15-cv-05387-RK   Document 35   Filed 03/30/16   Page 2 of 123 \n II.   FACTS   \n Duckweed’s Complaint contains a multitude of factual allegations against the four named  \nDefendants.   In the interest of efficiency, we will primarily focus upon the factual allegations  \ncontained in the Complaint pertaining to  Abraham.   In November 2012, Duckweed was allegedly  \nformed to develop and market emerging aquatic biomass clean -energy technologies.   Compl.  \n¶ 14.  On  July 6, 2010 , the patent -in-suit, United  States  Patent  No. 7,750,494 BI (the  \n“494 Patent”), titled “Systems and Vessels for Producing Hydrocarbons and/or Water, and \nMethods for Same,” was issued by the United States Patent  and Trademark Office.  Id. ¶ 11. \nBehrens is listed in the 494 Patent as an “inventor” and as the “assignee.”  Id. ¶ 27.  Certain \nprocesses and technologies covered in the Patent (which Duckweed calls Hydrodynamic Reformation, or “HDR”) can produce a cost effective, clean, and renewable petroleum oil substitute from algae, waste water or vegetable oils.  Id. ¶¶ 14 -16.  Through a document entitled \n“Resolution,”  which was signed by Behrens, Michael Rigolizzo  (“Rigolizzo”), Duckweed’s \nPresident and CEO , and S tephany Longo (“Longo”) , Duckweed’s Vice -President and Secretary, \nDuckweed alleges that Behrens gave it “an exclusive license to develop, market  and license \ncommercial synfuel feedstock facility(s), utilizing the patented processes and  technologies in the \n494 Patent.”  Id. \n¶¶ 28 -29.  \n According to the Complaint, since Duckweed obtained the l icense, its primary focus has \nbeen to develop and construct a commercial  synfuel feedstock facility at a site in Winslow \nTownship, New Jersey (the “Winslow Project”), an d a facility at the Sparta Waste Water \nTreatment facility in Sparta, Georgia (the “Sparta Project”) featuring the HDR process.  Id. ¶ 31.  \nIn addition, Duckweed  developed a relationship with Rutgers University’ s “Aquaculture Case 2:15-cv-05387-RK   Document 35   Filed 03/30/16   Page 3 of 124 \n Innovation Center for Environm ent and Natural Resources, ” in Cape May, New Jersey, and for \nthe past year has been developing an d constructing a demonstration site at the Rutgers Center to \nshow the HDR process in continuous operation to investors (the “Rutgers Project”).  Id.  The \nRutge rs Project is critical to Duckweed’s efforts to attract the investment funding that is needed \nto construct and operate the Winslow and Sparta Projects.  Id.    \n Duckweed began to lay out the demonstration site for the Rutgers Project and push for \nfunding in January 2015.  Id. ¶ 45.  Rigolizzo  was introduced to Kearney, who informed \nRigolizzo that he had many contacts in the investing community and could assist with Duckweed \nattract ing funding.  Id. ¶ 46.  Kearney set up a meeting between Rigolizzo and Abraham , the \nresult of which was that, in March, 2015, Abraham (through his company EPA Marketing Management, Inc.)  loaned Duckweed $45,500 to “construct[] a prototype of the Linear Venturi \nKinetic Nozzle Sy nfuel Production System” for the Rutgers Project.  Id. ¶ 49.  Duckweed went \nto work immediately and, by June 17, 2015, the demonstration units for the Rutgers Project w ere \nconstructed and ready to be made operational.  Id. ¶ 51.  All that was needed was for Behrens to \ndeliver critical pump/nozzle assemblies  and the  “artificial intelligence” needed to operate them.  \nId.     \n On June 19, 2015, Rigolizzo and Longo each received an email from Behrens stating that \nhe was “withdrawing from [D uckweed]” and “nulli fying” the license.  Id. ¶ 54.  Behrens went on \nto claim that BEAR , not Duckweed, had made the agreement with Rutgers to demonstrate its \n(BEAR’s) “patented technologies” - i.e., the technologies that Duckweed h as an exclusive \nlicense to commercialize  - to “the world.”  Id. ¶ 54.  Upon information and belief, Abraham and \nKearney, together with Behrens, are principals in BEAR.  Id. ¶ 6. Case 2:15-cv-05387-RK   Document 35   Filed 03/30/16   Page 4 of 125 \n  Following Behrens ’ email, Behrens and Kearney (acting on his own b ehalf and on behalf \nof Abraham) each communicated on mult iple occasions by email and by telephone with \nDuckweed investors James McMonagle and Frank Marx to, among other things: (i) disparage \nRigolizzo, calling him a liar and a thief, (ii) make clear that, together with Abraham, they would \ninstall the pump and nozzle assemblies and artificial intelligence  - which Behrens has withheld \nand refused to deliver to D uckweed -  in order to make the Rutgers s ite operational and present it \n“to the world”  as a BEAR project; (iii) make clear that, together with Abraham, they intended to \npursue the Sparta, Georgia opportunity through BEAR once the Rutgers site was operational; and (iv) solicit D uckweed’s investors away from Duckweed .  Id. ¶ 58.  Moreover, on September 4, \n2015, Rigolizzo received  a call from Abraham, who confirmed the alliance bet ween himself and \nBehrens by bragging that the algae tanks at the Rutgers site had been filled and were growing algae, that the LVKN pump and nozzle assemblies were about to be installed, and that the demonstration units would then be fully operational.  Id. ¶ 59.  \nIII.   DISCUSSION  \n A.  Standing  \n In addition to Article III standing, Duckweed must also possess standing as defined by   \n§ 281 of the Patent Act.5  See Alps S., LLC v. Ohio Willow Wood Co., 787 F.3d 1379, 1382 \n(Fed. Cir.  2015 ), cert. denied, 136 S. Ct. 897 (2016) .  “Under 35 U.S.C. § 281, a ‘patentee’  has \nstanding to pursue a patent infringement action.”  Id. (citing H.R. Techs., Inc. v. Astechnologies, \nInc., 275 F.3d 1378, 1384 (Fed. Cir.  2002) ).  “The word ‘ patentee ’ is not limited to the person to \nwhom the pa tent issued, but also includes ‘ successors in title to the patentee. ’”  Id. (citing 35 \nU.S.C. § 100(d) ).   \n                                                           \n5“Standing must be present at  the time the suit is brought.”  Sicom Sys., Ltd. v. Agilent Techs., Inc. , 427 F.3d 971, \n975– 76 (Fed. Cir. 2005).  The party “bringing the action bears the burden of establishing that it has standing.”  Id.  at \n976.   Case 2:15-cv-05387-RK   Document 35   Filed 03/30/16   Page 5 of 126 \n  “In addition to the patent owner, [Federal Circuit]  case law provides that ‘ [a]n exclusive \nlicensee has standing to sue in its own name, without joining the patent holder where all \nsubstantial rights  in the patent are transferred. ’”  Id. (quoting Int’l Gamco, Inc. v. Multimedia \nGames, Inc. , 504 F.3d 1273, 1276 (Fed. Cir.  2007) ).  In the case where a patent owner tra nsfers \nall substantial rights, the transferee is treated as the patentee and has standing to sue in its own name.   Id. (citing Propat Int’l Corp. v. Rpost, Inc., 473 F.3d 1187, 1189 (Fed. Cir.  2007); Int’l \nGamco , 504 F.3d at 1276 (observing that a  licensee with all substantial rights “is effectively an \nassignee”); Speedplay, Inc. v. Bebop, Inc., 211 F.3d 1245, 1250 (Fed. Cir.  2000) (explaining that \nan entity “that has been granted all substantial rights under the patent is considered the owner regardless of how the parties characterize the transaction that conveyed those rights.”) )  “If, \nhowever, the transferee or licensee does not hold all substantial rights, it may ‘ sue third parties \nonly as a co -plaintiff with the patentee. ’”  Id. at 1382- 83 (quoting Mentor H/S, Inc. v. Med. \nDevice Alliance, Inc. , 240 F.3d 1016, 1017 (Fed. Cir. 2001) ). \n “At least one exception to that rule exists, however: an exclusive licensee that does not \nhave all substantial rights does have standi ng to sue in his own name whe n ‘necessary to prevent \nan absolute failure of justice, as where the patentee is the infringer, and cannot sue himself.’ ”  \nTextile Prods., Inc. v. Mead Corp., 134 F.3d 1481, 1484 (Fed. Cir. 1998)  (quoting Waterman v. \nMackenzie, 138 U.S. 252, 255 (1891); ci ting Littlefield v. Perry , 88 U.S. (21 Wall.) 205, 223 \n(1874) (holding that plaintiff was an assignee, but stating that even if he were an exclusive \nlicensee, he could bring suit in his own name, because the patentee was the infringer); Ortho \nPharm. Corp. v. Genetics Inst., Inc., 52 F.3d 1026, 1030 (Fed.  Cir. 1995) ).  “On the other hand, a \nbare licensee has no standing at all. ”  Id. (citing Rite -Hite Corp. v. Kelley Co., 56 F.3d 1538, \n1552 (Fed. Cir. 1995)  (bare licensees have no standing); Ortho , 52 F.3d a t 1034) . Case 2:15-cv-05387-RK   Document 35   Filed 03/30/16   Page 6 of 127 \n  “Determining whether a licensee is an exclusive licensee or a bare licensee is a question \nof ascertaining the intent of the parties to the license as manifested by the terms of their \nagreement and examining the substance of the grant.”  Id. (citing Ortho , 52 F.3d at 1033–34) .  \n“The use of the word ‘ exclusive’  is not controlling; what matters is the substance of the \narrangement. ”  Id. (citing Ortho , 52 F.3d at 1032).  “ Becau se patent rights are rights to ‘exclude \nothers,’  see 35 U.S.C. § 154(a)(1), a licensee is an exclusive licensee only if the patentee has \npromised, expressly or impliedly, that ‘ others shall be excluded  from practicing the invention’  \nwithin the field covered by the license.”  Id. (quoting Rite –Hite , 56 F.3d at 1552) .  “Put another  \nway, an exclusive license is ‘ a license to practice the invention .  . . accompanied by the patent \nowner’ s promise that others shall be excluded from practicing it within the field of use wherein \nthe licensee is given leave. ’”  Id. (quoting W. Elec. Co. v. Pacent Reproducer Corp., 42 F.2d 116, \n118 (2d Cir. 1930) ).  Therefore, licensees under that patent are not exclusive licensees if a \npatentee- licensor is free to grant licenses to others .  Id.   \n Here, Behrens is the undisputed owner of the 494 Patent, and he has not made any \nassignment.  Relying upon the Resolution, D uckweed asserts that it is an exclusive licensee with \nall substantial rights under the 494 Patent and, therefore, has standing  to sue for patent \ninfringement.  We conclude that Duck weed does not have an exclusive license with all \nsubstantial rights under the 494 Patent.  Behrens has retained a significant amount of interest in the 494 Patent and has  clearly not relinquished all substantial rights under the P atent.  Invoking \nthe excep tion outlined above , Duckweed asserts that it has standi ng to sue in his own name as an \nexclusive licensee to prevent an absolute failure of justice  since Behrens, who is the patentee, is \nthe alleged infringer, and cannot sue himself .  Abraham argues that Duckweed lacks standing \nbecause the Resolution did not grant  Duckweed an exclusive license, but only granted a bare Case 2:15-cv-05387-RK   Document 35   Filed 03/30/16   Page 7 of 128 \n license.  Based upon all of the arguments, and the Resolution itself, we conclude that Duckweed \nhas standing to sue beca use it falls under the exception outlined above. \n The following t wo sections of the Resolution are relevant to the determination of whether \nDuckweed was granted an exclusive license or a bare license:  \n7.)       It was further agreed that Rudolph Behrens wi ll contribute his professional \n expertise and patented process of turning aquatic biomass  into vegetable \n oil that can be sold to refineries to make Biodiesel fuel and related \n products, referred to as ‘ SF-1: Land -Based  Synfuel Production System.’  \n \n8.)       It was further agreed that Duckweed USA will exclusively  develop, market \n and license commercial synfuel feedstock facility(s) , utilizing the  ‘SF-1: \n Land -Based Synfuel Production Syste m.’ \n \nSee Compl ., Ex. B (Resolution)  ¶¶ 7, 8.  Based upon the Resolution, A braham asserts that, “at \nbest, a bare license was conveyed and rights to manufacture and build facilities.”  ( See Def.’s \nSuppl Br. on Standing at 8.)  However, we find that the Resolution conveys more.   \n It is clear from the Resolution that Duckweed was granted the exclusive right to develop, \nmarket a nd license commercial synfuel feedst ock facility(s)  utilizing the SF -1:Land- Based \nSynfuel Production System.  See Compl ., Ex. B ¶ 8.  Significantly, Behrens gave Duckweed the \nexclusive right to license commercial synfuel feedst ock facility(s)  utilizing the SF -1:Land- Based \nSynfuel Production System.  Id.  “To qualify as an exclusive license, an agreement must clearly \nmanifest the patentee’s promise to refrain from granting anyone else a license in the area of \nexclusivity.”  Textile , 134 F.3d at 1484.  The Resolution between Behrens and Duckweed clearly \nmanif ests a promise by Behrens to do so.  Not only does the Resolution clearly manifest \nBehrens’ promise to refrain from granting anyone else a license in the area of exclusivity, but it gives Duckweed  itself the exclusive right to license commercial synfuel fe edstock facility(s) \nutilizing the SF -1:Land -Based Synfuel Production System .  As discussed, licensees under a \npatent are not exclusive licensees if a patentee- licensor is free to grant licenses to others .  See Case 2:15-cv-05387-RK   Document 35   Filed 03/30/16   Page 8 of 129 \n supra p. 7 (citing Textile , 134 F.3d at 1484).  This is clearly not the case here as Duckweed is \ngranted the exclusive right to grant licenses to others, not Behrens .   \n Not only did Duckweed receive the right to practice the inventio n within a given \nterritory, but, significantly, it also received Behrens’ explicit promise that others shall be \nexcluded from practicing the invention within that territory as well.   Since Duckweed received \nan express promise of exclusivity under the patent, i.e., the right to exclude others from making, \nusing, or selling the patented invention, it has received an exclusive license.  It has received more than Behrens’ promise that it will not be sued for infringement , i.e., a “bare license.”   \nAccordingly, we find that Duckweed h as an exclusive license and its case falls under  the \nexception allowing a n exclusive licensee that does not have all substantial rights  to have standing \nto sue in its own name when “necessary to prevent an absolute failure of justice, as where the patentee is the infringer, and cannot sue himself .”  See Textile , 134 F.3d at 1484 (citing \nWaterman , 138 U.S. at 255; Littlefield , 88 U.S. (21 Wall.) at 223).   Consequently, Duckweed has \nstanding to sue for patent infringement of the 494 Patent.    \n B.  Motion T o Dismiss  \n 1.  Count V – Civil Conspiracy to Breach License Agreement  \n In Pennsylvania, “a civil conspiracy claim . . . requires an underlying tort.”  Alpart v. \nGen. Land Partners , 574 F. Supp. 2d 491, 507 (E.D. Pa. 2008) (citing Boyanowski v. Capital \nArea Intermediate Unit , 215 F.3d 396, 405 (3d Cir . 2000)  (explaining that, as a predicate to \nliability for civil conspiracy, a complaint must allege a distinct underlying tort) ).  “[A] b reach of \ncontract, without more, is not a tort.”  Id. at p. 507 n.18 (citing W insor Sec., Inc. v. Hartford Lif e \nIns. Co., 986 F.2d 655, 664 (3d Cir. 1993)).  “Because a claim for civil  conspiracy can only exist \nwith ‘a finding that the under lying tort has occurred,’  Boyanowski , 215 F.3d at 405, the claim  for Case 2:15-cv-05387-RK   Document 35   Filed 03/30/16   Page 9 of 1210 \n civil conspiracy cannot be based on a breach of contract.”  Id.  Thus, Duckweed’s claim of civil \nconspiracy based upon the alleged breach of the license agreement i s dismissed.6   \n 2.  Remaining Counts  \n When reviewing a Complaint for purposes of a Motion to Dismiss, the Court must \n“accept all factual allegations as tr ue [and] construe the Complaint in the light mos t favorable to \nthe Plaintiff.”  DelRio -Mocci v. Connolly Props., Inc. , 672 F.3d 241, 245 (3d Cir. 2012) (citing \nWarren Gen. Hosp. v. Amgen, Inc., 643 F.3d 77, 83 (3d Cir. 2011)).  “A motion to dismiss \npursuant to 12(b)(6) may be granted ‘only if, accepting all well -pleaded allegations in the \ncomplaint as true and viewing them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, a court finds that \nplaintiff’s claims lack facial plausibility.’”   Id. (quoting War ren, 643 F.3 at 84). \n The majority of Abraham’s arguments for dismissal center upon the assertion that \nDuckweed merely cites a series of conclusory statements devoid of any factual support.  ( See \nDef.’s Mem. Law Support Mot. to Dismiss.)  However, we note that Duckweed has, indeed, included factual support within its Complaint to support its claims against Abraham.  Specifically, we note that Duckweed asserts that, upon information and belief, Abraham and Kearney, together with Behrens, are pr incipals in BEAR.  Compl . ¶ 6.  The Complaint further \nalleges that, on June 19, 2015, Rigolizzo and Longo each received an email from Behrens stating that he was “withdrawing fr om [Duckweed]” and “nullifying” the l icense.  Id.  ¶ 54.  Behrens  \nwent on to claim that BEAR , not Duckweed, had made the agreement with Rutgers to \n                                                           \n6Duckweed asserts that “it is well -settled that patent infringement is tortious conduct.”  (Pl.’s Resp . Opp’n Def.’s \nMot. to Dismiss at 13.)  It a sserts that its  civil conspiracy claim survives dismissal because “the breach of the \nLicense is inextricably  intertwined with infringement of the 494  Patent, assuming, arguendo, that a civil conspiracy  \nclaim . . . must be founded upon underlying tortious conduct, Count . . . V. . . [has] such  foundation.”  ( Id.)  We only \naddress what is before us contained within the Complaint, which is a civil conspir acy claim based upon a breach of \nlicense agreement.  As discussed above, pursuant to Pennsylvania law, we will dismiss Count V for failure to state a \nclaim.  Case 2:15-cv-05387-RK   Document 35   Filed 03/30/16   Page 10 of 1211 \n demonstrate its (BEAR’s) “patented technologies”  - i.e., the technologies that Duckweed has an \nexclusive license to commercialize -  to “the world.”  Id. ¶ 54.  \n Duckweed further alleges in its Complaint that after Behrens’ email, Behrens and \nKearney (acting on his own behalf and on behalf of Abraham) each communicated on multiple \noccasions by email and by telephone with Duckweed investors James McMonagle and Frank Marx to, among other  things: (i) disparage Rigolizzo, calling him a liar and a thief, (ii) make clear that, together with Abraham, they would install the pump and nozzle assemblies and artificial intelligence  - which Behrens has withheld and refused to deliver to Duckweed -  in order \nto make the Rutgers s ite operational and present it “to the world”  as a BEAR project; (iii) make \nclear that, together with Abraham, they intended to pursue the Sparta, Georgia opportunity through BEAR once the Rutgers site was oper ation al; and (iv) solicit Duckweed’s investors \naway from Duckweed.  Id. ¶ 58.  Additiona lly, the Complaint alleges that, on September 4, 2015, \nRigolizzo received a call from Abraham, who confirmed the alliance between himself and Behrens by bragging that the al gae tanks at the Rutgers site had been filled and were growing \nalgae, that the LVKN pump and nozzle assemblies were about to be installed, and that the demonstration units would then be fully operational.  Id. ¶ 59.   \n Accepting all of the pertinen t allega tions in the Complaint a s true , and viewing them in \nthe light most favorable to Duckweed, it is clear that Duckweed has set forth factual averments that Abraham has taken more action in this case than solely providing Duckweed w ith funding \nper their agreem ent.  As such, at this early stage of the litigation, Duckweed’s claims against \nAbraham; namely, Patent Infringement (Count I); Tortious Interference with Existing Contract (Count III);  Aiding and Abetting Breach of Fiduciary Duty (Count VII); and  Civil C onspiracy to Case 2:15-cv-05387-RK   Document 35   Filed 03/30/16   Page 11 of 1212 \n Breach Fiduciary Duties (Count VIII)  have facial plausibility.  Consequently, Abraham’s Motion \nto Dismiss is denied regarding  the aforementioned claims .    \n Regarding its claim for Aiding and Abetting Breach of License Agreement (Count IV), \nDuckweed  does not object its dismissal “ since Count IV of the Complaint, for aiding and \nabetting breach of the License, is not materially different than Count III.”  (P l.’s Resp. Opp’n \nDef.’s Mot. to Dismiss at 12 n.3.)  As a result, we grant Abraham’s Mot ion to Dismiss regarding \nCount IV - Aiding and Abetting Breach of License Agreement.  It is dismissed f rom t he \nComplaint.   \nIV. CONCLUSION \n Duckweed has standing to bring Count I – Patent Infringement.  Duckweed’s civil \nconspiracy claim based upon the alleged breach of the license agreement in Count V i s dismissed  \nfor failure to state a claim.  A t this early stage of the litigation, the  following allegations against \nAbraham in the Complaint  have facial plausibility : Patent Infringe ment (C ount I); Tortious \nInterference with Existing Contract (Count III); Aiding and Abetting Breach of Fiduciary Duty \n(Count VII); and Civil Conspiracy to Breach Fiduciary Duties (Count VIII ).  As a result, \nAbraham’s Motion to Dismiss these claims  is denied.  Ho wever, Duckweed has  no objection to \nthe dismissal of its claim for Aiding and Abetting Breach of License Agreement (Count IV) .  \nTherefore, we grant Abraham’s Motion to Dismiss regarding Count IV - Aiding and Abetting \nBreach of License Agreement.         \n An appropriate Order follows.

This litigation consists of  twelve  actions  \npending in the Northern District of California and the Southern District of New York, as listed on \nSchedule A.    \n \n Microsoft Corporation, a defendant in several of the New York actions, supports \ncentralization in either the Northern District of California or the Southern District of New York, \nand asks that the MDL be assigned to an experienced transferee judge.  Plaintiffs in the Millette  \naction support centralization in the Northern District of California.  All other responding plaintiffs \noppose centralization, though their alternative positions differ.  Plaintiffs in the California class \nactions ( Tremblay , Silverman, and Chabon) alternatively support the Northern District of \nCalifornia as the transferee district.  Plaintiffs in the two New York class actions ( Authors Guild  \nand Alter ) alternatively suggest the Southern District of New York as the transferee district.  \nPlaintiffs in the New York “ News ” cases ( New York Times , Daily News , and Center for \nInvestigative Reporting) and the New York “DMCA” cases ( Raw Story Media and The Intercept ) \nalternatively suggest that , if an MDL is created, the News and DMCA cases should be centralized \nin the Southern District of New York.2     \n \n On the basis of the papers filed and the hearing session held, we  find that the actions listed \non Schedule A involve common questions of fact, and that centralization in the Southern District of New York will serve the convenience of the parties and witnesses and promote the just and \n \n* Judge David C. Norton  did not participate in the decision of this matter.  \n \n1 OpenAI, Inc.; OpenAI, L.P.; OpenAI OpCo LLC; OpenAI GP LLC; OpenAI LLC; OpenAI \nGlobal LLC; OAI Corporation LLC; OpenAI Holdings LLC; OpenAI Startup Fund I LLC; OpenAI Startup Fund GP I LLC; and OpenAI Startup Fund Management LLC (collectively, OpenAI).  \n \n2 This alternative suggestion is a nonstarter because the News cases and the DMCA cases are \nalready pending in the Southern District of New York and thus lack the multidistrict character required by 28 U.S.C. § 1407(a).  Case MDL No. 3143   Document 85   Filed 04/03/25   Page 1 of 5- 2 - \n \nefficient conduct of this litigation.  These actions share factual questions arising  from allegations \nthat OpenAI and Microsoft used copyrighted works, without consent or compensation, to train \ntheir large language models (LLMs), such as GPT -4, which underlie defendants ’ generative \nartificial intelligence products, such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT  and Microsoft’s Bing Chat (rebranded \nas Copilot) , which can algorithmically simulate human reasoning and inference .3  Each action will \ninvolve overlapping, complex, and voluminous  discovery regarding how defendants trained and \ndesigned their LLMs.4  Given the novel and complicated nature of the technology, there likely will \nbe overlapping experts across these actions.  Centralization will eliminate duplicative discovery; \nprevent inconsistent pretrial rulings, particularly as to class certification; and conserve the resources of the parties, their counsel, and the judiciary.  \n \nThe opposing plaintiffs focus on the differences among the claims in these actions.  For \ninstance, t hey contend class action cases are brought by authors of fiction and non- fiction works \n(primarily novels) who allege that their copyrighted works were  infringed when defendants used \nthem as input  in the training of their LLMs  whereas the News plaintiffs assert that millions of their \ncopyrighted works (newspaper articles) were infringed both when used as input in the training of defendants’ LLMs and by the LLM s output —specifically, that defendants’ artificial intelligence \nproducts generate verbatim and detailed summaries of news content.   Plaintiffs also argue that the DMCA plaintiffs, unlike plaintiffs in the other cases, do not allege copyright infringement.  Instead, they allege that defendants violated the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), 17 U.S.C. § 1202, which, inter alia , prohibits the removal of copyright management information (such \nas author, title, copyright, and terms of use information) from a work.  Finally, plaintif fs in the \nMillette  action, unlike the other plaintiffs, seek to represent a putative class of YouTube content \ncreators whose videos (or, more specifically, transcripts of those videos) were used to train \ndefendants’ LLMs .   \n These differences in claims and the underlying material alleged to be infringed do not \npresent a significant obstacle to centralization given the substantial overlap in factual questions \n \n3 According to the parties, LLM s are algorithms that predict words that are likely to follow a given \nstring of text based on the potentially billions of examples used to train it.  LLMs encode the information from a  training corpus that they use to make these predictions as numbers called \n“parameters.”  There are, for example, approximately 1.76 trillion parameters in the GPT -4 LLM.   \nTraining an LLM allegedly involves storing encoded copies of the training works in computer memory, repeatedly passing them through the model with words masked out, and adjusting the parameters to minimize the difference between the masked -out words and the words the model \npredicts  to fill in.  After being trained on a general corpus, LLMs may be subject to “fine -tuning” \nby, for example, performing additional rounds of training using specific types of works to better mimic their content or style, or providing them with human feedbac k to reinforce desired or \nsuppress undesired behaviors. Once trained, LLMs generate output based on patterns and connections drawn from the training data.    \n \n4 According to the parties, defendants have already produced petabytes of data from their training \nsets. Case MDL No. 3143   Document 85   Filed 04/03/25   Page 2 of 5- 3 - \n \nand discovery relating to defendants’ training of their LLMs .5  It is not uncommon for transferee \ncourts to establish separate tracks for actions involving differing claims that allow the actions to \nprogress efficiently.  See, e.g., In re Jan. 2021 Short Squeeze Trading Litig., MDL No. 2989, 2021 \nWL 1258399, at *3 (J.P.M.L. Apr. 2, 2021) (“T he transferee court, though, can employ any number \nof pretrial techniques —such as establishing claim -specific or defendant specific tracks and \ncreating an attorney leadership structure that reflects the differences in the claims —to manage the \ndifferences t hat these actions may present .”).       \n  The opposing plaintiffs also argue that Judge Araceli Martínez -Olguín in the Northern \nDistrict of California and Judge Sidney H. Stein in the Southern District of New York, as well as their assigned magistrate judges, are already closely coordinating with one another with respect to discovery.  While this informal coordination is commendable, we are persuaded that Section 1407 \ncentralization will ensure overall economies.  The currently assigned judges and magistrate judges have dedicated substantial time and resources to this litigation, and far  more will be required as \npretrial proceedings progress to the deposition stage.  Moreover, these judges will be called upon \nto resolve duplicative discovery disputes and overlapping dispositive and class certification motions.  Centralization will allow a single judge to coordinate discovery , streamline pretrial \nproceedings , and eliminate inconsistent rulings .  \n \nThe opposing plaintiffs insist that pretrial proceedings in the class actions and the News \nactions are too advanced for centralization to be beneficial.  We do not find this argument \npersuasive.  Counsel stated during oral argument that only four depositions have been taken thus far and, at a minimum, forty more depositions will be needed in the class acti ons alone.  The parties \nhave been unable to agree on a deposition coordination protocol to eliminate duplicative depositions of defense witnesses —indeed, much of the recent briefing by the parties and oral \nargument before the Panel  consisted of counsel blaming the other side for the breakdown in \nnegotiations.  Opportunities abound for the transferee judge to redirect the parties onto a more efficient path and eliminate the potential for duplicative discovery and pretrial motion practice, as well as inconsistent pretrial rulings and scheduling. \n Finally, the opposing plaintiffs argue that OpenAI cannot seek centralization under the \nterms of a January 2024 stipulation and order in the New York class actions.  We need not resolve the parties’ dispute regarding the interpretation of this stipulation because, r egardless of whether \nOpenAI could request centralization under the stipulation, this Panel itself can certainly order it.   \nSee 28 U.S.C. § 1407(c) (granting the Panel the authority to centralize civil actions upon its own \ninitiative); Hearing Ses sion Order, MDL No. 3143 (J.P.M.L. Feb. 14, 2025), ECF No. 65 (“IT IS \nFURTHER ORDERED that the Panel may, on its own initiative, consider transfer of any or all of the actions in those matters [listed on the attached Schedule] to any district or districts. ”).  Cf. Uber \nTechs., Inc. v. U.S. Jud. Panel on Multidistrict Litig., No. 23- 3445, __ F.4th __, 2025 WL 748135, \nat *8  (9th Cir. Mar. 10, 2025) (“ It is clear from the text of Section 1407 that the statute does not \ncreate an individual right to centralizati on that may be waived but instead vests the JPML with a \n \n5 Even the most unique of these actions —the Millette  YouTube action—will share common factual \nquestions and significant discovery regarding the training of defendants’ LLMs. Case MDL No. 3143   Document 85   Filed 04/03/25   Page 3 of 5- 4 - \n \npower to manage the federal docket by centralizing cases that is unfettered by private \nagreements. ”). \n The Southern District of New York is an appropriate transferee district for this litigation.  \nEight of the twelve actions in this docket are already pending in this  convenient and accessible \nvenue .  Several plaintiffs, as well as Microsoft  Corporation, alternatively suggest or do not oppose \ncentralization in the Southern District of New York.  Judge Sidney H. Stein, an experienced transferee judge, presides over six of the eight actions in the district.  Both he and Magistrate Judge Ona T. Wang have devoted  substantial time and resources to this litigation, and thus are well \nsituated to steer this litigation on a prudent and expeditious course . \n \nIT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that the actions listed on Schedule A and pending outside \nthe Southern District of New York are transferred to the Southern District of New York and, with the consent of that court, assigned to the Honorable Sidney H.

United States, the plaintiff, Ahmad Aljindi, claimed that the federal government infringed on his intellectual property, specifically related to scientific work on Information Security, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Legacy Information Systems (LIS). The court dismissed the case for failing to state a plausible claim, concluding that Aljindi sought copyright protection for ideas, concepts, and principles, which are not copyrightable. Aljindi’s motion for summary judgment was also denied as futile.\n\n2. Key Legal Issue: Whether the plaintiff's allegations of copyright infringement against the federal government were legally sufficient to state a plausible claim for relief under copyright law.\n\n3. Court's Holding: The court held that the plaintiff failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted because he sought copyright protection for ideas and discoveries, which are not protectable under copyright law. The motion to dismiss was granted, and the motion for summary judgment was denied.\n\n4. ELI5 Explanation: Imagine you've written an essay that explains how to make a delicious cake. You own the copyright to how you've written the essay, but you can't claim that people can't bake cakes using the same method just because you discovered it. The court told the man, Ahmad, that he couldn't stop the government from using ideas or methods he wrote about. His legal claim failed because he wanted to protect the ideas themselves, which isn't allowed under copyright rules.",

But “ regardless of whether the plaintiff is proceeding pro \nse or is represented by counsel, conclusory allegations or legal conclusions \nmasquerading as factual conclusio ns will not suffice to prevent a motion to dismiss .” \nScott , 134 Fed. Cl. at 758 ( quoting McZeal v. Sprint Nextel Corp ., 501 F.3d 1354, 1356 \n(Fed. Cir. 2007) ). \nAs this Court’s original dismissal order noted , even assuming Plaintiff meant \nto allege a taking of his intellectual property  — a theory he  seemed to  disclaim, see \nOpinion & Order at 3 — his allegations were not facially plausible without factual \nallegations in the complaint about what the property consisted of, how it was taken, \nand what the g overnment did with it. See Scott , 134 Fed. Cl. at 764. Much the same \nconsiderations require dismissal of any claim for copyright infringement.  \nIn addition, i t does not appear that Plaintiff alleges government use of \nanything that was copyrightable in the f irst place. C opyright protections do not \n“extend to any idea, procedure, process, system, method of  operation, concept, \nprinciple, or discovery, regardless of the form in which it is described,  explained, \nillustrated, or embodied in such work.” 17 U.S.C. §  102(b) .3 Individuals can own a \ncopyright to the “ literary form ” of their work, but not “ the ideas and information ” \ntheir work contains. See Harper & Row  Publishers, Inc. v. Nation Enters. , 471 U.S. \n539, 581 (1985) ; Boyle v. United States , 200 F.3d 1369, 1373 (Fed. Cir. 2000) ; \nShipkovitz v. United States , 1 Cl.  Ct. 400, 403 (1983) . Even making allowances for \nPlaintiff as a pro se  litigant,  the material that he alleges the government used was \nnot copyrightable . He has therefore failed to state a claim  upon which relief can be \ngranted.  \nPlaintiff claims that his intellectual property consisted of “ scientific work about \nInformation Security, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Legacy  Information Systems \n(LIS) [.]” Compl. at 2.  Plaintiff concedes in response to the motion to dismiss that he \n \n3 There are two elements of copyright i nfringement: “(1) ownership of a valid copyright, and (2) copying \nof constituent elements of the work that are original.”  Gaylord v. United States , 595 F.3d 1364, 1372 \n(Fed. Cir. 2010) . Case 1:21-cv-01295-SSS   Document 50   Filed 11/28/22   Page 2 of 4 \n- 3 - \n is claiming copyright to a scientific “topic” or “field,” see Resp. to Mot. to Dismiss at \n4–5, which by definition cannot be copyrighted.  \nPlaintiff’s motion for summary judgment underscores the point. Plaintiff \nasserts that  the allegedly infringed work was his doctoral dissertation, which he \nprovides as an exhibit along with its certificate of copyright registration. See Mot. for \nSumm. J. at Exhs. C & E. “The scientific intellectual property ” at issue, he claims,  “is \nthe dis covery of the entire Information Security, AI,  and LIS scientific field in its \nentirety and establishing this scientific field from scratch [.]” Id. at 5. Because he \nbelieves that “[p] rior to my scientific research this field did not exist ,” he claims the \nright to all subsequent work on the subject: “[E] verything built on top of my property \nis my  property .” Id.; see also  id. at 7 (“[A]s  I have discovered this entire  scientific field \nin its entirety, … all facts, findings, knowledge that falls under it and ba sed on my  \nscientific generic qualitative study and its formal findings are subsequent \nknowledge [.]”). He considers the “f ormal AI Strategies published by the federal  \ngovernment ” to have infringed his work, id. at 7, because he does not think the \ngovernment could have “ know [n] about the relationship between AI, Information \nSecurity, and LIS  without reading and taking my property and building on its formal \nscientific findings ,” id. at 5.  And although Plaintiff at taches several government \npublications on artificial intelligence to his motion, he does not identify any part of \ntheir “literary form” that derived from his dissertation. Harper & Row , 471 U.S. at \n581. All of this confirms that Plaintiff is erroneously se eking copyright protections \nnot for the dissertation’s copyrightable aspects, but for “ idea[s], … concept [s], \nprinciple [s], or discover [ies]” it contains.  17 U.S.C. § 102(b ). \nWhen this Court dismisses complaints for failure to state a claim, it has \ndiscret ion to allow leave to amend. This Court denies leave, however, when \namendment would be futile.  See Foman v. Davis , 371 U.S. 178, 183 (1962);  Steffen v. \nUnited States , 995 F.3d 1377, 1380 (Fed. Cir. 2021) ; Chapman v. United States , 130 \nFed. Cl. 216, 219 (20 17).  Because Plaintiff has made clear in multiple documents \nthat the infringement he alleges relates to uncopyrightable ideas, leave to amend \nwould be futile here.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: CCC Information Services Inc. sued Tractable Inc., alleging that Tractable fraudulently accessed CCC's proprietary software, CCC ONE, to use its data for Tractable's benefit. The court denied Tractable's motion to compel arbitration, finding that CCC did not agree to arbitrate with Tractable. The case highlights the use of artificial intelligence by Tractable, enabling it to produce real-time cost estimates from vehicle damage pictures, as opposed to CCC ONE, which requires physical vehicle inspection by appraisers.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether Tractable can compel arbitration under the fraudulent circumstances through which it obtained access to CCC's software, and whether Tractable and CCC had an existing agreement to arbitrate disputes.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court held that Tractable could not compel arbitration because there was no valid agreement to arbitrate disputes between CCC and Tractable. The fraudulent circumstances under which Tractable accessed the software negated any agreement.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine you have a special tool that only you can use because you made it. Someone tricks you into thinking they're someone else, borrows your tool, and copies it to make their own. Later, when you catch them, they want to settle this in a way you never agreed to. The judge says no, because you never actually agreed to settle things that way with them. That's essentially what happened here: Tractable couldn't make CCC settle things through arbitration because they never really had a deal in the first place.",
    "full_text": " \nIN THE UNITED STATES  DISTRICT COURT  \nFOR THE NORTHERN DIS TRICT OF ILLINOIS  \nEASTERN DIVISION  \n \nCCC INFORMATION SERV ICES INC ., )  \n) \n   Plaintiff ,   ) Case No.  18 C 7246  \n       ) \nv.      ) \n) Judge Robert W. Gettleman  \nTRACTABLE INC ., )  \n) \nDefendant s. ) \n \nMEMORANDUM OPINION A ND ORDER  \nPlaintiff  CCC Information Services Inc.  filed a seven -count first amended complaint \nagainst defendant Tractable Inc. (“Tractable ”), alleging that Tractable  fraudulently obtained \naccess to plaintiff ’s software, and that  Tractabl e used that access to obtain plaintiff ’s proprietary \ndata to  advance Tractable ’s own business.  Tractable  moves  to compel arbitration and to stay the \nproceedings pending arbitration.  Tractable ’s motion  to compel arbitration is denied . \nBACKGROUND  \nPlaintiff ’s “CCC ONE ” platform  is a program that uses proprietary algorithms and data to \ngenerate vehicle damage estimates.  Independent appraisers use CCC ONE to assess vehicle s. An \nappraiser physically inspect s the vehicle, documents the damage, takes photos, takes notes, and \nuses CCC ONE to generate the damag e estimate. The appraiser then transmits the information \nand the damage estimate through CCC ONE to an insurance company.  \nJason Chen  (legally named Xing Xin), holding himself out as a representative of “JA \nAppra isal,” contacted plaintiff  to obtain a license to use CCC ONE . Relying on Chen ’s \nrepresentations, plaintiff granted JA Appraisal an independent appraiser license. Under the  \nlicense , JA Appraisal was prohibited from : “copying or making derivative works of the Case: 1:18-cv-07246 Document #: 43 Filed: 05/07/19 Page 1 of 7 PageID #:<pageID>2 programs; electronically transmitting the programs and/or services from one computer to another \nover a network, including the Internet; deriving or attempting to derive the source code, source \nfiles or structure of all or any portion of the programs and/or services by reverse engineering, \ndisassembly, decompilation or any other means; or using the programs and/or services and \ndocumentation for the benefit of any entity other than the independent appraiser. ” \nPlaintiff later learned that JA Appraisal never existed.  Rather, JA Appraisal ’s purported \nrepresentative, Chen , was an employee of Tractable —a rival company that uses artificial \nintelligence to produce real -time cost estimates of accident repair s based on pictur es of vehicle \ndamage . Unlike plaintiff, whose CCC ONE program is used by independent appraisers who \nphysically visit and inspect accident vehicles , Tractable sought to produce damage s estimates \nusing only pictures . \nMonths after Chen obtained the license fo r CCC ONE,  plaintiff ’s customers told plaintiff  \nthat Tractable was providing a product that generated estimates that appeared to be written by \nCCC ONE.  After  investigat ing, plaintiff  realized that Tractable did not have  a CCC ONE license.  \nTractable  employees , however, had allegedly been accessing the program through licenses held \nby JA Appraisal  to replicate CCC ONE ’s algorithm . Tractable employees also allegedly \ncontacted  plaintiff ’s customer service agents and falsely represented themselves as JA Appraisal \nemployees . Those Tractable employee s asked plaintiff ’s agents how to import and export data, all \nthe while pretending to be JA appraisal employees . The Tractable employees  concealed their \nidenti ties by using false telephone numbers  and false Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, and  by \nusing email addresses with domain names that did not end in “@tractable .ai.” Case: 1:18-cv-07246 Document #: 43 Filed: 05/07/19 Page 2 of 7 PageID #:<pageID>3 Plaintiff sued in this court. Tractable now moves to compel arbitration under t he license \nagreement between plaintiff and JA Appraisal  (represented by Chen) . The license agreement  \ncontains an arbitration clause  and a non-assignment clause : \nAny dispute, claim, case or controversy, whether in tort, contract, statute or otherwise, aris -\ning out of or relating to this contract, including any question regarding its existence, valid -\nity, or termination or arising out of or relating to the relationship between CUSTOMER \nand CCC or any of the respective agents, partners, contractors or employees thereof shall \nbe resolved by binding arbitration. . .  . Any disputes regarding arbitrability, the scope of \narbitration or the arbitrator ’s jurisdiction will be decided by the arbitrator . . . . This agree -\nment is governed by the Federal Arbi tration Act, and any award shall be subject to judicial \nconfirmation in any court having jurisdiction.  \nCUSTOMER represents that it is acting on its own behalf and is not acting as an agent for \nor on behalf of any third party, and further agrees that it may not assign its rights or obli -\ngations under this Agreement wit hout the prior written consent of CCC.  \nDISCUSSION  \nUnder the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1, et seq ., “arbitration may be compelled if \nthe following three elements are shown: a written agreement to arbitrate, a dispute within the \nscope of the arbitra tion agreement, and a refusal to arbitrate. ” Zurich Am erican  Insurance  Co. v. \nWatts Indus tries, Inc. , 417 F.3d 682, 687 (7th Cir. 2005) (citing 9 U.S.C. § 4).  Courts review a \nmotion to compel arbitration under a summary judgment standard . Tinder v. Pinkert on Sec urity, \n305 F.3d 728, 735–36 (7th Cir. 2002).  The party seeking to avoid  arbitration  “must identify a \ntriable issue of fact concerning the existence of the agreement . . . .” Id. at 735.  \n1 Who decides whether  a contract between plaintiff and Tractable  exists ? \nBecause arbitration is a matter of contract, “the court must decide whether a contract \nexists before it decides whether to stay an action and order arbitration. ” Janiga v. Questar Capital \nCorp. , 615 F.3d 735, 741–42 (7th Cir. 2010). There is no dis pute that  plaintiff and JA Appraisal \nare bound by the license agreement ’s arbitration  clause . The dispute is whether  plaintiff and Case: 1:18-cv-07246 Document #: 43 Filed: 05/07/19 Page 3 of 7 PageID #:<pageID>4 Tractable  are bound . And that dispute —whether plaintiff agreed to arbitrate with Tractable —is a \ndispute that “can’t logically be resolved by the arbitrators. ” Sphere Drake Insurance Ltd. v. All \nAmerican Insurance Co. , 256 F.3d 587, 591 (7th Cir. 2001), quoted in Janiga., 615 F.3d at 742.  \nAlthough  the arbitration clause delegates  the issues of existence and v alidity to the \narbitrator, the delegation  clause cannot be enforced against plaintiff unless plaintiff agreed to \narbitrate disputes with Tractable . See Granite Rock Co. v. Teamsters , 561 U. S. 287, 299 (2010) \n(“Arbitration is strictly a matter of consent .”) (citation and quotation marks omitted).  Here, \nunlike  in Henry Schein , the issue is not the effect of a contractual provision to which the parties \nagreed. Henry Schein, Inc. v. Archer & White Sales, Inc. , 139 S. Ct. 524, 529 (2019) (noting that \nwhen a con tract includes a delegation clause that delegates the question of arbitrability to the \narbitrator, “a court possesses no power to decide the arbitrability issue ”). The issue is whether an \nagreement between plaintiff and Tractable exists at all . That issue is for the court to decide . \n2 Did plaintiff and Tractable enter into a contract to arbitrate their dispute ? \nArbitration agreements are governed by contract law.  Scheurer v. Fromm Family Foods \nLLC , 863 F.3d 748, 752 (7th Cir. 2017) (citing Arthur Andersen LLP  v. Carlisle , 556 U.S. 624, \n631 (2009)).  “Generally, under Illinois law, only signatories to an arbitration agreement can \nmove to compel arbitration. ” Applications Software Tech. LLC. V . Kapadia , at 2018 WL \n3122173, at *5 (N.D. Ill. June 26, 2018).  There a re, however, principles  that allow  a nonsignatory \nto compel arbitration , including principles of agency and equitable estoppel.  Id. \nTractable argues that plaintiff agreed to arbitrate its disputes with Tractable because : \n(1) Tractable  is a party to the lic ense agreement ; (2) JA Appraisal is Tractable ’s agent;  and \n(3) plaintiff is equitably estopped from refusing to arbitrate . These arguments are without merit .  \n Case: 1:18-cv-07246 Document #: 43 Filed: 05/07/19 Page 4 of 7 PageID #:<pageID>5 Whether Tractable is a party. A reasonable jury could find  that plaintiff never intended \nto grant Tractable a license agreement and never would have  done so but for Tractable ’s \ndeception . Whether the agreement ’s “CUSTOMER ” is Chen , or JA Appraisal , is immaterial : \nTractable ’s name is nowhere in the agreement . Given the license agreement ’s non-assignment \nclause, in which “CUSTOMER represents that it is acting on its own behalf and is not acting as \nan agent for or on behalf of any third party, ” a reasonable jury could conclude that plaintiff \nreasonably believed that it was granting a license to eithe r Chen or JA Appr aisal—but not to \nTractable, a rival company whose artificial intelligence -powered business model might  make \nplaintiff ’s CCC ONE program obsolete.  \nAgency.  The non -assignment clause similarly  disposes of Tractable ’s agency  argument . A \njury could easily find that neither Chen nor JA Appraisal were Tractable ’s agent because both \nChen and JA Appraisal  expressly represented that they were not acting  as an agent for any third \nparty.  Tractable at times suggests the reverse —that Chen or JA Ap praisal was the principal , \nTractable the agent —but subverts  that suggestion by  repeatedly  arguing  that Chen was \nTractable ’s employee.  \nTractable  argues  that breaching  the non -assignment clause does not  doom the arbitration \nclause . Rent -A-Center, West, Inc. v. Jackson , 561 U.S. 63, 70–71 (2010) . That statement of law  is \ncorrect , but irrelevant —the issue  is whether  plaintiff reasonably believed  that it was signing a \nlicensing agreement  with Tractable . For that issue, Chen or JA Appraisal ’s adoption of  the non -\nassignment clause —in which they represented that they were acting on their own behalf —creates \na triable issue of fact because a jury could infer from  Chen and JA Appraisal ’s representation that \nplaintiff never had reason to believe  that it had entered  into a licensing agreement with Tractable. \nAnd t hat inference has nothing to do with  severability  or unconscionability.  See id. (holding that Case: 1:18-cv-07246 Document #: 43 Filed: 05/07/19 Page 5 of 7 PageID #:<pageID>6 “a party ’s challenge to another [non-arbitration] provision of the contract, or to the contract as a \nwhole, does not prevent a court from enforcing a specific agreement to arbitrate. ”). \nEquitable estoppel.  Equitable estoppel does Tractable no better.  “In Illinois, a claim of \nequitable estoppel exists where a person, by his or her statements or conduct, induces a sec ond \nperson to rely, to his or her detriment, on the statements or conduct of the first person. ” Warciak \nv. Subway Restaurants, Inc. , 880 F.3d 870, 872 (7th Cir.  2018), quoting Ervin v. Nokia, Inc. , 349 \nIll. App.  3d 508, 514 (Ill. App. 2004).  Tractable does not identify the statements on which it \nsupposedly relied to its detriment . And as the court ’s discussion suggests , a reasonable jury could \neasily find that the equities  favor plaintiff , not Tractable . See Ervin , 349 Ill. App. 3d at 517 (“To \nexpand the doctrine of equitable estoppel  . . . would unfairly deny Ervin access to the courts and \nforce him to arbitrate his claim against Nokia, in spite of the fact that Nokia was not a party to \nthe [agreement]  that Ervin entered into with AT&T. ”). As alleged in the first amended complaint , \nand as  Tractable does not dispute , Tractable : (1) used a false  company to obtain a CCC ONE \nlicense; (2)  had its employees conceal their identi ties through  false  telephone numbers  and false \nIP addresses, and through  email addresses with domain names that did not end in \n“@tractable .ai”; and (3)  did all this  to reverse -engineer plaintiff ’s proprietary algorithms for use \nin Tractable ’s artificial intelligence  technology.  To reward Tractable ’s deceit by compelling \narbitra tion would make  equity a  farce . Cf. Bradley v. Fox , 7 Ill. 2d 106, 113  (Ill. 1955) , citing \nwith approval Riggs v. Palmer , 115 N.Y . 506, 50 7 (N.Y . 1889)  (“No court will lend its aid to a \nman who founds his cause of action upon a fraudulent or illegal act. ”). \nTractable ’s relian ce on Hoffman , in which this court granted  a nonsignatory ’s motion to \ncompel arbitration , is misplaced.  Hoffman v. Deloitte & Touche, LLP , 143 F. Supp. 2d 995, \n1004 –05 (N.D. Ill. 2001)  (Gettleman, J.) . Hoffman  applied principles of equitable estoppel based Case: 1:18-cv-07246 Document #: 43 Filed: 05/07/19 Page 6 of 7 PageID #:<pageID>7 \non federal common law . Id., citing MS Dealer Serv ice Corp. v. Franklin , 177 F.3d 942, 947 (11th \nCir. 1999) . Since Hoffman , however,  the Supreme Court has made clear  that a nonsignatory ’s \nright to compel arbitration is governed by s tate law. Carlisle , 556 U.S. at 631–32, discussed in \nScheurer , 863 F.3d at 752–52. Thus, Illinois law govern s, and a reasonable jury instructed on \nIllinois principles of  equitable estoppel could find that plaintiff did not even know about  \nTractable, much less that plaintiff  tricked Tractable to Tractable ’s detriment .  \nCONCLUSION  \nDefendant Tractable ’s motion to compel arbitration (Doc. 21) is denied . The parties are \ndirected to submit a joint status report using this court ’s form on or before May 15, 2019 . This \nmatter is set for a report on status on May 30 , 2019,  at 9:00 a.m . \nENTER:  May 7, 2019  \n \n \n \n__________________________________________  \nRobert W.

Dkt. No. 1  ¶¶ 5, 27 (“ Compl .”).  Before and after  the meeting, Plaintiff provided Mr. \nConner with his business plan that included his entire patent prosecution strategy .  At th e meeting  \nin Menlo Park , according to Plaintiff , Mr. Conner disclosed Plaintiff’s “proprietary and \nconfidential information” to Mr. Krane and did so without executing a non -disclosure agreement.  \nId. ¶¶ 55, 57.   Mr. Conner and Mr. Krane deny a meeting ever took place.  Id. ¶ 25. \nPlaintiff alleges that after this meeting Google Inc. moved to “artificially intelligent \nsolutions in its Cloud platform and that Google invested $4.5M on artificial intelligence research \nin Montreal. ”  Id. ¶ 21.  Plaintiff infers that because Google Inc. made this move shortly after the \nMenlo Park meeting, it shows that Google used his proprietary information  in this venture.   \nPlaintiff alleges, as a result of  this meeting, he “has been caused to suffer more than $75 million of \nexposure to his artificial intelligence inventions.”  Id. ¶ 53.  Further, Plaintiff claims he has \nsuffered “more than $20 million in four innovative software product designs: Proprietary  \nStreaming Video Protocol, Cloud Based Transcoding and Streaming System for Media \nCompanies, OTT Platform with Social Media Layers for OEMs, and Multiscreen OTT Video \nStack for Operators.”  Id. ¶ 60. \nPlaintiff filed his initial complaint in July 2018 for m isappropriation of trade secrets and \nother state law claims against Defendants Google Ventures, Catherine Straggas, Kevin Conner, \nand Conner & Associates.  Compl .  All Defendants subsequently filed separate motions to dismiss.  \nSee Dkt. Nos. 36, 50, 60.  In January of 2019, Plaintiff filed a motion for preliminary injunction \nagainst Google Ventures and non -party Alphabet Inc. and Google LLC.  Dkt. No s. 82, 83.     \nIn March of 2019, the court granted Defendants  Catherine  Straggas ’ and Kevin Conner  and \nConner & As sociates ’ motions to dismiss without leave to amend.   Dkt. No. 100.  The court also \ngranted Defendant Google Venture’s motion to dismiss but with leave to amend.  Id.  Plaintiff \nsubsequently filed an amended complaint.  Dkt. No. 106.   The court now respond s to Plaintiff’s \nmotion for preliminary injunction based on a similar set of facts as the initial complaint , which Case 5:18-cv-04327-EJD   Document 127   Filed 05/07/19   Page 2 of 7 \nCase No.: 5:18-cv-04327 -EJD \nORDER DENYING PLAINTIFF’S MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION  \n 3 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  was the operative complaint at the time Plaintiff filed his preliminary injunction motion.  \nII. LEGAL STANDARD  \nA preliminary injunction is an “extraordinary remedy that may only be awarded upon a \nclear showing that the plaintiff is entitled to such relief. ”  Winter v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc. , \n555 U.S. 7, 22 (2008).  To obtain a preliminary injunction, a plaintiff must show “that he is likely \nto succeed on the merits, that he is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary \nrelief, that the balance of equities tips in his favor, and that an injunction is in the public interest. ” \nId. at 20.  The Ninth Circuit has held that courts  may balance “the elements of the preliminary \ninjunction test  . . . so that a stronger showing of one element may offset a weaker showing of \nanother. ”  Alliance  for the Wild Rockies v. Cottrell , 632 F.3d 1127, 1131 (9th Cir. 2011).   \nAlternatively, a preliminary injunction is also appropriate if “serious questions going to the \nmerits were raised and the balance of the hardships tips sharply in the plaintiff's favor. ”  Alliance , \n632 F.3d at 1135 .  “These formulations are not different t ests but represent two points on a sliding \nscale in which the degree of irreparable harm increases as the probability of success on the merits \ndecreases. ”  Big Country Foods, Inc. v. Board of Educ. of the Anchorage Sch. Dist. , 868 F.2d \n1085, 1088 (9th Cir.  1989).  But “[u]nder either formulation, the moving party must demonstrate a \nsignificant threat of irreparable injury, irrespective of the magnitude of the injury. ”  Id.   \nWhether to grant or deny a preliminary injunction is a matter within the court ’s discretion. \nSee Miss Universe, Inc. v. Flesher , 605 F.2d 1130, 1132 -33 (9th Cir. 1979).   Any order of an \ninjunction only binds a party who has received actual notice.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(d)(2).  \nIII. DISCUSSION  \nA. Success on the Merits  \nPlaintiff has not shown that h e is likely to succeed on the merits of his trade secret claim \nagainst Google .  Plaintiff brought his  initial  trade secret misappropriation claim under the federal \nDefend Trade Secrets Act  against four Defendants .  The court has since dismissed all of Plaintiff’s \nclaims.  Plaintiff was granted leave to amend as to one Defendant, Google Ventures .  Plaintiff’s \nmotion for preliminary injunction is a near recitation of his complaint.   Case 5:18-cv-04327-EJD   Document 127   Filed 05/07/19   Page 3 of 7 \nCase No.: 5:18-cv-04327 -EJD \nORDER DENYING PLAINTIFF’S MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION  \n 4 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  To commence discovery and to obtain a preliminary injunction, a plaintiff must first \nidentify his alleged trade secrets with “reasonable particularity. ”  Cal. Civ. Proc. Code § 2019.210; \nAction Learning Sys., Inc. v. Crowe , 2014 WL 12564011, at *4 (C.D. Cal. Aug. 11, 2014).  Both \nlaws requir e a plaintiff to show that it possessed a trade secret, that the defendant misappropriated \nthe trade secret, and that the defendant ’s conduct damaged the plaintiff.   Space Data Corp. v. X , \n2017 WL 5013363, at *1 (N.D. Cal. Feb. 16, 2017) (citing 18 U.S.C. § 1839(5) and Cal. Civ. \nCode § 3426.1(b)).  A “trade secret ” is information that (1) derives independent economic value, \nactual or potential, from not being generally known to, or readily ascertainable by other people \nwho can obtain economic value from its  disclosure or use and (2) is subject to reasonable efforts to \nmaintain its secrecy.  18 U.S.C. § 1839(3); Cal. Civ. Code § 3426.1(d).   “Misappropriation ” means \nacquisition of a trade secret through means that the party knew or should have known were \nimpro per, such as theft or breach of a duty to maintain secrecy.  18 U.S.C. § 1839(5); Cal. Civ. \nCode § 3426.1(b).   A party may be liable for misappropriation if they knew or had reason to know \nthat a trade secret it uses was derived from a person who acquired  it through improper means.  18 \nU.S.C. § 1839(5); Cal. Civ. Code § 3426.1(b).    \nHere, Plaintiff neither shows possession of  a trade secret nor does he  describe his alleged \ntrade secrets  with “reasonable particularity.”  Plaintiff states that his “assets AR E trade secrets as \nthey are only housed on a secure page within the domain of www.arumaitechnologies.com  \naccessible only to Plaintiff.”  Dkt. No. 82 ¶ 10; Dkt. No. 83 ¶  28.  And that he “employs multiple \nlayers of security.”   Id.  As previously found by the court, Plaintiff’s description of his four \ninnovated software product designs including “[p]roprietary  Streaming Video Protocol, Cloud \nBased Transcoding and Streaming System for Media Companies, OTT Platform with Social \nMedia Layers for OEMs, and Multiscreen OTT Video Stack for Operators,”  that he  “owns all \nrights, title, and interest” to (Compl.  ¶¶ 42, 53 , 60) lacks boundaries to permit Google  to ascertain \nwhere the secrets might lie.  Pellerin v. Honeywell Int’l, Inc. , 877 F. Supp. 2d 983, 988 (S.D. Cal. \n2012) , citing  Diodes, Inc. v. Franzen , 67 Cal. Rptr. 19, 24 (Cal. Ct. App.  1968).  \nPlaintiff also fails  to show that Google misappropriat ed his alleged trade secrets.  Based on Case 5:18-cv-04327-EJD   Document 127   Filed 05/07/19   Page 4 of 7 \nCase No.: 5:18-cv-04327 -EJD \nORDER DENYING PLAINTIFF’S MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION  \n 5 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  allegations in his complaint, Plaintiff states that “[n]ine of the twelve exposed patent ideas are \nbuilt upon artificial intelligence” that had little use since its discovery in 1956 .  Compl. ¶  19.  \nPlaintiff alleges Mr. Conner disclosed his patent ideas to Mr. Krane at the meeting in October \n2016.  Compl.  ¶ 16.  Plaintiff then states that in November 2016 Google Inc. started using artificial \nintelligence in its Cloud platform.  Id. ¶ 21.  Plaintiff ’s statements are conclusory and lack \nreasonable logic.  Plaintiff does not show what trade secrets he alleges were stolen, nor does he \nshow that Google knew or had reason to know any trade secret was derived from improper means.  \nBased on Plaintiff’s  limited  and conclusory  facts as alleged, the court cannot describe in \nreasonable detail any act or acts Google would be restrained from doing as required under Federal \nRule of Civil Procedure 65(d)(1)(C)  to provide Plaintiff with adequate relief .  In sum, Plaintiff \ncannot  not show a likelihood of success on the merits.  \nB. Irreparable Harm  \nPlaintiff has not shown irreparable harm.   In seeking a preliminary injunction, a Plaintiff \nmust demonstrate “that irreparable injury is likely in the absence of a n injunction.”  Winter , 555 \nU.S. at 21.  An injunction ordered on any lesser showing is “inconsistent ” with the \n“characterization of injunctive relief as an extraordinary remedy. ”  Id. at 22.  In assessing whether \na plaintiff has demonstrated that it is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of injunctive \nrelief, the court is mindful that the plaintiff must make a “clear showing of irreparable harm. ”  \nGarcia v. Google , 786 F.3d 733, 74 6 (9th Cir. 2015).  “Speculative injury does not constitute \nirreparable injury sufficient to warrant granting a preliminary injunction. ”  Caribbean Marine \nServs. Co. v. Baldrige , 844 F.2d 668, 674 (9th Cir. 1988).  Indeed, “[a] plaintiff must do more than \nmerely allege imminent harm sufficient to establish standing; a plaintiff must demonstrate  \nimmediate threatened injury as a prerequisite to preliminary injunctive relief. ”  Id.  “Subjective \napprehensions and unsupported predictions of revenue loss are not sufficient to satisfy a plaintiff ’s \nburden of demonstrating an immediate threat of irreparable harm. ”  Id. at 675 -76. \nHere, Plaintiff ’s first assert ion of harm is  that he is precluded from raising capital.  Dkt. \nNos. 82, 83 ¶ 34.  Plaintiff alleges that he cann ot “exchange cas h for capital shares without risking Case 5:18-cv-04327-EJD   Document 127   Filed 05/07/19   Page 5 of 7 \nCase No.: 5:18-cv-04327 -EJD \nORDER DENYING PLAINTIFF’S MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION  \n 6 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  himself of claims of negligence, securities violation, and stock fraud.”  Id.  Plaintiff does not \nexplain why this is the case but states plainly that “granting a preliminary injunction would \nalleviate t hese possibilities.”  Id.  Plaintiff’s statements do not meet the standard of a clear \nshowing of irreparable harm.  \nPlaintiff also states that he will suffer nine types of irreparable harm if the court does not \nimmediately enjoin Google.  Id. ¶ 35.  Plaintiff describes the nine types of harm as:  \n(1) no coding of a Proprietary Streaming Video Protocol; (2) no \ncoding 331 of the Cloud -Based Transcoding and Streaming System \nfor Media Companies; (3) 332 no coding of a Multiscreen OTT \nPlatform with Social M edia Layers for OEMs; (4) 333 no coding for \na Silver Bullet OTT Video Stack for Operators; (5) no OTT 334 \nPlatforms for the OTT patent ideas to defensively protect; (6) the loss \nof the 335 individual as the motivating force behind the development \nand comme rcialization 336 of the most popular product in the history \nof consumer electronics – the DVD 337 player in Gregory B. \nThagard, SEVP & Co -CTO; (7) the loss of the well known 338 expert \nin service provider architecture and co -inventor with late co -founder \nof 339 Microsoft Corporation in David Colter, EVP &Co -CTO; (8) \nthe loss of the  individual who controls a $1 billion dollar P&L for \nQualcomm Corporation in lead 341 independent Director, Shyam \nKrishnamurthy; and (9) the probable demise of the 342 only leadin g, \nindependent, pure play company in the OTT industry today in 343 \nArumai Technologies, Inc. at the hands of the cash rich non -parties \nand party.   \nId.  This list of “types of harm ” is unclear.  Again, it is impossible for this court to enjoin Google \nfrom a  violation of the Defend Trade Secrets Act based on the information Plaintiff has provided.  \nFurthermore, Plaintiff, while filing his initial complaint in July of 2018, has waited until January \nof 2019 to bring his preliminary injunction motion.  This timi ng weighs against Plaintiff’s \nargument that his threatened injury is imminent warranting an injunction.  In sum, Plaintiff has \noffered no proof that there is an imminent threat of use or disclosure of Plaintiff’s alleged trade \nsecrets.  In light of this, P laintiff has not demonstrated irreparable harm.  \nBecause  the court finds that Plaintiff’ s explanation  of potential ensuing harm is not the \ntype of “immediate threatened injury ” required for a preliminary injunction, it need not address the \nother Winter factors.  See Leiva -Perez v. Holder , 640 F.3d 962, 965 (9th Cir. 2011) (holding that \ninjunctive relief may not issue absent a “threshold showing regarding irreparable harm . . . \nregardless of the petitioner ’s proof regarding the other [] factors ”).

CONCLUSION AND ORDER  \nThe court concludes that Plaintiff has not met the requirements to enable a preliminary \ninjunction.  Accordingly, a preliminary injunction will not issue.      \nIT IS SO ORDERED.  \nDated:  May 7,  2019  \n______________________________________  \nEDWARD J.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: This case involves a trademark dispute between Playground AI LLC and Mighty Computing, Inc., both operating in the artificial intelligence sector, over the use of the \"Playground AI\" mark. Playground AI alleges trademark infringement and cybersquatting against Mighty and its founder, Suhail Doshi, arguing that Mighty launched an aggressive campaign using the contested trademark despite knowing its prior use by Playground AI. The court denied Doshi's motion to dismiss, allowing the claims against him to proceed because there are plausible allegations of his personal involvement in the corporate actions. \n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether Suhail Doshi, as a corporate officer, can be held personally liable for trademark infringement and cybersquatting allegedly committed by Mighty Computing, given his significant control and involvement in the company's business activities.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court held that Playground AI provided sufficient factual allegations to state a plausible claim for personal liability against Doshi for trademark infringement and cybersquatting. Doshi's motion to dismiss the First Amended Complaint was denied because he is allegedly the central figure in the company's decision-making, especially regarding the trademark issues at hand.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine two kids — let's call them Paul and Mike — both set up lemonade stands with the name \"Yummy Lemonade.\" Paul believes he was the first to use the name and sues Mike, saying Mike stole it to trick people into thinking his lemonade is Paul's. Paul also says Mike's dad is in on it because he helps run Mike's stand from their garage. The court says, \"We think there's enough reason to believe Mike's dad was part of the plan, so we should keep looking into it,\" and refuses to dismiss the case just because Mike's dad says he had nothing to do with it.",

Both companies assert  rights in the mark “Playground AI” and variations  of that \nmark .  Playground AI filed this suit against Mighty and its founder, Suhail Doshi (“Doshi”), \nasserting claims under two federal statutes,  the Lanham Act  and the Anti-Cybersquatting \nConsumer Protection Act .  Mighty  answered and filed counterclaims against Playground AI and \nits founder, Rick Latona (“Lato na”), asserting a Lanham Act  claim  and related state law  claims . \n All parties have answered except Doshi, who moves to dismiss Playground AI’s operative \nfirst amended complaint (“FAC”) under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6).   Doshi  argues \nthat he cannot be held liable for Mighty’s  alleged trademark infringement and cybersquatting  \nbased solely on his role as a corporate officer , and  contends  that the FAC does not  sufficiently \nallege his personal involvement in Mighty’s  alleged wrongd oing to state a claim against him .  The \nCourt finds the motion suitable for decision without oral argument, and therefore the motion \nhearing set for April 25, 2024 is VACATED.   See Civ. L.R. 7 -1(b).

BACKGROUND1 \n Playground AI is a company specializing in artificial intelligence software , and “[i]ts \nwebsite is a ‘one -stop’ location for a variety of generative AI tools and models .”  FAC ¶ 1 , ECF \n15.  Both “AI” and “playground” are  generic terms commonly used in the AI field :  “AI refers to \n‘artificial intelligence, ’ while playground refers to an application or platform  where users can \nsafely experiment, test, learn, or play with various tools and algorithms. ”  Id. ¶ 3.  “However, \nPlayground AI’s inverted word order, in which playground is a  noun -adjunct  modifying AI, \ncreates a distinctive composite ” that has been in continual use by  Playground AI and its \npredecessors in interest since December 2019.  Id. ¶¶ 4-5.  The “Playground AI” mark and \nvariations of the mark have been used in connection with Playground AI’s goods and services \nrelating to artificial intelligence, including “(i) ‘Anonymous Camera, ’ a popular and well -\npublicized  application for investigative journa lists and political activists, which uses AI to identify  \npeople in images and videos; blur, pixelate, or block identifying features in real time; and  strip \nmetadata from the resulting file; and (ii) ‘Worklens, ’ a mobile application that uses  AI to analyze,  \nlabel, group, and search photos based on content. ”  Id. ¶¶ 5-6. \n Mighty  is a technology company founded by Doshi  in 2019 .  See FAC ¶¶ 7-8.  The \ncompany is a closely held  corporation with approximately ten employees , which is run from \nDoshi’s home.  See id.  ¶ 7.  Mighty’s Statement of Information filed with the California Secretary \nof State lists “Doshi as the sole officer of the company, simultaneously holding the key positions \nof ‘Chief Executive Officer, ’ ‘Chief F inancial Officer ’ and ‘Secretary. ’”  Id. ¶ 82.   Doshi “ has \npersonally participated in all major business  strategy, branding, and marketing decisions and \nactions ” of Mighty.  Id.  \n In September 2022, Mighty launched a website at <playgroundai.com> with the  title \n“Playground AI,” and shortly thereafter Mighty deployed an application with text -to-image and \nimage search  features on its website .

Mighty \nnonetheless registered for the Twitter/X handle of “ @playground_ai ,” and “ funded an aggressive \nmarketing and litigation campaign against  Playground AI in the hopes of overwhelming and \nbullying the company out of its rights  and domain name. ”  Id. ¶¶ 11 -15.  In September 2023, \nMighty filed an complaint with the World Intellectual Property Organization (“WIPO ”) pursuant \nto its Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy (“UDRP ”), alleging that Mighty  has \ncommon law rights in the domain name <playground .ai> and that Playground AI has no rights in \nthe domain name.  See id.  ¶ 13.   Mighty dismissed the UDRP complaint without prejudice on \nOctober 11, 2023.  See id.  ¶ 16.  \n Playground AI filed the present action on October 11, 2023.  See Compl., ECF 1.  The \nfollowing day, Mighty  began changing some of its branding from “Playground AI” to \n“Playground.”  FAC ¶ 18.  However, Mighty continues to use “Playground AI,” “playgroundai,” \nand similar variations on Mighty’s website.  Id. ¶¶ 19 -24.  Playground AI alleges that “ Mighty \nbuilt its business and brand by infringing on the Playground AI  Marks.  It attracted customers, \nattention, and, upon information and belief, new funding,  by lever aging the good will, publicity, \nand consumer recognition already associated with  the Playground AI Marks in the AI software \nspace. ”  Id. ¶ 23.  Playground AI filed the operative FAC on November 14, 2023, asserting claims \nagainst Mighty and Doshi for:  (1) False Association and Designation of Origin  under the Lanham \nAct, 15 U.S.C. § 1125(a) ; and (2) Cybersquatting  under the Anti-Cybersquatting Consumer \nProtection Act , 15 U.S.C. § 1125(d) . \n Mighty answered the FAC, and filed counterclaims against Playground A I and its founder, \nLatona.  Doshi filed the present motion to dismiss , arguing that the FAC does not state a claim \nagainst him because it does not allege facts showing his personal involvement in the claimed \ntrademark infringement and cybersquatting.  \n Case 5:23-cv-05181-BLF     Document 42     Filed 03/14/24     Page 3 of 6 \n4 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California    II. LEGAL STANDARD  \n “A motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) for failure to state a \nclaim upon which relief can be granted tests the legal sufficiency of a claim.”  Conservation Force \nv. Salazar , 646 F.3d 1240, 1241 -42 (9th Cir. 2 011) ( internal quotation marks and citation omitted). \nWhile a complaint need not contain detailed factual allegations, it “must contain sufficient factual \nmatter, accepted as true, to ‘state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.’” Ashcroft v. Iq bal, \n556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) (quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly , 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007)).  \n When evaluating a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, the district court is limited to the allegations of \nthe complaint, documents incorporated into the complaint by reference , and matters which are \nsubject to judicial notice.  See Louisiana Mun. Police Employees ’ Ret. Sys. v. Wynn , 829 F.3d \n1048, 1063 (9th Cir. 2016) (citing Tellabs, Inc. v. Makor Issues & Rights, Ltd. , 551 U.S. 308, 322 \n(2007)).  The Court need not “accept as  true allegations that contradict matters properly subject to \njudicial notice” or “allegations that are merely conclusory, unwarranted deductions of fact, or \nunreasonable inferences.”  In re Gilead Scis. Sec. Litig. , 536 F.3d 1049, 1055 (9th Cir. 2008) \n(internal quotation marks and citations omitted).  \n  III. DISCUSSION  \n Doshi contends that the FAC does not allege facts sufficient to give rise to personal \nliability against him for Mighty’s alleged trademark infringement and cybersquatting.  In \nopposition, Playground AI argues that the claims against Doshi are adequately alleged because the \nFAC makes clear that Doshi controls Mighty and is involved in all significant corporate decisions.   \nIn the event the Court does not find the allegations o f the FAC to be adequate, Playground AI \nrequests leave to amend and proffers additional facts that could be alleged with respect to Doshi.   \n “[A] corporate officer or director is, in general, personally liable for all torts which he \nauthorizes or directs o r in which he participates, notwithstanding that he acted as an agent of the \ncorporation and not on his own behalf .”  Comm. for Idaho’s High Desert, Inc. v. Yost , 92 F.3d \n814, 823 (9th Cir. 1996)  (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  The Ninth Circuit has \nexpressly applied this principle to trademark infringement actions.  See id.  at 823 -24.   “ Cases \nfinding personal liability on the part of corporate officers have typically involved instances where Case 5:23-cv-05181-BLF     Document 42     Filed 03/14/24     Page 4 of 6 \n5 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  the defendant was the ‘guiding spirit’ behind the wrongful conduct, or the ‘central figure’ in the \nchallenged corporate activity.”   Facebook, Inc. v. Power Ventures, Inc. , 844 F.3d 1058, 1069 (9th \nCir. 2016)  (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  “ At the motion to dismiss stage, courts \nhave  found a plausible basis for personal liability when the plaintiffs have alleged that the officer \nexercises sufficient control over the corporation with respect to the challenged activity. ”  DISH \nNetwork L.L.C. v. Jadoo TV, Inc. , No. 20 -CV-01891 -CRB, 2020 WL 5816579, at *4 (N.D. Cal. \nSept. 30, 2020) .  \n Here, the FAC alleges that “ Doshi is the founder and central figure  of Mighty Computing, \nInc., and has personally participated in all major business strategy,  branding, and marketing \ndecisions and actions. ”  FAC ¶ 82.  Those allegations are supported by the following facts:  Doshi \nfounded Mighty; Mighty is a closely held  corporation with approximately ten employees ; the \ncorporation is operated from Doshi’s home; and the corporation’s Statement of Information f iled \nwith the California Secretary of State lists Doshi as the sole officer of the company, holding the \npositions of CEO, CFO, and Secretary.  Id.  The FAC contains screen shots of Doshi’s social \nmedia posts announcing  transition of Mighty’s branding from “Playground AI” to “Playground” \nand opining that the company’s use of “Playground” was “Trademark clear.”  Id. ¶¶ 118 -121.  \nFinally, the FAC alleges that af ter the present lawsuit was filed, Doshi direct messaged \nPlayground AI’s founder Latona to ask if he wanted to “find  a more peaceful resolution. ”  Id. ¶ \n123.  The Court finds that these allegations give rise to a plausible basis for personal liability \nagainst Doshi based on his exercise of control over Mighty with respect to the alleged trademark \ninfringement and cybersquatting.  \n Doshi  argues that the FAC’s allegations are too general to give rise to personal liability \nagainst him, relying on In re JUUL La bs, Inc., Mktg., Sales Pracs., & Prod. Liab. Litig. , 497 F. \nSupp. 3d 552  (N.D. Cal. 2020) .  In JUUL , the district court found allegations regarding certain \ncorporate officers’ direct involvement in youth -targeted marketing to be sufficient to give rise to \npersonal liability under California’s Unfair Competition Law, but found more general allegations \nthat certain directors had “final say” in marketing materials to be insufficient for personal liability.  \nSee id.  at 635 -36.  Doshi argues that the FAC’s alleg ations against him are similar to those found Case 5:23-cv-05181-BLF     Document 42     Filed 03/14/24     Page 5 of 6 \n6 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  inadequate in JUUL .  Doshi’s reliance on JUUL is misplaced.  He is not merely a board member \nalleged to have final say in marketing decisions, but rather an individual alleged to have founded \nMighty, to hold every significant corporate office, to run the corporation out of his home, and to \nbe someone who personally announces corporate rebranding and initiates negotiations re garding \ntrademark litigation.   The Court finds these allegations sufficient to assert personal liability against \nDoshi for pleading purposes.  \n The Court observes that even if it were to grant Doshi’s motion  to dismiss , it would grant \nleave to amend based on Playground’s  representation  that it could add additional allegations \nregarding Doshi’s status as a central figure in the alleged trademark infringement.  Playground \nsubmits the declaration of its counsel, Brett E. Lewis, containing screen shots of several of \nDoshi’s social media pos ts.  See Lewis Decl., ECF 31 -1.  In one, Doshi teased a big corporate \nannouncement and, when asked whether the board was involved, replied “i am the board and i am \ndefinitely involved.”  Id. ¶ 4.  The following day, he posted a thread introducing “Playgrou nd v2.”  \nId. ¶ 5.  The addition of allegations regarding Doshi’s personal involvement in the alleged \ntrademark infringement based on these social media posts would bolster Playground AI’s claims \nof personal liability .  However, the Court concludes that it need not require amendment of \nPlayground AI’s pleading to add such allegations (and thus potentially invite another round of \nmotion practice), because the FAC is adequate as pled.  \n Doshi’s motion to dismiss the FAC is DENIED.  \n  IV. ORDER  \n (1) Defendant Dos hi’s motion to dismiss the FAC is DENIED; and  \n (2) This order terminates ECF 20.  \n \nDated:   March 14, 2024  \n ______________________________________  \nBETH LABSON FREEMAN  \nUnited States District Judge  \nCase 5:23-cv-05181-BLF     Document 42     Filed 03/14/24     Page 6 of 6",

    "summary": "**1. Summary:**\nIn the case of Lamont v. Krane et al., the United States District Court for the Northern District of California granted the motion to dismiss filed by Google Ventures (GV Defendants). Plaintiff P. Stephen Lamont accused the defendants of misappropriating trade secrets related to artificial intelligence (AI), but the court found that Lamont failed to state a claim with sufficient particularity and evidence to support the allegations. The court denied further leave to amend due to the futility of the changes proposed by Lamont.\n\n**2. Key Legal Issue:**\nThe primary legal issue in this case was whether Lamont’s complaint had sufficiently established a plausible claim for trade secret misappropriation under the Defend Trade Secrets Act, including proper ownership and wrongful acquisition or use of the alleged trade secrets.\n\n**3. Court's Holding:**\nThe court held that Lamont's complaint lacked adequate detail and evidence to support claims of trade secret ownership and misappropriation. As a result, the motion to dismiss was granted without leave to amend, concluding that further amendments would be futile and potentially cause undue prejudice to the defendants.\n\n**4. ELI5 Explanation:**\nImagine a person making a big claim against a company, saying that they stole their secret recipe and used it to make their product better. The court looked at the claim and asked, \"Where's the recipe, and how did the company steal it?\" The person didn’t provide any clear explanations or evidence to show that the company took it or used it. Since he'd already had chances to explain properly and couldn't, the court decided not to let him try again, meaning his case was closed.",

No. 117  \n \nPresently before the Court is Defendant s’ motion to dismiss Plaintiff ’s Second Amended \nComplaint ( “SAC ”) filed by Defendants David Krane and Google Ventures ( “GV Defendants ”).  \nDkt. No. 117  (“Mot. ”).  Pro se Plaintiff P. Stephen Lamont ( “Plaintiff ”) seeks nearly one billion \ndollars in compensatory and punitive damages against original GV Defendants and two newly \nadded Defendants : Alphabet, Inc. and Google, LLC (collectively “Defendants ”).  SAC . \nPlaintiff asserts  that Defendants have violat ed the Defend Trade Secrets Act, 18 U.S.C. \n§ 1836 , and 18 U.S.C. §  1961 ( defining  18 U.S.C. Ch. 96 —Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt \nOrganizations).  Defendants Alphabet and Google have not been served with this action nor have \nthey otherwise responded.  Because Plaintiff has failed to address the deficiencies  previously \noutlined by th e Court (Dkt. No. 100), Plaintiff still  lacks a sufficient ly plead  claim under the \nDefend Trade Secrets Act .  Plaintiff also states no facts in support of his  newly -added  \nRacketeering claim .  For the reasons  below , GV Defendants ’ motion to dismiss is GRANT ED. \nThis Court has subject matter jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. §  1331 (federal question).

BACKGROUND1 \nAs stated in his original Complaint , Plaintiff is  Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of \niviewit Holdings, Inc., d/b/a Arumai Technologies, Inc .  Dkt. No. 1 (“Compl. ”).  As the alleged \n“only true inventor and designer ” of “four innovative software product de signs ” including \n“Proprietary Streaming Video Protocol, Cloud Based Transcoding and Streaming System for \nMedia Companies, OTT Platform with Social Media Layers for OEMs, and Multiscreen OTT \nVideo Stack for Operators, ” Plaintiff  claims that he  “owns all rights, title, and interest ” of the \n“compromised assets. ”  Compl . ¶¶ 42, 53, 60.   Plaintiff asserts he has been caused to suffer more \nthan $35 million in exposure of these software designs.  SAC at 16.  \nPlaintiff assert s in his Complaint, but omits from his  SAC,  that in October of 2016,  Kevin \nConner, Plaintiff ’s CPA, met with David Krane at the Rosewood on Sand Hill Road.  Compl.  at 7.  \nPlaintiff  alleges that at that meeting, Mr. Conner gave Mr. Krane Plaintiff ’s business plan that \nincluded his entire pate nt prosecution strategy  that was marked proprietary and confidential.  \nCompl. ¶  16.2  Plaintiff alleges that at that meeting, his patent and product ideas were disclosed \nwithout a signed non -disclosure agreement .  Dkt. No. 60 -1 ¶ 22.  Mr. Conner and Mr . Krane both \ndenied the meeting ever took place.  Plaintiff alleges that because “Google Inc. had made a move \nto artificially intelligent solutions in its Cloud platform and that Google invested $4.5M on \nartificial intelligence research in Montreal ” shortl y thereafter,  GV’s move to artificial intelligence \nwas based on  Plaintiff ’s trade secrets unlawfully acquired from the meeting at the Rosewood.  \nCompl. ¶  21.   \nOn the initial  motion to dismiss, the Court found that Plaintiff failed to plead his claim \nwith sufficient  particularity and failed to connect the alleged trade secret with Google Inc.’s \ninvolvement with artificial intelligence and gave Plaintiff leave to amend his Complaint .  Plaintiff \nfiled an Amended Complaint on March 31, 2019 (Dkt. No. 106) and a Second A mended \n                                                 \n1 The background is a summary of the allegations in the  Complaint (Dkt. No. 1) and Plaintiff’s  \nSAC (Dkt. No. 116) that are relevant to GV Defendant’s motion to dismiss.  \n2 Further factual background is provided in this Court’s previous order (Dkt. No. 100) .

Motion to Dismiss  \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a) requires a plaintiff to plead each claim with sufficient \nspecificity to “give the defendant fair notice of what the . . . claim is and the grounds upon which \nit rests. ”  Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly , 550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007) (internal quotations omitted).  \nA complaint which falls short of the Rule 8(a) standard may be dismissed if it fails to state a claim \nupon which relief can be granted.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6).  “Dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) is \nappropriate only wh ere the complaint lacks a cognizable legal theory or sufficient facts to support \na cognizable legal theory. ”  Mendiondo v. Centinela Hosp. Med. Ctr ., 521 F.3d 1097, 1104 (9th \nCir. 2008).  Moreover, the factual allegations “must be enough to raise a right t o relief above the \nspeculative level ” such that a claim “is plausible on its face. ”  Twombly , 550 U.S. at 555, 570.  \nWhen deciding whether to grant a motion to dismiss, the court generally “may not consider any \nmaterial beyond the pleadings. ”  Hal Roach Stu dios, Inc. v. Richard Feiner & Co ., 896 F.2d 1542, \n1555 n.19 (9th Cir. 1990).  The court must accept as true all “well-pleaded factual allegations. ”  \nAshcroft v. Iqbal , 556 U.S. 662 (2009).  The court must also construe the alleged facts in the light \nmost favorable to the plaintiff.  Love v. United States , 915 F.2d 1242, 1245 (9th Cir. 1998).  \n“[M]aterial which is properly submitted as part of the complaint may be considered. ”  Hal Roach \nStudios , 896 F.2d at 1555 n.19.  But “courts are not bound to accept a s true a legal conclusion \ncouched as a factual allegation. ”  Twombly , 550 U.S. at 555.  \nB. Pro Se Pleadings  \nWhere, as here, the pleading at issue is filed by a plaintiff proceeding pro se, it must be \nconstrued liberally.  Resnick v. Hayes , 213 F.3d 443, 447 (9 th Cir. 2000).  In doing so, the court \n“need not give a plaintiff the benefit of every conceivable doubt ” but “is required only to draw \n                                                 \n3 The Court considers the SAC as the operative complaint for GV Defendants’ motion to dismiss \nand for this order.

De Bord , \n507 F.2d 501, 504 (9th Cir. 1974).  The court “should use common sense in interpreting the \nfrequently diffuse pleadings of pro se complainants. ”  Id.  But pro se parties must still abide by the \nrules of the court in which they litigate.  Carter v. Commissioner , 784 F.2d 1006, 10 08 (9th Cir. \n1986).   A pro se complaint should not be dismissed unless the court finds it “beyond doubt that the \nplaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief. ”  \nHaines v. Kerner , 404 U.S. 519, 521, 92 S. Ct.  594, 30 L. Ed. 2d 652 (1972).  \nIII. DISCUSSION  \nA. Plaintiff ’s Second Amended Complaint Still Fails to Plead a Sufficient Claim  \nGV Defendants move to dismiss Plaintiff ’s misappropriation for trade secret claim because  \nPlaintiff still fails to plead a su fficient claim.  Mot. at 9 –12.  The Court agrees.  \nCongress enacted the Defend Trade Secrets Act in 2016 (the “Act”).  See Defend Trade \nSecrets Act of 2016, Pub. L. No. 114 -153, § 2, 130 Stat. 376 (2016) (codified as amended at 18 \nU.S.C. § 1831 et seq.).  The Act builds upon the Espionage Act of 1996 and provides exclusive \noriginal jurisdiction to the District Courts.  Id. § 1836.  The Act provides a right of civil action to \n“[a]n owner of a trade secret ” intended for use in commerce “that is misappropriate d.”  Id. \n§ 1836(b)(1).   \nA “trade secret ” is considered “all forms and types of financial, business, scientific, \ntechnical, economic, or engineering information, including patterns, plans, compilations, program \ndevices, formulas, designs, prototypes, metho ds, techniques, processes, procedures, programs, or \ncodes, whether tangible or intangible, and whether or how stored, compiled . . . ”  Id. § 1839(3).  \nAn owner maintains her trade secret if: (1) she takes reasonable measures in keeping it secret, and \n(2) “the information derives independent economic value, actual or potential, from not being \ngenerally known to, and not being readily ascertainable through proper means . . . . ”  Id. \n§ 1839(3)(A) and (B).  “Misappropriation ” of a trade secret occurs when: (A) the trade secret is \nacquired “by a person who knows or has reason to know that the trade secret was acquired by \nimproper means ” or (B) “disclosure or use ” occurs by a person without “express or implied Case 5:18-cv-04327-EJD   Document 130   Filed 05/14/19   Page 4 of 8 \nCase No.: 5:18-cv-04327 -EJD \nORDER GRANTING GV DEFENDANTS’ MOTION TO DISMISS  \n 5 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  consent. ”  Id. § 1839(5)(A) and (B).   \n1. Trade Secret Ow nership  \nGV Defendants move to dismiss Plaintiff ’s claim because  Plaintiff lacks standing under \nDefense Trade Secret Act (“DTSA”) as he fails to show ownership.   Mot. at 12 –13.  To state a \nDTSA claim, a plaintiff must show that he is the owner or licensee of the alleged trade secret.  See \n18 U.S.C. §§  1836(b)(1), 1839(4) (defining “owner ”); uSens, Inc. v. Shi Chi , No. 18 -cv-01959 -\nSVK, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 175570, *8 -9 (N.D. Cal. Oct . 11, 2018).   \nWhile , a “plaintiff need not ‘spell out the details of the trade secret, ’ Autodesk, Inc. v. \nZwcad Software Co ., No. 5:14 -cv-01409 -EJD,  2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 63610, at *13 (N.D. Cal. \nMay 13, 2015).  Nevertheless, the plaintiff must “describe the subject matte r of the trade secret \nwith sufficient particularity to separate it from matters of general knowledge in the trade or of \nspecial knowledge of those persons who are skilled in the trade, and to permit the defendant to \nascertain at least the boundaries within  which the secret lies. ”  Pellerin v. Honeywell Int ’l, Inc. , \n877 F. Supp. 2d 983, 988 (S.D. Cal. 2012) (quoting Diodes, Inc. v. Franzen , 67 Cal. Rptr. 19, 24 \n(Cal. Ct. App.  1968)).   Plaintiff has neither provided information in his SAC to show ownership, \nnor descri ption  of the alleged trade secrets with sufficient particularity.   \nHere, the Court previously found that Plaintiff lacked a sufficient description of \nparticularity.  Dkt. No. 100 ( “Order ”).  Plaintiff ’s SAC repeats much of what was already stated  in \nhis original Complaint with some additions.  Plaintiff adds that his trade secrets are: “the use of an \nExpert System ” and provides a graph titled “Expert System. ”  SAC at 10.   Even still, Plaintiff fails \nto provide an explanation as to the numbers and formulas provided or as to what the expert system \nmeans.  Plaintiff states that his trade secrets are “the use of a Knowledge Base to insert bad \nchoices ” and “the use of inference engines to reiterate another choice ” but omits any further \nexplanation.  Id.  Plaintiff contends that his trade secrets are “numerous sundry items ” without \nexplanation.  Lastly, Plaintiff contends that when these are applied together, “Plaintiff achieves to  \n[sic] goal of solving complex problems ” while also “achieving optimal pic ture quality, lower \nbandwidth requirements, and lower storage requirements. ”  SAC at 11.  Plaintiff ’s descriptions are Case 5:18-cv-04327-EJD   Document 130   Filed 05/14/19   Page 5 of 8 \nCase No.: 5:18-cv-04327 -EJD \nORDER GRANTING GV DEFENDANTS’ MOTION TO DISMISS  \n 6 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  still broad and unascertainable.           \nFurther in his description, Plaintiff alleges that his trade secrets are housed in folders on \nthe secure page of Arumai Technologies accessible only to the Administrator.  SAC ¶  9.  And that \n“[t]o ensure the veracity of Plaintiff ’s protection claim, he cannot extend an invite to the Federal \ndefendants, but  he is willing to extend an invite to Courtroom Deputy.  . . .”  SAC ¶ 9.  Plaintiff has \nnot remedied the deficiencies in his Complaint with these statements, which  are insufficient and \nlack any showing of ownership.    \nAccordingly, Plaintiff fails to assert  ownership of any trade secret.  \n2. Misappropriation  \nTo show misappropriation, DTSA  requires a showing of one of two categories: (1) \nwrongful acquisition, or (2) disclosure or use of the trade secret without consent.  18 U.S.C. \n§ 1839(5)(A) and (B).  GV Defendants argue that Plaintiff shows neither.  The Court agrees.  \nFirst, Plaintiff still fails to show GV Defendants (1) acquired a trade secret, and (2) if they \nhad, that it was acquired wrongfully.  To wrongfully acquire a trade secret, one must obtain a  trade \nsecret while having reason to know that it was obtained through “improper means. ”  Id. \n§ 1839(5)(A) ( “misappropriation ” means “acquisition of a trade secret by a person who knows or \nhas reason to know that the trade secret was acquired by improper m eans. ”).  Such “improper \nmeans ” can include lying, paying a bribe, or inducing someone to breach their confidentiality \nagreement.  Id. § 1839(6)(A).    \nHere, the Court previously rejected Plaintiff ’s theory that GV Defendants acquired \nPlaintiff ’s alleged tr ade secrets wrongfully because Plaintiff stated in his Complaint and through \nexhibits that he consented to Mr. Conner sharing Plaintiff ’s “business plan ” with the GV \nDefendants before and after the alleged meeting .  Plaintiff argues that because a non-disclosure  \nagreement was not signed at the alleged meeting, that Plaintiff therefore did not consent.   Dkt. No. \n123 at 12  (“Reply ”).  However, Plaintiff ’s harm  is aimed  toward Mr. Conner , no longer a \ndefendant in this case,  and how Mr. Conner may ha ve handled Plaintiff ’s business plan and non -\ndisclosure agreement.  This assertion still does not support a showing that GV Defendants Case 5:18-cv-04327-EJD   Document 130   Filed 05/14/19   Page 6 of 8 \nCase No.: 5:18-cv-04327 -EJD \nORDER GRANTING GV DEFENDANTS’ MOTION TO DISMISS  \n 7 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  obtained any trade secrets through improper means such as inducing Mr. Conner to breach any \nconfidentiality agreement.  Even if the Court construed Plaintiff’s statements  of wrongful \nacquisition  liberally , Plaintiff ’s claim still fails on the element of use.  \nPlaintiff ’s original  statements that GV Defendants put his alleged trade secrets to use are \npurely speculative and lac k any cognizable legal theory.  In fact, Plaintiff ’s SAC has retracted \nfrom claiming any such use and now claims that GV Defendants will use in the future .  For \nexample, Plaintiff  originally  claimed injury from exposure of his patent ideas “to a large, cas h \nrich, competitor [GV] without the benefit of the Mutual Non -Disclosure Agreement. ”  Compl. at \n16.  Plaintiff then implied that because a month later  Google took Plaintiff ’s trade secrets from \nMr. Conner at the alleged meeting in October , Google  “had made a move to artificially intelligent \nsolutions in its Cloud platform and that Google  invested $4.5M on artificial intelligence research \nin Montreal .”  Compl. at 6.  This inference was not enou gh to show misappropriation and the \nCour t provide d Plaintiff an opportunity to allege more facts to support his theory.  Plaintiff has not \nonly failed to add any facts to support his theory in his SAC, he now appears to retract his \nstatement that GV Defendants are using his alleged trade secret s at all.  Plaintiff now states in his \nSAC that “[t]he notion that Google, in either regard, is making use of artificial intelligence at all is \nquestionable. ”  SAC at 4.  Plaintiff further alleges and repeats that “[a]t the final adjudication of \nthe instant action including all appeals ” Defendants will conclude and “have already concluded \nthat the best means of performing video search on Google TV is by the use of Plaintiff ’s classical \nform of artificial intelligence. ”  SAC at 14.  Plaintiff states no where in his SAC that GV \nDefendants, or any other defendants in this action, are using his alleged trade secrets.  Only that \nthey will in the future.   \nAccordingly,  in addition to a lack of ownership,  Plaintiff fails to state a claim of \nmisappropriation against GV Defendants . \nB. Leave to Amend  \nIf the court concludes that the complaint should be dismissed, it must then decide whether \nto grant leave to amend.  “[A] district court should grant leave to amend even if no request to Case 5:18-cv-04327-EJD   Document 130   Filed 05/14/19   Page 7 of 8 \nCase No.: 5:18-cv-04327 -EJD \nORDER GRANTING GV DEFENDANTS’ MOTION TO DISMISS  \n 8 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  amend the pleading was made, unl ess it determines that the pleading could not possibly be cured \nby the allegation of other facts. ”  Lopez v. Smith , 203 F.3d 1122, 1130  (9th Cir. 2000)  (quoting \nDoe v. United States , 58 F.3d 494, 497 (9th Cir. 1995 )).  Leave to amend can be properly denied \nwhere the amendment of the complaint  would cause the opposing party undue prejudice, is sought \nin bad faith, constitutes an exercise in futility, or creates undue delay.  Foman v. Davis , 371 U.S. \n178, 182 (1962); Janicki Logging Co. v. Mateer , 42 F.3d 561, 566 (9th Cir. 1994).   Based on the \nrepetitive nature of Plaintiff ’s SAC, his continued failure to describe ownership of any trade \nsecret, and his retracted statements on use, the Court finds that a third amended complaint w ould \nconstitute an exercise in futility and will cause the opposing party undue prejudice.  Thus, Plaintiff \nwill not be given leave to amend.  \nIV. CONCLUSION AND ORDER  \nFor the reasons stated, GV Defendant ’s motion to dismiss Plaintiff ’s Second Amended \nComplaint is GRANTED without leave to amend.  \nIT IS SO ORDERED.  \nDated:  May 14,  2019   \n______________________________________  \nEDWARD J.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: In the case of Mullen Industries LLC v. Meta Platforms, Inc., Mullen alleges that Meta's augmented and virtual reality systems infringe twelve of its patents, focusing on patent claims related to wireless telephones, artificial intelligence (AI), and landscape characteristics. Meta filed a motion to dismiss claims regarding seven of these patents, arguing implausibility and lack of specificity in Mullen's claims, especially pertaining to AI and the concept of \"landscape characteristics\" in virtual playfields. The court recommended dismissing Counts II and VII, related to AI usage and wireless telephone functionality, with prejudice while allowing the other counts to proceed, denying Mullen the opportunity to amend its complaint further.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether Mullen's complaint sufficiently alleges the infringement of its patents by Meta's products, particularly through specific uses of AI and the classification of devices capable of location-based game functionalities.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court recommended dismissing with prejudice the claims concerning wireless telephones and AI due to lack of plausibility and specificity in Mullen’s allegations, while allowing counts related to landscape characteristics to proceed, requiring further claim construction. Mullen was denied the opportunity to amend the dismissed claims, as the court considered additional amendments futile given their failure to address deficiencies in prior attempts.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine Meta and Mullen are arguing about whether Meta's cool new virtual reality gadgets copy Mullen's patented ideas. Mullen says Meta is using tech that includes some phone-like functions and smart computer-controlled characters from their patents. Meta thinks Mullen didn’t explain well enough how their gadgets do this copying. The court mostly sides with Meta, saying Mullen didn't make a strong enough case in some areas, like pretending VR headsets are phones or how exactly the AI is working. The court lets some other arguments stay in the sense they need more looking into, and Mullen can't change their arguments again for the two parts they got wrong.",

EZRA  \nUNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE  \nBefore th e Court are Defendant  Meta Platforms, Inc.’s Partial Motion to Dismiss First \nAmended Complaint (Dkt. 19) for Failure to State a Claim under Rule 12(B)(6), filed July 31, \n2024 (Dkt. 23); Plaintiff Mullen Industries LLC’s Response, filed August 9, 2024 (Dkt. 24); and \nDefendant  Meta ’s Reply, filed August 16, 2024 (Dkt. 25). By Text Order entered  August 19, 2024 , \nthe District Court referred the motion to this Magistrate  Judge for a report and recommendation, \npursuant to 28  U.S.C. §  636(b)(1)(B), Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 72, and Rule 1(d) of \nAppendix C of the Local Court Rules  of the United States District Court for the Western District \nof Texas  (“Local Rules”) . \nIn its First Amended Complaint (Dkt. 19), Plaintiff Mullen Industries LLC alleges that \nDefendant Meta Platforms, Inc.’s augmented and virtual reality systems (“Accused Products”) \ninfringe twelve of its patents.1 Meta moves to dismiss Mullen’s claims as to seven of those patents.  \n \n1 U.S. Patent Nos. 8,585,476 (“’476 Patent”), 9,662,582 (“’582 Patent”), 9,744,448 (“’448 Patent”), \n10,179,277 (“’277 Patent”), 10,828,559 (“’559 Patent”), 10,967,270 (“’270 Patent”), 10,974,151 \n(“’151  Patent”), 11,033,821 (“’821 Patent”), 11,376,493 (“’493 Patent”), 11,904,243 (“’243 Patent”), \n11,947,716 (“’716 Patent”), and 12,019,791 (“’791 Patent” ). Case 1:24-cv-00354-DAE     Document 45     Filed 11/14/24     Page 1 of 132 I. Motion to Dismiss  \nA. Legal Standards  \nWhile Federal Circuit law governs substantive issues of patent law, the law of the respective \nregional circuit governs the procedural issue whether to grant or deny a motion to dismiss. Disc \nDisease Sols. Inc. v. VGH Sols., Inc. , 888 F.3d 1256, 1259 (Fed. Cir. 2018); Grecia Est. Holdings \nLLC v. Meta Platforms, Inc. , 605 F. Supp. 3d 905, 910 (W.D. Tex. 2022).  \nRule 12(b)(6) allows a party to move to dismiss an action for failure to state a claim on which \nrelief can be granted. In deciding a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, the \ncourt  “accepts all well -pleaded facts as true, viewing them in the light most favorable to the \nplaintiff.” In re Katrina Canal Breaches Litig. , 495 F.3d 191, 205 (5th  Cir. 2007) (internal \nquotation marks omitted). The Supreme Court has explained that a complaint must contain \nsufficient factual matter to “state a  claim to relief that is plausible on its face.” Ashcroft v. Iqbal , \n556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) (quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly , 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007)). “A \nclaim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw \nthe reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.” Id.  \nWhile a complaint attacked by a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss does not \nneed detailed factual allegations, a plaintiff’s obligation to provide the \ngrounds of his entitlement to relief requires more than labels and \nconclusions, and a formulaic recitation o f the elements of a cause of action \nwill not do. Factual allegations must be enough to raise a right to relief \nabove the speculative level, on the assumption that all the allegations in the \ncomplaint are true (even if doubtful in fact).  \nTwombly , 550 U.S. at 555 (cleaned up).  Motion s to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) are viewed with \ndisfavor and rarely granted. Hodge v. Engleman , 90 F.4th 840, 843  (5th Cir. 20 24). \nIn patent cases , a complaint must place the alleged infringer on notice of what activity is being \naccused of infringement.  Lifetime  Indus.,  Inc. v. Trim -Lok, Inc., 869 F.3d 1372,  1379  (Fed.  Cir. \n2017) . This evaluation will “be a context -specific task that requires the reviewing court to draw on Case 1:24-cv-00354-DAE     Document 45     Filed 11/14/24     Page 2 of 133 its judicial experience and common sense.”  Iqbal , 556 U.S. at 679.  “This standard ‘simply calls \nfor enough facts to raise a reasonable expectation that discovery will reveal evidence of’ the \nnecessary claims or elements.”  In re S. Scrap Material  Co., 541 F.3d 584, 587 (5th Cir. \n2008)  (quoting  Twombly , 550 U.S. at 556 ).  \nIn Bot M8 LLC v. Sony Corp. of Am., 4 F.4th 1342, 1352 (Fed. Cir. 2021), the Federal Circuit \nembraced a flexible pleading standard for direct infringement, inquiring “whether the factual \nallegations in the complaint are sufficient to show that the plaintiff has a plausible claim for relief. ” \nThe court explained that:  \nThe level of detail required in any given case will vary depending upon a \nnumber of factors, including the complexity of the technology, the \nmateriality of any given element to practicing the asserted claim(s), and the \nnature of the allegedly infringing device.  \nAccordingly, a plaintiff cannot assert a plausible claim for infringement \nunder the  Iqbal /Twombly  standard by reciting the claim elements and \nmerely concluding that the accused product has those elements. There must \nbe some factual allegations that, when taken as true, articulate why it is \nplausible that the accused product infringes the patent claim.  \nId. at 1353 .  \nAn element -by-element pleading of fact for each asserted patent claim is not required , Sesaco  \nCorp.  v. Equinom  Ltd., No. 1:20 -CV-1053 -LY, 2022 WL 1546642, at *1 (W.D. Tex. Mar. 11, \n2022) , but: “To state a viable direct infringement claim, a plaintiff must plead facts that plausibly \nsuggest that the accused product meets each limitation of the asserted claim or claims.” Encoditech, \nLLC v. Citizen Watch Co. of Am., Inc. , No. SA -18-CV-1335 -XR, 2019 WL 2 601347, at *3 \n(W.D.  Tex. June 25, 2019) . Under any standar d, “the complaint must support is entitlement to \nrelief with ‘factual content,’ not just conclusory allegations that the accused product(s) meet every \nclaim limitation.” Vervain, LLC v. Michron Tech., Inc. , No. 6:21 -cv-00487 -ADA, 2022 WL \n23469 , at * 2 (W.D. Tex. Jan. 3, 2022) (quoting Bot M8 , 4 F.4th at 1353).  Case 1:24-cv-00354-DAE     Document 45     Filed 11/14/24     Page 3 of 134 In determining whether a plaintiff ’s claims survive a  Rule  12(b)(6)  motion to dismiss, the \nfactual information to which the court addresses its inquiry is limited to the (1) facts set forth in \nthe complaint, (2) documents attached to the complaint, and (3) matters of which judicial notice \nmay be taken under  Federal  Rule  of Evidence  201. Walker v. Beaumont Indep. Sch. Dist. , 938 F.3d \n724, 735 (5th Cir. 2019 ). The Court considers the complaint and attached patents and claim char ts. \nB. Analysis  \n1. “Wireless Telephone” – Count VII  \nClaim 1 of t he ’151 Patent recites a system comprising  “a wireless telephone having a locating \ndevice and a display, wherein a location -based video game is operable to be played on said wireless \ntelephone.”  ’151 Patent, 23:58 -62, Dkt. 19 -7. Meta contrasts this claim  with claim 1 of the ’476 \nand ’448 Patents , which claim a “head -mounted display” and “head -mounted device,” \nrespectively. The Accused Products are Meta’s gaming headsets. Dkt. 23 at 17 (citing Dkt. 19 \n¶ 236). Meta asserts: “The complaint nonsensically asserts a claim requiring a ‘wireless telephone ’ \nagainst Meta’s virtual reality gaming headsets. A wireless telephone is not a virtual reality headset:  \n \nNothing in the claim language, specification, file history, or common sense suggests that a \n‘wireless telephone’ is a virtual reality headset.” Dkt. 23 at 17 (citation omitted) . Meta notes  that \nthe application was filed in 2006 and th e claim is directed to games on a wireless telephone, like \nthe “Sprint VISION PCS wireless telephone” from the 2000s. ’151 Patent, 2:11 -14, Dkt. 19 -7. \nCase 1:24-cv-00354-DAE     Document 45     Filed 11/14/24     Page 4 of 135 Mullen  argues in respons e that it plausibly pleads the Accused Products are wireless telephones \nbecause Meta’s Messenger instant messaging software application is preinstalled on them, \nallowing them to make calls. Dkt.  24 at 14 -15; Dkt. 19 ¶  241 (“ Each of the Meta AR/VR systems \nincludes, and is, a wireless telephone. For example, each Meta AR/VR system includes Meta’s \nMessenger application, which makes the Meta AR/VR system a wireless telephone because it \nallows a user of the Meta AR/VR system to ma ke telep hone calls wirelessly. ”). Mullen submits \ndictionary definitions of “telephone” and “telephony” in support of its argument that the Accused \nProducts “are plausibly, if not undeniably, wireless telephones.” Id. at 15 ; Dkts. 24 -3, 24 -4. Meta \nargues in reply that “Mullen’s ‘wireless telephone’ claim cannot be plausibly read to cover instant \nmessaging software on a virtual reality headset.” Dkt. 25 at 9.  \nHaving reviewed the parties ’ arguments, the specification, and the portions of the prosecution \nhistory submitted with  the briefing, this Magistrate Judge agrees with Meta that no claim \nconstruction is needed to find that Mullen has not plausibly alleged that the Accused Products are \na “wireless telephone.” See, e.g. , Ottah v. Fiat Chrysler , 884 F.3d 1135,  1141 (Fed. Cir. 2018) \n(affirming dismissal of claim that  camera holders infringed a patent for a book holder ; district court  \nstated  that the fact that the  book holder “c ould be used to hold a camera does not make it the \nequivalent of a mobile camera ”); Contiguity, LLC v. Conduent Bus. Servs., LLC , No. W -23-CV-\n00038 -XR, 2024 WL 252068, at *2 (W.D. Tex.

Tex. Apr. 7, 2017).  \nAccepting as true the allegations in the First Amended C omplaint  and construing the facts \nfavorably to Mullen , the Court finds that this infringement allegation is implausible on its fac e. \nThis Magistrate  Judge recommends that the District Court grant Meta’ s motion to dismiss for \nfailure to state a claim  as to Count VII .  \n2. “Artificial Intelligence” – Count II  \nClaim 1 of the ’582 Patent re quires a virtual playfield, a first character, and “a second character, \nwherein said second character is computer controlled via artificial intelligence and said artificial \nintelligence utilizes said first control signal from said first locating device for con trolling, at least \nin part, said second character.” ’582 Patent, 24:4 -8, Dkt. 19 -2.  \nMeta argues that Mullen “was obligated to identify what is the accused ‘artificial intelligence’ \nin the accused products” but does not plausibly plead  the claimed “artificial intelligence ” because  \nit “fails to allege where and how the accused products are using the claimed ‘artificial intelligence ’ \nwhich uses ‘said first control signal from said first locating device for controlling, at least in part, \nsaid second character. ’” Dkt. 25 at 10-11. \nMullen responds that it sufficiently pleads, for example, that the claimed “’artificial \nintelligence ’ is programmed into the Meta AR/VR system [Accused Products] and determines or \nchanges the position of the second character ’s head or eye movements based on, for example, the \nuser’s position on the playfield. ” Dkt. 19 ¶  116. Mullen also argues that it plausibly demonstrates \nthat the Accused Products include the claimed “artificial intelligence” by including three sets of \nannotated comparisons of screen shots  from an Accused Product “ that depict the claimed ‘second \ncharacter ’ having its head or eye movement determined by artificial intelligence based on the \nposition of a player ,” including : Case 1:24-cv-00354-DAE     Document 45     Filed 11/14/24     Page 6 of 137  \nDkt. 24 at 18; Dkt. 19 ¶  116.  \nFinally, Mullen states that it will  provide more detail about the allegedly infringing “artificial \nintelligence” in its infringement contentions after receiving discovery from Meta “because the \nadditional details that Meta now demands are presently in Meta ’s sole possession and are not \npublicly available. ” Dkt. 24 at 20.  Cases Mullen cites include British Telecomms. PLC v. \nIAC/InterActiveCorp , 381 F. Supp. 3d 293, 301 (D. Del. 2019) , in which the court denied a m otion \nto dismiss because requiring a complain t to include information not in the public domain is “a \nmore rigorous pleading standard than the law imposes ,” and DoDots Licensing Sols. LLC v. Lenovo \nHolding Co. , No. 18 -098 (MN), 2018 WL 6629709 , at * 3 n.3 (D.  Del. Dec. 19, 2018) ( finding \nallegations plausible and stating that “ Plaintiff would have no insight into Defendants ’ internal \nactivities at the pleading stage ”).  \nAgain a ccepting as true the allegations in the First Amended C omplaint  and construing the \nfacts favorably to Mullen , the Court finds that Mullen has not plausibly alleged that “ artificial \nintelligence utilizes said first control signal from said first locating device for controlling, at least \nin part, said second character ,” as required by Claim 1. Mullen thus has not plead facts plausibly \nsuggesting that the Accused Products meet “each limitation of the asserted claim.” Encoditech, \nCase 1:24-cv-00354-DAE     Document 45     Filed 11/14/24     Page 7 of 138 2019 WL 2601347, at *3. This Magistrate  Judge recommends that the District Court grant Meta’ s \nmotion to dismiss for failure to state a claim  as to Count II .  \n3. “Landscape Characteristics” – Counts I, III -V, and IX  \nThe remaining counts Meta moves to dismiss assert the ’476, ’448, ’277, ’559, and ’493 \nPatents. All are titled “Location -Based Games and Augmented Reality Systems” and share a \ncommon specification in claim 1 requiring a detector that determines “landscape characteristics” \nof a physical playfield. ’476 patent, 21:15 -16, Dkt. 19 -1; ’448 patent, 21:49 -50, Dkt. 19 -3; ’277 \npatent, 21:51 -52, Dkt. 19 -4; ’559 patent, 21:48 -59, Dkt. 19 -5; ’493 patent, 21:55 -22:1, Dkt. 19 -9.  \nIn the introduction to the Amended Complaint, Mullen explains that the Asserted Patents \naddress ed problems with then -existing virtual reality systems, including safety issues posed by \nmoving in a physical environment a VR user could not see. Dkt. 19 ¶  4.  \nFor example, “[a] landscape detector may be provided with a \nlocation -based game system such that information on the physical \nterrain of the user’s physical environment may be utilized by the \ngaming system.” [’476 Patent]  at 4:8 -11. The landscape detector \nmay determine, for example, the locations of walls, objects, doors, \nand pathways. Id. at 14:39 -42, 15:49 -54, 20:8 -9. \nId. The ’476 Patent includes this description of Figure 4: “ Landscape detector 451 may be provided \nin such a system such that the location of actual environmental objects may be determined and \nutilized in the game. In environment 410, environmental objects 411 and 412 are present. ”  \n \nCase 1:24-cv-00354-DAE     Document 45     Filed 11/14/24     Page 8 of 139 ’476 Patent, 14:39 -42 & Fig. 4, Dkt. 19 -1. \nIn Count I, asserting infringement of the ’476 Patent, Mullen alleges that the Accused Products \nare “capable of displaying images generated by the Meta gaming system for display together with \na user’s view of the real world, thus providing a composite view of both virtual images and real -\nworld images ,” including “a head -mounted display that overlays virtual indicia onto a physical \nplayfield.” Dkt. 19  ¶¶ 55, 60. Mullen also alleges that the Accused Products include “ a locating \ndevice that determines the physical location of said locating device on the physical playfield, \nwherein said video game logic utilizes the physical location of said locating device in providing \nsaid video game. ” Id. ¶ 85.   \nMeta argues that “the complaint is devoid of any plausible allegations of the claimed \n‘landscape  characteristics ’ in the accused Meta products.” Dkt. 23 at 11. Meta  contends that,  \n“[c]onsistent with the word landscape , the specification repeatedly emphasizes the “physical \nterrain .” Id. at 9. Rather than identifying any landscape characteristics, Meta argues , Mullen’s \nallegations “ all focus on interiors of the ‘user’s room, ’ i.e., ‘the location  of the floors, walls, and \nceiling ’ – no objects are identified, let alone environmental objects in the physical terrain of the \nphysical playfield .” Id. at 11.   \nMullen’s allegations about the location of the ceiling or floor inside \na room cannot be squared with the patent specifications, which state \nthat the “[l]andscape detector 451” determines “the location of \nenvironmental objects  411 and 412,” which in the patents are \nillustrated by a brick wall and a tree in the physical terrain of the \nphysical playfield [.] \nDkt. 25 at 6 (citing ’476 Patent, Fig. 4, shown above). Meta argues that the claimed “landscape \ncharacteristics” are “ physical objects in the physical terrain that can be interacted with or hidden \n(e.g., a tree, brick wall, skyscraper), not the location of the ceiling or the floor inside a room. ” Id. \nAs an example from the Amended Complaint, Meta cites this image of a user’s room : Case 1:24-cv-00354-DAE     Document 45     Filed 11/14/24     Page 9 of 1310  \nDkt. 19 ¶  141. Meta contrasts Mullen’s assertion that the landscape detector may determine the \nlocations of “walls, objects, doors, and pathways” with the ’476 Patent’s specification  of  \n“‘environmental objects  411 and 412’” in the outdoor physical terrain  of the physical playfield, \nsuch as a brick wall and a tree.” Dkt. 23 at 16.  \nMullen argues in response that Meta’s arguments constitute premature claim construction. \nMullen also contends that Meta’s position is incorrect because the Asserted Patents “never use the \nterm ‘outdoors’ even once, which further demonstrates that there is no support in the patents’ \nintrinsic record for Meta’s argument that the claimed ‘landscape characteristics’ can only be \ncharacteristics of the outdoors.’” Dkt. 24 at 13.  \nThe Court agrees with Mullen that whether the detector that determines “landscape \ncharacteristics” of a physical playfield claimed in the Asserted Patents encompasses  determination  \nof the room interiors alleged in the Amended Complaint is a question for claim construction. See, \ne.g., Pedersen v. Zoho Corp. , No. 1:23 -CV-71-DII, 2023 WL 3612333, at *2 (W.D. Tex. May 23, \n2023)  (denying motion to dismiss when defendant’s arguments “r equire the Court to interpret \nCase 1:24-cv-00354-DAE     Document 45     Filed 11/14/24     Page 10 of 1311 claim language, which is improper at this stage of the litigation ”); OBD Sensor Sols. LLC v. Track \nWhat Matters, L.L.C. , No. 2:22 -cv-00124 -JRG-RSP, 2023 WL 1827922, at *2 (E.D. Tex. Jan. 20, \n2023) (“T he general rule is that courts do not engage in claim construction at the pleadings stage \nunless it is clear that the claims cannot plausibly be construed to cover the accused \ninstrumentalities. ”), R. & R. adopted , 2023 WL 1818268 (E.D. Tex. Feb.  8, 2023) . This Magistrate \nJudge finds that Mullen’s allegations a s to Claims I, III -V, and IX meet the plausibility standard \nand offer fair notice of the infringement alleged and recommends that the District Court deny \nMeta’s motion to dismiss these claims.  \nII. Request for Leave  to Amend  \nIf any claims are dismissed, Mullen makes a “contingent request for leave to amend” its First \nAmended Complaint “ to supplement its pleadings on these counts in light of the Court ’s guidance. ” \nDkt. 24 at 21.  \nCourts should freely grant leave to amend when justice so requires. FED. R. CIV. P. 15(a)(2). \nCourts should deny leave to amend when amendment would cause undue delay or undue prejudice \nto the opposing party, or the amendment would be futile or in bad faith. Mayeaux v. La. Health \nServ. & Indem. Co. , 376 F.3d 420, 425 (5th  Cir. 2004). A n amendment is futile if it would fail to \nsurvive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion. Marucci Sports, L.L.C. v. Nat’l Collegiate Athletic Ass’n , 751 F.3d \n368, 378  (5th Cir. 20 14). \nMull en neither  submit s a proposed amended complaint nor describe s any additional facts  it \nwould plead to cure the defects in its First Amended Complaint. And Mullen has already amended \nits complaint once in response to Meta’s first partial motion to dismiss, which raised the same \nissues as Meta’s instant motion but was dismissed as moot after Mullen amended its complaint. \nDkt. 14; Text Order entered July 18 , 2024.  Case 1:24-cv-00354-DAE     Document 45     Filed 11/14/24     Page 11 of 1312 Because Mullen has already amended its complaint once and does not apprise the Court of \nfacts it would plead to cure these deficiencies, the Court recommends that Mullen’s request for \nleave to amend be denied with prejudice as futile. See Edionwe v. Bailey , 860 F.3d 287, 294 \n(5th Cir. 2017) (holding that leave to amend is not required where movant fails to apprise court of  \nfacts it would plead in amended complaint to cure any deficiencies); see also Local Rule CV -7(b) \n(requiring that executed copy of a prop osed pleading be filed as an exhibit to a motion for leave).  \nIII. Recommendation  \nFor the se reasons , this Magistrate  Judge RECOMMENDS that the District Court  GRANT IN \nPART and DENY IN PART Defendant  Meta Platforms, Inc.’s Partial Motion to Dismiss First \nAmended Complaint (Dkt.  19) for Failure to State a Claim under Rule 12(B)(6) (Dkt. 23). This \nMagistrate Judge recommends that the District Court GRANT the motion to dismiss for failure to \nstate a claim  as to Count s II and  VII and dismiss th ose claims  with prejudice and DENY the \nmotion as to Counts I, III , IV, V, and IX .  \nThe Court further RECOMMENDS that the District Court DENY Plaintiff’s contingent \nrequest for leave to amend with prejudice to refiling (Dkt. 24 at 17). \nIT IS  ORDERED  that the Clerk REMOVE  this case from th is Magistrate Judge ’s docket and \nRETURN  it to the docket of the Honorable David A. Ezra . \nIV. Warnings  \nThe parties may file objections to this Report and Recommendation. A party filing objections \nmust specifically identify those findings or recommendations to which objections are being made. \nThe District Court need not consider frivolous, conclusive, or gen eral objections. See Battle v. \nUnited States Parole Comm’n , 834 F.2d 419, 421 (5th Cir. 1987).

    "summary": "1. **Summary:** In the case of *Thaler v. Perlmutter*, the court considered whether a non-human machine (specifically an AI-created by Dr. Stephen Thaler) could be an author under the Copyright Act of 1976. Dr. Thaler attempted to register a copyright for an artwork created by his AI, the \"Creativity Machine,\" listing the machine as the sole author. The U.S. Copyright Office denied the application based on its longstanding human-authorship requirement, and both the district court and the appellate court upheld this decision, affirming that the Copyright Act mandates human authorship as a prerequisite for copyright protection.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue:** Whether a non-human, such as an artificial intelligence, can be deemed an \"author\" under the Copyright Act of 1976.\n\n3. **Court's Holding:** The appellate court held that, under the Copyright Act of 1976, a work must be authored by a human being to qualify for copyright protection. Since Dr. Thaler's AI, the \"Creativity Machine,\" is not human, it cannot be recognized as an author under the Act.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation:** Imagine you made a really cool drawing with the help of a robot friend, and now you want to say the robot is the artist. The problem here is the law says only humans can be considered artists when it comes to protecting drawings, songs, or stories (called copyright). So, even though the robot helped, the law insists a human should be the one who gets credit as the artist.",

Chapuis , Deputy General Counsel, U.S. \nCopyright Office.  \n \nBefore: MILLETT  and WILKINS , Circuit Judges , and \nROGERS , Senior Circuit Judge . \n \n \nOpinion for the Court filed by Circuit Judge  MILLETT .  \n \n MILLETT , Circuit Judge :  This case presents a question \nmade salient by recent advances in artificial intelligence:  Can \na non- human machine be an author under the Copyright Act of \n1976?   The use of a rtificial intelligence to produce original \nwork is rapidly increasing across industries and creative fields.  \nWho —or what —is the “author ” of such work  is a question that \nimplicates  important property rights undergirding economic \ngrowth and creative innovation.   \nIn this case , a computer scientist attributes authorship of \nan artwork  to the operation of software.  Dr. Stephen Thaler \ncreated  a generative artificial intelligence named the \n“Creativity Machine.”  The Creativity Machine made a picture  \nthat Dr. Thaler titled “A Recent  Entrance to Paradise.”  Dr. \nThaler submitted a copyright  registration  application for “A \nRecent  Entrance to Paradise” to the United States Copyright \nOffice .  On the application, Dr. Thaler listed the Creativity \nMachine as the work’s sole author and himself as just the \nwork’s owner.  \n  The Copyright Office denied Dr. Thaler’s application \nbased on its  established human- authorship requirement.  This \npolicy requires work to be authored in the first instance by a \nhuman being to be eligible for copyright registration .  Dr. USCA Case #23-5233      Document #2106229            Filed: 03/18/2025      Page 2 of 243 \n Thaler sought review of the Office’s decision in federal district \ncourt and that court affirmed.   \n  We affirm the denial of  Dr. Thaler’s copyright application.  \nThe Creativity Machine cannot be the recognized author  of a \ncopyrighted work because the Copyright Act of 1976 requires \nall eligible work to be authored in the first instance by a human \nbeing.  Given that holding, we need not address the Copyright Office’s argument that  the Constitution itself requires human \nauthorship of all copyrighted material .  Nor do we reach Dr. \nThaler’s argument that he is the work’s author by virtue of making and us ing the Creativity Machin e because that \nargument w as waived before the agency . \n \nI \n \nA \n  The Constitution’s Intellectual Property Clause  gives \nCongress authority to “promote the Progress of Science and  \nuseful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and \nDiscover ies[.]”  U.S. C\nONST . Art. I, §  8, cl. 8.   Under that \nprovision, f ederal copyright protection extends only as far as \nCongress designates by statute .  Wheaton v. Peters , 33 U.S. \n591, 661 (1834) . \n \nCopyright law incentivizes  the creation of original works  \nso they can be use d and enjoyed by the public .  Since the \nfounding, Congress has given authors short term monopolies \nover their  original  work.  See Act of May 31, 1790, ch. 15, 1st \nCong., 1 Stat. 124.  This  protection is not  extended as “a special \nreward”  to the author, but rather “to encourage the production \nof works that others might reproduce more cheaply.”  Google LLC v. Oracle Am., Inc., 593 U.S. 1, 16 (2021).  By ensuring USCA Case #23-5233      Document #2106229            Filed: 03/18/2025      Page 3 of 244 \n that easily reproducible work is protected, individuals are \nincentivized to  undertake the effort of creating original  work s \nthat otherwise would be  easily plagiarized . \n \n The Copyright  Act of 1976 is the current  federal  copyright \nstatute .  Three of its pr ovisions  are relevant  here.  \n  First, the  Copyright Act preempt s state common law \ncopyright protection by immediately vesting federal copyright \nownership in a work’s author  as soon as a work is created.   17 \nU.S.C. §§ 102(a); 201(a) ; 301(a) .  Although domestic author s \ngenerally must register their  copyright s to exercise other rights, \nlike the right to sue for infringement, id. § 411(a) , the right to \nown a copyright does not depend on registration or publication.  \n  Second, the Copyright Act incentivizes authors by \nprotecting their work “for a term consisting of the life of the author and 70 years after the author’s death.”  17 U.S.C. § 302(a).  In that way, a uthors  are encouraged to produce work \nbecause they  know  that they can  profit  from it  for their entire \nlife and that their heirs and assigns  can continue to benefit  for \nseven decades there after.  \n  Third, individuals and organizations can own copyrights \nby hiring someone to create work.  The Copyright Act’s  work -\nmade- for-hire provision allows “the employer or other person \nfor whom the work was prepared” to be “considered the author” and “ own[] all of the rights comprised in the \ncopyright.”  17 U.S.C. § 201(b).  Rather than enduring for the author’s lifetime, a work -made- for-hire copyright lasts “95 \nyears from the year of its first publication, or a term of 120 years from the year of its creation, whichever expires first.”  Id. § 302(c).    \n  USCA Case #23-5233      Document #2106229            Filed: 03/18/2025      Page 4 of 245 \n B \n \n The Copyright Act is administered by the  United States  \nCopyright Office.  17 U.S.C. § 701(a).   That Office has a duty \nto “[a]dvise Congress” on issues “relating to copyright,” to “[p]rovide information and assistance” to “Federal departments and agencies and the Judiciary,” and to “[c]onduct \nstudies and programs regarding copyright[.]”  Id. § 701(b)(1), \n(2), (4).    \n \nIn addition, t he Copyright Office  has authority to establish \nregulations  to implement the Copyright Act .  17 U.S.C. § 702.  \nPursuant to that authority, the Copyright Office issues regulations  governing the “conditions for the registration of \ncopyright, and the application to be made for registration[.]” 37 \nC.F.R. § 202.3(a)(1).  The Copyright Office publishes the se \nregistration regulations in the  Compendium of Copyright Office \nPractices to inform authors about  registration  criteria  for \ndifferent types of  work .  See Copyright Office, Compendium of \nU.S. Copyright Office Practices (3d ed. 2021), https://perma.cc/9N9N -C3VU ( Compendium Third Edition) . \n Individuals  whose registration applications  are denied  can \nseek reconsideration by the  Copyright Office’s  Registration \nProgram .  If still dissatisfied, they can ask the Copyright \nOffice’s Review Board  to reconsider  their case.   37 C.F.R. \n§ 202.5(b), (c).  A decision by the Review Board  “constitutes \nfinal agency action,” i d. § 202.5(g), and is reviewable under the \nAdministrative Procedure Act,  5 U.S.C. § 704;  17 U.S.C. \n§ 701(e).  \n Copyright Office  regulations  have  long required that any \nregistered work be authored by a human .  See Copyright Office,  \nCompendium of Copyright Office Practices  § 2.8.3(I), \n(I)(a)(1)(b) (1st ed. 1973), https://perma.cc/J7ML -BZK6  USCA Case #23-5233      Document #2106229            Filed: 03/18/2025      Page 5 of 246 \n (Compendium First Edition) (“[N]othing can be considered the \n‘writing of an author’” unless it owes its “origin to a human \nagent[.]”);  Copyright Office, Compendium of Copyright Office \nPractices  § 202.02(b) (2d ed. 1984), https://perma.cc/52MX -\n6YPD ( Compendium Second Edition)  (“The term “authorship”  \nimplies that, for a work to be copyrightable, it must owe its origin to a human being.”).  The current Compendium advises  \nthat the Copyright Office  “will refuse to register a claim if it \ndetermines that a human being did not create the work.”  Compendium Third Edition § 306.  Th at refusal extends to \nwork s “produced by a machine or mere mechanical process \nthat operates randomly or automatically without any creative input or intervention from a human author.”  Id. § 313.2              \n \nC \n \n1 \n \nDr. Thaler is a computer scientist who  creates and works \nwith artificial intelligence systems , Thaler Opening Br. ii,  and \nwho invented the Creativity Machine , id. 43-44.  On May 19, \n2019, Dr. Thaler  submitted a copyright registration application \nto the Copyright Office for a n artwork  titled “A Recent  \nEntrance to Paradise.”   J.A. 43.  On the application, Dr. Thaler \nlisted the “Author” of that work as the “Creativity Machine. ”  \nJ.A. 43.  Under “Copyright Claimant ,” Dr. Thaler provided his \nown name .  J.A. 43.  In the section  labeled “Author Created,” \nDr. Thaler wrote “2 -D artwork, Created autonomously by \nmachine.”  J.A. 43.  \n  The Copyright Office denied Dr. Thaler’s application \nbecause “a human being did not create the work.”  J.A. 45.  The letter cited the Supreme Court’s decision in Burrow -Giles \nLithographic Co. v. Sarony , 111 U.S. 53 (1884) , in support  of \nits decision .  J.A. 45.   USCA Case #23-5233      Document #2106229            Filed: 03/18/2025      Page 6 of 247 \n  \nIn seekin g reconsideration  by the Registration Program , \nDr. Thaler acknowledged the Copyright Office’s decision “was \nmade on the basis that the present submission lacks human authorship[.]”  J.A. 49.  Dr. Thaler confirmed this “is  correct” \nand “that the present submission lacks traditional human authorship—it was autonomously generated by an AI.”  J.A. 49.  Dr. Thaler then argued that “the Human Authorship \nRequirement is unconstitutional and unsupported by either statute or case law.”  J.A. 49.  Dr. Thaler claimed  judicial \nopinions “from the Gilded Age” could not settle  the question \nof whether computer generated works are  copyright able today.  \nJ.A. 55.    The Registration Program again denied Dr. Thaler’s \napplication because the work lacked “sufficient creative input \nor intervention from a human author.”  J.A. 59.   \n \nIn his request for reconsideration by the Review Board , Dr. \nThaler  reaffirmed that  “the present submission lacks traditional \nhuman authorship—it was autonomously generated by an AI.”  \nJ.A. 63.  He  then reiterated his constitutional, statutory, and \npolicy arguments against the human- authorship requirement.  \nJ.A. 63- 69.  Dr. Thaler  also argued he should own the copyright \nunder the work -made- for-hire doctrine because “non- human, \nartificial persons such as companies can already be authors \nunder this doctrine.”  J.A. 66.   The Review Board affirmed the denial of Dr. Thaler’s \ncopyright application based on the human- authorship \nrequirement.  J.A. 73.  The Board relied upon Dr. Thaler’s \n“representation that the Work was autonomously created by artificial intelligence without any creative contribution from a human actor[.]”  J.A. 72.  The Board also rejected Dr. Thaler’s \nargument that the work was made for hire on the ground that USCA Case #23-5233      Document #2106229            Filed: 03/18/2025      Page 7 of 248 \n there was no contract between Dr. Thaler and the Creativity \nMachine.  J.A. 76- 77. \n \n2 \n  Dr. Thaler sought review in the United States D istrict \nCourt for the District of Columbia, and  both sides  moved for \nsummary judgment.  Thaler v. Perlmutter , 687 F. Supp. 3d 140, \n142 (D.D.C. 2023) .  In his motion, Dr. Thaler asserted  the same \nconstitutional, statutory, and policy arguments that he had \nadvanced before the agency, including the argument that he \nowns the copyright under the work -made -for-hire provision.   \nJ.A. 80-115.  In addition, he  claimed  for the first time that the \nwork is copyrightable be cause a hu man—Dr. Thaler —\n“provided instructions and directed his AI [.]”  J.A. 113. \n \n The district court affirmed the Copyright Office ’s denial \nof registration .  Based on  the caselaw and  the Copyright Act’s  \ntext, the district court concluded that “ [h]uman authorship is a \nbedrock requirement of copyright.”  Thaler , 687 F. Supp. 3d at  \n146.  The court also held that Dr . Thaler  could not rely on the \nwork -made -for-hire provision because that provision \n“presuppose [s] that an interest exists to be claimed.”  Id. at 150.  \nThe “image autonomously generated” by the Creativity \nMachine was not such an i nterest because it “was never eligible \nfor copyright,” so the Machine had no copyright  to transfer to  \nDr. Thaler even if he were the Creativity Machine’s employer.   \nId.  Finally, the court found that Dr. Thaler waived his \nargument that he should own the copyright because he created \nand used the Creativity Machine.  The court stressed that, “ [o]n \nthe record designed by plaintiff from the outset of his application for copyright  registration, ” the case had present ed \n“only the question of whether a work generated autonomously \nby a computer system is eligible for copyright .”  Id . at 149- 150.            \n  USCA Case #23-5233      Document #2106229            Filed: 03/18/2025      Page 8 of 249 \n II \n \nWe review a district court ’s grant of summary judgment in \na case concerning agency action de novo  and, like the district \ncourt, will set aside the agency action only if it is “ arbitrary, \ncapricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in \naccordance with law[.]’”  Jicarilla Apache Nation v. United States  Dep’t of Interior , 613 F.3d 1112, 1118 (D.C. Cir. 2010) \n(quoting 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A)).  We “exercise independent judgment in determining the meaning of statutory provisions.”  Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo, 603 U.S. 369, 394 \n(2024).  \n The district court had jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1331.  \nThis court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1291. \n \nIII \n  As a matter of statutory law, the Copyright Act  requires all \nwork  to be authored in the first instance by a human being.  Dr. \nThaler’s copyright  registration  application listed the Creativity \nMachine as the work’s sole author, even though the Creativity \nMachine is not a human being.  As a result, t he Copyright \nOffice  appropriate ly denied Dr. Thaler’s application. \n   \nA \n \nAuthors are at the center of the Copyright Act .  A \ncopyright “vests initially in the author or authors of the work.”  17 U.S.C. § 201(a).  And copyright protection only “subsist s \n* * * i n original works of authorship[.]”  Id. § 102(a).   \n The Copyright Act does not define the word “author.”   But \ntraditional tools of statutory interpretation  show that, within the \nmeaning of the Copyright Act , “author ” refers only to human USCA Case #23-5233      Document #2106229            Filed: 03/18/2025      Page 9 of 2410 \n beings.  To start , the text of m ultiple provisions of the statute \nindicate s that authors must be humans, not machines.  In \naddition, the Copyright Office  consistently  interpreted the \nword author to mean a human prior to the Copyright Act’s \npassage, and w e infer that Congress adopted the agency’s \nlongstanding interpretation  of the word “author ” when it re -\nenacted that term in the 1976 Copyright Act.   \n \n1 \n \nNumerous Copyright Act provisions both identify authors \nas human beings  and define “machines ” as tools used by \nhumans  in the creative process rather than as creators \nthemselves .  Because m any of the Copyright Act’s provisions \nmake sense only if an author is a human being, the best reading \nof the Copyright Act is that  human authorship is required for \nregistration .     \n \nFirst, the Copyright Act ’s ownership provision is \npremised on the  author ’s legal capacity to  hold property.  A \ncopyright “vests initially in the author[.]”  17 U.S.C. § 201(a).  \nThis means an “author gains ‘exclusive rights’ in her work immediately upon the work’ s creation.”  Fourth Est ate Pub. \nBenefit Corp. v. Wall -Street.com, LLC , 586 U.S. 296, 300- 301, \n(2019) (quoting 17 U.S.C. § 106).  Because a copyright is \nfundamentall y a property right created by Congress, and \nCongress specified that authors immediately own their copyrights, an entity  that cannot  own property cannot be an \nauthor  under the statute.  \n Second, the Copyright Act limits  the duration of a \ncopyright to the author’s lifespan or to a period that approximates how long a human might  live.  A copyright \ngenerally “endures for a term consisting of the life of the author and 70 years after the author’s death.”  17 U.S.C. § 302(a).  The USCA Case #23-5233      Document #2106229            Filed: 03/18/2025      Page 10 of 2411 \n Copyright Office maintains “current records of information \nrelating to the death of authors of copyrighted works” so that it can determine when copyrights expire.  Id. § 302(d).  If the \nauthor’s death is unknown, the Copyright Act presumes death after “a period of 95 years from the year of first publication of a work, or a period of 120 years from the year of its creation[.]”  Id. § 302( e).  And even when a corporation owns a copyright  \nunder the work- made- for-hire provision, the copyright endures \nfor the sa me amount of time —“95 years from the year of first \npublication” or “120 years from the year of its creation[.]”  Id. § 302(c).  Of course, machines do not have “lives” nor is the \nlength of their operability generally measured in the same terms as a human life.   \n       Third, the Copyright Act ’s inheritance provision states \nthat, when  an author dies, that person’s  “termination interest is \nowned, and may be exercised” by their “widow or widower,” or their “surviving children or grandchildren,” 17 U.S.C.  \n§ 203(a)(2), (A).  Machines , needless to say, have no surviving \nspouses or heirs .  \n \nFourth, copyright transfers require  a signature .  To transfer \ncopyright ownership, there must be “an instrument of conveyance” that is “signed by the owner[.]”  17 U.S.C. § 204(a).  Machines lack signatures , as well as the legal \ncapacity to provide an authenticating signature .  \n Fifth , authors of unpublished works are protected \nregardless of the author’s “nationality or domicile.”  17 U.S.C. § 104(a).  Machines do not have domiciles , nor do they have a \nnational identity.    \n Sixth , authors have intentions.  A joint work is one \n“prepared by two or more authors with the intention that their contributions be merged into inseparable or interdependent USCA Case #23-5233      Document #2106229            Filed: 03/18/2025      Page 11 of 2412 \n parts of a unitary whole.”  17 U.S.C. § 101.  Machines lack \nminds  and do not intend anything. \n \nSeventh , and by comparison, every time the Copyright Act \ndiscusses machines, the context indicates that machines are \ntools, not authors.  For example, the Copyright Act defines a “computer program” as “a set of statements or instruction s to \nbe used directly or indirectly” to “bring about a certain result.”  17 U.S.C. § 101.  The word “machine” is given the same \ndefinition  as the word s “device” and  “process ,” id., and those \nterms are consistently used  in the statute as mechanisms that \nassist authors, rather than as authors themselves, id . §§ 102(a) ; \n108(c)(2); 109(b)(1)(B)(i);  116(d)(1); 117(a)(1), (c); 401(a); \n1001(2), (3).  In addition, when computer programs and \nmachines are referenced in the statute, the statute presumes they have an “owner,” id. § 117(a), (c), who can perform \n“maintenance,” “servic[ e],” or “repair” on them, id. \n§ 117(d)(1), (2).          \n  All of these statutory provisions  collectively identify an \n“author ” as a human being.  Machines do not have  property, \ntraditional human lifespans, family members,  domiciles,  \nnationalities , mentes reae, or signatures .  By contrast, reading \nthe Copyright Act to require human authorship comports  with \nthe statute ’s text, structure, and design because humans have \nall the attributes the Copyright Act treats  authors as possessing.  \nThe human- authorship requirement , in short, eliminates the \nneed to  pound a square peg into a  textual  round hole by  \nattributing unprecedented and mismatched meanings to \ncommon words  in the Copyright Act .  See Food & Drug \nAdmin. v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 529 U.S. 120, 133 (2000) (“I t is a ‘ fundamental canon of statutory \nconstruction that the words of a statute must be read in their context and with a view to their place in the overall statutory USCA Case #23-5233      Document #2106229            Filed: 03/18/2025      Page 12 of 2413 \n scheme. ’”) (quoting Davis v. Michigan Dept. of Treasury , 489 \nU.S. 803, 809 (1989)) .   \n      \n To be clear, we do not hold that any one of those  statutory \nprovisions  states a necessary condition for someone to be the  \nauthor  of a copyright able work .  An author need not have \nchildren , nor a domicile, nor a conventional signature.  Even \nthe ability to own property has not always been required  for \ncopyright authorship.  Married women in the nineteenth \ncentury authored work that was eligible for copyright \nprotection even though coverture  laws forbade them from \nowning copyright s.  See Melissa Homestead, A MERICAN \nWOMEN AUTHORS AND LITERARY PROPERTY , 1822- 1869,  at \n21-62 (2005); Belford, Clarke & Co. v. Scribner , 144 U.S. 488, \n504 (1892)  (recogniz ing Mrs. Terhune’s authorship when her \nbook’s copyright was infringed, even though, as a married \nwoman , she could not own property) .   \n  The point , instead, is that the  current  Copyright Act’s text , \ntaken as a whole, is best read as making humanity  a necessary \ncondition for  authorship under the Copyright Act .  That is the \nreading to which  “the provisions of the whole law ” point.  John \nHancock Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Harris Tr. & Sav. Bank , 510 U.S. \n86, 94 (1993)  (quoting Pilot Life Ins. Co. v. Dedeaux , 481 U.S. \n41, 51 (1987) ). \n  \n2 \n  The Copyright Office’s longstanding rule requiring a \nhuman author reinforces the natural meaning of those statutory \nterms.   \n  The Copyright Office first addressed w hether machines \ncould be authors in 1966—ten years before the Copyright Act \nof 1976 was passed.  That year, the Register of C opyrights USCA Case #23-5233      Document #2106229            Filed: 03/18/2025      Page 13 of 2414 \n wrote  in the  Copyright Office’s  annual report to Congress  that, \nas “computer technology develops and becomes more \nsophisticated, difficult questions of authorship are emerging. * * * The crucial question appears to be whether the ‘work’ is basically one of human authorship, with the computer merely being an assisting instrument[.]”  Copyright Office, Sixty -\nEighth Annual  Report of the Register of Copyrights at  5 (1966) , \nhttps://perma.cc/QU7P -TY6N.  \n  The Copyright Office  formally adopted the human \nauthorship requirement  in 1973.  That year, the Copyright \nOffice updated  its regulations  to state explicitly that works \nmust  “owe their origin to a human agent [.]”  Compendium First \nEdition  § 2.8.3(I)(a)(1)(b).   \n  In 1974, Congress created the National Commission on \nNew Technological Uses of Copyrighted Works ( “CONTU” ) \nto study how copyright law should accommodate “the creation \nof new works by the application or intervention of such automatic systems or machine reproduction.”   Pub. L. 93- 573, \n§ 201(b)(2), 88 Stat. 1873 (1974).  CONTU assembled copyright experts from the government, academia, and the private sector  to make recommendations to Congress .  Prior to \nthe Copyright Act’s passage, the Library of Congress published summaries of CONTU’s meetings , several of which  focused on \ncopyright law and computer technology.  In none of these meetings  did members of  CONTU suggest that computers were \nauthors rather than tools used by authors to create original work.  See CONTU, Meeting No. 2 at 10-11  (Nov. 19, 1975), \nhttps://perma.cc/857K -VRSB; CONTU,  Meeting No. 3 at 1-11 \n(Dec. 18-19, 1975), https://perma.cc/EB3T -KNR4 ; CONTU, \nMeeting No. 4 at 1-8 ( Feb. 11-13, 1976), \nhttps://perma.cc/NPG6 -J8E3 ; CONTU, Meeting No. 6 (May 6 -\n7, 1976), https://perma.cc/HCX5 -6ZYX ; CONTU, Meeting USCA Case #23-5233      Document #2106229            Filed: 03/18/2025      Page 14 of 2415 \n No. 7 at 46-148 (June 9- 10, 1976) , https://perma.cc/Q795 -\nYVQ4 .   \n \nThis understanding of  authorship and computer \ntechnology is reflected in CONTU’s final report :      \n \nOn the basis of its investigations and society’s experience \nwith the computer, the Commission believes that there is no reasonable basis for considering that a computer in any way contributes authorship to a work produced through its use.  The computer, li ke a camera or a typewriter, is an \ninert instrument, capable of functioning only when activated either directly or indirectly by a human.  When so activated it is capable of doing only what it is directed to do in the way it is directed to perform. \n \nCONTU, Final Report  at 44 (1978) , https://perma.cc/7S8T -\nTAB5 . \n  \nAlthough CONTU’s final report was not published until \n1978, its conclusion that machines cannot be authors reflects \nthe state of play at the time Congress enacted the Copyright Act in 1976.  And  when Congress amended the Copyright Act’s \nprovision governing computer programs shortly following \nCONTU’s final report,  Congress preserved the Act’s \nprovisions governing authorship and the language describing machines  as devices used by authors.  Pub. L. No. 96- 517, 94 \nStat. 3015, 3028 (1980) (stating it is not infringement to copy a computer program if the copy “is created as an essential step in the utilization of the computer program in conjunction with a machine[.]”) .    \n     \nIn short, at  the time the Copyright Act was passed and for \nat least a decade before, computers were not considered to be  \ncapable of acting as  authors , but instead served as “inert USCA Case #23-5233      Document #2106229            Filed: 03/18/2025      Page 15 of 2416 \n instrument[s]” controlled “directly or indirectly by a human”  \nwho could be an author.  CONTU, Final Report  at 44 (1978), \nhttps://perma.cc/7S8T -TAB5 .  We infer Congress adopts an \nagency’s interpretation of a term “when a term’s meaning was \nwell-settled[.]”  Sackett v. Environmental Prot. Agency , 598 \nU.S. 651, 683 (2023).   And that rule ap plies with double force \nhere where the commis sion Congress  designated to study the \nissue, CONTU,  came to the same conclusion .  Given all that, \nthe interpretation  of “author ” as requiring human authorship \nwas well-settled at the time the 1976 Copyright Act was \nenacted . \n \n3 \n Dr. Thaler ’s contrary reading of the statutory text fails.   \n \na \n Dr. Thaler  argues first that the natural meaning of “author” \nis not confined to human beings .  Dr.  Thaler points to a 2023 \ndictionary definition defining “author ” as “one that originates \nor creates something[.]”  Thaler Opening Br. 23 (citing Author , \nMerriam -Webster Dictionary (2023) ),  https://perma.cc/S96L -\nWYTS .  \n \n But statutory construction requires more than just finding \na sympathetic dictionary definition .  We “do not read statutes \nin little bites ,” or words in isolation from their statutory \ncontext.  Kircher v. Putnam Funds Tr., 547 U.S. 633, 643 \n(2006).  The judicial task when interpreting statutory language, \ninstead , is to discern how Congress used a word in the law.   \n  That process includes “ a natural presumption that identical \nwords used in different parts of the same act are intended to have the same meaning.”   Atlantic Cleaners & Dryers, Inc. v. USCA Case #23-5233      Document #2106229            Filed: 03/18/2025      Page 16 of 2417 \n United States , 286 U.S. 427, 433 (1932).  Here , the Copyright \nAct makes no sense if an “author ” is not a human being.  If \n“machine ” is substituted for “author,”  the Copyright Act would \nrefer to a machine’ s “children,”  17 U.S.C. § 203(a)(2),  a \nmachine’s  “widow,”  id., a machine’s  “domicile,”  id. § 104(a), \na machine’s mens rea , id. § 101, and a machine’s  “nationality ,” \nid.  Problematic  questions would arise about a machine’s  “life” \nand “death [.]”  Id. § 302(a).  And  “machine” would \ninconsistently mean both an author and a tool  used by authors.  \nId. § 117(d)(1) ; see id. §§ 102(a); 108(c)(2);  116(d)(1); 117(c); \n1001(2), (3).    \n \nDr. Thaler points out that the Copyright Act’s work- made-\nfor-hire provision allows  those who hire creators to be \n“considered the author”  under the Act .  17 U.S.C. § 201(b).  \nThat is why corporations, e.g., Warren v. Fox Fam. Worldwide, \nInc., 328 F.3d 1136, 1140 (9th Cir. 2003) , and governments, \ne.g., Georgia v. Public.Resource.Org, Inc., 590 U.S. 255, 270 \n(2020) , can be legally recognized as authors.   \n \n But the word “considered”  in the work -made- for-hire \nprovision does the critical work here.  It allows the copyright \nand authorship protections attaching to a work originally created  by a human author to transfer instantaneously, as a \nmatter of law , to the person who hired the creator.  See \nCommunity  for Creative Non -Violence v. Reid , 490 U.S. 730, \n737 (1989) .  Congress , in other words, was careful to avoid \nusing the word “author” by itself to cover non-human entities .  \nFor if Congress  had intended otherwise, the work- made- for-\nhire provision would s ay straightforwardly that those who hire \ncreators “are  the author for purposes of this title ,” not that they \nare “ considered  the author for purposes of this title.”   \n   USCA Case #23-5233      Document #2106229            Filed: 03/18/2025      Page 17 of 2420 \n copyrightability of a work authored exclusively by a rtificial \nintelligence .  Contrast Rearden LLC v. Walt Disney Co., 293 \nF. Supp. 3d 963 (N.D. Cal. 2018)  (holding that companies may \ncopyright work made with motion capture software ).   \n \n Second, Dr. Thaler has not explained how  a ban on \nmachines being author s would result in less original work  \nbecause machines , including the Creativity Machine, do not \nrespond to economic incentives .   \n \nDr. Thaler  worries that the human -authorship requirement \nwill disincentivize  creativity by the creator s and operator s of \nartificial intelligence.  Thaler Opening Br. 36.  That argument \noverlooks that the requirement  still incentivizes humans like \nDr. Thaler  to create and to pursue exclusive rights to work s that \nthey make with  the assistance of  artificial intelligence . \n  Of course,  the Creativity Machine does not represent  the \nlimits  of human technical ingenuity when it comes to artificial \nintelligence .  Humans at some point might produce  creative  \nnon-humans capable of responding to economic  incentive s.  \nScience fiction is replete with examples of creative machines  \nthat far exceed the capacities of current generative artificial \nintelligence .  For example, Star Trek’s Data might be worse \nthan ChatGPT at writing poetry, but Data’s intelligence is \ncomparable to that of a human being.  See Star Trek:  The Next \nGeneration:  Schism  (Paramount  television broadcast Oct. 19, \n1992)  (“Felis catus is your taxonomic nomenclature, an \nendothermic quadruped, carnivorous by nature”) .  There will \nbe time enough for Congress and the Copyright Office to tackle those issues when they arise.       Third, Congress ’s choice not to amend the law since 1976 \nto allow artificial- intelligence authorship  “might well be taken \nto be an acquiescence in the judicial construction given to the USCA Case #23-5233      Document #2106229            Filed: 03/18/2025      Page 20 of 2421 \n copyright laws.”  White -Smith Music Pub. Co. v. Apollo Co., \n209 U.S. 1, 14 (1908).  The human- authorship requirement is \nnot new and has been the subject of multiple judicial decisions.  \nThe Seventh Circuit has squarely held that authors  “of \ncopyrightable works must be human.”   Kelley v. Chicago Park \nDist. , 635 F.3d 290, 304 (7th Cir. 2011).  And the Ninth Circuit \nhas strongly implied the same when deciding that an author must be a “worldly entity,” Urantia Foundation v. Maaherra, 114 F.3d 955, 958 (9th Cir. 1997) , and cannot be an animal, \nNaruto v. Slater , 888 F.3d 418, 426 (9th Cir. 2018) .   \n \nFinally , even if the human authorship requirement were at \nsome point  to stymy the  creat ion of  original work, th at would \nbe a policy argument for Congress to address .\n  U.S.  CONST . Art. \nI, § 8, cl. 8.  “Congress has the constitutional authority and the \ninstitutional ability to accommodate fully the varied \npermutations of competing interests that are inevitably \nimplicated by such new technology.”  Sony , 464 U.S. at  431. \n \nThis court’s job, by contrast, “is to apply the statute as it is \nwritten ,” not to wade into technologically uncharted copyright \nwaters and try to decide what “might ‘accord with good \npolicy.’ ”  Burrage v. United States , 571 U.S. 204, 218 (2014)  \n(quoting Commissioner v. Lundy , 516 U.S. 235, 252 (1996)) ; \nsee also Teleprompter Corp. v. Columbia Broad. Sys., Inc., 415 \nU.S. 394, 414 (1974) (“Detailed regulation of these \nrelationships, and any ultimate resolution of the many sensitive \nand important problems in this field, must be left to Congress.”) .  Accommodating new technology “is for \nCongress.”   Fortnightly Corp. v. United Artists Television, Inc., \n392 U.S. 390, 401 (1968).   \n \n In that regard, it bears noting that the Political Branches  \nhave been  grappling with how copyright law should adapt  to \nnew technology.  The Copyright Office is studying how USCA Case #23-5233      Document #2106229            Filed: 03/18/2025      Page 21 of 2422 \n copyright law should respond to artificial intelligence , \nArtificial Intelligence and Copyright, 88 Fed. Reg. 59,942, \n59,942 ( Aug. 30, 2023) , and is making recommendations  based \non its findings , see Copyright Office, Copyright and Artificial \nIntelligence, Part 1:  Digital Replicas at 57  (Jul. 31, 2024) , \nhttps://perma.cc/8CUH -DN5A (recommending a statutory \nright for individuals to sue those who make deepfakes with their likeness) ; Copyright Office, Copyright and Artificial \nIntelligence, Part 2:  Copyrightability at 32-40 (Jan. 29, 2025) , \nhttps://perma.cc/W9VR -TLQP  (recommending against \nchanging the law governing the copyrightability of work \ngenerated by artificial intelligence ).  Also, Congress recently \ncompleted a report that addresses the problem of artificial intelligence and intellectual property.  U.S. House of Rep., Bipartisan House Task Force Report on Artificial Intelligence  \nat 111-136 (Dec. 2024), https://perma.cc/Y69R -DM3D.   \nCongress and the Copyright Office are  the proper audience s for \nDr. Thaler’s policy and practical arguments.  \n \n4 \n  Because the Copyright Act itself requires human \nauthorship, we need not and do not address the Copyright Office’s argument that the Constitution ’s Intellectual Property \nClause requires human authorship.  The Copyright Act \nprovides “a sufficient ground for deciding this case, and the \ncardinal principle of judicial restraint—if it is not necessary to decide more, it is necessary not to decide more —counsels us to \ngo no further .”  PDK Laboratories  Inc. v. U nited States  Drug \nEnforcement Agency, 362 F.3d 786, 799 (D.C. Cir. 2004) \n(Roberts, J., concurring in part and concurring in the \njudgment).    USCA Case #23-5233      Document #2106229            Filed: 03/18/2025      Page 22 of 2423 \n IV \n \n Dr. Thaler raises two alternative arguments in support of \nhis copyright application.  Neither succeeds . \n  First , Dr. Thaler argues that the  Copyright Act’s work-\nmade- for-hire provision allows him to be “considered the \nauthor”  of the work at issue because the Creativity Machine is \nhis employee.  Thaler Opening Br. 52- 56; 17 U.S.C. § 201(b) .  \n \nThat argument misunderstands the human authorship \nrequirement.  The Copyright Act  only protects “original works  \nof authorship.”   17 U.S.C . § 102(a) .  The authorship  \nrequirement applies to  all copyrightable work, including work -\nmade- for-hire.  The word  “authorship,”  like the word “ author, ” \nrefers to  a human being.   As a result, t he human- authorship \nrequirement  necessitates that  all “original works of authorship”  \nbe created  in the first instance  by a human being, including  \nthose who make work for hire .     \n  Second, Dr. Thaler  argues that he is the work’s author  \nbecause he made and used the Creativity Machine.  Thaler \nOpening Br. 42- 51.  We cannot reach  that argument.  T he \ndistrict court held  that Dr. Thaler  forwent any such argument \nbefore the Copyright Office.  Thaler , 687 F.Supp.3d at 150.   \nAnd i n his opening brief, Dr. Thaler did not challenge the \ndistrict court’s finding of waiver.  Dr. Thaler  offered only a \nsingle sentence in his opening brief, in which he  describ es the \ndistrict court’s conclusion as  “based on a misunderstanding of \nthe record below.”  Thaler Opening Br. 43.  That  “bare and \nconclusory assertion” is insufficient to preserv e an argument \nfor resolution on the merits.  Abdullah v. Obama, 753 F.3d 193, \n199 (D.C. Cir. 2014) . \n         USCA Case #23-5233      Document #2106229            Filed: 03/18/2025      Page 23 of 2424 \n V \n \n For the foregoing reasons, the district court’s denial of Dr. \nThaler’s copyright application is affirmed.  \n \nSo ordered.

The case highlights issues around whether Meta's AR/VR technologies satisfy the specific patent claims put forth by Mullen, particularly the AI aspects that were deemed insufficiently detailed.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether Mullen Industries adequately pled factual allegations to support claims of patent infringement against Meta's AR/VR products, particularly regarding the use of AI technology and whether these products can be considered \"wireless telephones.\"\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court granted in part and denied in part Meta's motion to dismiss. Specifically, it dismissed with prejudice Count II (involving wireless telephones) and Count VII (involving AI claims) due to a lack of plausible allegations that Meta's products met essential claim elements. Counts I, III, IV, V, and IX were not dismissed, allowing those claims to proceed.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine you invented a new type of game and claimed other people copied your idea. You sued a big company saying their video game headsets use your invention. The court looked at your claims and decided that two of your arguments didn’t make sense. You said their headset was a kind of phone and used AI like your invention, but you couldn’t explain how exactly. So, the court threw out those parts of your case but kept other parts, saying they need more investigation.",

(Dkt. # 45), recommending the Court grant  in part and deny \nin part Defendant Meta Platforms, Inc.’s (“Meta”) Partial Motion to Dismiss (Dkt. \n# 23).  Plaintiff Mullen Industries, LLC (“Mullen”) timely objected to portions of \nthe R ecommendation on November 26, 2024 (Dkt. # 51), and Meta filed a \nresponse to those objections on December 10, 2024 (Dkt. # 56).   \n  The Court finds this matter suitable for disposition without a hearing.  \nAfter conducting a de novo review of the objected- to portions of the \nRecommendation  and reviewing the unobjected -to portions for clear error, the Case 1:24-cv-00354-DAE     Document 64     Filed 01/29/25     Page 1 of 152 \n Court ADOPTS  the R ecommendation  in its entirety.   Accordingly, Meta’s Partial \nMotion to Dismiss is GRANTED IN PART  and DENIED IN PART .  (Dkt. # 23.)  \n     BACKGROUND  \n  This case involves allegations by Mullen Industries that Meta \ninfringed several of its patents related to virtual and augmented reality technology. \n(Dkt. # 45 at 1.)  The First Amended Complaint (“FAC”) asserts twelve counts of \npatent infringement, including  infringement of  the two patents at issue in Mullen’s \nObjection to the Re commendation (Dkt. # 51) : U.S. Patent Nos. 10,974,151 (“’151 \nPatent”)  and 9,662,582 (“’582 Patent”) .  (Id. )  The FAC alleges that Meta infringes \nMullen’s patents through its augmented reality and virtual reality (“AR/VR”) \nsystems, including wearable headsets (“Accused Products”). ( Id.) \n  Meta filed a Partial Motion to Dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), \nchallenging Counts I, II, III, IV , V , VII, and IX on the grounds that Mullen failed to \nplausibly allege infringement of essential claim elements.   (Dkt. # 23.)   Judge \nHightower recommended dismissal with prejudice of Count II (the “Wireless \nTelephone” count) and Count VII (the “Artificial Intelligence” count) , while \nrecommending the Court deny Meta’s Motion  as to Counts I, III, IV , V , and IX  (the \n“Landscape Characteristics” counts) .  (Dkt. # 45 at 12.)   Mullen has objected to \nJudge Hightower’s recommendations that Count II and Count VII be dismissed Case 1:24-cv-00354-DAE     Document 64     Filed 01/29/25     Page 2 of 153 \n with prejudice and that the Court deny its request for leave to amend.  (Dkt. # 51 at \n6–13.)  \nLEGAL STANDARD \nI. Review of Report and Recommendation  \n The Court must conduct a de novo review of any of the Magistrate \nJudge’s conclusions to which a party has specifically objected.  See 28 U.S.C. \n§ 636(b)(1)(C).  The objections must specifically identify those findings or \nrecommendations that the party wishes to have the district court consider.  \nThomas  v. Arn, 474 U.S. 140, 151 (1985).  A district court need not consider \n“[f]rivolous, conclusive, or general objections.”  Battle v. U.S. Parole Comm’n, \n834 F.2d 419, 421 (5th Cir. 1987).   “A judge of the court may accept, reject, or \nmodify, in whole or in part, the findings or recommendations made by the \nmagistrate judge.”  28  U.S.C. § 636(b)(1)(C).  \n  Findings to which no specific objections are made do not require de \nnovo review; the Court need only determine whether the Recommendation is \nclearly erroneous or contrary to law.  United States v. Wilson, 864 F.2d 1219, 1221 \n(5th Cir. 1989).  \nII. 12(b)(6) Motion to Dismiss  \n  While Federal Circuit law governs substantive issues of patent law, \nthe law of the respective regional circuit governs the procedural issue whether to Case 1:24-cv-00354-DAE     Document 64     Filed 01/29/25     Page 3 of 154 \n grant or deny a motion to dismiss.  Disc Disease Sols. Inc. v. VGH Sols., Inc. , 888 \nF.3d 1256, 1259 (Fed. Cir. 2018); Grecia Est. Holdings LLC v. Meta Platforms, \nInc., 605 F. Supp. 3d 905, 910 (W.D. Tex. 2022).    \n  In deciding a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss for failure to state a \nclaim, the court “accepts all well- pleaded facts as true, viewing them in the light \nmost favorable to the plaintiff.”  In re Katrina Canal Breaches Litig., 495 F.3d 191, \n205 (5th Cir. 2007) (internal quotation marks omitted).  The Supreme Court has \nexplained that a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter to “state a claim \nto relief that is plausible on its face.”  Ashcroft v. Iqbal , 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) \n(quoting Bell Atl. Co rp. v. Twombly , 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007)).  “A claim has \nfacial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct \nalleged.”  Id.  \n  “The tenet that a court must accept as true all of the allegations \ncontained in a complaint is inapplicable to legal conclusions,” and courts “are not \nbound to accept as true a legal conclusion couched as a factual allegation.”  Iqbal , \n556 U.S. at 678 (internal quotations and citations omitted).  Thus, although all \nreasonable inferences will be resolved in favor of the plaintiff, the plaintiff must \nplead “specific facts, not mere conclusory allegations.”  Tuchman v. DSC \nCommc’ns Corp. , 14 F.3d 1061, 1067 (5th Cir. 1994); see  also Plotkin v. IP Axess Case 1:24-cv-00354-DAE     Document 64     Filed 01/29/25     Page 4 of 155 \n Inc., 407 F.3d 690, 696 (5th Cir. 2005) (“We do not accept as true conclusory \nallegations, unwarranted factual inferences, or legal conclusions.”).  \n  In patent cases, a complaint must place the alleged infringer on notice \nof what activity is being accused of infringement.  Lifetime Indus., Inc. v. Trim -\nLok, Inc. , 869 F.3d 1372, 1379 (Fed. Cir. 2017).   This evaluation will “be a \ncontext -specific task that requires the reviewing court to draw on its judicial \nexperience and common sense.”  Iqbal , 556 U.S. at 679.  “This standard ‘simply \ncalls for enough facts to raise a reasonable expectation that discovery will reveal \nevidence of’ the necessary claims or elements.”  In re S. Scrap Material Co. , 541 \nF.3d 584, 587 (5th Cir. 2008) (quoting Twombly , 550 U.S. at 556).  \n  In Bot M8 LLC v. Sony Corp. of Am. , 4 F.4th 1342, 1352 (Fed. Cir. \n2021), the Federal Circuit embraced a flexible pleading standard for direct \ninfringement, inquiring “whether the factual allegations in the complaint are \nsufficient to show that the plaintiff has a plausible claim for relief .”  The court \nexplained that:  \n The level of detail required in any given case will vary depending upon \na number of factors, including the complexity of the technology, the materiality of any given element to practicing the asserted claim(s), and the nature of the allegedly infringing de vice.  \n \n Accordingly, a plaintiff cannot assert a plausible claim for infringement \nunder the Iqbal/Twombly standard by reciting the claim elements and \nmerely concluding that the accused product has those elements. There \nmust be some factual allegations that, when taken as true, articulate why it is plausible that the accused product infringes the patent claim.    Case 1:24-cv-00354-DAE     Document 64     Filed 01/29/25     Page 5 of 156 \n  \nId. at 1353.  \n  \n  An element -by-element pleading of fact for each asserted patent claim \nis not required, Sesaco Corp. v. Equinom Ltd. , No. 1:20-CV -1053 -LY , 2022 WL \n1546642, at *1 (W.D. Tex. Mar. 11, 2022), but: “To state a viable direct \ninfringement claim, a plaintiff must plead facts that plausibly suggest that the \naccused product meets each limitation of the asserted claim or claims.”   \nEncoditech, LLC v. Citizen Watch Co. of Am., Inc. , No. SA -18-CV-1335-XR, \n2019 WL 2601347, at *3 (W.D. Tex. June 25, 2019).  In patent cases, “the \ncomplaint must support . . . entitlement to relief with ‘factual content,’ not just \nconclusory allegations that the accused product(s) meet every claim limitation.” \nVervain, LLC v. Michron Tech., Inc. , No. 6:21 -cv-00487 -ADA, 2022 WL 23469, at \n*2 (W.D. Tex. Jan. 3, 2022) (quoting Bot M8 , 4 F.4th at 1353).  \n  In determining whether a plaintiff’s claims survive a Rule 12(b)(6) \nmotion to dismiss, the factual information to which the court addresses its inquiry \nis limited to the (1) facts set forth in the complaint, (2) documents attached to the \ncomplaint, and (3)  matters of which judicial notice may be taken under Federal \nRule of Evidence 201.  Walker v. Beaumont Indep. Sch. Dist. , 938 F.3d 724, 735 \n(5th Cir. 2019).  \n \n Case 1:24-cv-00354-DAE     Document 64     Filed 01/29/25     Page 6 of 157 \n DISCUSSION \n I.  Unobjected -to Portion s of the Report and Recommendation   \n  Judge Hightower  recommended denying Meta’s Motion to D ismiss as \nto Counts I, III, IV , V , and IX, which concern patents sharing a common \nspecification in claim 1 requiring a detector that determines “landscape \ncharacteristics” of a physical playfield.  (Dkt. # 45 at 8, 11.)  Judge Hightower  \nfound  that Meta’s arguments for dismissal of these counts would require the Court \nto improperly engage in claim construction at the pleadings stage.  ( Id. at 10.)  See, \ne.g., Pedersen v. Zoho Corp. , No. 1:23 -CV-71-DII, 2023 WL 3612333, at *2 (W.D. \nTex. May 23, 2023) (denying motion to dismiss when defendant’s arguments \n“require the Court to interpret claim language, which is improper at this stage of \nthe litigation”) .  \n  No party objected to these recommendations, and the Court finds no \nclear error in Judge Hightower’s analysis.  Accordingly, the recommendations as to \nCounts I, III, IV , V , and IX are ADOPTED.   Meta’s Partial Motion to Dismiss \nthese counts is therefore DENIED.  \n II.  Objections to the Report and  Recommendation  \n  A. Count VII: “Wireless Telephone”  Claim  (‘151 Patent)  \n  Judge Hightower recommended dismissing Count VII with prejudice, \nfinding that the FAC failed to plausibly allege infringement of the ’151 Patent.   Case 1:24-cv-00354-DAE     Document 64     Filed 01/29/25     Page 7 of 158 \n (Dkt. # 45 at 5.)  Claim 1 of the ’151 Patent recites a system comprising “a \nwireless telephone having a locating device and a display, wherein a location-based \nvideo game is operable to be played on said wireless telephone.”   (Dkt. # 45 at 4.)   \n  Meta assert s in its Motion: “The complaint nonsensically asserts a \nclaim requiring a ‘wireless telephone’ against Meta’s virtual reality gaming headsets.  A wireless telephone is not a virtual reality headset: Nothing in the claim \nlanguage, specification, file history, or common sense suggests that a ‘wireless \ntelephone’ is a virtual reality headset.”  (Dkt. # 23 at 17 ) (citation omitted).  Meta \nnotes that the application was filed in 2006,  and the claim is directed to games on a \nwireless telephone, like the “Sprint VISION PCS wireless telephone” from the \n2000s.  (Dkt. 19 -7 at 2:11- 14, ’151 Patent.)  \n  Mullen argues in response that it plausibly pleads the Accused \nProducts are wireless telephones because Meta’s Messenger instant messaging \nsoftware application is preinstalled on them, allowing them to make calls.   (Dkt.  \n# 24 at 14 –15.)  \n  The Magistrate Judge concluded that the FAC could not be read as \nplausibly asserting that Meta’s head-mounted  AR/VR  devices  are “wireless \ntelephones ,” citing  Ottah v. Fiat Chrysler , 884 F.3d 1135 , 1141  (Fed. Cir. 2018)  \n(affirming dismissal of claim that camera holders infringed a patent for a book Case 1:24-cv-00354-DAE     Document 64     Filed 01/29/25     Page 8 of 159 \n holder; district court stated that the fact that the book holder “could be used to hold \na camera does not make it the equivalent of a mobile camera”  ).  (Dkt. # 45 at 5.)  \n  Mullen objects to the Recommendation, arguing that Judge Hightower  \nimproperly engaged in premature claim construction by interpreting “wireless \ntelephone” without the benefit of a developed record.   (Dkt. # 51 at 7.)  The Court \nfinds Mullen’s objection unpersuasive.   As the R ecommendation  notes, no claim \nconstruction is needed to find that Mullen has not plausibly alleged that the Accused Products are a “wireless telephone,” merely because they utilize instant messaging software.  (Dkt. # 45 at 5.)  Meta’ s infringement allegation is \n“implausible on [its] face.”  Bartonfalls LLC v. Turner Broad. Sys., Inc.,  No. 2:16 -\nCV-1127 -JRG-RSP, 2017 WL 1375205, at *2 (E.D. Tex. Mar. 15, 2017)(E.D. Tex. \nApr. 10, 2017) .  Drawing on “judicial experience and common sense,”  Iqbal , 556 \nU.S. at 679 ,  the Court finds that Judge Hightower  correctly concluded the \nComplaint could not be read as plausibly asserting that Meta’s head-mounted AR/VR devices are “wireless telephones.”  Accordingly, this objection is \nOVERRULED.   Count VII is DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE.  \n  B. Count II: “Artificial Intelligence ” Claim  (‘582 Patent)  \n  Judge Hightower also recommended dismissing Count II with \nprejudice, finding that the FAC did not adequately allege how the Accused \nProducts  used “artificial intelligence” in the manner claimed by the ’582 Patent.   Case 1:24-cv-00354-DAE     Document 64     Filed 01/29/25     Page 9 of 1510 \n (Dkt. # 45 at 6– 7.)  Claim 1 of the ‘582 Patent requires a virtual playfield, a first \ncharacter, and “a second character, wherein said second character is computer \ncontrolled via artificial intelligence and said artificial intelligence utilizes said first \ncontrol signal from said first locating device f or controlling, at least in part, said \nsecond character.”   (Dkt. # 45 at 6.)  Judge Hightower concluded  that “Mullen has \nnot plausibly alleged that ‘artificial intelligence utilizes said first control signal from said first locating device for controlling, at least in part, said second character,’ as required by Claim 1.”   (Dkt. # 45 at 7.)  \n  In its Motion, Meta argues Mullen:  “was obligated to identify what is \nthe accused ‘artificial intelligence’ in the accused products” but does not plausibly \nplead the claimed “artificial intelligence” because it “fails to allege where and how \nthe accused products are using the claimed ‘arti ficial intelligence’ which uses ‘said \nfirst control signal from said first locating device for controlling, at least in part, \nsaid second character.’”  (Dkt. # 25 at 10– 11.)  \n  In response, Mullen argues that it sufficiently pleads, for example, that \nthe claimed “’artificial intelligence’ is programmed into the Meta AR/VR system [Accused Products] and determines or changes the position of the second \ncharacter’s head or eye movements based on, for example, the user’s position on \nthe playfield.”   (Dkt. # 19 at ¶ 116. )  Case 1:24-cv-00354-DAE     Document 64     Filed 01/29/25     Page 10 of 1511 \n   Judge Hightower concluded that Mullen had failed to state a claim as \nto Count II because it “ has not plead facts plausibly suggesting that the Accused \nProducts meet “each limitation of the asserted claim. ”  (Dkt. # 45 at 7.)  \n  In its objection, Mullen contends that it provided sufficient allegations \nto meet the plausibility standard and argues that the R ecommendation  improperly \ndiscounted its factual assertions.  (Dkt. # 51 at 10.)   Mullen also argues : “the \nReport’s implicit but unsubstantiated finding that the FAC was purportedly \nrequired to plead additional, non- public detail to state a plausible claim for relief is \nerroneous.  In effect, the Report appears to require the impossible, i.e., that Plaintiff \nmust plead in the FAC non- public information including the technical details of the \nAccused Products’ computer source code. ”  (Dkt. # 51 at 11.)  Finall y, Mullen \nasserts that the Recommendation construed the claim term  \"artificial intelligence” \nwithout the required Markman  process.  (Dkt. # 51 at 12.)  \n  In Response, Meta argues that “merely restating words in a claim is \nnot pleading facts under Iqbal/Twombly.”   (Dkt. # 56 at 10.) See, e.g., Chhim v. \nUniv. of Tex. at Austin, 836 F.3d 467, 469 (5th Cir. 2016) (courts do not credit \n“allegations that merely restate the legal elements of  a claim.”).  Further, Meta \nargues that Judge Hightower was not requiring the “impossible,” but rather, was \nrequiring Mullen “ plead facts plausibly suggesting a claim for relief, as required \nunder Iqbal .”  (Dkt. # 56 at 11.) (emphasis in original).  According to Meta, Case 1:24-cv-00354-DAE     Document 64     Filed 01/29/25     Page 11 of 1512 \n because Mullen “only parroted the claim language without explaining what facts \nshow how the accused products practice the claimed artificial intelligence using \n‘said first control signal from said first locating device for controlling, at least in \npart, said second character, ’ Plaintiff fell short of satisfying Iqbal/Twombly .”  (Id. \nat 11.)   See , e.g., Addiction & Detoxification Inst. v. Carpenter , 620 F. App’x 934, \n937 (Fed. Cir. 2015) (bare allegations do not put defendants on “notice as to what activity,  method, or procedure is alleged to infringe”).   \n   Finally, Meta argues that there was no claim construction needed  or \nconducted by the Magistrate Judge, because “ nothing factual was pointed to  [by \nMullen]  for [the artificial intelligence element ], despite  [Mullen]  already knowing \nthat Meta had repeatedly informed Plaintiff that it could not understand what was the accused ‘artificial intelligence ’ and how the accused products allegedly met the \n‘artificial intelligence ’ limitation. ”  (Dkt. # 56 at 12.)  \n  The Court agrees with the Magistrate Judge’s conclusion.  As stated in \nMeta’s motion, the FAC “simply parrot[s ] claim language without explaining what \nfacts show how the accused products practice the claimed artificial intelligence” in \nthe claimed manner.  (Dkt. # 56 at 11.)  As the Federal Circuit has emphasized, \n“mere recitation of claim elements and corresponding conclusions, without \nsupporting factual allegations, is insufficient to satisfy the Iqbal/Twombly  \nstandard.\"  Bot M8 LLC , 4 F.4th at 1355.   Further, the Court finds Mullen’s Case 1:24-cv-00354-DAE     Document 64     Filed 01/29/25     Page 12 of 1513 \n cursory argument that Judge Hightower engaged in claim construction of the term \n“artificial intelligence” to be unpersuasive.  Concluding that insufficient facts have \nbeen alleged to support infringement is not claim construction.  Accordingly, this \nobjection is OVERRULED.   Count II is DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE.  \n  C. Leave to Amend \n  Judge Hightower recommended the Court deny Mullen’s request for \nleave to amend.  (Dkt. # 45 at 12.)   Judge Hightower noted that “ Mullen has \nalready amended its complaint once in response to Meta’s first partial motion to \ndismiss, which raised the same issues as Meta’s instant motion but was dismissed \nas moot after Mullen amended its complaint.”   (Dkt. # 45 at 11.)   Judge Hightower \nalso noted that “Mullen neither submits a proposed amended complaint nor \ndescribes any additional facts it would plead to cure the defects in its First Amended Complaint.”   (Id.)  \n  Courts should freely grant leave to amend when justice so requires. \nFED. R. CIV . P. 15(a)(2).  Courts should deny leave to amend when amendment \nwould cause undue delay or undue prejudice to the opposing party, or the \namendment would be futile or in bad faith.  Mayeaux v. La. Health Serv. & Indem. \nCo., 376 F.3d 420, 425 (5th Cir. 2004).   An amendment is futile if it would fail to \nsurvive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion.  Marucci Sports, L.L.C. v. Nat’l Collegiate \nAthletic Ass’n , 751 F.3d 368, 378 (5th Cir. 2014).  Case 1:24-cv-00354-DAE     Document 64     Filed 01/29/25     Page 13 of 1514 \n   Mullen objects to Judge Hightower’s recommendation that its request \nfor leave to amend  the FAC  be denied.  (Dkt. # 51 at 13.)  However, as Meta notes \nin its response to Mullen’s objection, Mullen “ still has not explained what specific \nadditional facts it would plead to cure the fundamental defects [identified by Judge \nHightower].”  (Dkt. # 56 at 13.)  Because Mullen has already been afforded one \nopportunity to amend and it has failed to provid e the Court with additional facts it \nwould plead to cure the defects identified in the Recommendation, this objection is \nOVERRULED.  See Edionwe v. Bailey , 860 F.3d 287, 294 (5th Cir. 2017) \n(holding that leave to amend is not required where movant fails to apprise court of \nfacts it would plead in amended complaint to cure any deficiencies); see also Local \nRule CV -7(b) (requiring that executed copy of a proposed pleading be filed as an \nexhibit to a motion for leave).   Mullen’s request for leave to amend is DENIED.  \nCONCLUSION  \n  For the reasons above, the Court ADOPTS  U.S. Magistrate Judge \nSusan Hightower’s Report and Recommendation in full as the opinion of this \nCourt.  (Dkt. # 45.)  Defendant Meta’s  Partial Motion to Dismiss is GRANTED IN \nPART  and DENIE D IN PART .  (Dkt. # 23.)  The Motion is GRANTED as to \nCounts II and VII, and those claims are dismissed WITH PREJUDICE .  The \nMotion is DENIED  as to Counts I, III, IV , V , and IX.  Plaintiff Mullen’s request for \nleave to amend is DENIED.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: This court case involves a dispute over the interpretation of terms in U.S. Patent No. 7,394,392, which covers an \"Expert System Safety Screening of Equipment Operators.\" The case specifically focuses on the term \"expert system(s),\" which is a type of artificial intelligence used to evaluate the impairment of equipment operators and control equipment based on that assessment. The court adopts a construction of \"expert system\" that comprises a database module, a decision module, and an interface module.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: The key legal issue is how to properly construe the term \"expert system(s)\" within the patent, which is central to determining whether Mercedes-Benz USA and Daimler AG infringe on the patent.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court holds that the term \"expert system(s)\" in the '392 patent refers to a computer program that includes: (1) a database module with information pertinent to assessing operator impairment; (2) a decision module for applying logic to screen and control the equipment; and (3) an interface module connecting with equipment and operators.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine you have a very smart computer program that acts like a team of experts always checking if a driver is too tired or drunk to drive. This program uses rules and information it learned from experts to make decisions. The court had to decide exactly what parts this smart program needed to have to fit the description in the patent, and they decided it needs to have three parts: one for holding expert information, one for making decisions, and one for talking to the equipment it's controlling.",

Summary judgment was denied without\nprejudice in order to conduct term-construction proceedings in accord with\nprocedures in Markman v. Westview Instruments, Inc. , 52 F. 3d 967 (Fed. Cir.\n1995).  The parties have submitted expert w itness declarations, briefs, and exhibits. \nThe court has also heard oral argument.\nThe '392 patent is entitled \"Expert System Safety Screening of\nEquipment Operators.\"  It was issued on July 1, 2008 based on an application filed\non June 10, 2005.  The patent abstract indicates that it relates to \"[m]ethods andsystems using one or more expert systems to screen equipment operators forimpairments, such as intoxication, physical impairment, mental impairment, orCase: 1:13-cv-04417 Document #: 92 Filed: 09/18/14 Page 1 of 10 PageID #:<pageID>emotional impairment, to selectively test  the equipment operators and control the\nequipment.\"\nPlaintiff Vehicle Intelligence and Sa fety LLC (\"VIS\") accuses defendants\nMercedes-Benz USA, LLC and Daimler AG of infringing claims 8, 9, and 11-18 ofthe '392 patent.  Each of the asserted clai ms specifies an \"expert system\" to screen\nand test equipment operators for potential impairment and to control equipment. \nClaim 8, which is representative, provides:  \n A method to screen an equipment operator for\nimpairment, comprising:screening an equipment operator by one or more expert      systems to detect potential impairment of said equipment    operator;  selectively testing said equipment operator when said    screening of said equipment operator detects potential    impairment of said equipment operator; and controlling operation of said equipm ent if said selective testing\n    of said equipment operator indicates said impairment of said    equipment operator, wherein said screening of said    equipment operator includes a time-sharing allocation of at    least one processor executing at least one expert system.\nPursuant to Local Patent Rule 4.2 (f), the parties have submitted a Joint\nClaim Construction Chart containing propos als for construction of seven terms in\nthe '392 patent as follows:\n- 2 -Case: 1:13-cv-04417 Document #: 92 Filed: 09/18/14 Page 2 of 10 PageID #:<pageID>No. Claim Term\nand PhrasePlaintiff’s Proposed\nConstructionDefendants’ Proposed\nConstruction\n1. “expert system(s)”\n(claims 8, 14, 16)System to apply logic for\nscreening an equipmentoperator for potentialimpairment by interfacingwith one or moreequipment modules and bygathering and analyzingdata that a specialist wouldconsider in performing theanalysis.A computer program\nconsisting of three distinctcomponents:  (1) aknowledge database thatcontains substantive rulesobtained from humanexperts, (2) a decisionmodule separate from theknowledge database thatapplies the rules stored inthe knowledge databaseand draws inferencesbased on the application ofthose rules, and (3) a userinterface.\n2. “selectively test[ing]\nsaid equipmentoperator” (claims 8,16)Plain and ordinary\nmeaning, no constructionnecessary.Perform[ing] a subsequent\ntest of said [an] equipmentoperator which is capableof determining impairmentindependently of saidscreening.\n3. “wherein said\nscreening of saidequipment operatorincludes a time-sharing allocation ofat least oneprocessor executingat least one expertsystem” (claim 8)Plain and ordinary\nmeaning, no constructionnecessary.  Alternatively:wherein said screening ofsaid equipment operatorincludes a time-sharingallocation of at least oneprocessor executing the atleast one expert system.Wherein said screening of\nsaid equipment operator isperformed using at leastone non-dedicatedprocessor running at leastone other expert system\n- 3 -Case: 1:13-cv-04417 Document #: 92 Filed: 09/18/14 Page 3 of 10 PageID #:<pageID>4. includes a time-\nsharing allocation ofone or moreprocessors” (claim14)Plaint and ordinary\nmeaning, no constructionnecessary.Is performed using one or\nmore non-dedicatedprocessors.\n5. “dexterity” (claims\n11, 18)Plain and ordinary\nmeaning, no constructionnecessary.Skill in performing a\nmanual task.\n6. “speed of dexterity”\n(claims 11, 18)Plain and ordinary\nmeaning, no constructionnecessary.Indefinite under 35 U.S.C.\n§ 112, ¶2.\n7. “control[ling]\noperation of saidequipment” (claims8, 16)Includes activating an\nalarm and issuing awarning message to animpaired equipmentoperator.No construction necessary.\nAs stated in Phillips v. AWH Corp. , 415 F.3d 1303, 1313 (Fed.  Cir. 2005), the\nstarting point for claim construction is the pate nt itself.  \"[T]he person of ordinary skill in\nthe art is deemed to read the claim term not only in the context of the particular claim in\nwhich the disputed term appears, but in th e context of the entire patent, including the\nspecification.\"  Id.  Claims \"should be so construed, if possible, as to sustain their\nvalidity.\"  Id. at 1327 (quoting Rhine v. Casio, Inc. , 183 F.3d 1342, 1345 (Fed.\nCir.1999).\nThe parties agree that the key term to be  construed is \"expert system(s),\" which\nappears in all of the claims which are char ged to be infringed.  VIS concedes that to\n- 4 -Case: 1:13-cv-04417 Document #: 92 Filed: 09/18/14 Page 4 of 10 PageID #:<pageID>overcome prior art in the field of impairment  detection systems, the '392 patent provides\nthat an \"expert system\" is used to screen a nd selectively test for operator impairment and\ncontrol of equipment.  The patent does not define the term \"expert system\" as such;\nhowever, the figures, particularly Figure 8, a nd the related specifications provide intrinsic\nevidence of what is intended.\n- 5 -Case: 1:13-cv-04417 Document #: 92 Filed: 09/18/14 Page 5 of 10 PageID #:<pageID>The difference between the parties' construc tion is that VIS proposes a construction that\nappears to equate the \"expert system\" with \"conventional computer programs.\" \nDefendants propose construing the term with th e type of computer program developed for\nuse in the field of Artificial Intelligence programs.\nExpert system is a term that is commonly used in the field of Artificial\nIntelligence.  Defendants' expert explains th at expert systems are a class of computer\nprograms that were first developed in the 1960's.  They seek to emulate the decision-\nmaking of human experts in a field of expertise ( e.g. chemistry, medicine, geology).  An\nexpert system stores knowledge obtained from human experts in a \"knowledge base.\"  In\nthe field of medical diagnosis, an expert system will include rules concerning thesymptoms and characteristics associated with various ailments.  The system will have a\n\"decision module\" inference engine that is pr ogrammed to selectively apply expert rules\nstored in the knowledge base in order to reso lve problems.  An example of the application\nof an Artificial Intelligence system is a b ackward-chaining process that searches the\nknowledge base for rules to either verify or disp rove that a patient has or doesn't have flu. \nThe decision module will search for and appl y rules in the knowledge base related to\nsymptoms of flu.  The application of those rules may verify the hypothesis or lead toother hypotheses and the application of additi onal rules.  Also, the expert system must\nhave a means of interfacing with a user.\n- 6 -Case: 1:13-cv-04417 Document #: 92 Filed: 09/18/14 Page 6 of 10 PageID #:<pageID>Defendants cite numerous sources defining expert systems.  The New\nEncyclopedia Britannica,  Vol. 4 at 633 (Micropedia, 15th ed. 2005) states:\nexpert system, an advanced computer program (instruction\nset) that mimics the knowledge and reasoning capabilities of\nan expert in a particular discipline.  Its programmers strive toclone the expertise of one or several human specialists tocreate a tool that can be used by a layperson to solve difficultor ambiguous problems.  A chief advantage of expert systemsis their low cost compared with the expense of paying an\nexpert or a team of specialists;\nExpert systems differ from conventional computer\nprograms, the chief functions of which include datamanipulation, calculations, and information retrieval.  In\ncontrast, expert systems combin e facts with rules that state\nrelations between the facts to achieve a crude form ofreasoning analogous to artificial intelligence.  The two maincomponents of an expert system are (1) the knowledge base,which differs from a database in that it contains executableprogram code (instructions) and (2) the inference engine,\n- 7 -Case: 1:13-cv-04417 Document #: 92 Filed: 09/18/14 Page 7 of 10 PageID #:<pageID>which interprets and evaluates th e instructions and data in the\nknowledge base.VIS does not dispute the accuracy of this definition of expert system in\nthe field of Artificial Intelligence, but it deni es that the term is the same as used in\nthe '392 patent.  It states that the rule s in the knowledge base of an Artificial\nIntelligence expert system are not necessary  or required, although it admits that the\nexpert system described in the '392 pa tent employs logic which may correspond to\nthe rules included in a knowledge database.\nDefendants argue that VIS's computer position results in duplicating\nprior art applications distinguished on the face of the '392 patent which weredistinguished by reason of the fact that they  lack an expert system.  Those prior art\napplications for impairment detection utilize microprocessors.  This argumenttends to go beyond the construction of terms.  It is not necessary or appropriate to\ndecide exactly what type of computer syst em is required by the '392 patent in order\nto provide a construction of the term \"expert system\" that can be understood by afactfinder.  Accordingly, the following construction is adopted:\nAs used in the '392 patent, the term \"expert system(s)\" means:\na computer program consisting of (1) a database module that\ncontains information a specialist would consider in an analysis\nof an equipment operator for impairment; (2) a decision\n- 8 -Case: 1:13-cv-04417 Document #: 92 Filed: 09/18/14 Page 8 of 10 PageID #:<pageID>module  that applies logic for screening and testing an\nequipment operator for impairment and for controlling\nequipment, and (3) an interface module which interfaces with\none or more equipment modules and the equipment operator.\nHaving reviewed the parties' proposed claim construction presentations\nof other terms, it is concluded that th e remaining terms in the '392 patent are\nsufficiently clear, have plain and ordina ry meaning, and require no construction.\nIT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that, in this proceeding, the term\n\"expert system(s)\" as used in the '392 pa tent will be given the construction:  \"a\ncomputer program consisting of (1) a database module that contains information aspecialist would consider in an analysis of an equipment operator for impairment;\n(2) a decision module  that applies logic for screening and testing an equipment\noperator for impairment and for c ontrolling equipment, and (3) an interface\nmodule which interfaces with one or more equipment modules and the equipment\noperator.\"  The remaining contested terms of the '392 patent are sufficiently clear \n- 9 -Case: 1:13-cv-04417 Document #: 92 Filed: 09/18/14 Page 9 of 10 PageID #:<pageID>without any additional construction.
