    "summary": "1. **Summary:** \nThis case involves Derek Mobley and other plaintiffs suing Workday, Inc., alleging that its AI-based applicant recommendation system discriminates against job candidates based on age, race, and disability, particularly affecting applicants over forty. The court granted preliminary collective certification for the age discrimination claim, allowing Mobley to notify similarly situated individuals so they can opt into the lawsuit. This stage focuses on the collective similarity of claims regarding whether Workday's system causes a disparate impact on applicants over forty.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue:** \nThe key legal issue is whether Workday's AI recommendation system causes a disparate impact on applicants over the age of forty, in violation of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA).\n\n3. **Court's Holding:** \nThe court granted preliminary collective certification, finding that Mobley adequately alleged a unified discriminatory policy through Workday’s AI system impacting applicants over forty. The court determined that the issue of whether the AI caused a disparate impact is suited for common proof across the proposed collective, thereby allowing preliminary certification of the collective age discrimination claim.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation:**\nImagine there's a robot that helps decide who gets a job interview by looking at their job applications. Some people think this robot is unfair to older applicants, not giving them a fair chance to move forward in job searches. A group of people, led by a man named Derek, went to court to make this case on behalf of many similar workers. The court decided that enough people could have been affected the same way, so they allowed Derek to tell others about the case and invite them to join in saying, \"If you feel the robot treated you unfairly due to age, you can join Derek in this lawsuit!\"",
    "full_text": "1  \n \n \nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT  \nNORTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA  \n \nDEREK MOBLEY , \nPlaintiff , \nv. \n \nWORKDAY, INC. , \nDefendant . \n Case No.   23-cv-00770 -RFL    \n \n \nORDER GRANTING PRELIMINARY  \nCOLLECTIVE  CERTIFICATION  \nRe: Dkt. No. 10 6 \n \n \nDerek Mobley brings this action for employment discrimination against Workday, Inc., \nalleging that Workday’s artificial intelligence (“AI”) -based applicant recommendation  system  \ndiscriminated against job applicants on the basis of race, age, and disability.   Mobley  is joined by \nfour other plaintiffs over the age of forty,  who allege that they too have applied for hundreds of \njobs via Workday and have been rejected almost every time without an interview, allegedly \nbecause of age discrimination in Workday’s AI recommendation  system .  Mobley now moves \nfor preliminary certification of a collective action on the age discrimination claim , which would \nallow him to notify similarly situat ed individuals of the lawsuit and provide them an opportunity \nto opt -in to having their claims heard on a collective basis .  (Dkt. No. 106.)  After additional \ndiscovery, Workday would then have an opportunity to present evidence that the collective is \nnot, in fact , similarly situated .  Workday could then  ask the Court to revisit its preliminary \ndecision by de -certifying the collective and requiring each plaintiff to proceed individually.  \nMobley’s  motion  for preliminar y certif ication of  the collective  is GRANTED .   \nThe proposed collective is similarly situated because Mobley has substantially alleged the \nexistence of a unified policy:  the use of Workday’s AI recommendation system to score, sort, Case 3:23-cv-00770-RFL     Document 128     Filed 05/16/25     Page 1 of 202 rank, or screen applicants.  The critical issue at the heart of Mobley’s  claim is whether that \nsystem has a disparate impact on applicants over forty .  That  issue  is susceptible to common \nproof —it cuts across the proposed collective, regardless of the degree  to which  particular \nemployers place weight on those  recommendations, the extent to which the system makes \ndiscriminatory recommendations across different  employers, or  the natural variations in the  \nqualifications or rejection rate for particular members of the proposed collective .  At this stage, \nthat is sufficient.  T he proposed collective need not be identical in all ways, because its members \nare alike in the central way that matters:  they were allegedly required  to compet e on unequal \nfooting due to Workday’s di scriminatory A I recommendations.  \nWorkday has raised concerns that there may be logistical hurdles to identifying members \nof the collective.  On the current record, those challenges do not appear insurmountable.  And, of \ncourse, c hallenges in identifying the collective  are not an excuse for denying notice  altogether .  \nNor does the size of the collective provide a basis to decline to provide notice .  If the collective is \nin the “hundreds of millions” of people, as Workday speculates, that is because Workday has \nbeen plausibly accused of discriminating against a broad swath of applicants.  Allegedly \nwidespread discrimination is not a basis for denyin g notice.  The parties shall meet and confer  \nand engage in further targeted discovery to develop a notice plan.  If necessary, publication \nnotice via social media or electronic notice to applicants using  Workday’s platform could be \nconsidered, but only if targeted notice cannot be accomplished.   \nI. BACKGROUND  \nA. Allegations and Supporting  Declaration s \nMobley seeks preliminary certification of a nationwide collective as to his Age \nDiscrimination in Employment Act (“ADEA”) claim.  The proposed collective includes “[a]ll \nindividuals aged 40 and over who, from September 24, 2020, through the present, [] applied for \njob opportunities using Workday, Inc.’s job application platform and were denied employment Case 3:23-cv-00770-RFL     Document 128     Filed 05/16/25     Page 2 of 203 recommendations.”  (Dkt. No. 106 at 14.)1   \nWorkday allegedly provides “human resource management services” including  applicant \nscreening services  on a subscription basis to businesses spanning numerous different industries.  \n(Dkt. No. 47  (“FAC” ), at 2, ¶¶ 89 –90.)  Workday  provides a  platform on the customer’s website \nto collect, process, and screen job applications.  ( See id. at 2, ¶¶  49–55.)  Workday’s website \nstates that it can “reduce time to hire by automatically dispositioning or moving candidates \nforward in the recruiting process.”  ( Id. ¶ 94. )  Workday allegedly “embeds artificial intelligence \n. . . into its algorithmic decision -making tools, enabling these applications to make hiring \ndecisions.”  ( Id. ¶ 99.)  Workday’s applicant screening tools allegedly integrate “pymetrics” that \n“use neuroscience data and AI,” in combination with existing employee referrals and \nrecommendations.  ( Id. ¶¶ 100 –01.)  According to Mobley, these tools “determine whether an \nemployer should accept or reject an application” and are designed in a manner that reflects \nemployer biases and relies on biased training data.  ( Id. at 3, ¶¶ 28, 38 –48, 102 –03.)  Mobley \nalleges that Workday’s AI  recommendation system can score, sort, rank, or screen an  applicant  \nand provide that data to the employer .  (Id. at 2–3, ¶¶ 28, 39, 98–101, 110 –12, 120 .)  In many  \ncases , an applicant can advance in the hiring process only if they get past Workday’s screening \nalgorithms.  ( Id. ¶ 98.)   \nAlthough discovery is ongoing, the  parties ’ preliminary collective certification briefing \ndiscusses  two Workday tools.  The first tool, Candidate Skills Match (“CSM”) , operates within a \nsubscription service called “Workday Recruiting” to “extract [] skills in the employer’s job \nposting” and the applicant’s materials “and determine the extent to which the applicant’s skills \nmatch the role to which they applied.  The results of CSM are reported [to the employer] as \n‘strong,’ ‘good,’ ‘fair,’ ‘low,’ ‘pending,’ a nd ‘unable to score.’”  (Dkt. No. 109 -6 at 4 .)  The \nsecond tool,  Workday Assessment Connector (“WAC”) is alleged to  use machine learning  to \n“observe that a client -employer disfavors certain candidates who are members of a protected \n \n1 Citations to page numbers refer to the ECF pagination.  Case 3:23-cv-00770-RFL     Document 128     Filed 05/16/25     Page 3 of 204 class, [and]  decrease the rate at which it recommends those candidates .”  (FAC ¶¶ 39, 100–01; \nDkt. No. 107 at 29 –30.)  Workday stated at oral argument —without introducing any evidence on \nthe issue —that WAC acts as a bridge to allow employers to access only “third -party” AI \nfeatures.  (Dkt. No. 120 at 8:6 –17; Dkt. No. 107 at 29 n. 6 .)  Via declaration, Workday also \nasserts that  customers with Workday Recruit ing subscriptions may  “enable, disable, use, or \nignore its many features ,” including its AI features .  (Dkt. No. 107 at 9 (citing Dkt. No. 108  ¶ \n10).)    \nSince 2017, Mobley has allegedly applied to over 100 positions with companies that use \nWorkday’s screening features  for talent acquisition and hiring.  ( FAC  ¶ 49.)  Mobley was \nallegedly denied employment for every one of the 100 -plus applications that he submitted to \ncompanies using Workday’s platform.  (Id. ¶ 88.)  In support of his motion, Mobl ey submits the \ndeclarations of four Opt-In Plaintiffs who likewise state that they are over forty and have \nsubmitted “hundreds of employment applications to prospective employers” through the \nWorkday system  and have been rejected nearly every time.  ( See Dkt. No. 106  at 6, 9 –13.)  Each \nOpt-In Plaintiff alleges that they  received at least one “automated” rejection email for a job for \nwhich the y met the qualification requirements.  ( Id.)  \nB. Motion to Dismiss Order  \nMobley  has already been found to have stated a plausible ADEA claim on a disparate \nimpact theory.  As explained in the order denying Workday’s motion to dismiss, Mobley has \nalleged that “Workday’s customers delegate traditional hiring functions, including rejecting \napplicants, to the algorithmic decision -making tools provided by Workday.”  ( Dkt. No. 80  at 9.)  \nSpecifically, “Workday’s software is not simply implementing in a rote way the criteria that \nemployers set forth, but is instead participating in the decision -making process by recommending \nsome candidates to move forward and rejecting others.”  ( Id.)  “Given Workday’s allegedly \ncrucial role in deciding which applicants can get their ‘foot in the door’ for an interview,” \nMobley had plausibly alleged that “Workday’s tools are engaged in conduct that is at the heart of \nequal access to employment opportu nities.”  (Id.)  Mobley has also adequately alleged that these Case 3:23-cv-00770-RFL     Document 128     Filed 05/16/25     Page 4 of 205 tools created a discriminatory disparity.  ( Id. at 15.)   \nII. LEGAL STANDARD  \nMobley  seeks preliminary  collective certification of his ADEA claim.  The AD EA \nprohibits employers from discriminating against a qualified individual on the basis of a disability \n“in regard to job application procedures” and “the hiring” of employees.  42 U.S.C. § 12112(a).   \nIn proving a claim for disparate impact under the ADEA “a plaintiff must (1) show a significant \ndisparate impact on a protected class or group; (2) identify the specific employment practices or \nselection criteria at issue; and (3) show a causal relationship between the challenged practices or \ncriteria and the disparate impact.”  Bolden -Hardge v. Off. of Cal. State Controller , 63 F.4th 1215, \n1227 (9th Cir. 2023).  \nThe ADEA is enforced “in accordance with the powers, remedies, and procedures” of the \nFair Labor Standards Act (“FLSA”).  29 U.S.C. § 626(b); Heath v. Google LLC , 345 F. Supp. 3d \n1152, 1164 (N.D. Cal. 2018).  Section 216(b) of the FLSA provides that one or more employees \nmay bring a collective action against any employer on behalf of “themselves and other \nemployees similarly situated.”  29 U.S.C. § 216(b).  Under this provision, “workers may litigate \njointly if they (1) claim a violation of the FLSA, (2) ar e ‘similarly situated,’ and (3) affirmatively \nopt into the joint litigation.”  Campbell v. City of Los Angeles , 903 F.3d 1090, 1100 (9th Cir. \n2018).  The FLSA does not define the term “similarly situated .”  See 29 U.S.C. § 216(b); \nCampbell , 903 F.3d at 1100 (“Given  the[] gaps [in the FLSA], much of collective action practice \nis a product of interstitial judicial lawmaking or ad hoc district court discretion.”).  However, \n“what matters is not just any similarity between party plaintiffs, but a legal or factual similarity \nmaterial to the resolution of the party plaintiffs’ claims, in the sense of having the potential to \nadvance these claims, collectively, to some resolution.”  Campbell , 903 F.3d  at 1115  (emphasis \nin original) .  Frequently, plaintiffs satisfy the “similarly situated” analysis with “substantial \nallegations, supported by declarations or discovery, that the putative class members were \ntogether the victims of a single decision, policy, or plan.”  See Villa v. United Site Servs. of Cal ., \nInc., No. 12 -cv-318-LHK, 2012 WL 5503550, at *13 (N.D. Cal. Nov. 13, 2012)  (collecting Case 3:23-cv-00770-RFL     Document 128     Filed 05/16/25     Page 5 of 206 cases) .  If such  similarit ies exist, the  collective  may be granted preliminary certif ication even if \nthere are  differences  that will ultimately require  a degree of  individual adjudication.  Id. at *14 \n(“certification is proper based on the allegations that Defendant operated under [a] common \npolicy, even though to prove liability, individual plaintiffs may still have to prove that they never \nactually took their breaks, and thus were underpaid”) .   \nIn Campbell , the Ninth Circuit described with approval the common practice in this \ndistrict of using  a two-step process to determin e whether a collective is “similarly situated.”  See \nCampbell , 903 F.3d at 11 10 (finding that “[t]here is good reason for th[e] consensus” on the two -\nstep approach).  First, “plaintiffs will typically move for preliminary certification.”  Id. at 1109.  \nAt this stage, the standard of review is “loosely akin to a plausibility standard, commensurate \nwith the stage of the proceedings,” and “the district court’s analysis is typically focused on a \nreview of the pleadings but may sometimes be supplemented by declara tions or limited other \nevidence.”  Id.2  If preliminary certification is granted, the “sole consequence . . . is the sending \nof court -approved written notice to workers who may wish to join the litigation as individuals.”  \nId. at 1101  (quoting Genesis Healthcare Corp. v. Symczyk , 569 U.S. 66, 75 (2013)) . \nAfter a collective has secured preliminary certification, the second stage of the analysis \n“will come at or after the close of relevant discovery. ”  Id. at 1109.  “The employer can move for \n‘decertification’ of the collective action for failure to satisfy the ‘similarly situated’ requirement \nin light of the evidence produced to that point.”  Id. (citing  1 McLaughlin on Class Actions § \n2:16 (21st ed.  2024 ); 7B Fed. Prac. & Proc. Civ. § 1807  (3d ed.  2025 )).  “The district court will \nthen take a more exacting look at the plaintiffs’ allegations and the record.”  Id.  “[T]he two -step \nprocess, culminating in a decertification motion on or after the close of rel evant discovery, has \nthe advantage of ensuring early notice of plausible collective actions, then eliminating those \n \n2 “The fact that a defendant submits competing declarations will not as a general rule preclude \n[preliminary]  certification.”  Harris v. Vector Mktg. Corp. , 716 F. Supp. 2d 835, 838 (N.D. Cal. \n2010) ; see also Sanchez v. Sephora USA, Inc. , No. 11-cv-03396 -SBA, 2012 WL 2945753, at *4 \n(N.D. Cal. July 18, 2012) (collecting cases that disregarded disputed evidence submitted by \ndefendants when certifying a collective at the notice stage).  Case 3:23-cv-00770-RFL     Document 128     Filed 05/16/25     Page 6 of 207 whose promise is not borne out by the record.”  Id. at 1110.  \nIII. DISCUSSION  \nA. Burden of Proof  \nAs an initial matter, Workday argues that Mobley  should be held to a significantly  higher \nburden of proof at the first stage of the “similarly situated” analysis  because the parties have \nalready engaged in some discovery.   (Dkt. No. 107 at 11 , 31–32.)  In essence, Workday proposes \na sliding scale, in which the more discovery has occurred, the more evidence plaintiff should \nhave to provide.  At oral argument , consistent with that approach,  Workday repeatedly faulted \nMobley for relying on his well -pled allegations and  for failing to come forward with  sufficient \nevidence .  The Court declines to apply a sliding -scale standard , which is contrary to the \nprocedure used by virtually all district courts in this circuit.  Such an approach would be \nimpossible to app ly with consistency , would encourage gamesmanship, and is contrary to the \npolicy considerations laid out in Campbell .   \nUnlike the straightforward standard described in Camp bell, a sliding scale standard \nwould require a court to weigh competing evidence on an incomplete record, attempting  to fairly \naccount for what percentage of discovery has yet to be exchanged.  Such a system would lead to \ninconsistent rulings.   How much weight should a court assign conflicting evidence proffered by a \ndefendant  when the court  estimates that only 20% of relevant discovery has been exchanged ?  \nWhat burden of proof should a plaintiff be held to where  90% of discovery is complete ?  What \nshould a court do where, as here, the parties disagree on  how much critical discovery remains to \nbe exchanged ?  Even more concerning, the system would encourage  gamesmanship.  P arties \ncould  withhold critical discovery until after preliminary  collective  certification  in an effort to win \nan early —and potentially dispositive —evidentiary battl e.  It would also allow defendants to  \nengineer a higher burden of proof for a plaintiff simply by negotiating for a lengthier discovery \nperiod prior to preliminary  certification, just as Workday did here in its proposed schedule at the \ninitial cas e management conference .  (See Dkt. No. 92.)  \nCampbel l endorses a two -step process where step one is “ loosely akin to a plausibility Case 3:23-cv-00770-RFL     Document 128     Filed 05/16/25     Page 7 of 208 standard ” and step two “resemble [s] a motion for partial summary judgment.”  Campbell , 903 \nF.3d at 11 09.  Its reasons for doing so are clear.  The system “ensur[es] early notice of plausible \ncollective actions” to the interested parties, and “then eliminating those whose promise is not \nborne out by the record.”  Id. at 1110.   Workday has provided no compelling reason for departing \nfrom the Ninth Circuit’s directive here, especially where Workday’s own evidentiary submission \nis limited to excerpts of  Plaintiffs ’ deposition transcripts, four interrogatory responses, and a \nsingle declaration.  (Dkt. Nos. 108, 109.)  Mobley ’s motion will therefore be assessed under the \n“substantial allegations” of similarity standard set forth above .   \nB. Mobley’s Proposed Collective  \nMobley argues that the proposed collective is “similarly situated” because all proposed \nmembers , like Mobley and the Opt -In Plaintiffs, were “together the victims of a single . . . \npolicy” :  “Workday’s artificial intelligence and machine learning screening products [which] \ntreat applicants over age 40 discriminatorily and have a disparate impact against them .”  (Dkt. \nNo. 106  at 15 , 18.)  He points to the allegations in the complaint, which have  already  been  found \nplausible, and the declarations of Opt -In Pl aintiffs who similarly experienced a high rejection \nrate of their application s processed through Workday.  ( Id. at 18.)   \nMobley  has substantially alleged an “identifiable factual or legal nexus [that] binds \ntogether the various claims of the [collective]  members in a way that hearing the claims together \npromotes judicial efficiency and comports with the broad remedial policies underlying the \nFLSA,” making the proposed collective  similarly situated.  See Rabin v. \nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP , No. 16 -cv-2276 -JST, 2018 WL 3585143, at *4 (N.D. Cal. July \n26, 2018) (citing Russell v. Wells Fargo & Co. , No. 07 -cv-3993 -CW, 2008 WL 4104212, at *3 \n(N.D. Cal. Sept. 3, 2008) ).  Specifically, he has  shown that the elements of his prima facie \ndisparate impact claim are susceptible to com mon proof.  Because Mobley has identified a \nunified policy applicable to all the putative collective members, common evidence can be used to \n“(1) show a significant disparate impact on [individuals over 40]; (2) identify the specific \nemployment practices or selection criteria at issue; and (3) show a causal relationship between Case 3:23-cv-00770-RFL     Document 128     Filed 05/16/25     Page 8 of 209 the challenged practices or criteria and the disparate impact.”  See Bolden -Hardge , 63 F.4th at \n1227  (listing the elements of a prima facie disparate impact case) .  Even under the more exacting \n“commonality” standard, the Ninth Circuit has found that the identification of a uniform policy \nthat allegedly generated a disparate impact creates a common question as to a prima facie case of \ndisparate impact age discrimination.  See Stockwell v. City & Cnty.  of San Francisco , 749 F.3d \n1107, 1114 –15 (9th Cir. 2014) ; see also Wal -Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes , 564 U.S. 338, 350 –56 \n(2011) (“If the employer ‘used a biased testing procedure to evaluate [] applicants for \nemployment. . .  , a class action on behalf of every applicant . . . who might have been prejudiced \nby the test clearly would satisfy the commonality and typicality requirements of Rule 23(a).’”) \n(quoting  Gen. Tel. Co. S w. v. Falcon , 457 U.S. 147 , 159 n. 15  (1982)).   \nThe mechanisms behind  Workday’s AI recommendation  system , the effects  on applicants \nwho are over 40 , and whether those “effects amount to a disparate impact on account of age, [] \nwill be so for all [collective]  members or for none; their claims rise and fall together.”  Stockwell , \n749 F.3d at 1115.  Therefore, as discussed in further detail below, preliminary collective \ncertification is proper.   \nC. Challenges to Any  Proposed Collective  \nWorkday advances several arguments for why it is impossible for any collective to be \nsimilarly situated under Mobley’s theory of the case.  First, Workday claims that it “does not \noffer ‘employment recommendations, ’ so no one belongs in this collective, including [Mobley] .”  \n(Dkt. No. 107 at 31 (emphasis in original).)  Second, Workday argues that the policy Mobley has \nidentified is not uniform, defeating preliminary collective certification .  Finally, Workday \nsuggests that the natural variation in the proposed  collective members ’ qualification s for the jobs \nto which they applied, number of jobs applied to, and rejection rate mean that no collective could \never be similarly situated.  Each of these arg uments is addressed in turn.     \n1. Whether Workday “Recommends” Applicants  \nCiting its interrogatory responses, Workday argues that “Workday does not recommend, \nscreen out, or otherwise assess or predict applicants’ likelihood of success in a role.”  (Dkt. No. Case 3:23-cv-00770-RFL     Document 128     Filed 05/16/25     Page 9 of 2010 107 at 31.)  Therefore, Workday claims that no one has ever been “denied employment \nrecommendations” by Workday and the proposed collective  has no members.  Id.  But this \nposition is contrary to the well -pled allegations in the complaint (incorporating Workday’s \nstatements on its own website), as well as Workday’s interrogatory responses.  For example:  \n \n• Workday’s website states that “[o]ur skills intelligence foundation \nhelps you build diverse teams by expanding candidate pools with \nequitable, AI- and ML -driven job recommendations .”  (FAC ¶ 111 \n(emphasis added).)3   \n \n• In discovery, Workday stated that: “Workday customers who \npurchase Workday Recruiting have access to Candidate Skills Match \n(‘CSM’), which they can choose to turn on or off.  If a customer \nchooses to turn on CSM, CSM utilizes artificial intelligence to par se \nan employer’s job posting and an applicant’s application and/or \nresume; extract skills in the employer’s job posting, on the one hand, \nand skills from the application and/or resume on the other hand; and \ndetermine the extent to which the applicant’s ski lls match the role to \nwhich they applied.  The results of CSM are reported as ‘strong,’ \n‘good,’ ‘fair,’ ‘low,’ ‘pending,’ and ‘unable to score .’”  (Dkt. No. \n109-6 at 4 (emphasis added).)  \n \n• Plaintiff alleges that Workday’s “algorithms are only trained on \nincumbent employees at a company, allowing the pymetrics Workday \nAssessment Connector to build a homogenous workforce not \nrepresentative of the applicant pool.”  (FAC ¶ 102.)   \nWorkday fails to explain why the conduct described above does not constitute \n“recommend[ing], screen[ing] out, or otherwise assess[ing] or predict[ing] applicants’ likelihood \nof success in a role.”  Workday appears to take the position that because its AI recommendation \nsystem  supposedly cannot auto -reject applicants without some degree of participation by the \nemployer , Workday  does not “recommend.”  But Mobley’s  disparate impact claim is based on \nthe theory that Workday’s AI “participat [es] in the decision -making process,” a concept that is \nbroader than auto -rejections.  ( Dkt. No. 80  at 9.)  Therefore, even if Workday is taken at its word \nthat its AI recommendation system cannot auto-reject an applicant, Workday is incorrect that the \nproposed collective  is memberless.   An individual who received a “low” CSM score, for \nexample, could  qualify as having been denied an employment recommendation.  Similarly, \n \n3 Quoting  https://www.workday.com/en -us/products/talent -management/talent -acquisition.html.  Case 3:23-cv-00770-RFL     Document 128     Filed 05/16/25     Page 10 of 2011 Mobley has substantially alleged that the WAC operates to recommend certain applicants over \nothers in a way that causes a disparate impact.    \nQuestions remain regarding where to draw the line between someone who was and \nsomeone who was not “recommended. ”  Does anything less than a “strong” CSM  score qualify \nas a denial of a recommendation?  How should  the results  of any  other  features  be measured?  \nHowever, the fact that these questions remain outstanding does not mean that no collective may \nbe certified.  See, e.g., Heath v. Google Inc. , 215 F. Supp. 3d 844, 859 (N.D. Cal. 2016) \n(certifying the collective and “instruct[ing] the parties to meet a nd confer on how to use \napplicants’ graduation date information as a proxy for age . . . to identify the candidates to whom \nthe third -party administrator will send notice” ).  Where the court has found that a collective \nshould receive preliminary certification, it cannot withhold notice simply because it will be \ndifficult to identify individual putative members.  See Campbell , 903 F.3d at 1110 ( stating that \n“in a valid collection action, ‘forbid[ding] the sending of notice altogether’ would be an abuse of \ndiscretion”) ( quoting  Woods v. N.Y. Life Ins. Co. , 686 F.2d 578, 580 (7th Cir. 1982)); see also  \nCarrillo v. Schneider Logistics, Inc ., No. 11 -cv-08557, 2012 WL 556309, at * 12–13 (C.D. Cal. \nJan. 31, 2012)  (authorizing alternative notice  where members of the collective  could not be \neasily identified) , aff’d on other grounds , 501 F. App’x 713 (9th Cir. 2012) .  Accordingly, the \nparties are ordered to meet and confer to determine how to define a “recommendation ,” along \nwith the other issues further detailed below.   \n2. Whether Mobley Has Identified a Unified  Policy  \nWorkday next argues that Mobley has failed to show that any uniform policy applies to \nall applications submitted through Workday, and that “[w]ithout that uniformity, there can be no \ncommon decision, policy, or plan justifying collective adjudication.”  (D kt. No. 107 at 29.)   \nSpecifically, Workday points out that employers can choose whether or not to use Workday’s AI \nfeatures.  ( Id. at 30.)  Furthermore, with respect to the “Workday Assessment Connector” feature  \nwhich Mobley alleges is used to “build a homogenous workforce” at a particular company, \nDefendant argues that whether or not this feature  cause s a disparate impact would necessarily Case 3:23-cv-00770-RFL     Document 128     Filed 05/16/25     Page 11 of 2012 vary based on the existing makeup of the employer’s incumbent workforce.  ( Id. at 29 –30.)  \nAs to the use of AI features  by Workday’s clients , the proposed collective already  \nencompass es only individuals whose applications were subject to  Workday’s AI  because the \nemployer turned on AI features .  By limiting the collective to those who were “denied \nemployment recommendation s” by Workday, the collective necessarily includes  only individuals \nwho were scored, sorted, ranked, or screened by Workday’s  AI and who either had this \ninformation conveyed to the employer  or who had their application withheld from the employer \nby Workday .  That is because  an individual who was scored, sorted, ranked, or screened based  \nonly on criteria  that were  specifically  selected by the employer  alone  has not been “denied [an] \nemployment recommendation” by Workday , even if the employer -directed  screening was \neffectuated through Workday.   In that hypothetical scenario , Workday would be no different \nfrom an excel spreadsheet operated by the employer  that sorted employees by age, so that the \nemployer could refuse to interview those above a certain cutoff.  (Dkt. No. 80 at 11.)  As \npreviously held in the motion to dismiss order, Workday would not be liable under an agency \ntheory in that scenario.  (Id.)  Accordingly, the individual w ould not be part of the proposed \ncollective.  The unified policy that Mobley has identified is Workday’s  AI recommend ation  \nsystem, and the proposed collective  reflects that limitation.   Workday will have the opportunity \nat a later stage of the case to present evidence that its AI system does not operate in a unified \nway.   \nWorkday’s argument  that certain of its AI features  could vary in their impact across \ndifferent employers  does not defeat the existence of common issues either .  In nearly every  large \ndisparate impact case , certain  units of the whole —for example, regions of a national company  or \ndivisions of a n organization —will demonstrate  the effects of a  unified  discriminatory policy to a \ngreater or lesser extent  than others , or may demonstrate no discriminatory effect at all .  But \nwhere a unified policy exists and  the net disparate impact of that unified policy can be proven \nthrough statistical evidence, such unit -level differences do not defeat the prima facie \ndiscrimination case .  The case re mains subject to collective proof.  For example, in Ellis v. Case 3:23-cv-00770-RFL     Document 128     Filed 05/16/25     Page 12 of 2013 Costco Wholesale Corp. , 285 F.R.D. 492  (N.D. Cal. 2012) , Costco  opposed  certification in a \ncase related to gender  discrimination in promotion.  Id. at 522 –23.  Costco ’s expert argued that \nthe court should look at “promotion numbers by region and evaluate each region separately ,” \nnoting  that some regions showed no evidence of discrimination.  Id.  The court found the  region -\nby-region  data unpersuasive  for several reasons, including that Costco’s top -down “promotion \npractices support a nationwide statistical analysis.”  Id.  Here , as well, Mobley has identified a \nunified policy that is the source of the alleged discriminatory disparate impact.  At this stage, the \nfact that the policy may not yield discriminatory results in every possible scenario  does not mean \nthat the proposed collective is not similarly situated.   \nFurthermore, if Workday intends to argue that any observable disparate impact is the \nresult of employer -driven bias and not attributable to Workday, that issue does not defeat \npreliminary certification  either .  How Workday’s AI recommendation  system works , and the \nextent to which any disparate impact is  generally driven by employer preferences  rather than \nWorkday’s own algorithm s, are issues susceptible to common proof.  To the extent Workday \ncontends that its advertised  AI recommendations are mere rote implementation of employer \npreferences, and thus that no uniform policy can be traced to its AI, that is an issue for the \nsecond stage of the  “similarly situated” analysis , and not this preliminary stage .  See Rabin , 2018 \nWL 3585143, at *4 ( “[c]onsiderations involving the merits of claims are more appropriately \naddressed at the second stage of the analysis when fewer facts  are in dispute” ) (citation omitted) ; \nsee also  Stockwell , 749 F.3d at 1114  n. 3 (in the more demanding Rule 23(b) context, affirmative \ndefenses are “not pertinent to the commonality question, as long as there is a common question \nas to the [] prima facie case of disparate impact age discrimination”) .   \n3. Whether the Individual Characteristics of Members of the Proposed \nCollective Make Certification Impossible  \nWorkday argues that because Mobley and the Opt -In Plaintiffs (i) did not meet the \nminimum qualifications for every job they were rejected from, (ii) sometimes omitted indicia of \ntheir age from their applications, and (iii) received some  interview s or job  offers  as the result of Case 3:23-cv-00770-RFL     Document 128     Filed 05/16/25     Page 13 of 2014 their applications via  Workday, they are not similarly situated to the hypothetical plaintiff who \ncould state a disparate impact claim against Workday.  (Dkt. No. 107 at 13 –15, 21 –24.)  \nWorkday sees Mobley and Opt -in Plaintiffs’ slightly varied  application  experiences as \n“emblematic”  of the fact that the individual characteristics  of potential collective members  will \noverwhelm, making “collective adjudication [] impossible .”  (Id. at 19, 24 (emphasis in \noriginal).)   At oral argument, Workday raised  further  concerns about  whether Mobley  would be \nable to carry his burden at the merits stage of statistically proving a disparate impact claim where  \nthe collective compris ed both  qualified and unqualified candidates for jobs .   \nMobley is not required to prove that each member of the proposed collective is \nidentically situated, or even that common questions predominate.  Villa , 2012 WL 5503550, at \n*14 (“conditional certification of a collective action does not require a showing that common \nclaims predominate”).  Instead, his burden is  to identify legal or factual similarit ies that are  \nmaterial to the resolution of the case.  Id.  As discussed above, Mobley has met that burden.  \nMobley has substantially  alleged  that the factors of his prima facie disparate impact claim are \nsusceptible to common proof.    \nIt is possible that , at the merits stage, Mobley will face challenges in proving  disparate \nimpact  for the reasons that Workday identifies .  However, that challenge is one that is common \nto the collective , and does not counsel against certification.  See Tyson Foods, Inc. v. \nBouaphakeo , 577 U.S. 442, 457 (2016) (“[r]espondents’ ‘failure of proof on this common \nquestion ’ likely would have ended ‘the litigation and thus would not have caused individual \nquestions to overwhelm questions common to the class. ’”) (quoting  Amgen Inc. v. Conn . Ret. \nPlans and Tr . Funds , 568 U.S. 455, 468 (2013))  (cleaned up) .  The variables may also be \nrelevant to Workday’s defenses in individual cases, and will likely  impact individual plaintiffs’ \nclaim for damages .  However, the “various defenses available to the defendant which appear to \nbe individual to each plaintiff” is properly assessed at the second phase of the collective \ncertification inquiry , and is not relevant to the  preliminary certification  analysis .  See Rabin , \n2018 WL 3585143, at *4 .  In sum , Workday has not identified a basis to deny preliminary Case 3:23-cv-00770-RFL     Document 128     Filed 05/16/25     Page 14 of 2015 certification.   \nD. Limits on the Collective  \nWorkday argues that the only individuals who could conceivably be entitled to join a \ncollective on Mobley’s theory of the case are those who applied to a high number of jobs, met \nthe minimum qualification for every job for which they applied, and had a “zero percent success \nrate.”  (Dkt. No. 106 at 12, 14, 20.)  Workday claims that no other applicants are “entitled to the \nsame ‘inference of  discrimination’ the Court gave [Mobley ] at the motion to dismiss.”  ( Id. at \n20–21.)  In support , Workday argues that t he FLSA  was amended to “limit[] private [ADEA] \nplaintiffs to employees who asserted claims in their own right and free[] employers of the burden \nof representative actions.”  (Dkt. No. 160 at 21 (quoting Hoffmann -La Roche , 493 U.S. at 173) \n(emphasis added by Workday).)   \nThis case, however, is no longer at the motion to dismiss stage and has moved into \ndiscovery.  As such, whether each member of the collective could allege disparate impact \nwithout the benefit of discovery is irrelevant.  Instead, the question is whether the proposed \ncollective members are similarly situated in the sense that they were actually “subject to the \nparticular employment practice with the alleged disparate impact .”  See Pottenger v. Potlatch \nCorp. , 329 F.3d 740, 749–750 (9th Cir. 2003 ); see also  Campbell , 903 F.3d at 1100 (individuals \nmay only “join a collective action if they [] claim a violation of the FLSA , [] are ‘similarly \nsituated ’ to the original plaintiff,  [] and affirmatively opt in”) (emphasis added).  Because the \nproposed collective encompasses only individuals who submitted applications through Workday \nand were “denied employment recommendations ,” this requirement is satisfied.   \nIt is unnecessary to examine each individual’s qualifications , application volume,  or \nrejection rate to determine if they are members of the collective.  Whether Workday’s AI \nrecommendation  system  has a disparate impact on applicants over forty is a question that is \naddressed across the collective, not on a member -by-member basis.  Workday cites Heath for the \nproposition the collective cannot include “ individuals who were not qualified for the jobs to \nwhich they applied .”  (Dkt. No 107 at 20 –23 (citing Heat h, 215 F. Supp. 3d at 857).)  But Heath  Case 3:23-cv-00770-RFL     Document 128     Filed 05/16/25     Page 15 of 2016 was a disparate treatment case.  Heath , 215 F. Supp. 3d at 848.  Therefore, unlike in Heath , \n“qualification” is not an element of Mobley’s prima facie disparate impact claim.  Compare id.  at \n857 (citing Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods., Inc. , 530 U.S. 133, 142 (2000)) with Bolden -\nHardge , 63 F.4th at 1227 .   \nMoreover, applicants do not need to show that they were qualified, got rejected, or would \nlikely have succeeded in being hired for the job in order to have standing to bring a disparate \nimpact claim  for injunctive relief .4  See Carney v. Adams , 592 U.S. 53, 66 (2020)  (reaffirming  \nthat an “aggrieved party need not allege that he would have obtained the benefit but for the \nunlawful barrier in order to establish standing”) (quotations omitted).  Here, in addition to \ndamages, Plaintiffs seek injunctive relief to stop Workday from continuing to engage in the \nallegedly discriminatory practice.  (FAC at 35.)  To allege an injury -in-fact sufficient to satisfy \nArticle III standing  to seek injunctive relief , applicant s need only show that they were denied the \nright to compete on equal footing against other candidates due to the allegedly discriminatory \nnature of Workday’s AI recommendation  system , and that they intend to  apply for jobs in the \nfuture through  Workday’s platform .   \n“In the context of an employment discrimination claim, a plaintiff may claim an injury in \nfact from the purported denial of the ability to compete on an equal footing against other \ncandidates for a job.”  Shea v. Kerry, 796 F.3d 42, 50 (D.C. Cir. 2015) (citing Ne. Fla. Chapter \nof the Associated Gen. Contractors of Am. v. City of Jacksonville,  508 U.S. 656, 666 (1993)).  \n“And because the injury lies in the denial of an equal opportunity  to compete, not the denial of \nthe job itself, the Court need not inquire  into the plaintiff’s qualifications (or lack thereof) when \nassessing standing.”  Id. (citing  Regents of Univ. of Cal. v. Bakke,  438 U.S. 265, 280 –81 & n. 14 \n(1978))  (emphasis in original) ; Cerrato v. S.F. Cmty. Coll. Dist. , 26 F.3d 968, 976 (9th Cir. \n1994) (“[t]o establish standing, a person need only allege that a discriminatory policy exists that \n \n4 Workday conceded at oral argument that it was not challenging the proposed collective \nmembers’ standing at this stage, but this order addresses the issue to avoid any doubt as to the \npropriety of defining the collective in the proposed fashion.  Case 3:23-cv-00770-RFL     Document 128     Filed 05/16/25     Page 16 of 2017 prevents him from competing on an ‘equal basis’”).5  Individuals over forty who were allege dly \nsubjected to the discriminatory policy —i.e., they had an application scored, sorted, ranked, or \nscreened by Workday’s AI —therefore have standing regardless of their qualifications, \napplication volume, or rejection rate and may be included in the collective.    \nTo be sure, an applicant’s qualifications could affect their standing to seek damages .  See \nBraunstein v. Ariz . Dep’t Transp. , 683 F.3d 1177 , 1186 –87 (9th Cir. 2012) (plaintiff  lacked \nArticle III standing  to pursue a  damages claim in an equal protection case  because he had not \nsubmitted bids or shown that he would have been “in a position to compete equally ” absent the \nalleged discriminatory policy ).  However, there is no basis for precluding members who have \nstanding to seek injunctive relief from joining the collective simply because they may not be able \nto state a claim for money damages.  At the  trial stage , the collective action could proceed first \non a representative or group basis as to liability and injunctive relief, before mo ving into a \ndamages phase on an individual basis .  See 7B Fed. Prac. & Proc. Civ. § 1807  (3d ed.  2025 ).  At \nthis stage, it is premature to limit the collective  in the way that Workday suggests.6  \nIn summary, preliminary certification is granted to  the collective comprising “[a]ll \nindividuals aged 40 and over who, from September 24, 2020, through the present, [] applied for \njob opportunities using Workday, Inc.’s job application platform and were denied employment \nrecommendations .”  In this context, being “denied ” an “employment recommendation” means \n \n5 Workday contended at oral argument that this line of  cases is distinguishable because they \ninvolved employment tests that were alleged to discriminate under  Title VII rather than the \nADEA.  But Workday offers no principled reason why the Article III standing analysis should \ntreat injury -in-fact due to age discrimination differently from injury -in-fact due to race or sex \ndiscrimination.  \n6 It is theoretically possible that the preliminary  collective will include some individuals who, \nnotwithstanding that they applied to jobs using Workday in the last four years, do not intend to \napply to a ny jobs using Workday’s software in the future .  This is likely to be a small percentage \nof the total collective , given Workday’s widespread role in the job market.  ( See Dkt. No. 108 ¶¶ \n6-7.)  Furthermore , many such individuals will still have standing under a damages theory .  \nFinally , while there  may be a small subset of individuals in the preliminary collective who are \nnot in either camp , this fact does not render the case unmanageable  at this stage .  See Hoffmann -\nLa Roche Inc ., 493 U.S. at 174 (the court’s “intervention in the notice process [is] for case \nmanagement purposes”) .   Case 3:23-cv-00770-RFL     Document 128     Filed 05/16/25     Page 17 of 2018 that (i) the individual’s application was scored, sorted, ranked, or screened by Workday ’s AI; (ii) \nthe result of the AI scoring, sorting, ranking, or screening was not a recommendation to hire ;7 \nand (iii) th at result was communicated to the prospective employer , or the result was an \nautomatic rejection  by Workday .   \nE. Feasibility of Providing Notice  \nWorkday raises a host of concerns regarding how the parties can identify and notify \ncollective members.  In addition to its line -drawing concerns already discussed above, Workday \nargues that it is contractually barred from accessing data about applications, and even if it could \naccess that data, there is no way to det ermine the age of applicants.  Finally, Workday makes the \npolicy argument that the proposed collective is simply too big, and therefore any notice would \namount to  an improper solicitation of cl aims.   \nOn the existing record, it appears that  Workday will likely be able to access the necessary \ndata to provide targeted  notice, and that it would not be unduly burdensome for Workday to \ngather and provide said data .  First, Workday acknowledge d at oral argument that it is able to see \nwhether its customer s have enabled any AI features .  Second, Workday  does not dispute  that \napplicant data is hosted by Workday, and that while Workday’s customers sign  contracts that  \nprohibit Workday from accessing applicants’ confidential personal data, the contract contains an \nexception  applicable when Workday is subject to a court order.   Third, Workday confirmed that, \nassuming customer consent, it can identify the score that its CSM  feature  gave an applicant (and \ncan presumably do so for other features  as well ).  Finally, although Workday’s counsel was \nunable to confirm what age -correlated data Workday customers collect, it is a fair inference that \ndatapoints such as graduation year or employment experience will frequently  be available to use \nas a proxy for age.  See Heath , 215 F. Supp. 3d  at 859 ( ordering the parties to  “meet and confer \non how to use applicants’ graduation date information as a proxy for age, where available in \nGoogle’s gHire database, to identify the candidates to whom the third -party administrator will \n \n7 The parties should meet and confer to determine what rank, score, or grouping constitutes a \n“recommendation.”  Case 3:23-cv-00770-RFL     Document 128     Filed 05/16/25     Page 18 of 2019 send notice.”) .   \nThe estimated size of the collective does not provide a basis to withhold notice either.  \nWorkday states that “1.1 billion applications were rejected using Workday” during the time \nperiod at issue and “any notice would still invite potentially hundreds of millions of potential \nplaintiffs to file their claims in this case.”  (Dkt. No. 107 at 24 –25 (emphasis in original) .)  First, \nthis rough estimate ignores the qualifiers  in the definition of the collective that will limit its \nscope.  Second, it is not the size of the proposed collective  (as Workday argues),  but rather the \ncontent of the proposed notice , that the Supreme Court instructs courts to police in order to \n“respect judicial neutrality .”  Hoffmann -La Roche Inc , 493 U.S. at 174.  In fact,  Hoffmann -La \nRoche reinforces the importance of providing “accurate and timely notice concerning the \npendency of the collective action, so that [individuals] can make informed decisions about \nwhether to participate.”  Id. at 170.  There is no basis for withholding notice simply because \nWorkday is alleged to have discriminated against a large number of applicants .   \nIV. CONCLUSION  \nBecause the proposed collective is similarly situated, Mobley’s Motion for Conditional \nCertification of Collective Action (Dkt. No. 106) is GRANTED , and notice should  issue to the  \ncollective members.  Although  disputes remain —regarding, for example, the parameters of the \n“court order exception”  in Workday’s customer contracts,  the availability of age -related proxies , \nand how to define a “recommendation” —it is premature to find that any of these issue s make \ntargeted  notice unfeasible , and none of the identif ied issues support the withholding of notice \naltogether .  See Rabin v. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP , No. 16 -cv-02276 -JST, 2019 WL \n9078785, at *4 (N.D. Cal., Apr. 5, 2019) (certifying a collective action but explaining that \n“[h]aving so ruled, the Court cannot yet order notice to potential members of the collective \naction because —as the parties themselves agree —furth er meet -and-confer efforts are required \nbefore they and the Court can determine who will receive such notice”).   \nThe parties are directed to meet and confer and engage in further targeted discovery to \nresolve the remaining disputes .  The parties are encouraged to work cooperatively and Case 3:23-cv-00770-RFL     Document 128     Filed 05/16/25     Page 19 of 2020 transparently in identifying the most sensible manner for providing comprehensive notice.  In the \nevent that a list of collective members is developed based on incomplete information in \ndiscovery, and later discovery reveals that a larger group should have  been noticed, the Court \nmay consider whether to authorize further round(s) of notice  and which  party should be \nresponsible for the costs of that notice .  The parties should also consider whether alternative \nnotice is necessary if more targeted notice  proves too difficult.   Carrillo v. Schneider Logistics , \nInc., No. 11 -cv-08557, 2012 WL 556309, at *13 (C.D. Cal. Jan. 31, 2012), aff’d , 501 F. App’x \n713 (9th Cir. 2012) (collecting cases allowing for alternate notice distribution methods where \nFLSA workers could not be easily identified).  \nIn addition, Workday identifies a variety of legitimate concerns about the content of the \nproposed notice, about which the parties are directed to meet and confer.  The parties shall file \nby May 28 , 2025 , a case management statement containing a  proposed schedule  for the targeted \ndiscovery, submission of the notice plan and revised notice, and briefing and a hearing on \naspects of the notice plan on which the parties cannot reach agreement, if any .  If the parties are \nunable to reach agreement on the proposed schedule , the joint filing shall include each side’s \nproposal as to that issue and the reasoning behind its requested approach .  A case management \nconference  to discuss this schedule is set for June 4, 2025, at 10:00 a.m.  via videoconference .  \n \nIT IS SO ORDERED.  \nDated: May 16, 2025  \n \n  \nRITA F.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: Plaintiff Mozart Saint Cyr sued JPMorgan Chase, alleging they violated Massachusetts law by subjecting him to a de facto lie detector test using an AI-powered HireVue Interview during his job application process and failing to provide statutory notice regarding lie detector rights. The court dismissed the lie detector claim due to insufficient allegations demonstrating the HireVue Interview's use for truth detection and remanded the notice claim to state court for lack of jurisdiction, as the plaintiff couldn't establish harm from not receiving the notice.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether JPMorgan Chase's use of AI-powered HireVue Interviews constitutes a violation of the Massachusetts Lie Detector Statute, and if the absence of statutory notice about lie detector tests results in a legal claim.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court found the plaintiff's lie detector allegations insufficient and unrelated to the HireVue Interview's purpose of detecting lies, leading to the dismissal of the lie detector claim. The notice claim was remanded to state court due to lack of Article III standing, as the plaintiff couldn’t show a concrete injury.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine you're applying for a job, and they ask you to do an online interview where a computer program analyzes your answers and expressions. You think this is like a lie detector test, but the court says you haven't shown enough evidence to prove the company used it to see if you were lying. Plus, you didn't lose anything when they didn't tell you about lie detector rules, so that part of your case goes back to state court, which has different rules for hearing cases.",

Gen. Laws \nch. 149, § 19B (the “Lie Detector Statute”).  Plaintiff brings these claims on behalf of himself and \non behalf of all others similarly situated.  JPMorgan has moved to dismiss.  For the reasons stated \nherein, the Court finds Plaintiff’s allegations insufficient as to the purported lie detector test and \nfinds that the Court lacks jurisdiction over his notice claim.  Accordingly, the Court will grant \nJPMorgan’s motion in part, deny the motion in part, and remand the notice claim. \nI. Background \nA. Factual Background \nThe Court draws the following facts from the Amended Complaint, Dkt. 17 (“Compl.”), \nand accepts them as true for purposes of the instant motion. Case 1:25-cv-11751-BEM     Document 29     Filed 10/22/25     Page 1 of 8 \n2 Plaintiff applied to work at JPMorgan in or around September 2023 and again in or around \nDecember 2024.  Id. ¶ 8.  Neither application included the following notice: \nIt is unlawful in Massachusetts to require or administer a lie detector test as a \ncondition of employment or continued employment.  An employer who violates \nthis law shall be subject to criminal penalties and civil liability. \nId. ¶¶ 1–2, 8; see also Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 149, § 19B(2)(b) (“All applications for employment \nwithin the commonwealth shall contain the following notice which shall be in clearly legible \nprint.”).  Also, as part of one or both applications, JPMorgan requested that Plaintiff take a HireVue \nInterview, which Plaintiff completed.  Compl.  ¶¶ 3, 8. \nHireVue Interviews are an artificial-intelligence-powered job candidate screening tool, \nprovided by HireVue, Inc (“HireVue”).  Id. ¶ 20.  HireVue Interviews work by having job \ncandidates answer a set of interview questions online while being recorded.  Id.1  Applicants may \nbe asked questions related to honesty or integrity ( e.g., “Tell me about a time that you acted with \nintegrity.”).  Id. ¶ 22.  HireVue analyzes interviews using three types of data: language input, \nspeech input, and video input.  Id. ¶ 23.  “Language input” refers to the content of job candidates’ \nspoken responses, which are transcribed and assessed using artificial intelligence against “relevant \ncompetencies.”  Id. ¶¶ 24–27 (brackets omitted).  “Speech input” and “video input” refer to a \ncandidate’s tone, expression, and other verbal-visual cues, which are analyzed using third-party, \nartificial-intelligence technology and converted into an “employability score” or \n“competency-level scoring report” by HireVue.

Procedural Background \nOn April 28, 2025, Plaintiff filed this lawsuit against JPMorgan in the Suffolk County \nSuperior Court for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.  Dkt. 14 at 3–10.  On June 16, 2025, \nJPMorgan removed to this Court pursuant to the Class Action Fairness Act (“CAFA”), 28 U.S.C. \n§ 1332(d)(2), asserting minimal diversity and an amount in controversy exceeding $5 million.  \nSee generally Dkt. 1.  On July 17, 2025, upon an earlier motion to dismiss, later denied as moot, \nPlaintiff amended his complaint.  Dkts. 12–13, 17–18. \nIn his Amended Complaint, Plaintiff alleges three claims on behalf of himself and on behalf \nof a putative class or sub-class of job applicants: (1) for declaratory and injunctive relief, Compl. \n¶¶ 44–47; (2) for violation of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 149, § 19B(2), Compl. ¶¶ 48–  55 (the “Lie \nDetector Claim”); and (3) for violation of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 149, § 19B(2)(b), Compl. ¶¶ 56–  59 \n(the “Notice Claim”). \nOn August 25, 2025, JPMorgan filed the instant motion to dismiss under Federal \nRule 12(b)(6).  Dkt. 21; see also Dkt. 22 (“Memo.”).  On September 8, 2025, Plaintiff opposed.  \nDkt. 23 (“Opp.”).  With leave, JPMorgan filed a reply on September 22, 2025.  Dkt. 28 (“Reply”). \nII. Legal Standard \nCourts analyzing claims under Federal Rule 12(b)(6) must determine whether a plaintiff’s \nfactual allegations—disregarding all “conclusory” statements—“state a claim to relief that is \nplausible on its face.”  Ashcroft v. Iqbal , 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009).  “The inquiry is usually limited \nto the facts alleged in the complaint, incorporated into the complaint, or susceptible to judicial \nnotice,” Whelden v. U.S. Bank Nat’l Ass’n , 494 F. Supp. 3d 68, 73 (D. Mass. 2020) (citing In re Case 1:25-cv-11751-BEM     Document 29     Filed 10/22/25     Page 3 of 8 \n4 Colonial Mortg. Bankers Corp. , 324 F.3d 12, 15 (1st Cir. 2003)), “but the court may also consider \nother documents the authenticity of which is not disputed by the parties, documents central to the \nplaintiff’s claim, and documents sufficiently referred to in the complaint,” id. (citing Watterson v. \nPage, 987 F.2d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 1993)). \nIII. Discussion \nA. The Lie Detector Claim \n“The Lie Detector Statute prohibits employers in Massachusetts from subjecting \nemployees or applicants to lie detector tests as a condition of employment or continued \nemployment.”  Baker v. CVS Health Corp. , 717 F. Supp. 3d 188, 190 (D. Mass. 2024).2  The statute \ndefines a “lie detector test” as: \n[A]ny test utilizing a polygraph or any other device, mechanism, instrument or \nwritten examination, which is operated, or the results of which are used or \ninterpreted by an examiner for the purpose of purporting to assist in or enable the \ndetection of deception, the verification of truthfulness, or the rendering of a \ndiagnostic opinion regarding the honesty of an individual. \nMass. Gen. Laws ch. 149, § 19B(1).  Thus, the statute creates two classes of lie detector tests: a \npolygraph constitutes a lie detector test ipso facto ; alternatively, “any other device, mechanism, \n \n2 In Baker, the defendants “[did] not challenge the sufficiency of the claims that [the defendants had] violated \nthe Lie Detector Statute” by subjecting their applicants to HireVue Interviews.  717 F. Supp. 3d at 189–90.  \nAccordingly, the Court did not have occasion to consider whether the HireVue Interviews, as used by those defendants, \nconstituted lie detector tests under section 19B. Case 1:25-cv-11751-BEM     Document 29     Filed 10/22/25     Page 4 of 8 \n5 instrument or written examination” can qualify as a de facto lie detector test if it used “for the \npurpose of” lie detection.  Id.3 \nPlaintiff alleges that JPMorgan subjected him to a ( de facto) lie detector test by requiring \nhim to take a HireVue Interview as part of his job application.  Compl. ¶¶ 48–55.  However, the \nAmended Complaint contains insufficient allegations to support the inference that his interview \nwas used for the purpose of truth assessment.  Plaintiff’s allegations do no more than establish that \nHireVue Interviews could constitute lie detector tests when used for that purpose.  However, this \nis not enough.  Any “device, mechanism, instrument or written examination” could qualify as a lie \ndetector test if used for that purpose.  To wit, if an employer were to give his applicant an IQ test \non the belief that people with certain IQs are inherently deceitful, wanting to find that out, that \nwould likely violate the Lie Detector Statute, notwithstanding the apparent silliness of that usage.  \nThus, that HireVue holds its product out as having any capability with respect to truth detection \n \n3 See also Auguste v. G4S Secure Sols. (USA), Inc. , No. SUCV14-3311-BLS1 (Mass. Sup. Ct. Apr. 25, 2016) \n(slip op.) (attached to JPMorgan’s Memo. at Dkt. 22-1).  Auguste considered, at summary judgment, an employer’s \nuse of the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-2 (the “MMPI-2”).  Id. at *1.  As explained in the opinion, \nthe MMPI-2 can indicate certain mental illnesses, including some that are correlated with dishonesty.  Id. at *3–4, \n9–10.  The MMPI-2 further relies on “validity scales,” including the “L” (“Lie”) scale, which can indicate a \n“non-credible pattern of responses” resulting from “intentional deception” or from other causes, such as a “high need \nto see oneself as extremely virtuous.”  Id. at *4–5, 10.  The Auguste court found that the MMPI-2’s diagnostic function \ndid not render it a lie detector test under section 19B because it merely indicated mental illness correlated with \ndishonesty, rather than dishonesty itself.  Id. at *9–10.  The court likewise found that the MMPI-2’s “L” scale did not \nturn the MMPI-2 into a lie detector test because that scale measured incredibility beyond just “intentional deception” \nand because the scale’s “purpose” was “to validate the test results,” rather than to “detect[] . . . lies.”  Id. at *10–12 \n(emphasis in original).  Further, the Court highlighted the statute’s “requirement that the test be employed for the \n‘purpose’ of determining deception or rendering an opinion regarding honesty,” noting that it “need not resolve the \nabstract question of whether the MMPI-2 could detect deception so as to possibly constitute a ‘lie detector test’ in \ncertain circumstances” but rather only whether the defendant’s “use of the MMPI-2 rendered it a lie detector test.”  Id. \nat *12 (emphasis in original).  The Court then turned to evidence that the defendant had used plaintiff’s MMPI-2 \nscores to determine his “psychological suitability” for the job, rather than to detect deception.  Id. at *12–13.  Thus, \nthe court concluded that the defendant did not violate section 19B by administering the test.  Id. at *14. \nPlaintiff points out that Auguste was decided at summary judgment and argues that his case, too, “merit[s] \nconsiderable discovery.”  Opp. at 4 n.1.  However, the availability of summary judgment to test the sufficiency of \nevidence does not obviate a plaintiff’s duty to plead his claims sufficiently in the first instance. Case 1:25-cv-11751-BEM     Document 29     Filed 10/22/25     Page 5 of 8 \n6 matters only insofar as it makes plausible that JPMorgan used the HireVue Interview for that \npurpose. \nPlaintiff’s allegations demonstrate the multi-utility of a HireVue Interview, making \nJPMorgan’s mere alleged use inadequate to demonstrate its purpose.  HireVue generates scores \nfrom its interviews based on “precise criteria [that] are often developed in consultation with the \nemployer,” “tailored to meet employers’ highly individualized needs.”  Id. ¶ 33.  Thus, a HireVue \nInterview might plausibly be employed for a wide variety of lawful (or unlawful) purposes, and \nnothing in the allegations suggests that lie detection is chief among its use cases, such to make any \ngiven user’s purpose readily apparent.  See, e.g., id. ¶ 35 (quoting a HireVue patent that includes \n“reliability, honesty, and integrity” on a non-exhaustive list of 23 “potential competencies” that \nthe platform can analyze (emphasis removed)).  JPMorgan’s use of HireVue Interviews is therefore \n“merely ‘consistent with’ unlawful action and is ‘just as much in line with’ lawful action.”  See \nFrith v. Whole Foods Mkt., Inc. , 38 F.4th 263, 270 (1st Cir. 2022) (quoting Ocasio-Hernandez v. \nFortuno-Burset , 640 F.3d 1, 9 (1st Cir. 2011)).  Plaintiff offers no other allegations that would \npermit the inference that JPMorgan has used or uses HireVue Interviews, either generally or as to \nPlaintiff’s application, for the unlawful purpose.4 \nAccordingly, the Court finds Plaintiff’s lie detector allegations “wholly conclusory” and \nso will dismiss the Lie Detector Claim.5  See id. \n \n4 Plaintiff does not argue, and the Court does not find, that JPMorgan’s requiring applicants to certify the \ntruthfulness of their applications converts the HireVue Interview into a lie detector test or else meaningfully suggests \nthat JPMorgan’s use of HireVue Interviews is for that improper purpose.  See Opp. at 7–10; Compl. ¶ 21; note 1, infra.  \nReading the Lie Detector Statute to prohibit employers from asking applicants not to lie on their applications would \nproduce “absurd results.”  See Commonwealth v. Morgan , 476 Mass. 768, 778 (2017) (advising courts to interpret \nstatutes “in a commonsense way”).  \n5 Likewise, the Court will dismiss that part of Plaintiff’s claim for declaratory and injunctive relief based on \nthe Lie Detector Claim allegations.  See Compl. ¶¶ 44–47. Case 1:25-cv-11751-BEM     Document 29     Filed 10/22/25     Page 6 of 8 \n7 B. The Notice Claim \nAs to Plaintiff’s Notice Claim, the parties focus almost exclusively on issues of statutory \ninterpretation—namely, whether the Lie Detector Statute creates a private cause of action for \nenforcement of its notice requirement and whether, if so, Plaintiff qualifies as a “person aggrieved” \nunder that statute for purposes of bringing such a claim.6  See Memo. at 15–25; Opp. at 10–26; \nReply at 9–16. \nBut before reaching these merits issues, the Court “must satisfy itself as to its jurisdiction, \nincluding [Plaintiff’s] Article III standing to sue . . . regardless of whether the litigants have raised \nthe issue of standing.”  See Pagan v. Calderon , 448 F.3d 16, 26 (1st Cir. 2006).  “The standing \ninquiry is . . . claim-specific,” meaning that the Court must determine whether Plaintiff “is entitled \nto have a federal court adjudicate each particular claim that he asserts.”  See id. \nWithout a viable allegation of having been subjected to a lie detector test, Plaintiff lacks \nArticle III standing for his Notice Claim, and so the Court lacks jurisdiction to consider it.  \nPlaintiff’s only purported injury is that he was not apprised of his rights under section 19B.  See \nCompl. ¶¶ 8, 18.7  Since this purely informational injury resulted in no “downstream \nconsequences”— i.e., Plaintiff did not, as a result, take a lie detector test contrary to his rights—it \n \n6 Compare Auguste v. G4S Secure Sols. (USA), Inc. , No. SUCV14-3311-BLS1, at *13–15 (Mass. Sup. Ct. \nApr. 25, 2016) (slip op.) (attached to JPMorgan’s Memo. at Dkt. 22-1) (concluding that there was no private cause of \naction to enforce the notice requirement and that the plaintiff, who had not shown that he was subject to a lie detector \ntest, was not a “person aggrieved” under the statute), with Baker , 717 F. Supp. 3d at 192–93 (concluding that there \nwas a private cause of action to enforce the notice requirement). \n7 Plaintiff also states that, “[h]ad [he] been made aware by Defendant that the HireVue Interview was a lie \ndetector test, he would not have completed the HireVue Interview.”  Compl. ¶ 8.  But the statutory notice does not \ninclude the definition of a lie detector test.  See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 149, § 19B(2)(b).  As such, it is not obvious why \nnotice would have helped Plaintiff evaluate whether the HireVue Interview was being used as a lie detector test. Case 1:25-cv-11751-BEM     Document 29     Filed 10/22/25     Page 7 of 8 \n8 cannot provide a basis for standing.8  See TransUnion LLC v. Ramirez , 594 U.S. 413, 442 (2021) \n(“An ‘asserted informational injury that causes no adverse effects cannot satisfy \nArticle III.’” (quoting Trichell v. Midland Credit Mgmt., Inc. , 964 F.3d 990, 1004 (11th Cir. \n2020))). \nBecause the Court finds a lack of Article III standing, a jurisdictional defect, “the proper \ncourse is remand.”  Maine Ass’n of Interdependent Neighborhoods v. Comm’r, Me. Dep’t of Hum. \nServs., 876 F.2d 1051, 1054 (1st Cir. 1989) (quoting Langford v. Gates , 610 F. Supp. 120, 122–23 \n(C.D. Cal. 1985)).9  Accordingly, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1447(c), the Court will remand the \nNotice Claim.10 \nIV. Conclusion \nFor the foregoing reasons, JPMorgan’s motion to dismiss is GRANTED in part and \nDENIED in part.  This action is hereby remanded to the Suffolk County Superior Court. \nSo Ordered.  \n \n /s/ Brian E. Murphy    \n Brian E. Murphy \nDated:  October 22, 2025 Judge, United States District Court \n \n8 In Baker, the court concluded that the plaintiff had stated a “concrete informational injury” because, “as a \ndownstream consequence of not receiving notice, he participated in a HireVue Interview.”  717 F. Supp. at 192.  \nHowever, in Baker, the defendants did not challenge the sufficiency of the plaintiff’s lie detector allegations.  Id. at \n190.  Thus, the court could take for granted that the HireVue Interview was a lie detector test and thus that its \nimposition was an injury “of the kind the statute was designed to protect.”  Id. at 192.  By contrast, in this case, \nJPMorgan has successfully shown that inference to be unreasonable.  Thus, Plaintiff’s position is akin to the \nhypothetical case, distinguished by the Baker court, of an “[a]pplicant[] who never took” any lie detector test, whom \nthe Baker court recognized “may well be in a different boat on the standing question.”  Id. at 192 n.2. \n9 As Plaintiff points out, Massachusetts courts, like state courts in general, are not subject to Article III \nlimitations.  See, e.g., Kenn v. Eascare, LLC , 103 Mass. App. Ct. 643, 649 (2024) (holding that an injury deemed \ninsufficiently concrete under Article III was nonetheless adequate for the claim to proceed in state court under \nMassachusetts standing principles). \n10 Likewise, the Court will remand that part of Plaintiff’s claim for declaratory and injunctive relief based on \nthe Notice Claim allegations.

    "summary": "1. **Summary:** In the case of Shared Partnership v. Meta Platforms, Inc., the United States District Court for the Northern District of California addressed discovery disputes related to the production of documents. The Plaintiff requested that Meta be compelled to complete document production by a certain date, especially concerning Meta's use of artificial intelligence (AI) to reject advertisements, including those related to the Plaintiff. The court denied the Plaintiff's request, finding it unjustified and premature, emphasizing that broad discovery into AI use was not proportionately relevant to the Plaintiff's claims in the current procedural context.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue:** The key legal issue revolved around whether Meta Platforms, Inc., should be compelled to complete its document production by a specific deadline, particularly concerning documents related to its use of AI in ad rejection.\n\n3. **Court's Holding:** The court denied the Plaintiff's request to force Meta to complete its document production by the specified deadline. Furthermore, it rejected the Plaintiff's attempt to establish broad discovery into Meta's use of AI to reject advertisements not related to the Plaintiff, due to lack of relevance and proportionality.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation:** Imagine you're arguing with someone to show you all their private documents right away, especially about how they use a robot helper to decide things. The judge said, “Not so fast!” They noted that it's not fair to ask for everything because it's not all related to what you're trying to prove, and it's way too much to ask for all at once. So, the judge said, “Let's do this step-by-step and only look at what really matters to the case.”",

Nos. 47, 49  \n \n \n Now pending before the court are a pair of discovery dispute letter briefs (dkts. 47, 49) \nthat, generally speaking, represent Plaintiff’s request  to compel the production of certain \ndiscovery. It app ears that the two letters are substantially the same, wit h the exception that the first \nletter appears to have been rushed to court  before Defendant could articulate its position as to one \nof the issues raised by Plaintiff ( see dkt. 47 at 3 -4; see also  dkt. 49 at 1, 4 -5). Defendant submits \nthat Plaintiff has involved the  court prematurely, that the dispute is not quite ripe for a motion to \ncompel, and that the parties should continue to engage one another in the discovery process. See \nLtr. Br. (dkt. 49) at 2. For the reasons stated below, the court wholeheartedly agrees.  \n Plaintiff has presented two issues . In the first, Plaintiff complains of the timing of \nDefendant’s document production. See id . at 1 -2. In this regard, Plaintiff subm its that it tendered  a \nset of interrogatories and requests for production in late October of 2022, and that Defendant’s \nresponses – which were served in mid -December of 2022, did not contain substantive information \nbut were rather limited to objections (pr esumably as to some requests) and statements to the effect \nthat responsive documents and information would be produced on a rolling basis (again, \npresumably as to certain other  requests). Id. at 1. Based only on the argument that Plaintiff should Case 3:22-cv-02366-RS     Document 50     Filed 03/14/23     Page 1 of 6 \n2 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  not be fo rced to agree to an  speculative  extension of the fact discovery deadline ( currently set for \nSeptember 21, 2023) and risk pushing back an already -scheduled  trial date of April 2024, Plaintiff \nsubmits that Defendant should now be forced “to complete its enti re document production by \nApril 7, 2023” because it “has had more than enough time – and has more than enough resources – \nto accomplish this.” Id. at 2.   \n Defendant respond s to the effect that Plaintiff’s 41  document requests  are relatively broad \nand that they seek , among other things , all documents relating to Plaintiff , all documents regarding \nPlaintiff ’s rejected advertisements  on Defendant’s platform , and all documents concerning \nDefendant ’s use of artificial intelligence to reject any and all advertisements  in general (that is, not \nsimply information limited to the rejection of Plaintiff’s own advertisements – the subject of this \naction) . Id. at 2. Nevertheless, Defendant submits that through its December responses, it agr eed to \nsearch for and  produce several categories of information  including documents relating to \nPlaintiff ’s rejected advertisements, notifications regarding those advertisements, and \ncommunications between the Parties . Id.  Following discussions  regarding the scope, relevance, \nand proportionality of the  requested  discovery, Defendant states that it  has agreed to produce a \nnarrowed set of documents for the majority of Plaintiff’s requests , and that it is working  diligently \nto gather responsive, non -privileged documents  for production. Id. at 2 -3.  \nHowever, Defendant contends that there are three  remining hurdles. As to the first, \nDefendant states that it “cannot produce any documents until a stipulated protective order is \nentered between the parties and Court, and the parties are currently negotiating the substance of \nthe protective order so that [Defendant]  can begin producing documents.” Id. at 3. The court finds \nthat this hurdle is easy to surmount. The Parties are herewith ORDERED  to promptly meet and \nconfer in a good faith effort to iron out their differences as to their respective views regarding  the \nsubstance of the protective order necessary such that Defendant can begin producing documents . \nThe court recommends, but does not require, using this district’s model protective order at least as \na starting point . In the event that the Parties cannot arrive at a stipulated resolution, the Parties are \nFURTHER ORDERED  to clearly and concisely present what dispute s remain in this regard \nthrough a jointly -filed letter brief conforming to the requirements set forth in ¶ 4 of the Case 3:22-cv-02366-RS     Document 50     Filed 03/14/23     Page 2 of 6 \n3 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  undersigned’s general standi ng order.1 \nAs to the second hurdle, Defendant submits that it  “continues to work diligently to search \nfor documents responsive to the majority of [the]  requests it has agreed to produce ” and that it \n“has already identified tens of thousands of potentially  responsive documents to [Plaintiff’s]  \nrejected advertisements and notifications regarding those rejected advertisements. ” Id. at 3. \nDefendant explains that the responsive discovery is voluminous and time -consuming to gather and \nproduce due to the fact tha t Plaintiff’s advertising relationship on Defendant’s platform “ goes back \nover ten years, and the volume of data is substantial ,” as well as the fact that “ the process to search \nfor, review, and pull those documents, which began months ago, is manual  — [and] there are thus \nmultiple, time -consuming steps [Defendant]  must undertake before it can produce information \nregarding [Plaintiff’s]  disapproved advertisements, of which there were many. ” Id. Defendant then \nadds that this is why it has focused on only pot entially responsive documents – that is, those \nrelated to Plaintiff’s rejected advertisements – rather than documents related to Defendant’s more \n“general purported use of artificial intelligence. ” Id. At bottom, Defendant contends that “[t] hese \ndocuments are probative of whether [Plaintiff’s]  ads were rejected and what notice [Plaintiff]  \nreceived regarding those ads, which is directly relevant to [the]  fraud -based claims. ” Id. The court \nfinds that the assertion of this hurdle is closely intertwined with the second issue raised by \nPlaintiff’s request to compel; accordingly, the court will address it below.  \nAs to the third hurdle, Defendant submits that it  has not yet provided a  specific  date by \nwhich  it will complete production of all resp onsive, non -privileged documents because it \n“continues to search for responsive documents, the extent of those documents, and  [because it is \ncurrently engaged in]  the labor -intensive process of pulling those potentially responsive \ndocuments. ” Id. In short,  Defendant submits that it “ has been working for months to gather and \nreview documents for production once the protective order is entered ,” and that it  “intends on \nproducing documents on a rolling basis shortly thereafter. ” Id.  \nIn essence, this dispute b oils down to Plaintiff’s desire to rush Defendant through the \n \n1 See https://www.cand.uscourts.gov/wp -content/uploads/judges/illman -rmi/RMI -Standing -Order -\nRevised9 -16-22.pdf  Case 3:22-cv-02366-RS     Document 50     Filed 03/14/23     Page 3 of 6 \n4 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  discovery process based only on a thin justification that Defendant “has had more than enough \ntime – and has more than enough resources – to accomplish this.” Id. at 2. The court finds this \nnotion to be unpersuasive. The alleged magnitude of Defendant’s resources, and the passage of a \nfew months of time does not justify arbitrarily setting a production deadline of April 7, 2023, as \nPlaintiff suggests. Once the Parties’ dispute about the terms of the forthcoming protective order \n(either by stipulation or by court order) are resolved, the court sees no  reason – and Plaintiff has \ncertainly  not suggested one – that Defendant’s production should not proceed on the rolling basis \nit has suggested and jus tified. Accordingly, Plaintiff’s request to force Defendant to complete its \nproduction by April 7, 2023, is DENIED . \nAs to the second issue, Plaintiff seeks an order “ making clear that [Defendant’s]  use of \nartificial intelligence to reject ads —including wha t it did and did not know about the ability of \nartificial intelligence to provide explanations for ad rejections —is both relevant and discoverable. ” \nId. Plaintiff then adds that “[t] his dispute is implicated by the following discovery requests: a) \nInterrog atories 2 -4 and b) RFP Nos. 15 -20; 25 -34; and 38 -41.” Id. at 4. Plaintiff has not include d \nthose discovery requests as attachments or exhibits to its letter brief. However, this omission is \nunimportant for two reasons.  \nFirst, Plaintiff has failed to convi nce the undersigned as to the probative value of this \noverwhelmingly broad request. Plaintiff points to the fact that its fraud claim survived dismissal \nwhen the presiding judge found that because Plaintiff had asserted that Defendant’s advertising \npolicie s contained a fraudulent statement to the effect that advertising  partners would be provided \nwith sufficient details to bring their rejected ads into conformity with Defendant’s  policies , it was \ntherefore plausible that a reasonable consumer would concur with Plaintiff ’s interpretation of the \npolicies, notwithstanding Defendant’s contrary interpretation.  Id. In short, in the context of \ndeciding a motion to dismiss, the presiding judge found that it was plau sible  that Defendant knew \nor should have known that it could not comply with this expectation due to its averred reliance on \nartificial intelligence.  Id. However, simply because an allegation has been found  to be sufficiently \nplausible such that  its associ ated claim  survives dismissal , it does not necessarily follow that \ndiscovery thereunder will automatically be found to be  relevant to that claim  at the discovery Case 3:22-cv-02366-RS     Document 50     Filed 03/14/23     Page 4 of 6 \n5 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  phase of a case . See e.g.,  Elgindy v. AGA Serv. Co. , No. 20 -cv-06304 -JST (RMI), 2021 U.S. Dist . \nLEXIS 211772, at *12 -13 (N.D. Cal. Nov. 2, 2021) ( “. . . the scope of Plaintiffs ’ 4 RFPs are more \ngeared to proving or disproving Plaintiffs ’ [own] speculative and editorial musings rather than \nthe[] actual claims. [R]elevance must be tethered to a claim , not simply to an allegation as seems \nto be implied by Plaintiffs ’ suggestion . . . ”). In this regard, the court finds – based on Plaintiff’s \npresentation (limited to the plausibility finding at the motion to dismiss stage) – that generalized \ninformation about Defendant’s suggested use of artificial intelligence to reject advertisements \nother than  Plaintiff’s  own advertisements  would have very little – if any – probative value to \nPlaintiff’s claims.  \nSecond, assuming arguendo  that the relevance of this requ est had been established, \nPlaintiff has expended no effort in justifying the proportionality of such a broad request , while \nDefendant has made a convincing case about its disproportionality . See id . at 3 -4, 5-6. It should be \nnoted  here that in order to suc ceed on a motion to compel, a moving party bears the burden of not \nonly demonstrating relevance, but also  demonstrating  that it has satisfied proportionality and other \nrequirements of Rule 26. See e.g.,  Rodriguez v. Barrita, Inc. , No. 09 -04057 RS  (PSG), 2011 U.S. \nDist. LEXIS 134079, at *4 (N.D. Cal. Nov. 21, 2011). In light of this, courts are required to limit \ndiscovery if its burden or expense outweighs its likely benefit; this is “the essence of \nproportionality, ” a frequently ignored or overlooked dis covery principle. See e.g. , Hegarty v. \nTransamerica Life Ins. Co. , No. 19 -cv-06006 -MMC (RMI), 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 203386, at *5 \n(N.D. Cal. Oct. 21, 2021) ; see also Williams v. Condensed Curriculum Int ’l, No. 20 -cv-05292 -\nYGR (RMI), 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2 11782, at *8 -9 (N.D. Cal. Nov. 2, 2021) ; see also  Mediatek, \nInc. v. Freescale Semiconductor, Inc. , No. 11 -5341 YGR (JSC), 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 122911, \nat *18 -19 (N.D. Cal. Aug. 28, 2013) ( “[U]nder Rule 26 ’s proportionality analysis, the Court must \nweigh t he burden versus the benefit of the discovery sought . . . [and] strike a balance between \nensuring that parties have access to relevant information regarding their claims and defenses, and \nthe burden on the producing party of providing the discovery sought .”). \nAs stated by Defendant, despite the fact that Plaintiff’s artificial intelligence theory was \nfound plausible at the motion to dismiss stage, by no means does it logically follow (as Plaintiff’s Case 3:22-cv-02366-RS     Document 50     Filed 03/14/23     Page 5 of 6 \n6 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  arguments imply) that broad -based and wholesale discovery  into all aspects of Defendant’s \npurported use of artificial intelligence to reject the advertisements of all of its many customers \nwould be proportional to the needs of Plaintiff’s case which involves a drastically smaller subset \nof events. Accordingly, P laintiff’s request for a finding as to the general discoverability of \nDefendant’s use of artificial intelligence to reject advertisements other than its own is DENIED .  \nIn closing, t he court also feels compelled to admonish the Parties to work together mor e \nefficiently  going forward  to resolve their discovery disputes with minimal need for court \nintervention.  “[T]this court is not a clearinghouse for resolving insignificant, unripe, or moot \ndiscovery disputes. Instead, counsel should be mindful that discove ry is the responsibility of the \nparties and turning to the court to resolve a discovery dispute should only be used as a last resort. ” \nMiranda Dairy v.

Attorneys practicing in this court are \nexpected to seek court involvement in discovery disputes only  as a last resort, and only when the \ndispute implicates truly significant interests that counsel cannot resolve through reasonable \ncooperation during the meet -and-confer process.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: The court dismissed the class action lawsuit filed by LGBTQ+ content creators against Google and YouTube, alleging discriminatory practices in content moderation, including demonetization and restriction of videos. The case referenced Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act as a defense, which protects online platforms from liability for content moderation decisions. The plaintiffs were given limited leave to amend one specific claim related to the breach of implied good faith, emphasizing that earlier claims could not be pursued further due to Section 230's protections.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether YouTube's content moderation practices, allegedly biased against LGBTQ+ creators, violated laws such as the Unruh Act and whether such claims are barred by Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court granted the motion to dismiss most claims, citing Section 230 as a shield against such lawsuits since it provides immunity for content moderation practices. The plaintiffs were allowed to amend their claim regarding the breach of implied good faith and fair dealing.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine you run a gigantic online video library and use a robot that decides if a video should be shown to everyone or just a few people. Some folks say your robot is unfairly choosing their videos to hide because of what's in them. They took you to court, but the judge said you've got special protection that says you can't get in trouble just for how your robot picks videos. However, the judge allowed one tiny part of their complaint to maybe change and come back to court.",

R. Civ. P. 73 ; Dkt. Nos. 5, 16, 17 . \n Case 5:19-cv-04749-VKD     Document 107     Filed 09/30/22     Page 1 of 35 \n2 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  YouTube .  Plaintiffs claim that  despite YouTube’s purported viewpoint neutrality, defendants have \ndiscriminated against them  based on their sexual or gender orientation, identity, and/or viewpoints \nby censoring , demonetizing, or otherwise interfering with certain videos that plaintiffs uploaded to \nYouTube.   Dkt. No. 67 ¶ 1; see also id . ¶¶ 35-44.2 \nPlaintiffs filed their original complaint on August 13, 2019 (Dkt. No. 1) and an amended \ncomplaint on November 12, 2019 (Dkt. No. 7).  \nOn January 6, 2020, the Court granted plaintiffs’ unoppose d motion for leave to file a second \namended complaint (“SAC”).  Dkt. No. 23.   The SAC asserted claims for (1) violation of plaintiffs’ \nFirst Amendment rights under 42 U.S.C. § 1983; (2) violation of Article I, section 2 of the California \nConstitution; (3)  violation of the Unruh Act, California Civil Code § § 51, et seq .; (4) unfair \ncompetition under California Business and Professions Code §§ 17200, et seq .; (5) breach of the \nimplied covenant of good faith and fair dealing; and (6) false advertising and fals e association in \nviolation of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1125, et seq .  In addition, plaintiffs sought  a declaration that \nSection 230 of the Communications Decency Act (“CDA”), 47 U.S.C. § 230(c), on which plaintiffs \nexpect ed defendants to rely as an affi rmative defense, is unconstitutional.  Plaintiffs also separately \nsought  a declaration that defendants violated the rights and obligations pled as the bases for all of  \nplaintiffs ’ other claims.  Dkt. No. 20.  \nDefendants moved to dismiss all of the claims in  the SAC  pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6)  for failure \nto state a claim and as barred by Section 230 of the CDA.  Dkt. No. 25.  On January 6, 2021, the Court \ngranted defendants’ motion to dismiss, with limited leave to amend.   Dkt. No. 65.   The Court \ndismissed pla intiffs’ First Amendment claim without leave to amend, concluding that defendants are \nnot state actors, YouTube is not a public forum, and that the availability of protections under CDA \nSection 230 does not amount  to government endorsement of defendants’ a lleged discrimination.  Id. at \n7-12.  Plaintiffs’ Lanham Act claim for alleged false advertising3 was dismissed with leave to amend.  \n \n2 The Court assumes the parties’ familiarity with the general background facts as described in its \nprior order  on defendants’ motion to dismiss plaintiffs’ second amended complaint  (Dkt. No. 65 at \n2-6) and does not repeat those facts i n this order . \n \n3 Plaintiffs withdrew their Lanham Act claim to the extent it was based on false association.  They \nalso appeared to abandon allegations that defendants violate the Lanham Act by describing Case 5:19-cv-04749-VKD     Document 107     Filed 09/30/22     Page 2 of 35 \n3 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  The Court concluded  that plaintiffs’  theory —i.e., that by making plaintiffs’ videos inaccessible \nthrough application of Restricted Mode, defendants falsely implied that the videos contain shocking or \ninappropriate content —is squarely foreclosed by Prager Univ. v. Google LLC  (“Prager III ”), 951 F.3d \n991 (9th Cir. 2020) .  Id. at 12 -14.  Having dismissed the only claims giving rise to federal jurisdiction, \nand n oting that the SAC did not expressly invoke federal jurisdiction under the Class Action Fairness \nAct (“CAFA”), 28 U.S.C. § 1332(d), the Court declined to exercise jurisdiction over plaintiffs’ state \nlaw claims  and dismissed those state claims without prejudice.  Id. at 16.   The Court dismissed \nplaintiffs’ claim for declaratory relief regarding CDA Section 230 because declarat ory relief is a \nremedy, not an independent cause of action; the claim was based on plaintiffs’ First Amendment \nclaim, which was dismissed; and because the Declaratory Judgment Act cannot be used to anticipate \nan affirmative defense.  Id. at 17 -18.  Plainti ffs’ omnibus claim for declaratory relief was dismissed as \nimproper , and because plaintiffs failed to state any federal claim over which the Court could exercise \njurisdiction , and because the Court declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over plaint iffs’ state \nlaw claims.  Id. at 18 -19. \nPlaintiffs were given leave to amend their Lanham Act false advertising claim, and to reassert \ntheir state law claims for relief.  They  were also given leave to attempt to plead CAFA jurisdiction.  Id. \nat 16, 19.  \nPlaintiffs’ operative  third amended class action complaint (“TAC”)  asserts a Lanham Act \nclaim  (claim 6) , as well as several state law claims for violation of Article I, section 2  of the California \nConstitution  (claim 2) ; violation of the Unruh Act  (claim 3) ; unfair competition under California \nBusiness and Professions Code § 17200, et seq . (claim 4) ; and breach of the implied covenant of good \nfaith and fair dealing  (claim 5) .  Additionally, p laintiffs again seek a declaration that  CDA  Section \n230, which defendants have raised as a defense , is unconstitutional  (claim 1) .  Plaintiffs assert  that \nfederal question jurisdiction exists by virtue of the Lanham Act claim .  They also conten d that the ir \ndeclaratory relief claim  provides an  additional  independ ent basis for federal question jurisdiction under \n28 U.S.C. § 1331.  The TAC further asserts that federal jurisdiction  also exists under CAFA , 28 U.S.C. \n \nYouTube as a viewpoint -neutral community that values freedom of expression .  See Dkt. No. 65 at \n12-13; see also  Dkt. No. 25 at 17 -18; Dkt. No. 36 at 24 -27; Dkt. No. 62 at 29:9 -13.

Plaintiffs assert that the Court has supplemental jurisdiction over their state law claims, 28 \nU.S.C. § 1367.   Dkt. No. 67 ¶¶ 61-62. \nDefendants move pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) to dismiss all claims in the TAC without \nfurther leave to amend , arguing that p laintiffs still fail to assert facts supporting a cognizable claim \nfor false advertising under the Lanham Act.  Defendants further contend that the TAC fails to state \nsufficient facts to support any of plaintiffs’ state law claims for relief, and that all such claims are \nbarred by CDA Section 230.  \nII. LEGAL STANDARD  \n“A motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) for failure to state a \nclaim upon which relief can be granted ‘tests the legal sufficiency of a claim.’”  Conservation \nForce v. Sa lazar , 646 F.3d 1240, 1241 -42 (9th Cir. 2011) (quoting Navarro v. Block , 250 F.3d \n729, 732 (9th Cir. 2001)).  When determining whether a claim has been stated, the Court accepts \nas true all well -pled factual allegations and construes them in the light most favorable to the \nplaintiff.  Reese v. BP Exploration (Alaska) Inc. , 643 F.3d 681, 690 (9th Cir. 2011).  While a \ncomplaint need not contain detailed factual allegations, it “must contain sufficient factual matter, \naccepted as true, to ‘state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.’”  Ashcroft v. Iqbal , 556 \nU.S. 662, 678 (2009) (quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly , 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007)).  A claim is \nfacially plausible when it “ pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable \ninference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.”  Id. \nThe Court is not  required to “ ‘assume the truth of legal conclusions merely because they \nare cast in the form of  factual allegations .’”  Prager  Univ. v. Google LLC (“Prager  I”), No. 1 7-\nCV-06064 -LHK , 2018 WL 1471939 , at * 3 (N.D. Cal. Mar. 26, 2018)  (quoting  Fayer v. Vaughn , \n649 F.3d 1061, 1064 (9th Cir. 2011)  (per curiam) ).  Nor does the Court accept allegations that \ncontradict  documents attached to the complaint or incorporated by reference, Gonzalez v. Planned  \nParenthood of L.A. , 759 F.3d 1112, 1115 (9th C ir. 2014) , or that rest on “ allegations that are \nmerely conclusory,  unwarranted deductions of fact,  or unreasonable inferences ,” In re Gilead Scis. \nSec. Litig ., 536 F.3d  1049, 1055 (9th Cir. 2008) . \nA court generally may not consider any material beyond the pleadings when ruling on a Case 5:19-cv-04749-VKD     Document 107     Filed 09/30/22     Page 4 of 35 \n5 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  Rule 12(b)(6) motion.  If matters outside the pleadings are considered, “the motion must be treated \nas one for summary judgment under Rule 56.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(d).  H owever, documents \nappended to the complaint, incorporated by reference in the complaint, or which properly are the \nsubject of judicial notice may be considered along with the complaint when deciding a Rule \n12(b)(6) motion.  Khoja v. Orexigen Therapeutics , 899 F.3d 988, 998 (9th Cir. 2018); see also Hal \nRoach Studios, Inc. v. Richard Feiner & Co., Inc. , 896 F.2d 1542, 1555 n.19 (9th Cir. 1990).   \nLikewise, a court may consider matters that are “capable of accurate and ready determination by \nresort to sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned.”  Roca v. Wells Fargo Bank, \nN.A., No. 15 -cv-02147 -KAW, 2016 WL 368153, at *3 (N.D. Cal. Feb. 1, 2016) (quoting Fed. R. \nEvid. 201(b)).  \nIII. DISCUSSION  \nA. Federal Jurisdiction  \nThe Court first examines the claims plaint iffs assert in support of federal jurisdiction .  As \ndiscussed above, the TAC alleges federal question jurisdiction, 28 U.S.C. § 1331, based on \nplaintiffs’ Lanham Act claim and on their claim for declaratory judgment .  The TAC also alleges \nCAFA jurisdiction  under 28 U.S.C. § 1332(d).  \n1. Lanham Act Claim  \nThe Court previously dismissed plaintiffs’ Lanham Act false advertising claim4 as \nforeclosed by Prager III , in which  the Ninth Circuit  held that statements about videos being \nunavailable in Restricted Mode are simply accurate explanations of the application of defendants’ \ncontent review and monitoring procedures , and are not actionable as commercial advertising or \npromotion.  See P rager III, 951 F.3d at 999-1000; see also  Dkt. No. 65 at 12 -14.  This Court \nfurther noted that plaintiffs “ do not explain how the purported competition between plaintiffs and \ndefendants transforms defendants’ explanatory statements into commercial advertising an d \n \n4 Although the TAC appears to re assert  allegations that defendants violate the Lanham Act \nthrough false association and defendants’ alleged “promotion of their service as a neutral public \nforum” ( see, e.g., Dkt. No. 67 ¶¶ 344, 350, 351, 355), as discussed above, plaintiffs were given \nleave to amend their Lanham Act claim only to the extent it was based on false advertising.  See \nDkt. No. 65 at 19.  Case 5:19-cv-04749-VKD     Document 107     Filed 09/30/22     Page 5 of 35 \n6 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  promotion or into specific representations of fact about particular videos. ”  Dkt. No. 65 at 14 . \nIn the TAC, p laintiffs’ false advertising claim  (asserted by plaintiffs on ly on  their own behalf ) \ncontinues to rest on the theory that b y making their videos  inaccessible through the application of \nRestricted Mode, YouTube falsely implies that the videos contain shocking or inappropriate content, \nsuch as “nudity, vulgarity, violence, hate,  shocking or sexually explicit material .”  See Dkt. No. 67 \n¶¶ 91-106; 34 1-357.  Plaintiffs further allege that defendants  “compete directly ” with plaintiffs  “in \nthe marketing of online video streaming ” and misapply Restricted Mode to plaintiffs’ videos in \norder to “ falsely  degrade and stigmatize ” plaintiffs’ videos “ while simultaneously enhancing the \nimage and goodwill  of [defendants’]  own content, and that of their partners and/or sponsored \ncreators .”  Id. ¶¶ 343, 354.  Plaintiffs claim that they have been injured  in the form of fewer \nsubscribers  and viewers , diverte d viewership, fewer notifications to subscribers regarding new \nvideo content, fewer or no recommendations  of their videos  by defendants to viewers, decreased \nad revenue , a reduction in advertisers willing to purchase advertisements shown on plaintiffs’ \nvideos,  and “damage to [plaintiffs’] respective brands, reputations and goodwill[.]”  Id. ¶ 356. \nPlaintiffs emphasize that the alleged false implications of Restricted Mode are communicated \nnot only to viewers, but also to advertisers, and are intended to sway viewers and advertisers to watch \ndefendants’ videos, rather than plaintiff’s videos.  See Dkt. No.  85 at 5.  However, nothing in the TAC, \nincluding in the particular paragraphs cited by plaintiffs ( see Dkt. No. 67 ¶¶ 3-4, 7, 13, 17, 22 -24, \n26.b., 80, 82 -89, 95 .b., 96-112, 133, 138 .c., 192 -93, 197, 201, 211, 232, 234, 238 -39, 243 -44, 246, \n257, 259, 262, 268, 341 -357) chang es the character of the challenged statements that videos are \n“unavailable” or “restricted” in Restricted Mode , which the Ninth Circuit has held are not actionable \nunder the Lanham Act.

Plaintiffs’ Lan ham Act false advertising \nclaim is dismissed without leave to amend.  \n2. Claim for Declaratory Judgment  \nPlaintiffs argue that their claim for a declaratory judgment  provides an independent basis \nfor federal jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1331.5  Citing Gunn v. Minton , 568 U.S. 251 (2013) and \nAtlantic  Richfield Co. v. Christian , 140 S. Ct. 1335 (2020), plainti ffs contend  that their \nconstitutional challenge to CDA Section 230, which has been raised by defendants as a defense  in \ntheir prior and present motions to dismiss , brings plaintiffs’  claim for declaratory judgment within \na “‘special and exceptional’ circumstance from which federal jurisdiction under § 1331 arises .”  \nDkt. No. 67 ¶ 54; see also id.  ¶¶ 283, 284 . \nFederal courts have original , or federal question,  jurisdiction over civil actions “arising \nunder the Consti tution, laws, or treaties of the United States.”  28 U.S.C. § 1331.  “‘[A] case can \n‘arise under’ federal law in two ways.’”  Negrete v. City of Oakland , 46 F.4th  811, 816  (9th Cir.  \n2022) (quoting Gunn , 568 U.S. at 257).  “First and ‘[m]ost directly, a cas e arises under federal law \nwhen federal law creates the cause of action asserted.’”  Id. at 816 -17 (quoting Gunn , 568 U.S. at \n257).  “Second, under the substantial federal question branch, ‘even where a claim finds its origins \nin state rather than federal law,’ the Supreme Court has ‘identified a ‘special and small category’ \n \n5 Defendants move to strike the declaratory judgment claim  on the ground that plaintiffs were not \nclearly given leave to reassert or amend that claim .  See Dkt. No. 77 at 1 , 9 n.9.  To the extent that \nthe Court’s order on defendants’ pr ior motion to dismiss may be ambiguous as to whether \nplaintiffs were permitted to reassert or amend this claim, defendants’ motion to strike is denied.  Case 5:19-cv-04749-VKD     Document 107     Filed 09/30/22     Page 7 of 35 \n8 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  of cases in which arising under jurisdiction still lies.’”  Id. at 817 (quoting Gunn , 568 U.S. at 258).  \n“Specifically, ‘federal jurisdiction over a state law claim will lie if a federal issue is: \n(1) necessarily raised, (2) actually disputed, (3) substantial, and (4) capable of resolution in federal \ncourt without disrupting the federal -state balance approved by Congress.’”  Id. (quoting Gunn , 568 \nU.S. at 258).  \nPlaintiffs do not co ntend that federal law creates their claim for declaratory relief.  Indeed, \nalthough the TAC correctly anticipates  defendants’ CDA Section 230 defense, “[f] ederal \njurisdiction cannot be predicated on an actual or anticipated defense ,” and “[i] t is not enou gh that \nthe plaintiff alleges some anticipated defense to his cause of action and asserts that the defense is \ninvalidated by some provision of [federal law].”   Vaden v. Discover Bank , 556 U.S. 49, 60 (2009) \n(internal quotations and citation omitted) ; see Atl. Richfield Co. , 140 S. Ct. at 1350 n.4 ( reiterating \nthat “‘[f]ederal jurisdiction cannot be predicated on an actual or anticipated defense.’”) (quoting \nVaden , 556 U.S. at 60); Negrete , 46 F.4th  at 817  (stating that federal question jurisdiction cannot \nbe based on “a federal defense, including the defense of pre -emption, even if the defense is \nanticipated in the plaintiff ’s complaint, and even if both parties concede that the federal defense is \nthe only question truly at issue.  And that remains true even  if, as here, the state -law complaint \nexplicitly seeks declaratory relief with respect to the anticipated federal defense.”) (internal \nquotations and citations omitted) . \nNor have plaintiffs demonstrated that their declaratory judgment  claim satisfies the f our \nrequirements for jurisdiction based on a substantial federal question.  Specifically, plaintiffs have \nnot shown that defendants’ invocation of CDA Section 230 as a defense is “necessarily raised” in \nthe sense contemplated by Gunn .  In Gunn , an element of the plaintiff’s state law claim for \nmalpractice necessarily required resolution of a federal patent law issue.  See Gu nn, 568 U.S. at \n259.  In the present case, defendants opted to assert CDA Section 230 as a defense, which cannot \nbe the basis for federal jurisdiction  for the reasons discussed above.  Even assuming that the CDA \n230 defense implicates issues of federal law , “a federal issue raised in anticipation of a defense is \nnot sufficient to establish federal question jurisdiction.”  Negrete , 46 F.4th  at 819.  Moreover, \n“[f]or  federal question jurisdiction to extend to a declaratory judgment action, the ‘claim itself Case 5:19-cv-04749-VKD     Document 107     Filed 09/30/22     Page 8 of 35 \n9 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  must present a federal question unaided by anything alleged in anticipation of avoidance of \ndefenses which it is thought the defendant may interpose.’”  Id. at 820 (quoting Skelly Oil Co. , 339 \nU.S. at 671)).   Plaintiffs have not, and cannot, make such a sho wing here.  \nPlaintiffs misplace their reliance on  United States v. Texas , 566 F.  Supp.  3d 605 ( W.D. \nTex. 2021) , which concerned the federal government’s  authority under In re Debs , 158 U.S. 564 \n(1895) to pursue a lawsuit to enjoin a state law as unconstitutional.  Texas  does not inform the \nCourt’s analysis of “arising under” jurisdiction in this  action, which concerns the propriety of a \nclaim for declaratory judgment by private cit izens against private entities based on a federal \ndefense.   As previously noted by the Court, “u sing the Declaratory Judgment Act to anticipate an \naffirmative defense is not ordinarily proper, and numerous courts have refused to grant declaratory \nrelief to  a party who has come to court only to assert an anticipatory defense.”  Veoh Networks, \nInc. v. UMG Recordings, Inc ., 522 F. Supp. 2d 1265, 1271 (S.D. Cal. 2007);  see also  Dkt. No. 65 \nat 18.  \nPlaintiffs have not established that their declaratory judgment c laim regarding the \nconstitutionality of CDA Section 230 provides an independent basis for the Court’s federal \nquestion jurisdiction.   This claim is dismissed without leave to amend.  \n3. CAFA Jurisdiction  \nThe TAC’s third  and final  asserted basis for federal jur isdiction is CAFA , 28 U.S.C. \n§ 1332(d) .  CAFA  was designed to permit a defendant to remove certain class or mass actions to \nfederal court .  It gives federal courts original jurisdiction over class actions where there are at least \n100 class members, at leas t one plaintiff is diverse in citizenship from any defendant, and the \namount in controversy exceeds $5,000,000, exclusive of interest and costs.   Dart Cherokee Basin \nOperating Co., LLC v. Owens , 574 U.S. 81 , 84-85 (2014) ; Yocupicio v. PAE Grp ., LLC , 795 F.3d \n1057 , 1059  (9th Cir. 2015) ; Ibarra v. Manheim In vs., Inc., 775 F.3d 1193, 1195 (9th Cir. 2015).  \nPlaintiffs’ CAFA allegations appear in paragraphs 55 -60 of the TAC.  Defendants do not contest  \nthe allegations regarding  CAFA’s jurisdictional requirement s of minimum diversity and class \nnumerosity.   They argue only that allegations regarding the amount in controversy are conclusory.   \nSee Dkt. No. 77 at 4 n.3; Dkt. No. 88 at 3 n.2.  With respect to the amount -in-controversy Case 5:19-cv-04749-VKD     Document 107     Filed 09/30/22     Page 9 of 35 \n10 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  requirement, the TAC alleges:  “T he matter in controversy exceeds the sum or value of Five \nMillion Dollars ($5,000,000), exclusive of interest and costs; moreover, the claims for relief seek, \namong other things statutory damages, compensatory damages, restitution, and other equitable \nrelief that substantially exceed One Billion Dollars ($1,000,000,000).”  Dkt. No. 67 ¶ 56. \n“In determining the amount in controversy, courts first look to the complaint.”  Ibarra , 775 \nF.3d at 1197.  Speculation and conjecture based on unreasonable assumptions are insufficient  to \ndemonstrate that CAFA’s jurisdictional threshold is satisfied .  Id.  While “ a damages assessment \nmay require a chain of reasoning that includes assumption s,” “those assumptions cannot be pulled \nfrom thin air but need some reasonable gro und underlying them.”   Id. at 1199.  Nonetheless, \n“Congress intended CAFA to be interpreted expansively.”  Id. at 1197 ; see also Jauregui v. \nRoadrunner Transp. Servs., Inc ., 28 F.4th 989 , 993  (9th Cir. 2022)  (“The [Supreme] Court has \nexplained that ‘CAFA’s provisions should be read broadly, with a strong preference that interstate \nclass actions should be heard in a federal court if properly removed by any defendant.’”) (quoting \nDart Cherokee , 574 U.S. at 89).   The amount in controversy  is “simply ‘the amount at stake in the \nunderlying litigation  . . . .’”  Jauregui , 28 F.4th at 994 (quoting Theis Rsch., Inc. v. Brown & Bain , \n400 F.3d 659, 662 (9th Cir. 2005)).   “Importantly, that ‘[a]mount at stake’ does not m ean likely or \nprobable liability; rather, it refers to possible  liability.’”  Id. (quoting Greene v. Harley -Davidson, \nInc., 965 F.3d 767, 772 (9th Cir. 2020)).  \nPlaintiffs’ allegations in paragraph 56 of the TAC regarding the amount -in-controversy are \nconcl usory.  Although the TAC generally asserts that plaintiffs have collectively lost “millions of \ndollars” (Dkt. No. 67 ¶ 356), t he named plaintiffs’ estimated damages do not appear to meet, much \nless exceed, the $5 million CAFA threshold.  See, e.g.,  Dkt. No. 67 ¶¶ 178, 194, 195, 196, 211, \n232, 233, 238, 255, 259, 262, 263.  Moreover, the TAC’s allegations indicate that not all of \nplaintiffs’ videos were excluded from Restricted Mode or demonetized ( see id . ¶¶ 191, 201, 203, \n214, 232, 234; see also  Dkt. No. 101 at 26:1 -6, 28:12 -16), and it is unclear precisely how often the \nalleged improper restriction of video content occurs.  \nNevertheless, plaintiffs maintain that defendants improperly censored or otherwise \ninterfered with many of their videos.  See Dkt. No. 67 ¶¶ 191, 201, 203, 214, 234 ; see also  Dkt. Case 5:19-cv-04749-VKD     Document 107     Filed 09/30/22     Page 10 of 35 \n11 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  No. 101 at 26:1 -6, 28:12 -16.  And their allegations regarding the amount in controversy  rest, in \nlarge part, on the sheer scale of defendants’  alleged billion -dollar  busines s, the potential millions \nof class members,6 and the artificial intelligence algorithms  and manual review policies  that \nreportedly are used to filter  video content based on unlawful criteria .  See Dkt. No. 67 ¶¶ 15, 57 -\n58, 65, 70,  113-114, 119, 269-70.  Notably, d efendants have not presented a factual challenge to \nthe TAC’s allegations regarding CAFA jurisdiction; they simply assert, without elaboration, that \n \n6 The YouTube Community Class is defined as:  \n \nAll persons or entities in the United States who are or we re members, \nusers and or consumers of YouTube who uploaded, posted, or viewed \nvideo content on YouTube subject to the choice -of-law and venue \nprovisions set forth in Defendants’ Terms of Service, Mission \nStatement, Community Guidelines, and/or any other co ntent -based \nfiltering, monetization, distribution, personal data use policies, \nadvertising or regulation and practices any other regulations or \npractices that are related to the YouTube Platform on or after January \n1, 2015 and continuing through to Decembe r 31, 2019 (the “Class \nPeriod”).  \n \nDkt. No. 67 ¶¶ 269.  The class excludes defendants, “ their employees, affiliates, parents, \nsubsidiaries, and co -conspirators, whether or not named in this Complaint, and the United States \ngovernment .”  Id. ¶ 269.  Plaintif fs believe that there are over 200 million class members.  Id. \n¶ 270. \n \n The LGBTQ+ subclass is defined as:  \n \nAll persons or entities in the United States who (a) are or were \nmembers, users and or consumers of YouTube who uploaded, posted, \nor viewed video content on YouTube subject to the choice -of-law and \nvenue provisions set forth in Defendants’ Terms of Service, Mission \nStatement, Community Guidelines, and/or any other content -based \nfiltering, monetization, distribution, personal data use policies,  \nadvertising or regulation and practices any other regulations or \npractices that are related to the YouTube Platform and (b) are part of \na protected class of persons under the California or Federal law \nbecause of sexual orientation, gender identity, or gen der or (c) create, \npost, distribute, monetize, or advertise video content on the YouTube \nPlatform that discusses or relates to topics, issues or viewpoints that \nadvocate for, are of interest to, or are intended for audiences, on or \nafter January 1, 2015 an d continuing through to December 31, 2019 \n(the “ Subclass Period”).  \n \nId.  The class excludes defendants, “ their employees, affiliates, parents, subsidiaries, and co -\nconspirators, and any YouTube users who create, post, distribute, promote or engage in vide o or \ncommunications on the YouTube Platform that is directed against Plaintiffs or Community and is \nobjectively violent, obscene, threatening, or homophobic as alleged in the Complaint .”  Id.  \nPlaintiffs believe that there are at least 9.33 million members  of the subclass.  Id. ¶ 270. \n Case 5:19-cv-04749-VKD     Document 107     Filed 09/30/22     Page 11 of 35 \n12 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  the TAC’s allegations are conclusory.   See Dkt. No. 77 at 4 n.3; Dkt. No. 88 at 3 n.2.  \nMoreover, as discuss ed below, the Court finds that plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged \nclaims for violation of the Unruh Act and California’s unfair competition law.  Even assuming that \nthe alleged improper restriction  of users’  videos occur red only on ce with respect to fewe r than half \nof the members of the putative YouTube Community Class, and further assuming minimal \ndamages of $1 per class member, the collective damages alleged in the TAC would exceed the $5 \nmillion CAFA threshold.   Accordingly, vi ewing the TAC’s allegatio ns as a whole,  and in a light \nmost favorable to plaintiffs, the Court finds that plaintiffs have pled sufficient facts demonstrating \na plausible possibility that CAFA’s amount -in-controversy requirement is satisfied .  However, as \ndiscussed below, the Court also finds that  even those claims that are sufficiently pled in the TAC  \nnonetheless are barred by CDA Section 230.  \nB. State Law Claims  \n1. California Constitution, Article I, Section 2  \nPlaintiffs assert a claim , for themselves and on behalf of the YouTube C ommunity Class,  \nfor violation of  their rights to liberty of speech and association  under the California Constitution.  \nDkt. No. 67 ¶¶ 305-317.  Contending  that defendants operate and maintain YouTube as “a public \nforum, or its functional equivalent,”  plain tiffs allege that defendants “expressly invite the public to \nvisit the YouTube platform to engage in freedom of expression,” and “ have restricted the speech \nand expressive conduct of the Proposed Class ” through censorship  of their videos  based on \nsubjectiv e, vague, and overbroad criteria .  See id. ¶¶ 307, 308 , 311.  \nArticle I, section 2 of the California Constitution provides that “[e]very person may freely \nspeak, write, and publish his or her sentiments on all subjects  . . ..”  Although t his provision of the \nstate constitution contains a state action limitation,  Golden Gateway Ctr. v.

Noting the “importance of the \npublic character of the property in determining the scope of California’s free speech clause,” the \nCalifornia Supreme Court subsequently clarified  that “the actions of a private property owner \nconstitute state action for pur poses  of California ’s free speech clause only if the property is  freely \nand openly accessible to the public .”  Golden Gateway , 26 Cal. 4th at 1033.  \nPlaintiffs contend that  defendants’ alleged conduct with respect to the regulation of content \nposted on YouT ube constitutes state action, arguing that YouTube is “the cyber -equivalent of a \ntown square where citizens exchange ideas on matters of public interest or concern.”  Dkt. No. 67 \n¶ 307.  However, no court has extended the Pruneyard  line of cases, which con cern physical \nproperty, to the Internet.

Bernardo Heights Country Club , 36 Cal. 4th 824, 853 (2005)).   Even so, evidence of \ndisparate impact “may be probative of in tentional discrimination in some cases,” subject to a \nproper foundation and the general rules of evidence.  Harris , 52 Cal. 3d at 1175 ; see also  GLAAD , \n742 F.3d at 426 n.4 (citing Koebke , 36 Cal. 4th at 854 ) (same).  \nDefendants argue that  plaintiffs’ Unruh Act claim  simply is based on  allegations about the \ndisparate impact of neutral policies that  apply equally  to all content creators .  “By its nature, an \nadverse impact claim challenges a standard that is applicable alike to all  such [protected \nclass ificatio ns] based on the premise that, notwithstanding its universal applicability, its actual \nimpact demands scrutiny.”  Turner , 167 Cal.

Here, defendants point out that the \nTAC alleges that defendants restricted and demonetized some plaintiffs’ videos, while leaving \nallegedly similar non -LGBTQ+ content unrestricted and fully monetized.  See, e.g.  Dkt. No. 67 \n¶¶ 191, 217 ; see also id . ¶ 235 (allegations concerning plaintiff  Stephanie  Frosch’s complaint \n“about how  Google/YouTube’s recent changes to the algorithm had disproportionately affected \nthe YouTube creators and viewers. ”).  Defendants maintain that these are quintessential disparate \nimpact allegations.   Additionally, defendants  contend that the TAC  asserts, in conclusory  fashion  \nand based solely on plaintiffs’ speculation, that YouTube’s algorithms flagged plaintiffs’ videos  Case 5:19-cv-04749-VKD     Document 107     Filed 09/30/22     Page 15 of 35 \n16 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  because they contain LGBTQ+ content .  See Dkt. No. 77 at 1 4 (citing Dkt. No. 67  ¶¶ 7, 17, 26.c, \n114, 119 , 204 ).  Defendants further argue that plaintiffs’ allegations concerning disparate impact \nare undermined by other allegations suggesting that many of plaintiffs’ videos remain available on \nYouTube, as well as allegations that  YouTube made LGBTQ+ outreach efforts and encouraged \nand s ponsored LGBTQ+ programs  from, for example, the BriaandChrissy channel .  See id. at 16 ; \nsee also  Dkt. No. 67 ¶¶ 35-44, 179, 180, 220, 259.  \nPlaintiffs contend that they have alleged more than mere disparate impact and have stated \nsufficient facts giving ris e to a plausible inference of discriminatory intent.  However, plaintiffs \nare not aided by their reliance on the declaration of plaintiff Stephanie Frosch (Dkt. No. 40 ), \npurported evidence that is not incorporated in or appended to  the operative complaint  and which \nthe Court has already determined cannot appropriately be considered in resolving a  Rule 12(b)(6)  \nmotion to dismiss.  See Dkt. No.  42. \nAs for particular paragraphs of the TAC that plaintiffs  do cite, most of them indicate that \nrestrictions placed on users’ content was an error that defendants took steps to rectify.  \nSpecifically, the TAC alleges that defendants acknowledged that Restricted Mode was not \n“working the way it should”  and “will never be perfect,” but  stated that they were working  on \nfixing Restricted Mode so that it “should not filter out content belonging to individuals or groups \nbased on ” a range of attributes  “like gender, gender identity, political viewpoints, race, religion or \nsexual orientation.”   The TAC further alleges tha t “[i]n response to complaints from the \nCommunity and other civil rights critics, ” defendants “ removed all restricted filtering on videos \nposted or produced by members and groups, and changed their policy, filtering algorithm, and \nmanual review policies pu rportedly to ensure that videos posted by vloggers were not being \ncensored solely because of the identity of the speaker. ”  See Dkt. No. 67 ¶¶ 29, 106, 140, 142.   \nThese allegations , standing alone,  do not raise a plausible inference that defendants  intenti onally \ndiscriminat ed against plaintiffs on the basis of their sexual orientation or viewpoints .  See \nNewman , 2021 WL 2633423  at *7 (finding that allegations regarding “an error caused by the \nYouTube algorithm used to filter content” did not support a plaus ible inference that defendants \nintentionally discriminated against content creators on the basis of race).

According \nto a purported transcript of that phone call,8 the advertisement was for a Divino Group Christmas \nepisode that launched on December 24; at the time of Mr. Knight’s phone call, Christmas was \nover and the ad remained under review.  When  Mr. Knight inquired why the ad remained under \nreview, a customer ser vice representative initially stated that “the ad has been disapproved because \nof shocking content[.]”  The call subsequently was transferred to a “floor manager.”  According to \nthe transcript, when Mr. Knight asked what “shocking content” caused the ad to  be flagged for \nreview, the manager responded that “the video has the sexuality content about the gays and \neverything” and  that “the major reason is about the gay thing.”  See Dkt. No. 20 at ECF 130 -135; \nsee also  Dkt. No. 67 ¶¶ 20, 24, 26.e., 32, 143, 155,  167, 354.   The TAC alleges that defendants \nlater apologized “for what they contend was a misunderstanding” and “eventually agreed to run \nthe ad”  more than  three weeks after the Christmas holiday passed.  Dkt. No. 67 ¶ 144. \nDefendants maintain that the cal l center episode is irrelevant to the extent it concerns  \nplaintiffs’ purchase of ad vertisements , rather than the restriction of  plaintiffs’ videos.  They also \nargue that  the TAC’s allegations are misleading and inconsistent insofar as they suggest that the  \nDivino Group ad was disapproved, when it  in fact was allowed to run.   As discussed above, \nhowever, the  overall theory of plaintiffs’ Unruh Act claim is that they are being unlawfully denied \nequal access to YouTube’s services because of their sexual orient ation and viewpoints.  The TAC \nalleges that the  Divino Group  ad was not allowed to run initially because of the “gay thing,” and it \nwas allowed to run later (after the advertised event was over) only after Mr. Knight called to \ncomplain .  Plaintiffs further allege  that, f ar from being an isolated incident, the same thing \nhappened to Divino Group at least five times before  the December 2017 call center in cident , and \nthat defendants subsequently “declined at least four additional ad requests from the same channel \n \n8 Plaintiffs apparently intended to, but did not , append the transcript to the TAC.  See Dkt. No. 67 \n¶ 20 n.6.   Nevertheless, both sides invite the Court to review the transcript appended to plaintiffs’ \nprior pleadings, most recently submitted as Exhibit A to plaintiffs’ SAC.  See Dkt. No. 20 at ECF \n130-135; Dkt. No. 85 at 18; Dkt. No. 88 at 7.

Enigma II , 946 F.3d at 1052.   Unlike Enigma II , however,  \nand despite the TAC’s allegations that defendants compete with plaintiffs for an audience and \nviewership,  the parties in the present acti on are not direct competitors.   See Dkt. No. 67 ¶¶ 35-46; \nsee e.g., Asurvio LP v. Malwarebytes, Inc. , No. 5:18-cv-05409 -EJD, 2020 WL 1478345,  at *5  \n(N.D. Cal. Mar. 26, 2020) (“The Court finds that the limitation to section 230(c)(2) (B) immunity \nrecognized in Enigma  does not apply to this case.  In Enigma , the parties were direct competitors \nwho sold computer security software nationwide.”) (internal  quotations and citation omitted).  \nIndeed, other courts have concluded that  “defendants’ creation of a ‘Restricted Mode’ to allow \nsensitive users to voluntarily choose a more limited experience of the YouTube service is exactly \nthe type of self -regulation  that Congress sought to encourage in enacting section 230, and fits \nwithin section 230(c)(2)(B)’s immunity for ‘any action taken to enable or make available to . . . \nothers,’ namely, YouTube users, ‘the technical means to restrict access to’ material ‘tha t the \nprovider or user considers to be obscene, . . . excessively violent, . . . or otherwise objectionable. ”  \nPrager Univ. , 2019 WL 8640569  at *10. \nDefendants have demonstrated that Section 230(c)(2)(B) immunity applies to the Unruh \nAct and UCL claims , to the extent those claims are based on YouTube’s application of Restricted \nMode . \nD. Plaintiffs’ Challenge to  Constitutionality of CDA  Section 230  \nThe Court is mindful of the doctrine of constitutional avoidance.  See Dep’t of Com. v. U.S. \nHouse of Representati ves, 525 U.S. 316, 343 (1999)  (“If there is one doctrine more deeply rooted \nthan any other in the process of constitutional adjudication, it is that we ought not to pass on \nquestions of constitutionality . . . unless such adjudication is unavoidable.” ) ((quoting Spector \nMotor Serv. v. McLaughlin , 323 U.S. 101, 105 (1944)).   However, in view of the Court’s \nconclusions that the TAC states some claims for relief, which nonetheless are barred by CDA \nSection 230(c), the Court finds it necessary to address plaintiffs’ argument that CDA Section 230 \nis unconstitutional . \nPlaintiffs argue  that CDA Section 230 (c) is unconstitutional because it violates  their free \nspeech rights under  the First Amendment .  Dkt. No. 85 at 27 -30.  Relying on Denver Area Educ. Case 5:19-cv-04749-VKD     Document 107     Filed 09/30/22     Page 31 of 35 \n32 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  Telecomm. Consortium, Inc. v. Fed. Commc’ns Comm’n , 518 U.S. 727 (1996), plaintif fs argue  \nthat “ the statute’s application results in  an unconstitutional permissive speech law that violates the \nFirst Amendment .”  Id. at 27.   Defendants respond that there is no valid basis for plaintiffs’ \nconstitutional attack on Section 230(c) because defendants are not state actors subject to the \nconstraints of the First Amendment .  Dkt. No. 77 at 24 -25; Dkt. No. 88 at 18 -20.  The United \nStates  argues that Section 230(c) is not unconstitutional because YouTube is not a state actor  and \nbecause Section 2 30(c) has not deprived plaintiffs of any valid underlying speech claim.   Dkt. \nNos. 47, 89.  \nThe Court agrees with defendants and the United States.  I n this Court’s prior order \ngranting defendants’ motion to dismiss the SAC, the Court concluded that plainti ffs failed to  \nestablish the presence of state action in support of their First Amendment claim because \n(1) YouTube’s hosting of speech on a private platform is not a traditional and exclusive \ngovernment function ; (2) plaintiffs failed to support their assertion that defendants effectively \ndeclared themselves the equivalent of state actors; (3) the availability of the affirmative defense \nunder Section 230(c) does not amount to government endorsement of defendants’ alleged \ndiscrimination ; and (4) nothing about Section 230 coerces private entities to take any particular \naction.  Nothing in the TAC or plaintiffs’ arguments requires the Court to alter its prior analysis or \nconclusions.  See Dkt. No. 65 at 7 -12; see also  Prager III , 951 F.3d  at 997-98; Newman , 2021 WL \n2633423 at *9 -10. \nPlaintiffs nonetheless maintain that under Denver Area , Section 230(c) is unconstitutional \nbecause it “was expressly enacted as a permissive regulation of speech” that allows defendants to \nregulate, restrict and block content on YouTube.  Dkt. No. 85 at 27 -28.  Plaintiffs’ arguments fail \nto persuade.  As discussed in the Court’s prior order dismissing plaintiffs’ SAC : \n \nUnlike the cable systems operators in Denver Area , YouTube is not \na government -regulated entity charged with prov iding public \nbroadcasting services.  And unlike the statute at issue in Denver \nArea , which permitted cable system operators to ban specific \ncontent, Section 230 of the CDA does not single out particular types \nof speech as suitable for private censorship.  At most, Section 230 \nprovides protection from civil liability for interactive computer \nservice providers who elect to host information provided by another \ncontent provider, or who in good faith act to restrict materials that Case 5:19-cv-04749-VKD     Document 107     Filed 09/30/22     Page 32 of 35 \n33 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  the provider or user considers “obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, \nexcessively violent, harassing, or otherwise objectionable,” \nregardless of whether that material is constitutionally protected.  \n[47] U.S.C. § 230(c); see also Roberts , 877 F.3d at 837 (concluding \nthat a permissive feder al statute giving a private entity the choice to \narbitrate does not “encourage” arbitration such that the private \nentity’s conduct is attributable to the government).  \n \nDkt. No. 65 at 11 -12; see also Lewis , 461 F. Supp. 3d at 952 -53 (concluding that Section 230(c)(1) \n“does not ban or restrict any speech.”) ; Prager Univ. , 2019 WL 8640569  at *12 (same) ; see \ngenerally Janus v. Am. Fed. of State, Cty. & Mun. Emps., Council 31 , 138 S. Ct. 2448, 2479 n.24 \n(2018) (noting that , while the issue has not yet bee n decided by the Supreme Court,  the \nproposition that a law “allowing, but not requiring, private parties ” to take certain action is \nsufficient to establish governmental action “is even more questionable today.”).12  Plaintiffs have \nnot presented any argume nt that compels a contrary conclusion.   Although plaintiffs maintain that \nUnited States v. Texas , 566 F.  Supp.  3d 605 ( W.D. Tex. 2021)  establishes that they need not \nestablish state action to pursue a constitutional challenge to CDA Section 230, that argum ent fails \nfor the reasons discussed above.  \nTo the extent the TAC  suggests that defendants’ invocation of CDA Section 230(c) as a \ndefense violates plaintiffs’ First Amendment right to “petition[] the courts for relief,” (see Dkt. \nNo. 67  ¶ 304), plaintiffs have not been precluded from presenting their legal disputes  to the courts, \n“express[ing] their ideas, hopes, and concerns to their government ,” or from “request[ing] action \nby the government to address those concerns.”  Borough of Duryea v. Gua rnieri , 564 U.S. 379, \n388-89 (2011).  Here, the United States argues, persuasively, that the Petition Clause does not \nrequire that the government guarantee plaintiffs the ability to continue to litigating their claims to \na particular outcome, or that defen dants must be denied the opportunity to avail themselves of a \ndefense under CDA Section 230.   See Dkt. No. 47 at 15 -16; Dkt. No. 89.   For example, i n \n \n12 The parties dispute whether d efendants  should be permitted to file a statement of recent decision \nconcerning Judge Chen’ s order  on a motion to dismiss  in Huber v. Biden , No. 21 -cv-06580 -EMC, \n2022 WL 827248 (N.D. Cal. Mar. 18, 2022).   See Dkt. Nos. 102, 103.  In briefing the matter, both \nsides present substantive arguments regarding their respective views on the relevance of Huber .  \nAs the parties have had an opportunity to brief the matter, t he Court grants defendants’ request for \nleave to file their statement  of recent decision .  The Court otherwise finds it unnecessary to rely on \nHube r; as discussed above, plaintiffs have not persuasively argued that Denver Area  requires \neither a finding of state action or a constitutional violation in the present matter .

Glock, Inc. , 565 F.3d 1126 , \n1140 -41 (9th Cir. 2009)  (concluding that law limiting liability did not deprive the plaintiffs of a \nvested property right because “although a cause of action is a species of property, a party’s \nproperty right in any cause of action does not ve st until a final unreviewable judgment is \nobtained.”).  \nPlaintiffs  have not established that the application of Section 230(c) as a defense is \nunconstitutional.  \nE. Leave to Amend  \nUnder Rule 15(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, leave to amend “shall be freely \ngiven when justice so requires,” because “the court must remain guided by the underlying purpose \nof Rule 15 . . . to facilitate decisions on the merits, rather than o n the pleadings or technicalities.”  \nLopez v. Smith , 203 F.3d 1122, 1127 (9th Cir. 2000) (en banc) (alterations and internal quotation \nmarks omitted).  “The decision of whether to grant leave to amend nevertheless remains within the \ndiscretion of the distr ict court,” which may deny leave to amend if allowing amendment would \nunduly prejudice the opposing party, cause undue delay, or be futile, or if the party seeking \namendment has acted in bad faith.  Leadsinger, Inc. v. BMG Music Publ’g , 512 F.3d 522, 532 ( 9th \nCir. 2008) (citing Foman v. Davis , 371 U.S. 178, 182 (1962)).  \nAs discussed above, plaintiffs are given leave to amend their claim for breach of the \nimplied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.  However, they will not be given leave to amend \nany other claims.  Plaintiffs  have now had several opportunities to plead  their claims.  See Dkt. \nNos. 1, 7, 20, 67.  They  have not articulated any additional facts that could be alleged in an \namended pleading to support  plausible claims for violation of the Lanham Act , the California \nConstitution,  or for declaratory relief reg arding the constitutionality of CDA Section 230 , much \nless additional claims for breach of contract, rescission, replevin or for an accounting ( see Dkt. \nNo. 67 at 1 n.1; Dkt.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: In Mazile v. Larkin University Corp. and ExamSoft Worldwide, Inc., Plaintiff Christelle Mazile, a doctoral student, claims that ExamSoft's AI-proctored exams led to false cheating allegations and her expulsion from Larkin University. The court ruled that Mazile's claims against ExamSoft must go to arbitration due to a binding arbitration clause in the clickwrap agreement she signed. Additionally, the court dismissed her claims against Larkin University for discrimination under the ADA and RA, among others, for failing to establish Larkin as a state actor or show that the university knew of any alleged discriminatory effects of the ExamSoft software.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the arbitration clause in the ExamSoft EULA is enforceable and whether Plaintiff's allegations state a valid claim of discrimination against Larkin University under various statutes, considering the use of AI in ExamSoft's software.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court compelled arbitration for the claims against ExamSoft, enforcing the arbitration clause in the EULA, and dismissed the Plaintiff’s claims against Larkin University. The dismissal was with prejudice regarding the § 1983 claim, finding Larkin is not a state actor, and without prejudice regarding the other discrimination claims, finding insufficient evidence for wrongful discrimination against Plaintiff due to her disabilities.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Christelle Mazile said a computer program in her university's online exam system incorrectly flagged her as a cheater, which led to her getting kicked out of school. She tried to sue both the university and the company behind the exam software. The court said she agreed to settle any issues with the software company in a special way (arbitration) when she clicked \"I agree\" before taking the test, so she has to handle that part outside court. As for the university, the court ruled her claims weren’t detailed enough to move forward, though she might get a second chance to explain them better in some cases.",

Being fully advised, the Motion [ ECF No. 34] is GRANTED.  \nI. BACKGROUND Plaintiff Christelle Mazile  attended Defendant Larkin University Corp. (“Larkin”) to \nobtain a doctorate degree in the ir pharmaceutical program, with an expected graduation date of \nMay 2021.  [ Compl. ¶ 11].  Mazile describes herself as an “African American female with \ndiagnosed anxiety and ADHD.”  [ Id.]   \nLarkin is a Florida non-profit corporation engaged in providing higher education services, \nand Larkin received forgivable loans from the federal  government via the Paycheck Protection \nProgram (“PPP”).  [Id . ¶¶ 2-3, 95c].   \nDefendant ExamSoft Worldwide, Inc. (“ExamSoft”), is a for -profit Texas corporation that \ncreates testin g software that Larkin use d to administer remote examinations for its classes .  [Id. ¶¶ \n2-3].   Case 1:23-cv-23306-DSL   Document 53   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/22/2024   Page 1 of 242 \n In the Spring of 2020, Mazile was scheduled to take her final examinations  at Larkin  in \nthree classes.  [ Id. ¶ 13].  She initially took examinations for these classes in person (without using \nExamSoft software ) but failed to achieve passing grades .  [Id. ¶¶ 16, 18].  As a result, Larkin \nrequired her to take remediation examinations.  [ Id. ¶¶ 20].  At the time of the remediation testing  \nand due to  the COVID-19 pandemic , Larkin arranged to have the ir students take  examinations \nremotely by using  ExamSoft software.  [ Id. ¶ 15].  T he ExamSoft software created “a continuous \naudio and video recording of the exam -taker using both webcam and screen capture, ” and after the \nexam was  completed the footage was  uploaded to ExamSoft for review by an artificial intelligence \nsystem to identify any potential irregular behavior.  [ Id. ¶ 25].  In  May 2020, Plaintiff took these \nexaminations remotely using ExamSoft ; she was not given an option by Larkin to take her \nexaminations in any other  manner.1  [Id. ¶¶ 21-24, 29].  After taking her remediation exams , \nExamSoft “flagged” Mazile for cheating, and she was expelled by Larkin as a result .  [Id. ¶¶ 30-\n31].   \nTo take her remote examinations using ExamSoft, Plaintiff signed a n Exam Soft \n“clickwrap” agreement, known as the End User Licensing Agreement (“EULA”), by checking a \nbox on her computer screen.  [ECF No. 36 at 7].  The EULA inc luded a clause mandating binding \narbitration for “any claim, demand, dispute or controversy of any kind or nature between the parties \nhereto arising out of or relating to this Agreement, its construction, interpretation, performance or alleged breach” that  is “not otherwise settled by agreement of the parties” (the “Arbitration \nClause”).  [ Compl., Ex. C  at 36].  The Arbitration Clause include d a choice-of- law clause \n \n1 In her Complaint, Mazile  claims to have taken the same remediation exams at different \ntimes.   At some points she claims they occurred in May 2020, and at other points she claims they \ntook place in May 2021.  [Compl. ¶¶ 21, 29, 30, 39, 50].   Because she admits in her response to \nDefendants’ Motion that the examinations occurred in May 2020, this Court will assume as such.  \n[See ECF No. 36 at 16].  Case 1:23-cv-23306-DSL   Document 53   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/22/2024   Page 2 of 243 \n specifying that Texas law applie d to any dispute “without regard to its conflict of laws rules.”  \n[Id.].   \nAs part of the expulsion determination, Mazile alleges that Larkin refused to allow her to \nretest, in person or otherwise, and refused to “consider or investigate her claims that the  \n[ExamSoft] Software had a discriminatory effect based on her race, as well as her ADHD and \nanxiety.”  [ Id. ¶ 32].  Mazile points out that ExamSoft ha d drawn  criticism “as early as December \nof 2020,” when six United States Senators wrote a letter to ExamSo ft expressing their concerns \nthat the ExamSoft software was accusing students of color  and those with disabilities  of cheating  \ndisproportionately.  [ Id., Ex. A at 19- 22].  Mazile also alleges that  “[n]umerous other articles, \nstories, or publications have been made which evidence a clear pattern of the [ExamSoft] Software, and its undoubted discriminatory effect on African America (sic) students, and those with disabilities.”  [ Id. ¶ 28].  \nMazile’s Amended Complaint contains seven counts .  Four counts are aga inst Larkin, \nalleging discrimination and failure -to-accommodate claims under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, the Americans \nwith Disabilities Act (“ADA”), and the Rehabilitation Act (“RA”) .  Three counts are against \nExamSoft, alleging intentional and negligent misreprese ntation and breach of warranty claims \nunder state law.  [ECF No. 16, Compl. ¶¶ 33- 104]. \nII. The Motion to Compel Arbitration  by ExamSoft  is GRANTED.  \nAs part of the Motion, ExamSoft moved to compel arbitration for the claims against it, \nclaiming that the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”) requires Plaintiff to submit her claims against ExamSoft to binding arbitration.  [ECF No. 34 at 3].  For the reasons tha t follow, this Court agrees  \nwith ExamSoft; these three counts must be decided in arbitration. \n Case 1:23-cv-23306-DSL   Document 53   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/22/2024   Page 3 of 244 \n A. Legal Standard  \nUnder the FAA, “[a] written provision in any . . . contract evidencing a transaction \ninvolving commerce to settle by arbitration a controversy the reafter arising out of such contract or \ntransaction . . . shall be valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, save upon such grounds as exist at law \nor in equity for the revocation of any contract [.]”  9 U.S.C. § 2.  “Confronted with a facially valid \narbitration  agreement, district courts shall  direct the parties to proceed to arbitration on issues as \nto which an arbitration agreement has been signed.”  Calcaterra v. Baptist Health S. Fla., Inc., No. 1:23- CV-20364- KMM, 2024 WL 2109349, at *2 (S.D. Fla. May 9, 2024) (emphasis in original); \n9 U.S.C. § 3.  “A motion to compel arbitration is treated generally as a Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.”  Calcaterra , 2024 \nWL 2109349, at *2 (citing Shea v. BBV A Compass Bancshares, Inc., 2013 WL 869526 at *2 n.3 \n(S.D. Fla. Mar. 7, 2013)).  Thus, a court “may consider matters outside the four corners of the complaint.”  Id . (citing Mamani v. Sanchez Berzain, 636 F. Supp. 2d 1326, 1329 (S.D. Fla. 2009)).  \nCourts s hould only compel arbitration if (a) the agreement is enforceable under “ordinary state -\nlaw contract principles” and (b) the claims before the court fall within the scope of that agreement.  Lambert v. Signature Healthcare , LLC, No. 19 -11900, 2022 WL 2571959, at *4 (11th Cir. July 8, \n2022). \nB. Discussion  \nIn diversity actions, this  Court is required to apply the forum state’s conflict -of-law rules.  \nDoe v. Roe , 500 F. Supp. 3d 1319, 1324 (S.D. Fla. 2020), aff'd , No. 20 -14456, 2022 WL 1447378 \n(11th Cir. May 9, 2022) (citing Klaxon Co. v. Stentor Elect. Mfg. Co., 313 U.S. 487, 496 (1941)).  In Florida, “[w]hen a false conflict exists, the law of the forum state –Florida –applies.”  Id . (citing \nCavic v. Grand Bahama Dev. Co. , 701 F.2d 879, 882 (11th Cir. 1983)).  A “false conflict exists Case 1:23-cv-23306-DSL   Document 53   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/22/2024   Page 4 of 245 \n where the laws of the interested jurisdictions would produce the same outcome[.]”  Id . (quotation \nmarks omitted).   \nMazile claims that both the choice -of-law provision and the Arbitration Clause are \nunconscionable.  [ See ECF No. 36 at 5].  This Court will review  the substantive law of \nunconscionability in both Florida and Texas to determine whether there is a “false conflict ,” such \nthat both courts in both states would “produce the same outcome” when deciding whether the \nchoice- of-law provision and the Arbitration Clause in the EULA are unconscionable.  If so, the \nCourt will apply Florida law. \n1. Substantive Law - Unconscionability  \n Florida Law \nUnder Florida law, “[w]hether an arbit ration provision is unconscionable is a question of \nstate law and therefore the provision is interpreted according to state law rules of contract \nconstruction.”  Valiente v. StockX, Inc. , 645 F. Supp. 3d 1331, 1339 (S.D. Fla. 2022).  “Both \nprocedural unconscionability and substantive unconscionability must exist before the provision is unenforceable.”  Id . (citing Golden v. Mobil Oil Corp., 882 F.2d 490, 493 (11th Cir. 1989)). \n“Procedural unconscionability focuses on (1) the manner in which the contract was  entered \ninto; (2) whether the complaining party had a meaningful choice at the time the contract was entered into; (3) whether the complaining party had a realistic opportunity to bargain regarding the terms of the contract; and (4) whether he or she had a reasonable opportunity to understand the terms of the contract.”  Valiente , 645 F. Supp. 3d at  1339 (internal quotations omitted).  Substantive \nunconscionability focuses on the “unreasonableness of the terms” in the “agreement itself.”  Basulto v. Hialeah Auto., 141 So. 3d 1145, 1157- 58 (Fla. 2014); Solis v. Am. Express Nat'l Bank , \nNo. 5:23- CV-208- JSM- PRL, 2023 WL 4474322, at *2 (M.D. Fla. July 11, 2023), report and Case 1:23-cv-23306-DSL   Document 53   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/22/2024   Page 5 of 246 \n recommendation adopted, No. 5:23- CV-208-JSM- PRL, 2023 WL 4831307 (M.D. Fla. July 28, \n2023).  However, while both procedural and substantive unconscionability “must be established \nto avoi d enforcement of the terms within an arbitration agreement[,] . . . . they need not be present \nto the same degree.”  Basulto, 141 So. 3d at 1159 (adopting a “sliding scale” approach for unconscionability). \nHere, Mazile signed the EULA  by checking a box before taking her remote exam s.  In \norder to take her exams, which were required for graduation, she had to agree to the terms provided \nby ExamSoft in the Arbitration Clause , with no effective negotiating power  to change the terms of \nthe software’s use.  [ECF  No. 37 at 7].  Plaintiff, therefore, had little meaningful choice when she \ntook her final examinations to not sign the EULA -- because if she did not agree to the terms as \npresented to her, she would certainly fail to graduate after she had spent over $135,000 in pursuit of her degree.  [Compl. ¶ 12].  Thus, it is clear to this Court that the second and third Valiente  \nfactors of procedural unconscionability are present .   \nHowever, the first and fourth Valiente  factors do not lead to a finding of procedural \nunconscionability.  T he Plaintiff had every opportunity to understand the clear terms of the \nArbitration Clause .  The clause, as Plaintiff admits, was “in the same font, text, color, and size as \nthe rest of the agreement” and was clearly titled “GOVERNING LAW AND ARBITRATION[.]”  [ECF No. 37 at 7].  Plaintiff had a duty to read the contract, which was less than four pages, before she agreed to it, and be cause the Arbitration Clause  was plainly  available for her to read , and not \nhidden in the contract , this Court does not find  that it is procedurally unconscionable.  See Valiente , \n645 F. Supp. 3d at  1340- 41. \nClickwrap agreements are generally valid and enf orceable in Florida , further supporting \nthe Court’s conclusion that the EULA is not procedurally unconscionable even though Plaintiff Case 1:23-cv-23306-DSL   Document 53   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/22/2024   Page 6 of 247 \n had little choice or bargaining opportunity before  signing it.  See, e.g., Matter of Chaves , No. 22-\n81648- CIV, 2024 WL 718033, at *8 (S.D. Fla. Feb. 9, 2024) (finding clickwrap agreements are \ngenerally upheld in Florida) ; Salco Distributors, LLC v. iCode, Inc., No. 8:05 CV 642 T 27TGW, \n2006 WL 449156, at *2 (M.D. Fla. Feb. 22, 2006).  W hile Plaintiff is correct that the EULA was \nlikely one of adhesion, which is a “standardized contract, imposed upon the subscribing party \nwithout an opportunity to negotiate the terms,” Senior Servs. of Palm Beach LLC v. ABCSP Inc. , \nNo. 12- 80226- CIV, 2012 WL 2054971, at *4 (S.D. Fla. June 7, 2012), adhesion contracts are not \n“per se unconscionable[,] ” Joyce v. Forest River, Inc. , No. 23- CV-81262, 2024 WL 517990, at *3 \n(S.D. Fla. Feb. 9, 2024) (holding that an adhesion contract is unconscionable only where more \nfactors are present, such as decepti on). \nThus, despite the presence of two  of the Valiente  factors necessary for procedur al \nunconscionability, the EULA is not strongly procedurally unconscionable .  See Valiente , 645 \nF.Supp.3d at 1339 ( holding that a clickwrap arbitration agreement was enforceable where there \nwas an opt -out clause, Plaintiff had a duty to read the terms and c onditions, and clause was not \nhidden in fine print).  \nWhile substantive unconscionability is a vague standard, because arbitration agreements \nhave been upheld consistently in Florida, and are expressly supported by federal policy, there is \nno evidence that the Arbitration Clause is substantive ly unconscionable .  See Hilton v. Fluent, \nLLC, 297 F. Supp. 3d 1337, 1340 (S.D. Fla. 2018) ; Sims v. Clarendon Nat. Ins. Co., 336 F. Supp. \n2d 1311, 1325 (S.D. Fla. 2004); Laizure v. Avante at Leesburg, Inc., 44 So. 3d 1254, 1257 (Fla. \nDist. Ct. App. 2010), approved, 109 So. 3d 752 (Fla. 2013); see generally AT&T Mobility LLC v. Concepcion, 563 U.S. 333, 339 (2011).  Mazile  states in correct ly that the Arbitration Clause’s \nrequirement  that she waive any class action right  creates substantive unconscionability .  See AT&T Case 1:23-cv-23306-DSL   Document 53   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/22/2024   Page 7 of 248 \n Mobility , 563 U.S. at 352 (finding that the FAA preempted a state ’s judicial rule  banning class \naction waivers  in arbitration clauses ); Pendergast v. Sprint Nextel Corp., 691 F.3d 1224, 1232 \n(11th Cir. 2012). \nAdditionally, Mazile has offered no explanation (beyond a conclusory statement ) as to why \napplying Texas law would be substantively unconscionable.2  Choice-of- law clauses are only held \nunreasonable and unenforceable when “(1) their formati on was induced by fraud or overreaching; \n(2) the plaintiff would effectively be deprived of its day in court because of the inconvenience and \nunfairness of the chosen forum; (3) the fundamental unfairness of the chosen law would deprive \nthe plaintiff of a remedy; or (4) enforcement of such provisions would contravene a strong public policy.”  Xena Invs., Ltd. v. Magnum Fund Mgmt. Ltd., 726 F.3d 1278, 1284–85 (11th Cir. 2013).  Clearly, the choice -of-law clause here does not meet this test for unreasonableness because (1) \nMazile does not allege fraud in the formation of the EULA ; (2) Mazile would not be deprived of \nher day in Court if Texas law applies as the application of Texas law itself does not forbid the Plaintiff from bringing any claim; (3) Texas law is not fundamentally unfair on unconscionability and closely mirrors Florida law (discussed below) ; and (4) Mazile has identified no strong public \npolicy that would counsel this Court against applying Texas law.  \nBecause Mazile has insuffici ently proven procedural unconscionability, and because there \nis no showing of substantive unconscionability, under Florida law, both clauses would be enforced \nand the Motion to Compel Arbitration would therefore be granted.  However, this Court must also analyze Texas law on unconscionability to determine whether a false conflict exists. \n \n \n2 To show substantive unconscionability under Florida law, Mazile has to show that it \nwould be unreasonable for this Court to apply Texas law  here.  Case 1:23-cv-23306-DSL   Document 53   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/22/2024   Page 8 of 249 \n  Texas Law  \n Similar to Florida, Texas courts analyze contractual unconscionability by determining both \nprocedural and substantive unconscionability.  Bongalis- Royer v. RJ Worldwide, LLC , No. 4:14-\nCV-330, 2015 WL 12778846, at *9 (E.D. Tex. July 16, 2015).  To do this, Texas courts examine \n“(1) the entire atmosphere in which the agreement was made; (2) alternatives, if any, available to \nthe parties at the time of formation; ( 3) the non -bargaining ability of a party; (4) whether the \ncontract was illegal or against public policy; (5) and whether it is oppressive or unreasonable.”  Id.; Delfingen US- Texas, L.P. v. Valenzuela, 407 S.W.3d 791, 798 (Tex. App. 2013).  Additionally, \nand like Florida, clickwrap agreements  are generally valid and enforceable in Texas , regardless of \nthe signatory’s purported lack of choice.   See, e.g., Bongalis- Royer , 2015 WL 12778846 at *9; \nRecursion Software, Inc. v. Interactive Intel., Inc. , 425 F. Supp. 2d 756, 782 (N.D. Tex. 2006); \nStubHub, Inc. v. Ball , 676 S.W.3d 193, 200 (Tex. App. 2023) (“Texas state and federal courts have \nrecognized the validity of clickwrap agreements.”).   \nJust as above, even though the atmosphere in which the agreement was made would suggest \nsome level of  procedural unconscionability, supra, the facts are insufficient to create strong \nprocedural or substantive unconscionability.  Arbitration clauses and choice of law provisions are neither  illegal nor against public policy (in fact, as discussed, federal law supports arbitration \nclauses) and the clickwrap terms were not “unfair or oppressive .”  Johnson v. Sw. Recovery Servs. \nInc., No. 3:22- CV-242-X- BH, 2023 WL 1944127, at *9 (N.D. Tex. Jan. 24, 2023), report and \nrecommendation adopted, No. 3:22- CV-0242-X- BH, 2023 WL 1879999 (N.D. Tex. Feb. 10, \n2023) ; supra. \nThus, because both Florida and Texas law would lead to the same conclusion that the \nEULA is not unconscionable , there is a “false conflict” between Texas and Florida law for the Case 1:23-cv-23306-DSL   Document 53   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/22/2024   Page 9 of 2410 \n enforceability of the Arbitration Clause .  This Court must therefore apply Florida law and , as \ndiscussed above,  finds that the Arbitration Clause is enforceable.  A ny claims that properly fall \nwithin the scope of the Arbitration Clause should be heard in arbitration.  \n2. Scope of the Arbitration Clause  \n The Arbitration Clause in the EULA  provides that any unsettled claim “shall be resolved \nby binding bi -lateral arbitration[.]”  [ECF No. 16 at 36 § 11].  A “claim” is “any claim, demand, \ndispute or controversy of any kind or nature between the parties hereto arising out of or relating to \nthis Agreement, its construction, interpretation, performance or alleged breach.”  [ Id.].  Because \nthis Court found that the choice of law clause in the Arbitration Clause is enforceable, Texas law applies to the determination of whether the Plaintiff’s claims fall under the Arbitration Clause.  \nUnder Texas law, a broad arbitration clause is one “where the language of the clause \nrequires arbitration of any dispute that arises out of or relates to ‘the agreement, or disputes that are in connection with the agr eement.”  Elkjer v. Scheef & Stone, L.L.P., 8 F. Supp. 3d 845, 855 \n(N.D. Tex. 2014).  Where there is a broad arbitration clause, for arbitration to be compelled over certain claims, those claims need only “touch” issues covered by the arbitration clause.  See id .   \nThe Arbitration Clause here is broad because it encompasses  “any claim . . . arising out of \nor relating to this Agreement[.]”   [ECF No. 16 at 36 § 11] .  Thus , any claim that relates to or \n“touches” the Agreement is covered  by the clause and shoul d be heard by an arbitral body, not a \nfederal court .  Here, the three claims against ExamS oft, Count IV (intentional misrepresentation), \nCount V (negligent misrepresentation), and Count VI (breach of warranty of fitness for a particular purpose), all relat e to the agreement which Mazile  signed because they concern her  examinations \nfor which she had to sign the EULA .  Case 1:23-cv-23306-DSL   Document 53   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/22/2024   Page 10 of 2411 \n In Count IV, Mazile states that she “acted on these, and other representations made by \nExamSoft as to the efficacy of its [ExamSoft] Software,  or nondiscriminatory impact thereof, in \nusing the EM Software to take her remediation examinations .”  [ECF No. 1 ¶ 74 (emphasis \nadded)].   In Count V, Mazile states that she “was injured as a direct and proximate result, as she \nwas in fact discriminated upon based on race and/or disability when using the [ExamSoft] \nSoftware[.]” [Id . ¶ 81] .  In Count VI she  states “Plaintiff and ExamSoft were in privity of contr act, \nby virtue of [the EULA.]”  [ Id. ¶ 81].    \nAs Mazile admits , all of these claims clearly  relate to or arise out of the Arbitration Clause.  \n[See ECF No. 36 at 2- 3; Compl. ¶ 8 (“Plaintiff’s claims arise directly out of ExamSoft’s activities \nin the state of Florida . . . the use of [the ExamSoft software] caused Plaintiff to be expelled.” ].  \nThese claims are only actionable because Mazile signed the EULA and decided to take the \nexaminations via ExamSoft.  Therefore, all of these claims should be hear d in arbitration.  The \nMotion to Compel Arbitration as to all counts against ExamSoft  (Counts IV, V, VI ) is GRANTED.  \nIII. The Motion to Dismiss by Larkin  is GRANTED.  \nDefendant Larkin moves to dismiss Plaintiff’s claims against it under Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 12(b)(6) for failure to state claims.  [ECF No. 34 at 5].  Specifically, Larkin argues that \n(1) it is not a state actor and therefore not amenable to suit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, (2) Plaintiff fails to properly plead discrimination under the ADA bec ause based on the facts presented in the \nAmended Complaint, Larkin could not have known of the possible discriminatory effect of ExamSoft, (3) Plaintiff fails to properly plead failure to accommodate under the ADA because Plaintiff did not demand an accomm odation, and (4) the legislative history of Section 504 of the \nRA implies that Larkin cannot be sued under the Act.  [ Id. at 6 -13].  For the reasons that follow, \nthe Motion is GRANTED. Case 1:23-cv-23306-DSL   Document 53   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/22/2024   Page 11 of 2412 \n A. Legal Standard  \nTo survive a 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, “a complaint must contain sufficient factual \nmatter, accepted as true, to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.”  Ashcroft v. Iqbal , \n556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) (quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly , 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007) (internal \nquotations omitted)).  When reviewing a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), a court must \naccept as true all factual allegations contained in the complaint, and the plaintiffs receive the benefit of all favorable inf erences that can be drawn from the facts alleged.  See  Chaparro v. \nCarnival Corp., 693 F.3d 1333, 1337 (11th Cir. 2012); Iqbal , 556 U.S. at 678. \nA court considering a 12(b)(6) motion is generally limited to the facts contained in the \ncomplaint and attached  exhibits —but may also consider documents referred to in the complaint \nthat are central to the claim and whose authenticity is undisputed.  See  Wilchombe v. TeeVee Toons, \nInc., 555 F.3d 949, 959 (11th Cir. 2009).  While the court is required to accept as t rue all allegations \ncontained in the complaint, courts “are not bound to accept as true a legal conclusion couched as \na factual allegation.”  Twombly , 550 U.S. at 555; Iqbal , 556 U.S. at 678.  “Dismissal pursuant to \nRule 12(b)(6) is not appropriate unless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief.”  Magluta v. Samples , 375 F.3d \n1269, 1273 (11th Cir. 2004) (citation and quotation omitted).  “ [D]etermining whether a complaint  \nstates a plausible claim for relief is a context -specific task that requires the reviewing court to draw \non its judicial experience and common sense.”  Holland v. Carnival Corp. , 50 F.4th 1088, 1093 \n(11th Cir. 2022) (alterations accepted) (quoting Iqbal , 556 U.S. at 679). \n   Case 1:23-cv-23306-DSL   Document 53   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/22/2024   Page 12 of 2413 \n B. Discussion  \nCount I – 42 U.S.C. § 1983 \n Mazile alleges Larkin  violated Plaintiff’s Equal Protection rights under the Fourteenth \nAmendment and brings a claim under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.  [ Compl. ¶ 38].  Count I  fails to state a \nclaim and is plainly futile .  Section  1983, the great civil rights statute  of post -Civil War American \nlaw, was passed “ to deter state actors  from using the badge of their authority to deprive individuals \nof their federally guaranteed rights and to provide relief to victims if such deterrence fails.”  Wyatt \nv. Cole , 504 U.S. 158, 161 (1992)  (emphasis added).  Larkin is a private university, id . ¶ 2, and \nPlaintiff presents no reason that it should be considered a “state actor” subjecting it to suit under § \n1983.   A private party can be considered a state actor in three rare circumstances: “(1) the State \nhas coerced or at least significantly enco uraged the action alleged to violate the Constitution \n(“State compulsion test”); (2) the private parties performed a public function that was traditionally \nthe exclusive prerogative of the State (“public function test”); or (3) the State had so far insinua ted \nitself into a position of interdependence with the private parties that it was a joint participant in the enterprise (“nexus/joint action test”).  Charles v. Johnson, 18 F.4th 686, 694 (11th Cir. 2021) (quoting Rayburn ex rel. Rayburn v. Hogue , 241 F.3d 1341, 1347 (11th Cir. 2001)).  None of these \ncircumstances are present here.  \nMazile argues that  Larkin is a state actor because it (1) performs a primarily and \ntraditionally state function – education, and (2) in the alternative, there is “joint action or a nexus \nbetween the State and Larkin University because Larkin University accepts federal funds.  [ Compl . Case 1:23-cv-23306-DSL   Document 53   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/22/2024   Page 13 of 2414 \n ¶¶ 34 -35, 37].  These arguments are without merit, and Mazile cites no legal authority  holding a \nprivate university to be a state actor.3 \nCourts have consistently held that private universities are not state actors for purposes of § \n1983.  See Andela v. Univ. of Miami , 461 F. App'x 832, 836 (11th Cir. 2012); Driessen v. Univ. of \nMiami Sch. of L. Child. & Youth L. Clinic , No. 1:20- CV-22559- UU, 2020 WL 13368589, at *2 \n(S.D. Fla. June 23, 2020), aff’d 835 Fed.Appx. 489 (11th Cir. 2020); Driessen v. Univ. of Miami \nSch. of L. Child. & Youth L. Clinic , No. 19-21224-CIV, 2019 WL 8895219, at *2 (S.D. Fla. Sept. \n24, 2019); Althia bat v. Howard Univ., 76 F. Supp. 3d 194, 197 (D.D.C. 2014).  Moreover, the \nreceipt of federal funds “do[es] not elevate [] private educational institutions to the status of ‘state \nactor.’”  Richards v. Duke Univ., 480 F. Supp. 2d 222, 239 (D.D.C. 2007); see Manhattan Cmty. \nAccess Corp. v. Halleck, 587 U.S. 802, 814 (2019); Siyu Yang v. Ardizzone , 540 F. Supp. 3d 372, \n380 (W.D.N.Y. 2021), aff'd sub nom. Yang v. Eastman Sch. of Music , No. 21-1482- CV, 2022 WL \n1040418 (2d Cir. Apr. 7, 2022) (“[A] private entity does not become a state actor for purposes of \n§ 1983 merely on the basis of the private entity's creation, funding, licensing, or regulation by the government.”) (citing Fabrikant v. French, 691 F.3d 193, 207 (2d Cir. 2012)).  Plaintiff is incorrect \nthat Larkin’s receipt of federal funds intertwines it with the government such that it has become a state actor.  \nHaving identified no possible way for Larkin to be considered a state actor, Mazile cannot \nestablish that it is amenable to suit under § 1983.  Count I is DISMISSED with prejudice . \n \n3 The Defendant cites Braden v. Univ. of Pittsburgh, 552 F. 2d 948 (3d Cir. 1977) and \nKrynicky v. Univ. of Pittsburgh, 742 F.2d 94 (3d Cir. 1984) for the proposition that courts have \nheld that universities are state actors.  [ See ECF No. 36 at 11].  However, the University of \nPittsburgh is a “state -related” university that received “a massive infusion of moneys” from the \nCommonwealth of Pennsylvania.  Braden, 552 F. 2d at 959.  Larkin  is a private university , and \nthere is no allegation that it received anything close to a “massive infusion of moneys” from the State of Florida.  T hese cases are inapposite.  Case 1:23-cv-23306-DSL   Document 53   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/22/2024   Page 14 of 2415 \n Count II – ADA Discrimination  \nMazile’s next claim against Larkin under the ADA for discrimination is based on her \ndiagnosis of ADHD and anxiety.  Even if taken as true, however, Count II  is so bereft of \ninformation that  it cannot  amount to a discrimination claim under the ADA.  \nUnder the ADA, no employer “shall discriminate against a qualified individual on the basis \nof disability in regard to job application procedures, the hiring, advancement, or discharge of \nemployees, emp loyee compensation, job training, and other terms, conditions, and privileges of \nemployment.” 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a); Samson v. Fed. Exp. Corp., 746 F.3d 1196, 1200 (11th Cir. 2014).  “To establish a prima facie case of disability discrimination under the ADA, a plaintiff \nmust show that [s]he: (1) is disabled, (2) is a qualified individual, and (3) was subjected to unlawful discrimination because of h[er] disability.”  Samson v. Fed. Ex p. Corp., 746 F.3d 1196 (11th Cir. \n2014). \nTaking the Plaintiff’s assertions as true, Plaintiff properly pleads that she is disabled and \nthat Larkin  knew of the discrimination.  [ECF No. 16 ¶¶ 47, 50].  Thus, the first prong of the test \nis met.  \nTo be a “qualified individual” under the ADA, the Plaintiff must show that “she can meet \nthe essential eligibility requirements for participation in the program, either with or without reasonable accommodations.”  Redding v. Nova Se. Univ., Inc., 165 F. Supp. 3d 1274, 1290 (S.D. Fla. 2016); Earl v. Mervyns, Inc. , 207 F.3d 1361, 1365 (11th Cir. 2000).  Based on Mazile’s  \nallegations , she is a “qualified individual” because passing the exams was an essential requirement \nof the pharmaceutical program , the use o f ExamSoft impeded  her ability to succeed on the exams , \nand she identifies possible accommodations which could have aided her .  [Compl. ¶ ¶ 32, 63].  Case 1:23-cv-23306-DSL   Document 53   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/22/2024   Page 15 of 2416 \n However, Mazile’s allegations cannot establish that Larkin discriminated against her \nbecause of  her disabili ty, and thus, her complaint does not properly plead the third prong of ADA \ndiscrimination .  Larkin’s  use of ExamSoft for examinations during COVID -19 was for all  exams, \nregardless of the student.  [ See Compl. ¶ 22].  Plaintiff claims in both her Amended Complaint and \nher response to the Motion to Dismiss that the use of ExamSoft for all exams was discriminatory \nas to her because Larkin “had actual or constructive knowledge that the [ExamSoft software] had a discriminatory effect on individuals who has certa in learning disabilities [which was] gleaned \nfrom a highly publicized open letter from congress[.]”  [ Compl. ¶¶ 52 -53; ECF No. 36 at 15- 16 \n(“Plaintiff further avers that University knew that the [ExamSoft] Software was detrimental, and \nits choice to utiliz e the same amounts to circumstantial evidence that University intended to \ndiscriminate against individuals with ADHD, anxiety, and other disability such as Plaintiff.”) ]. \nThe only possible source of this knowledge that Plaintiff identifies is the letter to ExamSoft \nfrom the United States Senators, which was published in December 2020, seven months after \nPlaintiff took her exams.  [Id., Ex. A at 19- 22].  It is therefore impossible that Larkin would have \nhad knowledge of this letter  at the time Mazile used ExamSoft  for Larkin’s exams .  Mazile tries \nto downplay this fact by claiming that the letter “did not arise in a vacuum ,” and merely \n“solidifie[d] the magnitude  of complaints, studies, and issues in the months prior, including May \nof 2020[.]”  [ECF No. 36 at 16 (emphasis in original)].  While Mazile is entitled to all reasonable \ninferences resolved in her favor, this Court can only take the facts presented to it as true, and Mazile has presented this Court with no possible sources  from which Larkin  could have had \nknowledge of the discriminatory impact of ExamSoft.  See Tropical Soup Corp. v. City of Key W., No. 21- 10459, 2021 WL 3878250, at *1 (11th Cir. Aug. 31, 2021).   Case 1:23-cv-23306-DSL   Document 53   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/22/2024   Page 16 of 2417 \n Mazile, in her response to this Moti on, wants this Court to accept that it is a “ reasonable \ninference that ExamSoft had received, individually, at least one such complaint prior to May of \n2020” and would like to prove  this allegation through discovery.  [ECF No. 36 at 16 n.6].  \nHowever, “a P laintiff may not amend a complaint via a response to a motion to dismiss. ”  Guerrero \nv. Target Corp., 889 F. Supp. 2d 1348, 1356 n.6 (S.D. Fla. 2012) .  To find, based on her Amended \nComplaint, that there was at least one complaint to ExamSoft about its software would be to read extratextual facts into the record to cure the Amended Complaint’s deficiencies.  This Court will \nnot do so. \nEven assuming the ExamSoft software had a discriminatory effect on Mazile, the Amended \nComplaint alleges no facts that would give rise to even a reasonable inference that Larkin discriminated against Plaintiff because of her disability.  Beyond the Senators’ letter to ExamSoft, \nMazile alleges neit her a separate source of knowledge of ExamSoft’s discriminatory effect nor any \nfacts that would allow this Court to infer that Larkin engaged in purposeful discrimination against \nher.  Mazile’s assertion that Larkin “discriminated against Plaintiff because  of her ADHD and \nanxiety” is merely a legal conclusion unsupported by any facts in the ADA Complaint, and \ntherefore is insufficient for this Court to find that the third prong of the test to state a claim for \nADA discrimination has been met.  [Compl. ¶ 51] . \nThus, the facts that Mazile has  presented, taken as true, cannot amount to a finding that \nLarkin discriminated against Plaintiff because of  her disability .  Count II is  therefore  DISMISSED \nwithout prejudice .  \nCount II I – ADA Failure to Accommodate  \nNext, Mazile alleges  that Larkin “refused to provide reasonable accommodation to \nPlaintiff, with respect to her renumeration exam.”  [Compl. ¶ 59].  Plaintiff, however, fails to Case 1:23-cv-23306-DSL   Document 53   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/22/2024   Page 17 of 2420 \n because other courts have required a plaintiff to plead the demand , this Court finds that failing to \nplead this essential element of an ADA accommodation claim is grounds for dismissal.4  See \nGaston v. Bellingrath Gardens & Home, Inc., 167 F.3d 1361, 1363 (11th Cir. 1999) (holding that \na plaintiff cannot establish a failu re to accommodation claim without showing he or she demanded \nsuch an accommodation) ; see also D'Onofrio v. Costco Wholesale Corp., 964 F.3d 1014, 1022 \n(11th Cir. 2020).  \nPlaintiff does not allege anywhere that she requested an y accommodation from Larkin, so \nher pleading fails to allege an essential element of ADA failure- to-accommodate claims .  \nTherefore, t his count is DISMISSED without prejudice . \nCount VII – Violation of the Rehabilitation Act  \nFinally, Larkin seeks to dismiss Count VII on grounds that it does not receive federal \nfinancial assistance “as a whole,” because the PPP funds it received were restricted to use for \nparticular purposes.  [ECF No. 24 at 12- 13].  Larkin, however, does not discuss whether the \nPlaintiff’s Amended Complaint sufficiently alleges discrimination under the Rehabilitation Act, despite their argument to dismiss the ADA discrimination claim for failure to state a claim under \nthe exact same standard.   Therefore, this Court will  first analyze whether Larkin is subject to the \nRA based on its receipt of federal PPP funds , and then discuss whether Plaintiff stated a viable \nclaim under the RA.  \n \n4 Plaintiff claims that it must allege only that “reasonable accommodations were available” \nand the defendant “has the burden of persuasion on whether an accommodation would impose an \nundue hardship.”  [ECF No. 36 at 17 (citing Gary v. Ga. Dept. of Human Res., 206 Fed. Appx. 849 (11th Cir. 2006)) ].  Despite the presence of some helpful language for Plaintiff, Gary  does not \nsay that a Plaintiff need only allege that reasonable accommodations “ were available. ”  Rather, \nGary  dealt with an appeal from a district court’s grant of summary judgment and therefore does \nnot discuss  the requirements to adequately plead a claim of ADA failure to accommodate.  Gary , \n206 Fed. Appx. a t 852.  Further, Gary  is necessarily qualified by every other case in the Eleventh \nCircuit which follows it – cases which the Plaintiff conspicuously fails to discuss.\n Case 1:23-cv-23306-DSL   Document 53   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/22/2024   Page 20 of 2421 \n  Is Larkin a “Program or Activity” that Receives “Federal Financial Assistance?” \n Under the  RA, “No otherwise qualified individual with a disability in the United States ... \nshall, solely by reason of her or his disability, be excluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or ac tivity receiving Federal \nfinancial assistance.”  J.A.M. v. Nova Se. Univ., Inc., 646 F. App'x 921, 926 (11th Cir. 2016) (emphasis omitted ) (citing 29 U.S.C. § 794(a)).  “Program or activity” is defined, in relevant part, \nby the R A as  \n[A]ll of the operatio ns of an entire corporation, partnership, or other private organization, \nor an entire sole proprietorship— \n \n(i) if assistance is extended to such corporation, partnership, private organization, or sole proprietorship as a whole; or \n(ii) which is principally engaged in the business of providing education, health care, housing, social services, or parks and recreation \n  \n29 U.S.C. § 794(a)(3)(A)(i)- (ii).   \nThe parties devote substantial space in their arguments to whether Larkin, by accepting \nPPP fun ds, accepted this Federal financial assistance “as a whole” under § 794(a)(3)(A)(i).\n5  \nDefendant relies heavily on Ariza v. S. Moon Sales, Inc. for the proposition that acceptance of \n \n5 The United States Senate Report of the RA explained the meaning of Federal Financial \nAssistance extended to  an entity “as a whole:”  \n Federal financial assistance extended to a corporation or other entity “as a whole” refers to situations where the corporation receives general assistance that is not designated for a particular purpose. Federal financial assistan ce to the Chrysler Company for the purpose \nof preventing the company from going bankrupt would be an example of assistance to a corporation “as a whole.” Federal aid which is limited in purpose, e.g., Job Training Partnership Act (JPTA) [sic] funds, is not  considered aid to the corporation as a whole, \neven if it is used at several facilities and the corporation has discretion to determine which of its facilities participates in the program. A grant to a religious organization to enable it to extend assistan ce to refugees would not be assistance to the religious organization as a \nwhole if that is only one among a number of activities of the organization.   \n S. REP. 100-64 at *17 (1987).\n Case 1:23-cv-23306-DSL   Document 53   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/22/2024   Page 21 of 2422 \n federal funds via the Paycheck Protection Program is insufficient to show that a Defendant \nreceived federal financial assistance “as a whole,” as required by 29 U.S.C. § 794(b)(3)(A)(i).  No. 1:21- CV-23604, 2022 WL 4345136, at *4 (S.D. Fla. Sept. 7, 2022), report and recommendation \nadopted, No. 21- 23604- CIV, 2022 WL 4310972 (S .D. Fla. Sept. 19, 2022).  Ariza  depended  on \nthe Senate Report to inform its understanding of the definition of “federal financial assistance extended to such corporation . . . as a whole.”   Similarly, Plaintiff relies on Fernandez v. Bruno \nNorthfleet, Inc . to argue that any doubt which the Court has as to whether PPP funds are “Federal \nfinancial assistance” should be determined based on evidence from discovery.  568 F. Supp. 3d 1294, 1300 (S.D. Fla. 2021) (denying a motion to dismiss a claim under the RA because whether PPP loans are sufficient for purposes of Section 504 is a question better addressed through discovery) . \nThe parties’  arguments and § 794(b)(3)(A)(i), however, are irrelevant to the dispute at \nhand.  Ariza  focused on the phrase “as a whole” in § 794(b)(3)(A)(i) because the Defendant there \nwas a “corporation that owns and operates a retail apparel and accessory store[,] and therefore fell under § 794(b)(3)(A)(i) , not § 794(b)(3)(A)(i i).  2022 WL 4345136, at *4.  Likewise, in Fernandez , \nDefendant was a “corporation that owns and operates retail stores selling bracelets, handbags, shoes, and jewelry [.]” 568 F. Supp. 3d at  1298.  Larkin, however, is a private university that \nprovides Doctoral Pharmaceutical degrees, and thus is not subject to § 794(b)(3)(A)(i ), but rather \nfalls under § 794(b)(3)(A) (ii).  [Compl. ¶ 11].  \n  The parties ignore § 794(b)(3)(A)(i i), which clearly extends the definition of “program \nactivity” to any private organization “w hich is principally engaged in the business of provi ding \neducation [.]”  29 U.S.C. § 794(b)(3)(A)(i i).  Therefore, the limitation under subsection (i) that \nFederal financial assistance must be extended to the organization “as a whole” does not apply to Case 1:23-cv-23306-DSL   Document 53   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/22/2024   Page 22 of 2423 \n those organizations which are considered “programs or ac tivities” under subsection (ii).  Larkin is \na private university which is in the business of providing education, and thus, whether Larkin uses \nfederal financial assistance “as a whole,” or not has no bearing on whether its receipt of PPP funds subject s it to the RA.  The Senate Report only discusses Federal financial assistance extended “as \na whole” and thus, even if this Court were open to considering legislative history, it would not apply here.   \n Next, this Court must determine whether the PPP loans to Larkin should be considered \n“Federal financial assistance” under § 794(a), based on the ordinary and plain meaning of the term.  PPP loans “provide[d] small businesses with funds to pay up to 8 weeks of payroll costs including benefits” during the COVID -19 crisis and were “fully forgiven when used for payroll costs, interest \non mortgages, rent, and utilities[.]”  Small Business Paycheck Protection Program, U.S. Department of Treasury, available at https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/PPP%20--%20Overview.pdf  (accessed July 2, 2024).  In effect, PPP funds were transfers from the federal \ntreasury to businesses to assist with the severe economic fallout  resulting  from  the COVID- 19 \ncrisis.  Based on an ordinary reading of “Federal financial assistance,” money given from the Federal government to help organizations weather the economic fallout of the pandemic certainly constitutes “Federal financial assistance.”  Therefo re, Larkin is a “program or activity” that \nreceived “Federal financial assistance” and is subject to the R A.   \nHaving determined that  Larkin is subject to the RA, the Plaintiff still must state a claim \nunder the Act to survive this Motion to Dismiss.  \n Does Plaintiff State a Discrimination Claim Under the Rehabilitation Act?  \n The standard to state a discrimination claim under the RA  is the same used for ADA \ndiscrimination: to establish a prima facie case, “the plaintiff must demonstrate that [s]he (1) is Case 1:23-cv-23306-DSL   Document 53   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/22/2024   Page 23 of 2424 \n \ndisabled, (2) is a qualified individual, and (3) was subjected to unlawful discrimination because of \n[her] disability.”  J.A.M., 646 F. App’x at 926; Doe v. Univ. of Miami , 446 F. Supp. 3d 1000, 1010 \n(S.D. Fla. 2020) .  \nBecause the standard for claims brought  under ADA discrimination and RA  discrimination \nare identical , this Court relies on its analysis in for Count II  and determines that Mazile has pleaded \ninsufficient facts to show that Larkin discriminated against her because of  her disabilities, even \nwhen taking all facts in the Amended Complaint as true.  Therefore, Count VII is  DISMISSED  \nwithout prejudice . \nIV. CONCLUSION \nFor the reasons stated above, it is ORDERED AND ADJUDGED Defendants’ Motion to \nCompel Arbitration or, in the Alternative, Motion to Dismiss Amended Complaint [ ECF No. 34] \nis GRANTED.    \nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Counts IV, V, and VI against Defendant ExamSoft \nmust be heard in binding arbitration.  Arbitration of these three counts is compelled.    \nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Count I is D ISMISSED with prejudice, and Counts II, \nIII, and VII are DISMISSED without prejudice.

    "summary": "1. **Summary:**\n   Plaintiff Thierry Rignol, an MBA student at Yale School of Management, used generative AI in violation of exam rules, leading to an investigation by the Honor Committee. Despite Rignol's denial and failure to cooperate by not providing requested documents, the Committee found that he had used AI and imposed a penalty of an \"F\" and a one-year suspension. Rignol sought a preliminary injunction to avoid irreparable harm from suspension and to continue his studies, but the court denied the motion due to a lack of evidence of such harm.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue:**\n   The central legal issue is whether Rignol demonstrated a likelihood of irreparable harm that justifies a preliminary injunction against the disciplinary actions imposed by Yale University.\n\n3. **Court's Holding:**\n   The court held that Rignol failed to demonstrate irreparable harm that would justify granting a preliminary injunction. Consequently, his motion for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction was denied.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation:**\n   Imagine you broke your school's rules during an important test by using a robot to get answers — you weren't supposed to do that! When the school found out, they told you that you would have to leave school for a year and get a failing grade for that test. You asked a judge to let you stay in school and not have a failing grade right away, while your fight with the school happened in court. But the judge said \"no\" because you didn't prove that being out of school would harm you in a way that couldn’t be fixed later.",

After a teaching assistant flagged one of his exams in the spring of 2024, SOM \nadministrators conducted an investigation to determine whether Rignol violated examination \nrules by using generative artificial intelligence (“AI”). In the course of its investigation, \nSOM  determined  that Rignol  was not forthcoming during the investigation and did use AI ; \nSOM penalized Rignol by issuing him an F in the course and suspending him from classes \nfor one year.  \nRignol subsequently sought  a preliminary injunction that would reinstate him as a \nstudent in good standing at SOM such that he could graduate with his classmates in the class \nof 2025 this spring. Because I conclude that Rignol has failed to make the threshold showing of irreparable harm, I deny Rignol’s motion for a preliminary injunction.

The C ommittee chair conducts an \ninitial review to determine if the offense “would be of sufficient seriousness to warrant the \nattention of the committee.” If the chair determines the conduct is sufficiently serious, they \nmust notify the student and advise the student of how the Honor Committee will conduct its \ninvestigation. Id.  at 9, 10. The Bulletin requires the following be communicated to the \nstudent:  \n[T]he student will be directed to review the Committee Policies and Procedures \nto apprise the student of the rights:  (a) to appear before the committee, (b) to be \naccompanied by any member of the university community to act as the student’s adviser,\n2 (c) to examine any and all written materials being provided to the \ncommittee as soon as possible, and ordinarily at least forty- eight hours in \nadvance of the meeting, so that the student may have ample opportunity to \nquestion or refute them.  \nId. at 9.  The Honor Committee will notify the student of the membership of the C ommittee \nso that the student may request recusals of members the student believes to be “ prejudiced ” \nagainst them. Id.  at 11. The chair may accept or refuse a student’s request to recuse a \nCommittee member.

First, a student may meet with the dean responsible for \noverseeing their academic program to lodge  complaints regarding “procedural irregularity or \nprejudice.” The dean must  then “investigate the objection and may remand the matter to the \ncommittee to correct the procedural irregularity or to re -deliberate after disqualifying the \nmember or members found to be prejudiced.” Id.

Until now, Wendy and Dean Scully have told me that this matter \nhas not been formally referred to the Honor Committee. Further, I was told that \nyou had already received a copy of the submitted exam. I am of course happy \nto comply with the SOM policies at all times.  \nId. Choi responded:  \nThe first step in the process is for the chair of the Honor Committee to make a \ndetermination of whether the case will proceed to the Honor Committee. This \ncan involve some gathering of evidence. That is where we are right now. I have \nthe PDF file that you submitted. I am asking you to send us the Word file from \nwhich the PDF was produced. You seem to be weighing whether you will \ncooperate or not. It’s your choice, but if history is a guide, failure to cooperate \nwould be viewed by the Honor Committee as an extraordinary violation of the \nHonor Code.  \nId. Later that same day, Choi wrote to Rignol to inform Rignol that he had expanded his \ninvestigation to consider “deliverables you submitted for other courses.”  Defs.’ Ex. R , ECF \nNo. 41- 19.

Id.  Case 3:25-cv-00159-SFR     Document 89     Filed 05/05/25     Page 7 of 268 After this initial investigation, Choi referred Rignol to the full Honor Committee. Id. ¶ \n15. Choi relied in part on the many similarities between Rignol’s answers to exam questions \nand those produced when Choi submitted exam questions to ChatGPT. Id.  Choi felt that \nRignol’s refusal to provide requested documents provided further grounds to suspect Rignol \ncheated on the exams. Id. \nTsung wrote to Rignol on September 8, 2024, notifying him that Choi had referred an \ninquiry to the full Honor Committee. Defs.’ Ex. W at 2- 3, ECF No. 41- 24. Tsung noted that \nthe Committee would investigate whether Rignol “improperly utilized AI on the final exam \nin the course.” Id. at 3.  Tsung told Rignol that he was required to attend a meeting with the \nHonor Committee, directed  Rignol to consult the  Bulletin for a description of how the \nCommittee would conduct its activities, and shared a link for where Rignol could find a \ndirectory of Committee members should he decide to seek recusals.

Tsung asked that, if Rignol sought to provide a written response, Case 3:25-cv-00159-SFR     Document 89     Filed 05/05/25     Page 8 of 269 that he share it with her by October 30 so that she could distribute it to the entire C ommittee. \nId. \nRignol sought recusals beginning on November 3, 2024. In a message copying one of \nhis attorneys, he requested that Scully —the former dean of students and an ex officio  \nmember of the Committee —be recused from participation. Defs.’ Ex. Y. Choi granted this \nrequest. Choi Aff. ¶ 19.

Defs.’ Ex. Z, ECF No. 41- 27. Choi responded, noting that Tsung and Scully disputed Rignol’s recollection of \ntheir meeting , and reiterating that the Committee would follow the procedures described in \nthe Bulletin . Choi informed Rignol that the only proper grounds for seeking recusal was if a \nCommittee member “would be prejudiced in your case.” Id. On  November 5, after Rignol \nasked to recuse every member of the Committee who had reviewed evidence in his case or \nhad participated in the initial review of evidence, Choi declined, saying he felt the  recusal \nrequests  were “baseless .” Given the evidence had been shared with C ommittee members in \nadvance of the hearing that was occurring in three  days , Rignol’s requests would have \nrequired recusing the entire Committee and its chair. Choi Aff. ¶ 19.  \nThe Honor Committee met to consider Rignol’s conduct on November 8, 2024. Id. ¶ \n20. Notwithstanding Tsung’s instruction that Rignol submit any written materials by October \n30, Defs.’ Ex.

At the hearing, Rignol continued to deny that he had used AI \non his exam. Id.  Rignol told Committee members that he had ignored Choi’s emails Case 3:25-cv-00159-SFR     Document 89     Filed 05/05/25     Page 9 of 2610 requesting Microsoft Word copies of his exams because he had written  the exam in Apple \nPages , not Word.

Tsung Aff . ¶ 14. \nRignol produced this document while the Committee was still meeting.  Id. Rignol also \nrequested to be excused from attending class that afternoon. Compl. ¶ 109.  \nAfter Rignol left  the hearing , the Honor Committee began deliberating. Choi says that \nhe and other Honor Committee members found Rignol’s responses to their questions at the hearing  “incredible .” Choi Aff . ¶ 22. In particular, Choi says: “ The Honor Committee was \nstunned by [Rignol ’s] disruptive action of ignoring the request to submit any documents he \nwished us to consider at least twenty-four hours before the meeting, his prior failure to produce the electronic files requested, and his incredible explanation for why he had not \ndone so. It concluded that [Rignol’s] actions were unprecedented.”  Id. ¶ 24. As the \nCommittee deliberated, Choi reviewed the Pages file that Rignol had shared and researched \nwhether the file contained its editing history. Id.  ¶ 25. Choi determined that Pages does not \ntransmit the editing history of a file when the file is shared via email, but that the editing history would be available on the hard drive of the computer used to write the exam. Id.  In \nlight of this, approximately 90 minutes after Rignol had left the hearing , Tsung called Rignol \nto ask that he return with his laptop. Id. ¶ 26.

Choi Aff. ¶ 28. The \ndecision was “based largely on [Rignol’s]  unprecedented refusal to produce the documents it \nhad requested—a decision that . . . the Committee concluded had no justification —and his \nrefusal to return to the Committee.” Id.  It did not reach the issue of whether Rignol had \nindeed used AI on his Sourcing and Managing Funds exam because it determined that \nRignol’s “decision to not be forthcoming had become the primary issue.” Id. ¶ 29.

Tsung \nresponded:  \nI don’t know when the faculty will be meeting this week but like I said, they do \nplan to meet and your grade should be updated next week.

See Defs.’ Ex. \nDD, ECF No. 41- 31. Rignol asserted that he had been forthcoming. Id. at 5. In addition, \nrelying in part on an email from Tsung where she disclosed that there had been only one \nother student penalized in the past three years for not being forthcoming, and this penalty \nwas in connection with a determination that the student had falsified attendance records , \nRignol asserted that his discipline was the first instance where the Honor Committee had \nissued a standalone penalty for not being forthcoming without addressing the merits of the \nunderlying charge . Id. Rignol asserted that “not being forthcoming” has “always been an \nenhancement factor in sentencing, not a basis for the punishment in and of itself.” Id. at 4. He \nmaintained that the penalty in the case “incentivizes students to falsely confess in order to \nreceive a reduced penalty.” Id. at 5.  \nDeputy Dean Jain wrote to Rignol on November 19, 2024, to inform Rignol that the \nFaculty Review Board had denied Rignol’s appeal.

Rignol was not invited to appear again before the Honor Committee. See  Rignol \nDecl. ¶ 24 , Feb. 25, 2025. In this second meeting, the Honor Committee determined that Rignol Case 3:25-cv-00159-SFR     Document 89     Filed 05/05/25     Page 12 of 2613 had violated examination rules by using AI. Choi Aff. ¶ 31. Choi says the Honor Committee \nrelied on Rignol’s decision not to be forthcoming in reaching its decision that he used AI. In \nparticular, “[t]he Honor Committee felt that [Rignol’s]  refusal to provide the documents could \nonly be explained by [Rignol]  attempting to hide misconduct in light of the fact that the only \nalternative explanation [Rignol]  had offered (regarding his use of Pages instead of Mic rosoft \nWord ) was incredible.” Id. ¶ 33. In addition, in concluding that Rignol used AI, the Honor \nCommittee relied on the “strong similarities between [Rignol]’s response and the ChatGPT \nresponse to one of the Sourcing and Managing Funds exam questions.”  Id. ¶ 34. Choi says that \nthe Honor Committee did not rely on the ChatGPTZero scans produced by Rouwenhorst. Id. \n¶ 32. The Honor Committee reached this decision only with regard to Rignol’s exam in \nSourcing and Managing Funds. Although Choi and Committee members suspected Rignol may also have used AI in completing his exam in the Investor course, “it could not rule out t he \npossibility that the responses at issue were found via permissible Internet searches instead of \nimpermissible AI generation.” Id. ¶ 35. The Honor Committee determined that an appropriate \npenalty would be a mandatory “F” grade in Sourcing and Managing Funds. Id.  ¶ 31. \nRignol appea led this penalty to the Faculty Review Board on December 2, 2024. \nDefs.’ Ex. CC, ECF No. 41- 30. In his appeal, he challenged the ability of the Faculty Review \nBoard to remand his case to the Honor Committee to reach a decision on whether he violated \nexam rules. Id. at 5. Jain responded on behalf of the Faculty Review Board on December 11, \n2024. Defs.’ Ex. GG, ECF No. 41- 34. Jain  informed Rignol that his appeal was denied and \naddressed Rignol’s contention that the Faculty Review Board exceeded its authority in the \nway it handled his firs t appe al. Id.  Jain noted:  Case 3:25-cv-00159-SFR     Document 89     Filed 05/05/25     Page 13 of 2614 Your appeal statement included the claim that the FRB “exceeded the scope of \nits authority” by directing the Honor Committee to continue deliberating and \n“issue findings regarding a new charge ” (emphasis added). I wish to point out \nthat this claim is entirely erroneous. My letter of November 19, 2024 made it \nclear that it was my decision as the cognizant dean, and not the FRB’s, to ask \nthe Honor Committee to continue deliberating the original c omplaint of \nviolation of exam rules, a complaint on which the Honor Committee did not \nreach a decision in its first hearing. This directive to the Honor Committee is \nfully within my authority and responsibility as the cognizant dean. Moreover, \nthis directive did not issue a new charge to the Honor Committee. The only \ncharge the Honor Committee considered in its continued deliberation, and \nissued a ruling on, was the original charge of violating the exam rules in MGT \n423E.  \nId.  \nTsung wrote to Rignol on December 12, 2024, to inform him of the terms of his \nsuspension. Defs.’ Ex. HH, ECF No. 41- 35. Tsung’s letter notes that Rignol ’s suspension \nbegan on November 20, 2024. Id.

Tsung informed Rignol that his “suspension will be noted on your transcript while you are on leave and will be removed at your request when you \nreturn.” Id. In closing, Tsung reminded Rignol of the courses he would need to complete in \norder to meet the requirements  for graduation. See id.   \nAt the time of his suspension in November 2024, Rignol had started but not \ncompleted two courses. These courses ended on January 10, 2025. Rignol was withdrawn \nfrom two other courses that started after his suspension began. These courses ended on \nFebruary 8, 2025.

As the standard for a TRO is \nidentical to that for a preliminary injunction , Kreger v. McCance, 537 F. Supp. 3d 234, 239 (D. \nConn. 2021) , my opinion addressi ng Rignol’s entitlement to a preliminary injunction also resolves \nwhether he is entitled to a TRO.  Case 3:25-cv-00159-SFR     Document 89     Filed 05/05/25     Page 16 of 2617 to their anticipated argument that the equities did not favor Rignol because he had in fact \ncheated on his exam . ECF No. 25. Rignol filed a response on March 12, 2025. ECF No. 45. \nAfter hearing argument, the C ourt7 granted in part the motion to compel  on March 19, 2025, \nand required compliance with the order by March 28, 2025. ECF No. 54. I permitted both \nparties to file any supplemental evidence relating to the preliminary injunction motion by \nApril 9, 2025. ECF No. 71. On April 9, 2025, Defendants fi led two supplemental exhibits \nthey assert demonstrate Rignol’s violation of examination rules. ECF Nos. 80, 81.  \nThe parties twice confirmed that they did not request an evidentiary hearing \nconcerning the preliminary injunction. On March 7, 2025, the parties submitted a joint notice \nof their availability for oral argument that stipulated they did not seek an evidenti ary hearing. \nECF No. 32. The parties reiterated that position in response to my questions at a pre -hearing \nstatus conference on April 3, 2025. ECF No. 61. After setting  oral argument for April 7, \n2025, I postponed argument at the request of the parties so they could explore settlement. \nECF No s. 67, 78.8 The parties did not settle, so I heard oral argument on April 11, 2025. ECF \nNo. 83.9  \n \n7 The Honorable Thomas Farrish, United States Magistrate Judge, decided the motion to compel  \non an expedited basis . See ECF No. 26, Order of Referral. I thank Judge Farrish for his prompt \ndecision.  \n8 Settlement talks were convened by the Honorable Robert Spector, United States Magistrate \nJudge. I offer my thanks to  Judge Spector for his efforts  to mediate this dispute, as well as to the \nparties for attempting in good faith to resolve their differences . As I noted at oral argument, the \ndecision to explore settlement has no bearing on how I decide the matter before me, nor do I know  \nwhat positions the parties may have taken during confidential settlement talks.  \n9 At oral argument, Rignol’ s counsel clarified that  his request for a preliminary injunction was \nlimited to his contractual claims. Tr. 15:5- 7, ECF No. 82. Case 3:25-cv-00159-SFR     Document 89     Filed 05/05/25     Page 17 of 2622 the merits of the case . Furthermore , I reject Rignol’s assertion that  a preliminary injunction is \nnecessary to prevent the damage to his professional reputation he says would occur if \ninvestors, business associates , or classmates  realized that  SOM determined he violated \nexamination rules . A preliminary injunction is not an exoneration, and it would not remedy \nthe fact that this lawsuit  describing Rignol’s disciplinary record  is public record .12  \nRignol’s remaining arguments are unavailing. Rignol says his aspirations to pursue \ngraduate studies at another institution will be frustrated during  the pendency of this litigation \nbecause no institution will accept an applicant whose transcript discloses academic misconduct . Here again Rignol errs in assuming that if he were granted a preliminary \ninjunction it necessarily follows that graduate schools would not learn of the disciplinary proceedings  described in these public filings. Nor has Rignol  articulate d any  concrete or \nimmediate plan to pursue graduate studies. Thus, the harms to his aspirations of postgraduate \nstudies are too speculative to entitle Rignol to a preliminary injunction . See  Doe v. Vassar \nColl., No. 19- cv-9601 (NSR), 2019 WL 6222918, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 21, 2019)  \n(“Plaintiff’s broad assertion that he will be harmed by having to explain his suspension to \nemployers or graduate schools is too speculative to warrant injunctive relief, since he has \nidentified no plans to attend any graduate school . . . .”).  Similarly, while Rignol asserts that \n \n12 In his Complaint, Rignol seeks a declaratory judgment declaring , inter alia, that the “sanction \nof a grade of ‘F’ and suspension for one year should be reversed,” his disciplinary  record expunged, \nand any “record of the proceeding regarding the conduct of Plaintiff  is to be permanently \ndestroyed.” Rignol’s entitlement to a declaratory judgment will await a final adjudication in the \ncase. Notably, Rignol’s attorneys insisted repeatedly that whether Rignol violated examination \nrules by using AI is not relevant to the merits of his claims. See, e.g., Reply 4- 5 (asserting that \n“whether Plaintiff used AI is not relevant here”).  Neither  Rignol’s Complai nt nor his request for a \npreliminary injunction seek to prevent Defendants from convening the Honor Committee again  to \nconsider Rignol’s  conduct using the procedural protections to which he says he was entitled and \ndenied.  Case 3:25-cv-00159-SFR     Document 89     Filed 05/05/25     Page 22 of 2623 the suspension will undermine  valuable  relationships he has cultivated  with his classmates in \nthe EMBA class of 2025 and cause him to forfeit the one -time honor of serving as class \nmarshal at graduation, I find that those harms— which broadly assert that SOM has \ndiminished the value of Rignol’s degree —are compensable with money damages.13 \nMontague , 2017 WL 4942772, at *3- 4 (holding that not graduating with one’s fellow \nclassmates was a harm compensable with money damages); see also Doe v. Vassar, 2019 \nWL 6222918, at * 6-7 (similar) . \n Finally, Rignol asserts that, “with immigration policies constantly shifting,” the \ninvestor visa that entitles him  to live and work in the United States could be revoked if \nimmigration officials learned that Rignol took three years to complete a two -year course of \nstudy because of a finding of academic misconduct. Pl.’s  Mem. 13. I agree with Defendants \nthat any immigration consequences of Rignol’s suspension are too speculative to entitle him \nto a preliminary injunction. The lawsuit has publicly  disclosed Rignol’s disciplinary record. \nA preliminary injunction requiring Defendants to accommodate Rignol’s  graduation this \nspring would not exonerate Rignol nor prevent public disclosure of his discipline.  \n \n13 At oral argument, Defendants further asserted that, should Rignol return to SOM following his \nsuspension, he is eligible to compete with members of the class of 2026 for the honor of being \nclass marshal . Tr. 60:11 -14. This further supports my finding that forfeiting the honor of being \nclass marshal at graduation in spring 2025 is not an irreparable harm.  Moreover , Rignol’s claim \nthat he would be class marshal if I were to order  Defendants to reinstate him  and remove the F \ngrade for the Sourcing and Managing Funds  course  is speculative. The class marshal honor is \nawarded based on grades received for  certain first year classes, including Sourcing and Managing \nFunds . Tsung Aff. ¶ 35; Rignol  Decl. ¶ 8, Feb. 25, 2025. I do not know what grade  Rignol would \nreceive in the course were his exam  to be graded by his professors , and thus do not  know whether \nRignol  would indeed be entitled to the class marshal honor should he  otherwise manage to satisfy  \nthe requirements for graduation. Id.  Case 3:25-cv-00159-SFR     Document 89     Filed 05/05/25     Page 23 of 2624 I therefore conclude that R ignol has not met his burden of establishing he would be \nirreparably harmed absent a preliminary injunction.  \nB. Equities  \nSince I have concluded that Rignol has failed to show irreparable harm, I need not \nconsider  the other requirements  for issuing a preliminary injunction . Inkel v. Connecticut , \nNo. 3:17 -cv-1400 (MPS), 2019 WL 1230358, at *10 (D. Conn. Mar. 15, 2019) (stating that \nwhere “a plaintiff does not establish irreparable harm, the court need not address the other \nfactors necessary for the issuance of injunctive relief”) (internal quotation marks omit ted). \nHowever, I observe that the balance of equities  does not favor Rignol . \n“Courts ‘must balance the competing claims of injury and must consider the effect on \neach party of the granting or withholding of the re quested relief. ’” Winter , 555 U.S. at 24 \n(quoting Amoco Prod. Co . v. Gam bell, 480 U.S. 531, 542 (1987)). I understand that Rignol \nhas been under considerable stress since he was first accused of academic misconduct, and \nthat he has much to lose from delaying graduation. And I acknowledge Rignol’s apparent \nreadiness to complete all the assignments he has missed in order to graduate with his peers this spring. Rignol  Supp. Decl. ¶¶ 10 -11, Feb. 28, 2025, ECF No. 24. But at the same time, \nan injunction requiring Defendants to permit Rignol to graduate this spring would require \nDefendants to “fundamentally alter the Program.” Tsung Aff. ¶ 32.  \nThe parties dispute whether granting an injunction would entail significant hardship \nto Defendants. Rignol maintains this is an insignificant burden. See Tr. 47:4 -6 (“We’re \ntalking about watching some videos and maybe doing a couple of assignments to make up \nfor some lectures that weren ’t recorded.”). But I find Defendants’ description of the manner \nin which the EMBA program would need to be modified, as well as the hardships faced by Case 3:25-cv-00159-SFR     Document 89     Filed 05/05/25     Page 24 of 2625 administrators and instructors, far more persuasive than Rignol’s assertion that he could \nsubstitute five months of missed graduate instruction for recorded class lectures and make -up \nessays. Tsung explains that “attendance, participation, and group work through Learning \nTeams and otherwise  are core components of the Program” and “[c]lass participation  and \ngroup work are commonly components of student grades.” Tsung Aff. ¶ 31. Tsung observes \nthat adding Rignol to classes underwa y or not even being offered would “dilute the rigor of \nthe classes and require the diversion of substantial time and energy by professors and, with \nrespect to ongoing classes, other students away from their current endeavors.” Id. ¶ 32. I \ncredit Defendants’ assertion that an injunction would place an extraordinary burden on \nRignol’s professors and teaching assistants, who would be responsible for devoting a \nsubstantial amount of time to helping Rignol remediate coursework in classes he has missed.  \nThese hardships were only exacerbated by Rignol’s decision to wait until February \n25, 2025— more than three  months after his suspension began and more than two months \nafter his final appeal to administrators was denied —to apply for injunctive relief . Rignol \nretained counsel as early as September 9, 2024, when he copied several attorneys, one of whom has noticed an appearance in this case, in an email to Tsung and Choi. Defs.’ Ex. W at \n2. Counsel explained at oral argument that the delay is attributable in part to several medical \nemergencies faced by members of Rignol’s legal team. Tr. 81:5- 11. But while  I appreciate \nthat no one can control such occurrences , I cannot ignore the fact that the difficulty of \naccommodating Rignol’s request for an injunction is far higher now than it would have been \nhad Rignol moved for an injunction in December 2024. Indeed, even had I issued an \ninjunction the  day that  Rignol made his request  (and without affording the parties the \nbriefing and argument that they requested ), the balance of equities  would still have favored  Case 3:25-cv-00159-SFR     Document 89     Filed 05/05/25     Page 25 of 2626 Defendants. By February 25, 2025, Rign ol had already missed  four courses entirely  (which \nended in January and February 2025) and  had missed sessions of five  more courses \nunderway . Tsung Aff. ¶¶ 20-26 & Ex. 3. Thus even on that earlier date , accommodating \nRignol would have imposed a substantial hardship on Defendants.  \nI therefore conclude that the equities do not favor an injunction. \nIV. CONCLUSION  \nFor the foregoing reasons, Rignol’s application for a temporary restraining order and \npreliminary injunction , ECF No. 16, is DENIED.  \nThe parties shall confer and submit a Rule 26(f) report describing case management \ndeadlines for the remainder of this action on or before May 19, 2025. \nSO ORDERED.  \n \n \nBridgeport , Connecticut \nMay 5, 2025  \n/s/Sarah F.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: This case involves W.A., a student with a specific learning disability, and his parents who claimed that the Clarksville/Montgomery County School System (CMCSS) failed to provide a free appropriate public education (FAPE) under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). The court upheld an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) decision that CMCSS did not adequately address W.A.'s reading and writing difficulties, particularly his dyslexia, by focusing on fluency and expression rather than foundational reading skills. The ALJ awarded compensatory dyslexia-specific tutoring, which the court orders must be implemented promptly.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether CMCSS failed to provide W.A. with a FAPE as required by IDEA by not adequately addressing his specific learning needs related to dyslexia.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court affirmed that CMCSS denied W.A. a FAPE by failing to focus on his basic reading skill deficits and ordered 888 hours of compensatory dyslexia-specific education. However, it declined to mandate a specific vendor for the tutoring, as long as the education meets the necessary requirements.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: A student named W.A. was not learning how to read because his school was not giving him the right kind of help he needed. Even though they knew he was struggling, his teachers only helped with some parts of reading that weren’t the real problem. The judge decided that the school must now give W.A. a lot of extra special lessons that focus on the parts of reading he struggles with.",

The  IDEA and the Say Dyslexia Act  \nThe Individuals with Disabilities Education Act ( “IDEA ”), 20 U.S.C. § 1400 et seq. , \n“offers federal funds to States in exchange for a commitment: to furnish a ‘ free appropriate public \neducation ’—more concisely known as a FAPE —to all children with certain physic al or intellectual \ndisabilities. ” Fry v. Napoleon Cmty. Sch., 137 S. Ct. 743, 748 (2017)  (citing 20 U.S.C. §§ \n1401(3)(A)(i),  1412(a)(1)(A)) . “[T]he IDEA gives the ‘ primary responsibility . . .  for choosing the \neducational method most suitable to the child ’s needs  . . . to state and local educational agencies ”—\ncommonly referred to as “ SEAs ” and “LEAs ”—which work  “in cooperation with the parents or \nguardian of the child.”  Long v. Dawson Springs Indep. Sch. Dist., 197 F. App’ x 427, 433–34 (6th \nCir. 2006)  (quoting Bd. of Ed uc. of Hendrick Hudson Cent . Sch. Dist. v. Rowley , 458 U.S. 176, \n207 (1982) ).  \nThe IDEA defines “ FAPE ” to include “both ‘special education ’ and ‘related services. ’ \n‘Special education ’ is ‘specially designed instruction . . . to meet the unique needs of a child with \na disability ’; ‘related services ’ are the support services ‘ required to assist a child  . . . to benefit \nfrom ’ that instruction. ” Endrew F. ex rel. Joseph F. v. Douglas Cty. Sch. Dist. RE -1, 580 U.S. 386, \n390 (2017)  (quoting 20 U.S.C. § 1401(9) , (26), (29)) . Special education and related services must \nmeet four  general  requirements before they can be said to qualify as  providing a child with  a FAPE. \nSee 20 U.S.C. § 1401(9) . The first three of those requirements are that the education and services \n“must be provided at public expense, must meet the State ’s educational standards, [and] must \napproximate the grade levels used in the State ’s regular education.”  Rowley , 458 U.S. a t 203. The \nfourth requirement —identified by the Supreme Court as the “ centerpiece of the statute’ s education \ndelivery system for disabled children,”  Honig v. Doe , 484 U.S. 305, 311 (1988) —is that the child ’s \nCase 3:23-cv-00912     Document 27     Filed 05/24/24     Page 2 of 30 PageID #: <pageID>3 \n education must be “ provided in conformity with t he individualized education program  [‘IEP’]” \nresponsive to that child’s disability and circumstances. 20 U.S.C. §§ 1401(9) (D), 1414(d) . The IEP \nrequirement provides  “the means by which special education and related services are ‘ tailored to \nthe unique needs ’ of [that]  particular child. ” Endrew F. , 580 U.S. at 391 (quoting Rowley, 458 U.S. \nat 181).  \nThat IEP requirement, with its focus on individualization, recognizes  that what constitutes  \na FAPE may vary from child to child. The other FAPE requir ements, however, leave room for \nanother type of variation—based not solely on the needs of the child at issue , but also on the policy \nbaseline set by the relevant state’s educational system . The Sixth Circuit has held that, because the \nIDEA requires a FAPE to meet state educational standard s, a school district that otherwise  \n“complies with federal law, . . .  may still violate the [ IDEA]  if it fails to satisfy more extensive \nstate protections that may also be in place. ” Doe ex rel.  Doe v. Bd. of Educ. of Tullahoma City \nSch., 9 F.3d 455, 457 (6th Cir. 1993)  (quoting Thomas v. Cincinnati Bd. of Educ., 918 F.2d 618, \n620 (6th Cir. 1990);  citing  David D. v. Dartmouth Sch. Comm., 775 F.2d 411, 417 (1st Cir. 1985) ; \nGeis v. Board of Educ. of Parsippany -Troy Hills , 774 F.2d 575, 581 (3r d Cir. 1985) ). For example, \nTennessee has enacted specific legislation , the Special Education Behavioral Supports Act \n(“SEBSA”), Tenn. Code Ann. § 49 -10-1301 to - 1307, to govern  the use of restraints and isolation \nin the special education setting. Based on the IDEA’s assimilation of state standards, federal  courts \nhave held that a violation of SEBSA can also give rise to a violation of the IDEA. See, e.g., I.L. ex \nrel. Taylor v. Knox Cty. Bd. of Educ.,  257 F. Supp. 3d 946, 964 (E.D. Tenn. 2017) ; accord J.M. ex \nrel. Mata v. Tennessee Dep ’t of Educ ., 358 F. Supp. 3d 736, 744–47 (M.D. Tenn. 2018) . \nIn 2016, the Tenness ee General Assembly enacted, and the Governor signed, a piece of \nlegislation sometimes referred to as the “ Say Dyslexia Act ,” 2016 Tenn. Pub. Laws  ch. 1058 (S.B. \nCase 3:23-cv-00912     Document 27     Filed 05/24/24     Page 3 of 30 PageID #: <pageID>4 \n 2635) , codified, as amended, Tenn. Code Ann. § 49- 1-229. The Say Dyslexia Act directs the \nTennessee Department of Education ( “TDOE ”) to “ develop procedures for identifying \ncharacteristics of dyslexia through the universal screening process required by”  the state’ s \npreexisting “Response to Instruction and Intervention ” framework, which is often referred to as \n“RTI2.” Tenn. Code Ann. § 49- 1-229(a), (f)(2). “RTI2 is an ‘ academic three- tiered framework ’” \nthat calls on educators  “to intervene when students first start to struggle and to subsequently \naddress deficits in student learning so that students can avoid prolonged academic difficulties.”  \nMatthew B. ex rel. G.F. v. Clarksville Montgomery  Cnty. Sch. Sys., No. 3:22 -CV-00675, 2023 WL \n4633905, at *13 n.18 (M.D. Tenn. July 19, 2023)  (quoting TDOE materials) . The RTI2 framework \nis intended to assist any students in need of intervention, including students receiving a general \neducation who do not have any IDEA -covered disability. See Tenn. Code Ann. § 49- 6-311.  \nThe dyslexia screening required  by the Say Dyslexia Act is  mandatory for all Tennessee \nLEAs. Tenn. Code Ann. § 49- 1-229(a)(3).  If a student is found, by that process, to have \n“characteristics of dyslexia, ” then the LEA must:  \n(1) Notify the student ’s parent or legal guardian;  \n \n(2) Provide the student ’s parent or legal guardian with information and resource \nmaterial regarding dyslexia;  \n \n(3) Provide the student with appropriate tiered dyslexia -specific intervention \nthrough its RTI2 framework; and  \n \n(4) Monitor the student ’s progress using a tool designed to measure the \neffectiveness of the intervention. \n \nTenn. Code Ann. § 49- 1-229(c). The Act defines “ dyslexia -specific intervention”  as follows:  \n“Dyslexia -specific intervention ” means evidence- based, specialized reading, \nwriting, and spelling instruction tha t is multisensory in nature, equipping students \nto simultaneously use multiple senses, such as vision, hearing, touch, and \nmovement. Dyslexia -specific intervention employs direct instruction of systematic \nand cumulative content, with the sequence beginning with the easiest and most \nCase 3:23-cv-00912     Document 27     Filed 05/24/24     Page 4 of 30 PageID #: <pageID>5 \n basic elements and progress methodically to more difficult material. Each step must \nalso be based on those already learned. Components of dyslexia -specific \nintervention include instruction targeting phonological awareness, sound symbol association, syllable structure, morphology, syntax, and semantics  . . . .  \n \nTenn. Code Ann. § 49- 1-229(f)(1).  TDOE’s regulations implementing the Say Dyslexia Act \nrequire individualized, dyslexia -focused learning plans for students identified as dyslexic, but they \nexempt students with IEPs under the IDEA from that requirement. Tenn. Comp. R. & Regs. 0520-\n01-22-.02(f). Neither the Act nor the regulations, however, expressly exempt IDEA -eligible \nstudents from any other aspect of the Say Dyslexia Act’s framework.  \nB. W.A.’ s Education  and IEPs  \n W.A. is a CMCS S student who was in 12th grade for the 2023–2024 school year. \n(Administrative Record ( “A.R. ”), Vol. 1 at 396.2) W.A. and his parents —E.A. and C.A.—moved \nto Clarksville around the time of the 2016–17 school year , when he was in fifth grade . (Id. at 381.)  \nCMCSS, as a school system covered by the IDEA, has an obligation to take appropriate steps to \nidentify students with disabilities pursuant to what is typically referred to as the IDEA ’s “child \nfind” obligation. See 20 U.S.C. § 1412(a)(3); Bd. of Educ . of Fayette Cnty., Ky. v. L.M., 478 F.3d \n307, 313 (6th Cir. 2007) . CMCSS ’s initial evaluation of W.A. showed  significant deficits in \nreading and writing, and W.A. was identified as having an IDEA -covered learning disability, \nalthough he was not identified specifically as being dyslexic or potentially so. (A.R., Vol. 1  at \n381.)  \nW.A.’s  2016–17 IEP identifie d his “Primary Disability ” as a “ Specific Learning \nDisability, ” with a “Secondary Disability ” of “Language Impairments. ” (A.R., Vol. 2 at 683.)  The \n \n2 Although each party disagrees with aspects of the ALJ’ s analysis and conclusions in this case, they mostly \naccept the ALJ ’s account of the foundational facts. The court will, therefore, cite the ALJ ’s findi ngs for \nsome background facts. The court ’s conclusions, however, are based on the administrative record as a \nwhole.  \nCase 3:23-cv-00912     Document 27     Filed 05/24/24     Page 5 of 30 PageID #: <pageID>6 \n IEP set language- related goals for W.A., granted him some accommodations (such as additional \ntime for test taking), and established that he was to receive ninety minutes of speech/language \ntherapy per week with a speech pathologist, as well as a combined s ix hours per week of \ninterventional instruction with a special education resource teacher, consisting of two hours devoted to “ Reading Intervention,”  two hours devoted to “ Writing Intervention,”  and two hours \ndevoted to “ Math Intervention.”  (Id. at 689–96.) At the time that the IEP was formulated, W.A. \nwas capable of writing about 40 words per minute in response to a writing prompt, with an average of 28 words spelled correctly. The average fifth grader, according to the IEP, could write about 51 words per minute, spelling 48 correctly. ( Id. at 686.)  The IEP acknowledged that W.A. faced issues \nnot only with more advanced areas such as “Reading Fluency” and “Written Expression,” but also “Basic Reading Skills.” ( Id. at 684–85.)  \nW.A. ’s subsequent middle school  IEPs were  broadly similar  in terms of the services \nprovided, at least on their face. He continued to exhibit significant language deficits —for example, \ntesting in the 1st percentile of metrics measuring reading fluency and the 10th percentile for written. ( Id. at 70 4–05.) The IEPs ’ identifications of his deficits, however, began to omit any \nacknowledgment of a specific deficit related to basic reading skills, while continuing to note his deficits in fluency and comprehension. ( Id. at 703–10, 723, 726–30, 741, 744–46.)  \n W.A. ’s 2020–21 ninth grade IEP continued the approach of focusing on fluency and \nexpression, rather than foundational skills . (Id. at 776–87.) The special education teacher assigned \nto W.A., however, quickly became what she described, in an email exchange with  a school \npsychologist, as “ very concerned ” about W.A. In one  internal email, the teacher stated bluntly that \n“[t]his kid can’ t read. ” (A.R., Vol. 1 at 387–88, A.R., Vol. 2 at 812.) Over the course of the year, \nCase 3:23-cv-00912     Document 27     Filed 05/24/24     Page 6 of 30 PageID #: <pageID>7 \n W.A. ’s grades varied significantly . W.A. received F grades on multiple assessments, but he also, \nat times, received As, and he ultimately advanced to tenth grade. ( A.R., Vol. 1 at 388.)   \nW.A. ’s 2021–22 tenth grade IEP continued  the same general approach , supplemented with \nthe “transitional”  supports that become available to students as the y approach the point at which \nthey will transition out of the age for secondary schooling. ( A.R., Vol. 2 at 823–33.)  The IEP \ncontinued to f ocus on fluency and expression, rather than basic skills, and included no express \nreference to dyslexia. ( Id. at 823–33.)  \n In the eleventh grade, however, a teacher again developed concerns that W.A. ’s reading \nproblems went beyond the  deficits reflected in the IEP. The teacher , Bethanie Hargett -Slack,  told \nW.A. ’s mother that, in her view, W.A. could not read. The two discussed the possibility of having \ndyslexia screening performed on W.A. W.A.’s mother  identified this conversation as the first time \nshe learned that W.A.’s disabilities might include dyslexia. ( A.R., Vol. 1 at 390; A.R., Vol. 2 at \n434, 582.)   \nW.A. ’s 2022–23 IEP, however, continued to identify W.A. only as having a “ Specific \nLearning Disab ility” with deficits in “ Reading Fluency”  and “Written Expression ” and continued \nthe same general approach to providing accommodations and support. ( Id. at 840, 848–49.)   \n W.A. ’s grades  remained  mixed. One potential reason for that is that, when W.A. performed \ntake- home assignments, he used a system of interrelated technological supports that enabled him \nto bypass the conventional writing process . The administrative law judge (“ ALJ”) who consider ed \nthis case provided an example of how W.A. ’s system worked:  \nW.A. can speak the words of a topic such as “George  Washington”  into a Word \ndocument by using speech to text software. He can then paste that  written word, \n“George Washington,”  into an artificial intelligence bot, such as “ Chat GPT. ” . . . . \nThe artificial intelligence bot can create a paper about the subject matter, here  \nGeorge Washington, that W.A. can highlight and paste back into a Word document. \nW.A. can  then run the Word document through another software program, \nCase 3:23-cv-00912     Document 27     Filed 05/24/24     Page 7 of 30 PageID #: <pageID>8 \n “Grammarly, ” which will create  a demeanor or style (e.g., business, informal paper, \ngraduate level, u ndergraduate level, or  essay). Where words appear as underlined \nfor being contextually inappropriate, W.A. would click and change them per the \nsoftware ’s suggestion, although he would not understand the  changes being made \nby the software, or whether they w ere actually grammatically appropriate.  W.A. \nwill next use read -aloud software to read him the newly fashioned Word document, \nand he  then would change items that he was not satisfied with or that “ didn’ t sound \nright.”  At that point, if Word notes grammatic al errors, W.A. can again click to \nmake automatic changes that  would be inserted by the software. Once the product \nis finished, W.A. cannot read it himself —he  again would listen to the read- aloud \nsoftware.  \n \n(A.R., Vol. 1 at 392.)  Although that full range of tools may not have been available to him while \nat school, his in -school accommodations did include technical supports that similarly permitted \nsome circumvention of the need to actually read in a conventional manner , particularly through \ntechnology capable of “reading” photographed written language aloud to the user . (See, e.g. , A.R., \nVol. 2 at 829.)  \n The IDEA and its implementing regulations grant a child ’s parent “ the right to an \nindependent educational evaluation,”  or “IEE,” “at public expense if the parent disagrees with an \nevaluation obtained by the public agency. ” 34 C.F.R. § 300.502(b)(1); see 20 U.S.C . § 1415(b). \nOn November 13, 2022, W.A.’ s mother made such a request . (A.R. , Vol. 1  at 394; A.R., Vol. 2 at  \n857.)  Two assessments were performed in connection with the request. One of the assessments, \nby school psychologist Dr. Ryann King, focused on whether W.A. exhibited autism and/or \nattention deficit/hyperactivity disorder ( “ADHD” ). Dr. King concluded  that a finding of \nimpairments bas ed on those conditions was supported, but  she did not focus meaningfully on the \npossibility that W.A. might be  dyslexic . (Id. at 857 –64.)  \n The other assessment was performed by school psychologist Rebecca G. Townsend, who \nconcluded that W.A. exhibited dysl exia, dysgraphia, ADHD, and autism . (Id. at 865–80.)  \nTownsend found, among other things, that W.A. was below the 0.1 percentile rank for an array of \nCase 3:23-cv-00912     Document 27     Filed 05/24/24     Page 8 of 30 PageID #: <pageID>9 \n skills related to reading and writing —including, specifically, his “Basic Reading Skills,” such as  \n“Letter -Word Identification,” which were at around a second grade level.  (Id. at 873.) Townsend \nwrote : \n[W.A.]  demonstrates weaknesses in phonological processing that appear to \ninterfere with his reading and writing skills. In addition to using an evidence -based \nintervention to build [W.A. ’s] phonological processing skills, it may also help to \npractice playing wor d games that require rhyming, blending sounds together to \nform a word, removing a sound from a  word to form another word, and saying a \nword one syllable or one sound at a time. In some cases, incorporating letters  \n(orthography) is helpful for supporting and building phonological processing. For \nexample, use letter cards to build a word and then change one or more letters or \nletter combinations to form a different word.  \n \n(Id. at 879.) Townsend, however, did not dispute that W.A. also needed support with regard to \nmore advanced skills, like fluency. Rather, she explained that his fluency instruction should be \ncombined with instruction involving more basic skills:  \nReading teachers are encouraged to focus on developing [W.A. ’s] reading fluency \nand de -emphasize individual word analysis. Teachers can combine fluency \ntechniques such as imitative reading, repeated reading, radio reading, phrase  \nreading, paired reading, and echo reading with basic sight -word recognition, \ndecoding, vocabulary development, and  comprehension lessons. \n \n (Id.) \n In 2023, W.A. began receiving private tutoring from Dr. Sarah McAfee, a dyslexia \nspecialist. Dr. McAfee used the Wilson Reading and Language System with W.A. Dr. McAfee attended a February 2023 meeting of W.A.’ s IEP team, where she recommended that such one-\non-one tutoring be included in the IEP for the coming year. ( A.R., Vol. 1 at 401.)  \nCMCSS ’s proposed 2023–24 twelfth grade  IEP acknowledged his autism diagnosis  and \nhis parents ’ concerns regarding whether W.A. was r eceiving sufficient supports. ( A.R., Vol. 2  at \n888–89.) The IEP’s assessment of W.A.’s impairments, however, continued to focus on fluency \nand expression, rather than on basic skills. ( Id. at 891–92.) The IEP acknowledged that W.A. would \nCase 3:23-cv-00912     Document 27     Filed 05/24/24     Page 9 of 30 PageID #: <pageID>10 \n need language -related interventions to be provided in a special education setting, but it did not call \nfor services to be provided by an outside tutor like Dr. McAfee. ( Id. at 898 –99.)  W.A. ’s parents \nfelt that the proposed IEP was insufficient, and, while they signed it, they noted, in writing, that \nthey were agreeing only to the provision of the listed services “ versus none at all ” and did not \nagree that the IEP “ provides FAPE.” (Id. at 900.)  W.A. indicated agreement with that position. \n(Id.) \nC. Administrative Proceedings  and Evidence of Alleged Flaws in CMCSS ’s Approach  \n“The IDEA  . . . provides for administrative procedures to resolve disputes when the people \ninvolved in the creation of an IEP are not able to agree on its substance. ” Long, 197 F. App’ x at \n432 (citing 20 U.S.C. § 1415(b)); see 20 U.S.C. § 1415(b)(6), (f) –(g), (k).  Those procedures permit \nany affected party  to raise before  an ALJ any dispute “ with respect to any matter relating to the \nidentification, evaluation, or educational placement of the child, or the provision of a free appropriate public education to such child.”  20 U.S.C. § 1415(b)(6)(A).). “ Any party aggrieved by \nthe findings and decision made under ” the administrative complaint process “ shall have the right \nto bring a civil action with respect to the complaint presented ” in either state or federal court. 20 \nU.S.C . § 1415(i)(2)(A); see also  S.E. v. Grant Cty. Bd. of Educ., 544 F.3d 633, 642–43 (6th Cir. \n2008). On March 23, 2023, W.A. and his parents filed a Complaint before an ALJ pursuant to \nthose procedures. (A.R., Vol. 1 at 1–15.)  The Complaint asserted causes of action pursuant to the \nIDEA, the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”), Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, and 42 U.S.C. § 1983. ( Id. at 12 –13.)   \nThe plaintiffs  alleged that W.A. had been denied a FAPE by CMCSS ’s failure to address \nhis dyslexia, autism, and ADHD. (Id. at 8.)  In addition to their more general concerns regarding \nthe adequacy of the services provided to W.A., W.A. and his parents  faulted CMCSS for failing to \nCase 3:23-cv-00912     Document 27     Filed 05/24/24     Page 10 of 30 PageID #: <pageID>11 \n comply with the Say Dyslexia Act by failing to provide adequate screening for dyslexia, failing to \nprovide W.A. and his parents  with the notice and information required by the Act, and failing to \nperform any “ dyslexia -specific interventions.”  (Id. at 11.)  The parties engaged in discovery, and \nthe plaintiffs ’ challenge was ultimately heard by ALJ Phillip Hilliard  in a three- day due process \nhearing. ( See A.R. Vol. 1 at 1, Vol. 2 at 1–682.)  \nDuring the hearing, the ALJ heard testimony that W.A. was, at that time, on pace to \ngraduate successfully  with a 3.4 GPA. (A.R., Vol. 2 at 200–01.)  W.A. and his parents conceded \nthat that was the case, but argued that W.A. ’s grades did not reflect his progress, because, as his \nmother testified,  those grades had been enabled, at least in part, by his reliance on assistive \ntechnology, including ChatGPT, voice -to-text, and the Grammarly software. ( Id. at 458–60.)  She \nexplained that W.A. was capable of absorbing educational information from ordinary, spoken instruction, but that, if reading or writing was involved, that information recall only translated to good grades based on W.A.’ s “accommodations and workarounds. ” (Id. at 464.) She confirmed \nthat, if called on to write for himself, W.A. was not e ven consistently capable of spelling his \nsurname correctly.\n3 (Id. at 466.)   \nCounsel for W.A. likened W.A.’ s situation to that of a swimmer in a race who advanced \nfrom one side of the pool to the other by dragging himself along the ropes. Such a swimmer, counsel explained, could “ get from point A to point B,”  but would not be “actually swimming. ” \n(Id. at 16.)  In addition to the evidence presented regarding W.A. ’s use of technological assistance \nfor take -home assignments, the evidence at the hearing demonstrated the ways in which W.A.’ s \nin-school accommodations also enabled him to obtain passing grades , despite his reading and \n \n3 This fact is confirmed by W.A.’s signatures, including the signature on his proposed 12th- grade IEP.  \n(See A.R., Vol. 2 at 900.)  \nCase 3:23-cv-00912     Document 27     Filed 05/24/24     Page 11 of 30 PageID #: <pageID>12 \n writing difficulties. For example, W.A. was permitted to use “ Snap&Read ” technology on \nassignments , which converts a photograph of text into artificial speech. ( Id. at 92 . 147, 895.)  \nSome of the evidence presented  to the ALJ casts doubt on the possibility that it is \nnecessarily significant , in and of itself, whether  or not the documentation surrounding a child’ s \nspecial education specifically uses the term “ dyslexia.”  CMCSS Director of Special Populations \nTaylia Griffith  explained that CMCSS favored the use of more generic language because dyslexia \nwas not a recognized “ eligibility category ” under the IDEA. (Id. at 136–37.)  That characterization \nis an accurate statement of the law, in that “‘ [d]yslexia ’ is not a qualifying disability category ,” \nbut, rather, “ one example of various disabilities falling within the eligibility category of Specific \nLearning Disability.”  L.C. on behalf of A.S. v. Issaquah Sch. Dist., No. C17- 1365JLR, 2019 WL \n2023567, at *17 (W.D. Wash. May 8, 2019)  (citing 34 C.F.R. § 300.8(c)(10)(i) ). However, the \nterminology that Griffith  suggested would be appropriate instead of  an express reference to  \ndyslexia —an acknowledgment of deficits in “basic reading skills” —was precisely the term that \nbegan to be omitted from W.A.’s IEPs in favor of a focus on fluency and expression. (A.R., Vol. \n2 at 136.)  \nGriffith ’s testimony, moreover , did not suggest that IDEA’s failure to acknowledge \ndyslexia as a distinct eligibility category negated the possibility that a specific diagnosis of dyslexia might have a meaningful bearing on the appropriateness of interventions in the case of any particu lar student. Griffith , moreover, conceded that, while it is appropriate to use technology \nto assist disabled students, it can be a problem if the technology “mask[s] ” whether the student is \n“able to do the work ” or becomes a “ substitute ” for actually learn ing a necessary skill that the \nstudent is capable of learning. ( Id. at 232–37.)  \nCase 3:23-cv-00912     Document 27     Filed 05/24/24     Page 12 of 30 PageID #: <pageID>13 \n W.A. and his parents called, as an expert, Katheryn Elizabeth Metcalf, who had, until \nrecently, served as the Director of Special Education for the Crockett County School Syste m. (Id. \nat 242–44.) Metcalf testified that she had  been  specifically trained by the State of Tennessee \nregarding the dangers of allowing students with reading difficulties to become overly dependent \non technological supports. ( Id. at 24 5–47.)  \nShe also testified that a focus on more advanced topics of fluency and written expression, \nbefore a child has developed basic reading skills, is ineffective. ( Id. at 253–54.) She testified , \nhowever, that, based on her review, “ all of W.A. ’s evaluations and IEP s have focused on reading \nfluency but never addressed basic foundational reading skills .”4 (Id. at 320.) “Basic reading skills, ” \nMetcalf explained, are the foundational skills , such as those involving phonetics  and the alphabet , \nthat are typically learned in kindergarten through third grade , whereas “ fluency”  focuses on more \ncomplex issues such as tone and conventions. ( Id. at 369–73.) Both areas, Metcalf explained, are \nimportant, but fluency should be learned as a “ next step, ” rather than as an alternative to basic \nreading  skills. ( Id. at 371.)  \nAs a result  of CMCSS ’s failure to focus on W.A. ’s deficits in  basic reading skills , Metcalf \nopined, CMCSS was merely asking W.A. to “ do the same thing over and over ” without ever \n“getting at the ro ot cause”  of his difficulties. ( Id. at 328.) She testified that, in her professional \nopinion, W.A.’ s IEP goals “ were not written to assist him in developing”  the necessary basic skills. \n(Id. at 339.)  She opined that the IEPs were, therefore, not “ instructionally appropriate ” with regard \nto reading. ( Id. at 353.) W.A., in her view, needed intervention “ using dyslexia -specific materials ” \nthat would help him build “ foundational reading skills.”  (Id. at 354.) She explained that, in her \nview, “accommodations are wonderful, but they don’ t replace intervention and instruction to the \n \n4 As the court has noted, this statement is true with regard to  most of  the IEPs at issue in this case, but \nW.A.’s first IEP di d, in fact, acknowledge a deficit in Basic Reading Skills. (A.R., Vol. 2 at 684.)  \nCase 3:23-cv-00912     Document 27     Filed 05/24/24     Page 13 of 30 PageID #: <pageID>14 \n point where we don’ t keep trying.”  (Id. at 367.) Accordingly, IEPs should be written with “ specific \nskill deficits in mind, ” even if some of the effects of those deficits can be mitigated by \naccommodations. ( Id.) \nMetcalf testified that she examined W.A. herself, including by having him perform a \nwriting exercise without technological assistance, and she concluded that his deficits did, in fact, \nreflect a “[l]ack of foundational reading and writing skills,”  rather than simply a lack of fluency. \n(Id. at 337.)  Indeed, she concluded that he “ ha[d] not mastered the basic mechanical skills \nnecessary to produce a written product of more than one sentence that conveys a complete thought or idea. ” (Id. at 338.)  \nW.A. and hi s parents also presented testimony by Dr. McAfee, both as a fact witness , \nregarding her work with W.A., and  as an expert witness based on  her experience and training as a \n“dyslexia specialist reading interventionist.”  (Id. at 388–90.)  Dr. McAfee opined that W.A. was \n“not able to read much of anything that [she] put in front of him ” and needed “systematic decoding \ninstruction,”  meaning instruction that would “ go back to the very basic introduction of the \nalphabet, the alphabetic principle, [and] alphabet sequencing,”  in order to teach W.A. to “ learn \nletters and sounds in order to put them together to make words.”  (Id. at 397 –98.) She testified that \nshe had worked with W.A. about 35 times, over the course of three months, and that she had been able to advance him to Step 2 of the 12- step Wilson Reading and Language System . (Id. at 400–\n01.) She opined that, based on her experience with students  who had exhibited similar deficits, \nW.A. would likely be able to finish all of the steps within three or four years. ( Id. at 401.)  \nDr. McAfee testified that, in her experience, it is not uncommon to meet individuals who \nwere able to obtain formal diplomas without ever learning to read. She explained that, for some schools, “one answer to kids like [W.A.] is to just heavily accommodate  [and]  accommodate, \nCase 3:23-cv-00912     Document 27     Filed 05/24/24     Page 14 of 30 PageID #: <pageID>15 \n add[ing]  more accommodations ” that would permit the student to obtain adequate grades and \ngraduate without having addressed the student ’s language deficits. ( Id. at 414.)  \nCMCSS ’s hearing evidence related to reading focused, in significant  part, on W.A.’ s strong \ngrades.  (E.g., id. at 516 –17, 613.) An assistant principal at W.A. ’s school, Dr. Mandy Frost, \nacknowledged that sometimes students receive improperly inflated grades to enable their \nadvancement or graduation, but she said that W.A. ’s grades did not appear , to her , to reflect su ch \na pattern. ( Id. at 527–28.)  \nHargett -Slack —the teacher  who discussed the possibility of dyslexia with W.A.’s mother \nin eleventh grade —testified to  the importance of classroom -based work to the grades she awarded , \npotentially supporting the inference tha t W.A. ’s full system of technological supports available at \nhome might be unlikely to account for all of his strong grades. ( Id. at 588 –89.) Hargett -Slack , \nhowever, did not dispute that W.A., as his IEPs suggested, had access to some technological supports, particularly Snap&Read, in connection with classroom -based work . (Id. at 591–92.)  \nHargett -Slack further acknowledged that W.A. could have surreptitiously used ChatGTP \nin the classroom as well, given his continuous access to a computer . (Id. at 575–76, 592–93.)  \nHargett -Slack also conceded that, based on W.A. ’s accommodations granting him extra time on \nassignments, she permitted him to take some normally classroom -based work home to complete, \nand she acknowledged that, despite W.A. ’s ultimate passing grade, he received numerous Ds and \nFs on assignments. ( Id. at 593, 604.) Hargett -Slack admitted that she once asked W.A. to read one \nof his own completed assignments, but he could not do so and ultimately conceded that he had not written it himself. ( Id. at 606.)  She did not deny discussing the severity of W.A.’s situation with \nhis mother , although her recollection of the details differed slightly. (Id. at 581–82.)  Another \nCase 3:23-cv-00912     Document 27     Filed 05/24/24     Page 15 of 30 PageID #: <pageID>16 \n teacher, Chelsie Jensen, confirmed that W.A. received accommodations in connection with in-\nschool work. ( Id. at 621.)  \nAnother of W.A. ’s teachers, Lisa Elliott, testified that W.A. earned strong grades in the \nAlgebra II course that she t aught and that, during that course, she observed W.A. successfully \nperform ing in- classroom work. ( Id. at 613–614.)  CMCSS also presented testimony by Dr. King as \nan expert in school psychology. ( Id. at 492, 588–89.) Dr. King took issue with certain \nmethodological aspects of Metcalf ’s report, but she did not opine more broadly regarding W.A.’ s \ndyslexia -related needs. ( Id. at 505–06.)  \nOn July 28, 2023, the ALJ issued a Final Order, holding that the plaintiffs had “met their \nburden of proof to show that CMCSS did not provide W.A. with FAPE because CMCSS violated its obliga tion to provide W.A. with an appropriate individualized education program (IEP) \nreasonably calculated to enable W.A. to make progress appropriate in light of his circumstances, which deprived W.A. of an educational  benefit in the areas of  reading and writi ng, from the time \nof the 2017 -2018 IEP through the filing of the due process complaint.”  (A.R., Vol. 1 at 433–34.)  \nThe ALJ included a discussion of the Say Dyslexia Act, particularly with regard to CMCSS ’s \nfailure to provide “dyslexia -specific intervention s,” as discussed in Tenn. Code Ann. § 49- 1-\n229(f)(1). (Id. at 405.) The ALJ, however, also discussed CMCSS ’s alleged failure to address \nW.A. ’s dyslexia more generally . He specifically credited Metcalf ’s testimony in light of her \nrelevant education, experience, and expertise, and he concluded that the substance of her testimony \nwas “almost entirely unrebutted .” (Id. at 407.) The ALJ  noted, in particular,  the high school IEPs ’ \nconsistent failure to identify basic reading skills as a deficit area. ( Id. at 411.)  \nThe ALJ acknowledged W.A.’ s strong grades and expected graduation, but he also noted, \ncorrectly, that the Supreme Court has expressly “ declined to hold that . . . every [disabled]  child \nCase 3:23-cv-00912     Document 27     Filed 05/24/24     Page 16 of 30 PageID #: <pageID>17 \n who is advancing from grade to grade  . . . is aut omatically receiving a [FAPE]. ” Endrew F. , 580 \nU.S. at 402 n.2 (quoting Rowley, 458 U.S. at  203 n.25). He noted that, in contrast with W.A.’s  \ngrades, the actual skill assessments depicted in the IEPs showed “ relative stagnation ” in W.A.’ s \nreading and writing skills , as evidenced by comparing his percentile ranking in assessments, year \nover year . (A.R., Vol. 1 at 413–15.) The ALJ acknowledged that a lack of progress is not, in and \nof itself, evidence of a denial of FAPE. He concluded, however, that Metcalf ’s testimony \nestablished that W.A. ’s deficits could be addressed, at least to some degree, by basic reading skills -\nfocused interventions that w ere never provided. ( Id. at 417.)  \nThe ALJ awarded W.A. “888 hours of compensatory education in the form of 5 sessions \nper week, at 1 hour per session, of Dyslexia tutoring from a reading interventionist trained to \nprovide  Dyslexia tutoring through the Wilson Reading and Language System.”  (Id. at 434.)  The \nALJ also concluded that W.A.’ s claims under the ADA and Section 504 were supported, although \nhe did not award any additional remedies in connection with those claims . The ALJ rejected the § \n1983 claim. ( Id. at 433.)  \nOn August 11, 2023, CMCSS filed a Petition for Reconsideration focused on the nature of \nthe award of compensatory education. CMCSS argued that the “ extent and method”  of dyslexia -\nfocused compensatory education that W.A. receives should be de termined by the IEP team. ( Id. at \n436, 439.) CMCSS expressed a desire, in particular, not to have to rely on the Wilson Reading and \nLanguage system. ( Id. at 438.) On August 22, 2023, the ALJ denied the petition, holding that, \nwhile the IEP team did retain jurisdiction over prospective services provided for the 2023–24 school year, the award of compensatory education was granted by the ALJ in connection with a contested case, leaving it within the power of the ALJ to define the scope of the relief required. (Id. at 453.)  \nCase 3:23-cv-00912     Document 27     Filed 05/24/24     Page 17 of 30 PageID #: <pageID>26 \n reflected W.A. ’s work ethic and capacity for information retention, those grades do not establish \nthat he received a FAPE with regard to the specific area of reading and writing skills. Deficits \nalone , of course, do not show the denial of a FAPE —because a FAPE must be judge d “in light of \nthe child ’s circumstances, ” Endrew F. , 580 U.S. at 399, and some children have persistent deficits \nthat a school cannot be, and is not, expected by the IDEA to overcom e. The evidence in the \nadministrative record, however, shows that W.A. is, in fact, likely to be able to improve his reading and writing skills, at least to some degree, through interventions specifically designed for students \nwith dyslexia. Indeed, all of  the available evidence suggests that, for nearly the entirety of W.A.’s \ntime at CMCSS, he was being trea ted like a student whose  ill-defined learning disability \ncompromised his fluency and expression—not as a student who lacked basic reading skills due to  \ndyslexia. The court, accordingly, concludes, as the ALJ did, that CMCSS ’s failure to provide \ninterventions appropriate to W.A.’s disabilities resulted in a denial of FAPE with regard to basic \nreading skills . Although CMCSS undisputedly acknowledged that W .A. had reading and writing \ndeficits in his IEPs and provided some corresponding support, an individualized plan responsive to W.A.’ s specific circumstances would have focused on addressing his lack of foundational \nreading skills, which his IEPs did not.  \nThe court ’s finding, in that regard, is based on the likely efficacy of targeted instruction \nfocused on basic reading skills  for individuals with dyslexia , as compared to the education that \nW.A. actually received . The court, in other words, is not formalis tically relying on  whether W.A. ’s \nIEPs  expressly invoke d “dyslexia ” in describing the services provided. If the ALJ had, in fact, \nrelied solely on whether the support that W.A. received was expressly  designated as “ dyslexia -\nspecific, ” that may well have been error. That, though, is not what the ALJ did, and it is not what \nthe court is doing here . The ALJ considered W.A. ’s specific needs and concluded that a FAPE \nCase 3:23-cv-00912     Document 27     Filed 05/24/24     Page 26 of 30 PageID #: <pageID>27 \n required W.A. to receive certain specific tutoring services that would likely have been more \neffective than the  inadequate support he actually received. This court, based on its review of the \nrecord, reaches the same conclusion. The IDEA guarantees W.A. educational benefits appropriate to his situation —not merely generic support for children who struggle with language and a system \nof accommodations so sweeping that it makes the severity of his disability hard to notice.  \nSimilarly, this court does not base its conclusion on technical noncompliance with the Say \nDyslexia Act. If CMCSS violated all of the  Say Dyslexia Act ’s general requirements, but had \nnevertheless adequately addressed W.A. ’s specific disability -related needs, there would be no \nbasis for an award under the IDEA. Conversely, if CMCSS had made an effort to scrupulously comply with the Say D yslexia Act, but had nevertheless failed to provide necessary services, that \ntechnical compliance would not excuse the underlying IDEA violation. It may well be true that, if \nCMCSS had granted W.A. access to the structure envisioned by the Say Dyslexia Act , that would \nhave prevented a violation of his right to a FAPE. It is, however, that denial of an educational \nbenefit —not the details of how it might have been avoided—that support s an award to the \nplaintiffs.  \nW.A. has established, with evidence, that he likely would have benefited substantially from \none-on-one tutoring geared toward addressing his specific, dyslexia -correlated deficits, rather than \nthe more general support that he received , and that the adequacy of his educational benefit was \nsignificantly degraded by CMCSS ’s failure to provide that manner of services . An individualized \napproach tailored to W.A. ’s specific needs would not simply have provided him general language \nsupports, but would have recogni zed his specific need to focus on basic reading skills , guided by \nan awareness of his dyslexia. The court, accordingly, will uphold the ALJ ’s determination that \nCase 3:23-cv-00912     Document 27     Filed 05/24/24     Page 27 of 30 PageID #: <pageID>28 \n W.A. was denied a FAPE.5 The court, moreover, agrees with the ALJ’s assessment that the \nappropriate remedy for that denial is the provision of 888 hours of dyslexia -specific tutoring. \nD. Method for Providing Compensatory Education  \n The only remaining question, then, is the one that was first raised before this court: whether \nW.A. has a right to have the court further restrict the mechanisms through which his compensatory \ninstruction should be provided. As a preliminary matter, the co urt notes that the ALJ was correct \nthat he had the authority to require the use of the Wilson Reading and Language System , regardless \nof the fact that, if CMCSS had provided dyslexia -specific interventions in the first place, it would \nhave had the discreti on to choose between other alternatives. The IDEA takes a “flexible approach”  \nto remedies, L.M. , 478 F.3d at  316, allowing a court to “ grant such relief as [it] determines is \nappropriate. ” 20 U.S.C. § 1415(i)(2)(C)(iii). “ An award of compensatory education is an equitable \nremedy that a court can grant as it finds appropriate.”  L.M. , 478 F.3d at 316 (citing 20 U.S.C. § \n1415(i)(2)(C)(iii); Park ex rel. Park v. Anaheim Union High Sch. Dist., 464 F.3d 1025, 1034 (9th \nCir. 2006) ); see, e.g. , Somberg, 908 F.3d at  177; Woods v. Northport Pub. Sch., 487 F. App’ x 968, \n978 (6th Cir. 2012) . The ALJ concluded that, because W.A. had already received numerous \nsessions in connection with the Wilson Reading and Language System  and had advanced within \nthat syste m, continuing along that course would provide the appropriate remedy. The court agrees. \nWhether or not other systems might work adequately in the abstract, W.A. ’s individual situation \nis that (1) these interventions are occurring far later in his education than they should have and (2) he has already done substantial work in the Wilson Reading and Language System. The court holds \n \n5 In addition to the ALJ ’s focus on W.A.’ s general denial of a FAPE, the ALJ found that CMCSS had failed \nto provide W.A. with sufficient transition services, for which the ALJ ordered only very modest relief in \nthe form of providing W.A. with some career -related assessments. (A.R., Vol. 1 at 431.)  CMCSS briefly \naddresses this aspect of the ALJ’s holding in its briefing, but its argument is conclusory and amounts to \nlittle more than saying that the ALJ erred. The court finds no error with regard to this aspect of the ALJ’s \ndetermination.  \nCase 3:23-cv-00912     Document 27     Filed 05/24/24     Page 28 of 30 PageID #: <pageID>29 \n that the appropriate mechanism for  remedying his denial of a FAPE is continuation of that \napproach.  \n W.A. ’s primary  argument in favor of modifying the relief to require CMCSS to rely on the \nClarksville Center for Dyslexia  is that CMCSS ’s failure to provide W.A. with instruction under \nthe Wilson Reading and Language System  until now should be construed as either a refusal or  an \ninability  to do so. The court, however, finds no basis for drawing so strong an inference. For the \noverwhelming majority of the time that CMCSS failed to provide W.A.  with the manner of \ninstruction he needed, it did so because it appears to have been genuinely unaware of the specific \nnature of his needs. CMCSS has represented to this court that it is “ ready, willing, and able to \nprovide the compensatory education order ed by the Administrative Judge ,” as long as it is able to \nresolve “logistical problems ” surrounding (1) W.A.’ s schedule and (2) access to data regarding his \nprogress with McAfee. (Doc. No. 23 at 1.) This court ’s only remedial power, under the IDEA, is \nto order a remedy adequate to address the denial of W.A. ’s FAPE. The court cannot conclude, at \nthis stage, that instruction provided through W.A.’ s preferred source, the Clarksville Center for \nDyslexia, is the only potentially adequate source of such instructi on. \n W.A. and his parents ask the court to consider two additional pieces of evidence that, they \nargue , establish CMCSS ’s inability to provide instruction in the Wilson Reading and Language \nSystem: an audio recording of a November 2023 IEP meeting showing that CMCSS generally uses \nanother system and evidence  from another student ’s case suggesting that the “ literacy transition”  \nteachers at W.A. ’s school lack ed dyslexia -specific training  in 2020 and that there is some question \nregarding the extent of such training now . Neither of those pieces of evidence, however, suggests \nthat CMCSS is categorically incapable of providing the  necessary instruction through any \nmechanism other than through the Clarksville Center for Dyslexia.  \nCase 3:23-cv-00912     Document 27     Filed 05/24/24     Page 29 of 30 PageID #: <pageID>30 \n If CMCSS does prove to be wholly incapable of providing Wilson Reading and Language \nSystem  instruction with its own personnel  in a timely  manner , then it w ill, by necessity, have to \nlook to an outside vendor. The court, however, has no basis for requiring it to do so and certainly \nhas no basis for selecting one particular vendor . The court, accordingly, will require the same \ncompensatory education that the A LJ did and will stress that it must be provided expeditiously—\nincluding, if necessary, through an outside party .6 If CMCSS fails to meet that obligation, W.A. \ncan return to this court to seek enforcement of its Order. For now, though, CMCSS ’s obligation i s \nto provide the necessary compensatory education through whatever adequate staffing and funding \nmechanism it chooses.  Because the relief originally ordered by the ALJ will now become relief \nordered by this court, the plaintiffs ’ motion to enforce the ALJ ’s Order will become moot.  \nIV. CONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, the plaintiffs ’ Motion to Enforce Final Order of the \nAdministrative Law Judge (Doc. No. 19) will be denied as moot, the plaintiffs ’ Motion for \nJudgment on the Administrative Record (Doc. No. 25) will be granted as to all issues other than \ntheir requested modification of the remedy, and will, in that respect, be denied, and CMCSS ’s \nMotion for Judgment on the Administrative Record (Doc. No. 22) will be denied.  \nAn appropriate order will enter.  \n        ______________________________ \n        ALETA A. TRAUGER  \n       United States District Judge  \n \n6 The court will, however, omit the requirement that the instruction be provided by a “ reading \ninterventionist, ” because CMCSS has disput ed whether  “Sarah McAfee or anyone associated with the \nClarksville Center for Dyslexia is a reading interventionist within the meaning of Tennessee law. ” (Doc. \nNo. 26 at 2.) Whatever the import of that distinction is with regard to general, prospective com pliance with \nthe Say Dyslexia Act,  there has been no showing that a formal designation as a reading interventionist is \nnecessary for the provision of adequate compensatory education in W.A.’ s case.  The court will also permit \nsome greater flexibility with r egard to scheduling.  \nCase 3:23-cv-00912     Document 27     Filed 05/24/24     Page 30 of 30 PageID #: <pageID>",

    "summary": "1. Summary:\nIn the case Sultan v. Trump, the plaintiff, Ahwar Sultan, a noncitizen student in the U.S., challenges the revocation of his F-1 visa and termination of his Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVIS) record, which occurred due to an Executive Order advocating the deportation of noncitizen students involved in protests. The court partially grants Sultan's request for a Temporary Restraining Order, finding that he has shown a likelihood of success on his claims under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and the Fifth Amendment for lack of due process. Notably, the case involves the use of AI in the \"Catch and Revoke\" program to identify and cancel visas of individuals associated with activities or groups deemed threatening to national security.\n\n2. Key Legal Issue:\nThe key legal issue is whether the revocation of Sultan's F-1 visa and termination of his SEVIS record, without adequate due process, violates the Fifth Amendment and the Administrative Procedure Act.\n\n3. Court's Holding:\nThe court held that Sultan is likely to succeed on his claims that the termination of his SEVIS record violated the APA and his procedural due process rights under the Fifth Amendment. Thus, the court granted a temporary restraining order requiring the reinstatement of Sultan's SEVIS record to its \"active\" status, preventing further adverse action until a full review on the merits.\n\n4. ELI5 explanation:\nImagine you’re a student from another country studying in the U.S., and one day the government suddenly takes away your permission to be here, without telling you why or letting you explain your side. A court has said that the government might have done this unfairly, so the judge temporarily put things back to normal while deciding the right way to handle it. The court wants to make sure students have a fair chance to argue their case before being told they have to leave the country.",

After considering the parties’ briefing and oral argument, for the reasons below, \nthe court will GRANT IN PART and DENY IN PART Plaintiff’s Motion.   \nI. BACKGROUND  \nA. Factual Background \n During the 2024 presidential campaign, Defendant , then a candidate for President,  \nrepeatedly vowed to deport noncitizen students who participate in protest activity.  Compl. ¶ 108, ECF No. 1 (“Compl.”).  On or about October 28, 2023, he told one news outlet, “All of the resident aliens who joined in the pro- jihadist protest this month, nobody’s ever seen anything like it.  Come \n2025, we will find you and we will deport you.”  Id .  He repeated similar statements on May 14, \n2024, and on August 13, 2024, to reporters.  Id. ¶¶ 109–10 Case 1:25-cv-01121-TSC     Document 12     Filed 04/24/25     Page 1 of 11Page 2 of 11  \n  On January 30, 2025, President Trump issued  Executive Order (“EO”) “Protecting the \nUnited States from Foreign  Terrorists and  Other National  Security and Public Safety Threats.”  \nExec. Order No. 14161, 90 Fed. Reg. 8451 (Jan. 30, 2025) .  Section 1(b)  of the EO  states that in \norder “[t]o protect Americans  . . . the  United States must ensure that admitted aliens and aliens \notherwise already present in the United States do not  bear hostile attitudes  toward its citizens, \nculture, government, institutions, or founding principles, and do not advocate for, aid, or support \ndesignated foreign terrorists and other  threats to our national security .”  Compl . ¶ 112 ( internal \nquotation marks and citation omitted ) (emphasis added) .  The EO requires Defendants Secretary \nof Homeland Security Kristi Noem , Attorney General Pam Bondi , and the Director of National \nIntelligence Tulsi Gabbard to do the following:  \n1. Section 2(a)(i): “[I]dentify all resources that may be used to ensure that all aliens  . . . who \nare already in the United States, are vetted and screened to the maximum degree possible.”  \n \n2. Section 2(a)(ii): “[A]scertain whether [an] individual seeking [an immigration] benefit \nis . .  . not a security or public safety threat.”  \n \n3.  Section 2(a)(iv): “[V]et and screen to the maximum degree possible all aliens who . . . are \nalready inside the United States.” \n \n4. Section 3: “Recommend any actions necessary to protect the American people from the \nactions of foreign nationals who have undermined or seek to undermine the fundamental constitutional rights of the American people[.]”\n1 \n Compl. ¶¶  113 (a) –(c).  On March 6, 2025, the State Department confirmed that: (1) it was \nplanning to review internal databases to see whether any visa holders were arrested and had not \nbeen subjected to immigration enforcement; id. ¶ 131, and (2) it would enact the “Catch and \nRevoke” program, an artificial intelligence effort to “cancel the visas of foreign nationals who appear to support Hamas or other designated terror groups.”  Id. ¶ 132.  On March 27, 2025, \n \n1 These recommendations were due on February 19, 2025, but have not been made public.  \nCompl. ¶  22. Case 1:25-cv-01121-TSC     Document 12     Filed 04/24/25     Page 2 of 11Page 3 of 11  \n Secretary  of State Marco  Rubio announced at a press conference that the State Department had \nrevoked the visas of approximately 300 foreign students.  Id. ¶  8. \n Plaintiff Sultan is one such student.  He is enrolled as a graduate student at the Ohio State \nUniversity (“OSU”), studying Comparative Studies. Id.  ¶ 15.  He  also works  as a Teaching \nAssistant for an Introduction to Humanities course.  Id. ¶ 45.  The other Plaintiff is Students for \nJustice in Palestine  (“SJP”) , a student -led organization at OSU committed to advocating for \nPalestinian rights, of which Sultan is a n “outspoken member .”  Id. ¶¶ 16, 74 .   \n On April 25, 2024, Sultan  was arrested after he participated in a SJP protest demanding \nthat OSU divest from Israel.  Id. ¶¶ 4–3, 70.  His charges were later dismissed and expunged after \nhe completed  10 hours of community service.  Id. ¶¶ 6, 70.   \n On April 21, 2025, at 1: 37 A. M., OSU notified Sultan  by email  that h is SEVIS record  had \nbeen  terminated for “ otherwise failing to maintain status – individual identified in criminal records \ncheck  and/or has had their VISA revoked.”   Id. ¶ 87; Pl.’s Reply, Ex. C, at 1, ECF No. 9- 3 (“Ex. \nC”).  The notice instructed Sultan to cease all F -1-related  activity  and campus  employment \nimmediately but provided no further  information.  Ex. C at 1.     \n On April 7, 2025, at 9:38 A.M., the U.S. Consul General in Mumbai emailed  Sultan \ninforming him that his F -1 visa had been revoked.   Pl.’s Reply, Ex. B at 1– 2, ECF No. 9- 2 (“Ex. \nB”).  Defen se counsel confirmed the same on the record during the court’s hearing on April 23, \n2025.  Temp. Restraining Order Hr’g Tr. at 8:23–9:3.   \n Plaintiffs filed suit in this court on April 15, 2025, alleging  several  claims  under the First \nAmendment.  Compl. ¶¶  140–64.  Only Sultan, however, brought claims under the Administrative \nProcedure Act  (“APA”) , the Fifth Amendment ’s Due Process Clause, and the Immigration and \nNationality Act.  Id. ¶¶ 165 –90.  In Sultan’s  motion for a temporary restraining order, however, he Case 1:25-cv-01121-TSC     Document 12     Filed 04/24/25     Page 3 of 11Page 4 of 11  \n relies  on his APA claim and his Fifth Amendment claim for procedural and substantive due \nprocess.  Pl. ’s TRO  at 9–10.  H e ask s the court  to: \n1. Declare that Defendants’ termination of his  F-1 student status under the SEVIS system \nwithout affording him sufficient notice and opportunity to be heard violates the Fifth \nAmendment and APA;  \n \n2. Order  Defendants to provide adequate individualized proceedings before an impartial \nadjudicator;  \n \n3. Order Defendants to reinstate his  SEVIS record at OSU  \n \na. or provide him with a reasonable period to maintain his valid F -1 status by allowing \nhim to transfer to another Department of Homeland Security (“DHS ”)-approved \nschool if his reinstatement at OSU is not accepted; \n \n4. Enjoin Defendants from detaining him  while this matter is  pending. \n Id. at 14 . \n \nB. Legal Background  \n An F-1 visa controls a noncitizen  student ’s entry into the United Sates, not  their lawful \nstatus  while in the country.  Congress requires a noncitizen with an F-1 visa to be a “bona fide \nstudent” and “to pursue a full course of study,” 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(15)(F)(i), or “engag[ e] in \nauthorized practical training.”  8 C.F.R. § 214.2(f)(5)(i).   \n The SEVIS database is maintained by I mmigration and Customs Enforcement (“I CE”) to \nmanage and track noncitizen s’ compliance  with the terms of their  visa status.   Compl. ¶  33; 8 \nU.S.C. § 1372(a)(1) ; 86 Fed. Reg. 69663 (Dec. 8, 2021) .  A noncitizen student maintains F -1 legal \nstatus only if the “student is making normal progress toward completed a course of study.”  8 \nC.F.R. § 214.3(f)(5) (i).  Designated School Officials must report through SEVIS when a student \nfails to maintain status.  Id. § 214.3(g)(2) (ii)(A).  If a student’s SEVIS record is terminate d, there \nare consequences : \n1. The s tudent loses all on-  and/or off -campus employment authorization.  Case 1:25-cv-01121-TSC     Document 12     Filed 04/24/25     Page 4 of 11Page 5 of 11  \n 2. The s tudent cannot re -enter the United States on the terminated SEVIS record.  \n3. ICE agents may investigate to confirm the departure of the student.  \n4. Any associated F -2 or M -2 dependent records are terminated.  \n “Terminate a Student,” U.S. Dep’t of Homeland Security, https://perma.cc/5K2T -2JXD.  \nIn addition, when a student’s SEVIS record is terminated , there is “no grace period” for “duration \nof status ”: “If the student and dependents are still in the United States, the student must either \napply for reinstatement, or the student and dependents must leave the United States immediately. ”  \nId.   \n DHS  can terminate a noncitizen’s F -1 legal  status in one of two ways : (1) student -initiated \nfailure; (2) an agency -initiated termination.  Under  the first category, a noncitizen  student  can lose \ntheir lawful status if they engage in unauthorized employment, 8 C.F.R . § 214.1(e), provide  false \ninformation to DHS , id. § 214.1(f), or is convicted of a “crime of  violence ” with a potential \nsentence of more than a year .  Id. § 214.1(g).  For the second category, DHS can terminate a \nstudent’s F -1 status under three circumstances:  \n1. When a previously- granted waiver under INA § 212(d)(3) or (4) is revoked;  \n \n2. When a private bill to confer lawful permanent residence is introduced in Congress; or  \n \n3. When DHS publishes a Federal Register notification identifying national security, diplomatic, or public safety reasons for termination. \nId. § 214.1(d).  Visa revocation is not  a basis for SEVIS  record  termination.  In fact, in a \n2010 policy guidance document, DHS stated that “[v] isa revocation is not, in itself, a cause for \ntermination of the student’s SEVIS record.”  Pl. ’s Reply, Ex. A, Dep’t. Homeland Security, Policy Case 1:25-cv-01121-TSC     Document 12     Filed 04/24/25     Page 5 of 11Page 6 of 11  \n Guidance 1004- 04-Visa Revocations, at 3 (2010) , ECF No. 9- 1 (“Ex. A”) .2  While visa r evocation \ndoes not necessarily terminate a noncitizen’s  status in the United States , the reason for the \nrevocation could lead DHS to review the student’s record and determine that the individual is out \nof status.  Id. at 1 –3.   \n The Secretary of State has wide latitude to refuse entry or deport noncitizens if he has \n“reasonable grounds to believe” that their  presence or activities “would have potentially serious \nadverse foreign policy consequences for the United States.”  See 8 U.S.C. §  1227(a)(4)(C)(i).  \nII. LEGAL STANDARD  \n A temporary restraining order is “an extraordinary remedy that should be granted only \nwhen the party seeking relief, by a clear showing, carries the burden of persuasion.”  Postal Police \nOff. Ass ’n v. U.S. Postal Serv., 502 F. Supp. 3d 411, 418 (D.D.C. 2020)  (citation omitted) .  As \nwith a preliminary injunction, a party seeking a temporary restraining order  must establish “(1) \nthat he is likely to succeed on the merits, (2) that he is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the \nabsence of preliminary relief; (3) that the balance of equities tips in his favor; and (4) that an \ninjunction is in the public interest .”  Aamer v. Obama, 742 F.3d 1023, 1038 (D.C. Cir. 2014) \n(quoting Sherley v. Sebelius , 644 F.3d 388, 392 (D.C. Cir. 2011)).  The third and fourth factors \nmerge when the gover nment is an opposing party.  Nken v. Holder , 556 U.S. 418, 435 (2009).  \n A court also considers the “underlying purpose” of a temporary restraining order —\n“preserving the status quo and preventing irreparable harm” until it has an opportunity to rule on the merits.  See Granny Goose Foods, Inc. v. Bhd. of Teamsters & Auto Truck Drivers Loc. No. 70 \nof Alameda Cnty., 415 U.S. 423, 439 (1974); Shelley v. Am. Postal Workers Union, 775 F. Supp. \n \n2 Defense counsel represented at the court’s hearing on April 28, 2025, that he has “not received \na response” “as to whether or not” the 2010 policy “has been cancelled.”  Temp.

Supp. 350, 352 (D.D.C. 1986) (“In the context of the limited purpose of a temporary restraining order, the Court ’s analysis of these factors seeks \nprincipally to ensure pr eservation of the status quo.”).  \nIII. ANALYSIS  \nA. Irreparable Harm  \n Demonstrating irreparable harm is “a threshold requirement in granting temporary \ninjunctive relief.”  Beattie v. Barnhart , 663 F. Supp. 2d 5, 8 (D.D.C. 2009) (citing CityFed Fin. \nCorp. v. Off. of Thrift Supervision, 58 F.3d 738, 747 (D.C. Cir. 1995)).  To show irreparable harm, \nthe “injury alleged must be ‘both certain and great, actual and not theoretical, beyond remediation, and of such imminence that there is a clear and present need for equitable relief.’”  Church v. Biden, \n573 F. Supp. 3d 118, 138 (D.D.C. 2021) (quoting Mexichem Specialty Resins, Inc. v. EPA , 787 \nF.3d 544, 555 (D.C. Cir. 2015)  (emphasis in original) ). \n Sultan has shown that he faces  irreparabl e harm from  Defendants’ actions .  His SEVIS \nrecord has been  terminated , Ex. 3 at 1, and Defendants  confirm ed that his F-1 visa has also been  \nrevoked.  Temp. Restraining Order  Hr’g Tr. at 9: 9–10.  Yet , despite being asked by the court at \nthe temporary restraining order  hearing, defense counsel stated that he did not know  whether  \nSultan  is accruing unlawful presence in the United States because he is waiting for a response from \nICE.  Id. at 13:15–14: 3.  Defense counsel also stated that he could not say whether the government  \nintends  to initiate removal proceedings.  Id. at 22:12–15.  As a result, Sultan is in a c atch-22 \nsituation —he cannot attend  school or work because his SEVIS record is terminated; nor do es he \nknow whether he should leave the United States  immediately or risk being subject to removal Case 1:25-cv-01121-TSC     Document 12     Filed 04/24/25     Page 7 of 11Page 8 of 11  \n proceedings , because Defendants refuse to provide him with the necessary information.  Sultan \nmust therefore wait in legal limbo , at possible risk of detention, until Defendants decide whether \nand how he should be removed.  \n To be sure, Defendants are correct that  “the burden of  removal alone cannot constitute the \nrequisite irreparable injury .”  Nken , 556 U.S. at 435.  But Sultan’s harm does not end there.  He is \n(1) unable to work without a work authorization; (2) harmed by the allegation that he has a criminal \nrecord; and (3) is accruing unlawful presence in the United States, which places him at risk of detention and deportation and jeopardizes any opportunity he may have to return to the U nited \nStates  for employment, educa tion, or personal travel.  Pl. ’s TRO at 10–11.  Other district judges \nin this C ircuit considering similar challenges for terminating certain international students’ SEVIS \nrecords and F -1 visas have found similar harm and, as a result, have entered at least seven \ntemporary restraining orders  to date .  Temp. Restraining Order Hr’g Tr. at 2:15–24.\n3 \n Defendants’ arguments to the contrary are unpersuasive.  They argue  that Sultan has not \nlost his “ability to complete his academic studies ,” nor does he “include allegations” that ICE \n“revoked any employment authorization.”  Defs.’ Opp’n at 13, ECF No. 8 (“Defs.’ Opp’n”).   Yet \nSultan was instructed  by OSU on April 3, 2025, to cease all F -1 related activity , including school \nand work.  Ex. 3 at 1.  Defendants respond that OSU, not DHS, sent Sultan the April 3 email.  \nTemp. Restraining Order Hr’g Tr. at 17:17–19.  But r egardless of who sent the email , DHS’s  own \npolicy is that termination of  a noncitizen student’s  SEVIS record means that the y should at least \n \n3 See also Hinge v.

Temp. Restraining \nOrder Hr’g Tr. at 14:17–25, 15:1 –5.  As an officer of the court, counsel has a duty of candor to \nanswer its questions.  United States v. Bruce , 89 F.3d 886, 894 (D.C. Cir. 1996) (explaining that \nthe duty of candor applies even if compliance risk disclosure of confidential information and \nincludes the obligation “to avoid making a false statement to the tribunal”).  At this juncture, more \nthan two weeks ha ve elapsed since Sultan filed his  Complain t and  the court is highly skeptical of \ncounsel’s representations  that Defendants are still w aiting for ICE to confirm whether Sultan’s \npresence in the United States is unlawful .  Temp. Restraining Order Hr’g Tr. at 13: 15–14: 3.  \nTherefore, the court will order  Defendants to designate  a representative to appear at the court’s \nnext hearing who can make authoritative representations on behalf of DHS  and ICE .  \nB. Likelihood of Success  \n Sultan  has also shown a likelihood of success on at least his APA claim  that Defendants’ \nactions are arbitrary and capricious, violate DHS regulation s, and fail to accord him  due process .  \nPl.’s TRO at 8 –9; Compl. ¶¶  165–75.  As an initial matter, terminating  Sultan’s SEVIS record is \nlikely a final agency action, as it has  a potentially severe legal consequence  for P laintiff, who can \nno longer work and who may have to leave the United States.  Bennett v. Spear s, 502 U.S. 154, \n178 (1997) (requiring a two- step inquiry for finality: (i) action must mark the end of the agency’s \nprocess, and (ii) action must be one  from  which legal consequences will flow).  Defendants point \nto no legal authority to ter minate Sultan’s SEVIS record based on his expunged, and indeed, \ndismissed April 2024 charges.  Defs.’ Opp’n at 5– 18.  Consequently, OSU’s notification to  Sultan \non DHS’s behalf that his SEVIS record termination was because he was  “identified in  [a] criminal Case 1:25-cv-01121-TSC     Document 12     Filed 04/24/25     Page 9 of 11Page 10 of 11  \n records check ” does not appear to be based on  reasoned decision making, and therefore may be \narbitrary and capricious .  Ex.3 at 1; 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A).   Even though Defendants refuse to  \nconfirm whether Sultan ’s F-1 legal status is terminated, it is reasonable to assum e that it is , because \nhis visa has been revoked and his SEVIS record terminated, in which case Defendants have  \nviolated 8 C.F.R. § 214.1(d)  by not following its own regulation before doing so.  And because the \nAPA provides for due process, Defendants ’ failure to  provide Sultan with an opportunity to be \nheard regarding his SEVIS record termination  also indicates a likelihood of success on the merits .  \n5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(D).   \nC. Balance of Equities and Public Interest  \nFinally, t he balance of equities and public interest tip in favor of granting a  temporary \nrestraining order.  Pursuing A m.’s Greatness v. FEC , 831 F.3d 500, 511 (D.C. Cir. 2016)  (stating  \nthat the equities and public interest are “one and the same” when  the government is the non -\nmovant).  Sultan risks deportation or accrual of unlawful presence; in contrast, DHS is not harmed \nby temporarily reactivating Sultan’s SEVIS record pending further review of this case’s  merits .   \n Accordingly, to preserve the status quo, the court will grant Sultan ’s Motion insofar  that it \nseeks his SEVIS record  be returned  to “Active” as of April 3, 2025, and that Defendants be  \nenjoined from modifying Sultan’s SEVIS record  based on  his April 23, 2024, arrest at OSU.  Pl. ’s \nTRO at 14 –15. \nIV. CONCLUSION \n For the foregoing reasons , the court will GRANT IN PART and DENY IN PART  \nPlaintiff’s Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order .  A corresponding order will follow shortly.  Case 1:25-cv-01121-TSC     Document 12     Filed 04/24/25     Page 10 of 11Page 11 of 11  \n Date: April 24, 2025 \nTanya S. Chutkan  \nTANYA S.

    "summary": "1. **Summary:** This case involves Michael Muir, who is challenging the use of Advanced Imaging Technology (AIT) scanners by the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) due to their impact on individuals with disabilities like his own, a congenital birth defect that presents as a hernia. Muir claims that the Automatic Target Recognition (ATR) software in these scanners wrongly identifies his condition as a threat, resulting in painful and invasive pat-downs. The court partially grants Muir’s petition, remanding it to the TSA to further consider accommodations under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 but denies all other aspects of his petition.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue:** Whether the TSA's use of AIT scanners violates the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 by failing to provide reasonable accommodations for passengers with disabilities.\n\n3. **Court's Holding:** The court grants Muir's petition in part, requiring the TSA to evaluate whether implementing Muir's requested accommodation would impose an undue burden on the agency under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, while denying the petition in all other respects.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation:** Michael Muir has a medical condition that makes airport security scanners, which find hidden objects, think he is hiding something dangerous. This means he has to undergo painful extra checks. He took TSA to court to ask for different screening procedures for people like him with medical conditions. The court agreed that the TSA should rethink whether it can give Muir and others like him a more comfortable security check without too much trouble for the agency.",

Muir contends that  his hernia causes him to \nexperience various problems ranging from severe pain to \npotentially life-threatening partial strangulation of his \nintestines.  Muir filed a peti tion challenging the Transportation \nSecurity Administration’s (TSA) Final Rule, which authorized its use of scanners  that use electroma gnetic radiation—known \nas Advanced Imaging Technology (AIT) scanners—to screen airline passengers at airport s ecurity screening checkpoints.  \nSee Passenger Screening Using Advanced Imaging \nTechnology, 81 Fed. Reg. 11,364, 11,365 (Mar. 3, 2016).   \n TSA posits that “AIT is th e most effective technology \ncurrently available to detect both metallic and non-metallic \nthreat items concealed on passengers.”  Id.  However, for Muir, \nAIT scanners equipped with Automatic Target Recognition \n(ATR) software inevitably flag his hernia as a threat object, which requires TSA agents to perform pain-inducing and potentially life-threatening pa t-downs of his groin area.  \nAccordingly, Muir implores us to  hold that the Final Rule and \nTSA’s standard operating proced ures (SOPs) are arbitrary and \ncapricious, contrary to TSA’s st atutory authority, and violate \nprotections afforded under Sec tion 504 of the Rehabilitation \nAct of 1973, 29 U.S.C. § 794.   USCA Case #22-1318      Document #2127237            Filed: 07/25/2025      Page 2 of 263 \n We grant Muir’s petition in pa rt and remand the matter to \nTSA for further proceedings to determine whether implementation of Muir’s requested accommodation under the Rehabilitation Act will impose an undue burden on the agency.\n1  We deny the petition in all other respects.             \n  \nI.  \nA. \nThe terrorist attacks of Se ptember 11, 2001, significantly \naltered airport secu rity measures.  S oon afterward, Congress \nestablished TSA, see Aviation and Trans portation Security \nAct, Pub. L. No. 107–71, 115 Stat. 597 (Nov. 19, 2001), and made it responsible “for the sc reening of all passengers and \nproperty” boarding passenger airplanes, 49 U.S.C. § 44901(a), and developing regulations prohibiting airlines from \ntransporting passengers who refuse to consent to the screening, \nid. § 44902(a)(1).  As a result, Congress charged TSA with \nensuring that passengers did not  board a commercial airline \nflight carrying dangerous weapons , explosives, or destructive \nsubstances.  Id. §§ 44901(a), 44902(a)(1).   \nThree years later, Congress enacted the Intelligence \nReform and Terrorism Preven tion Act of 2004, Pub. L. No. \n108–458, 118 Stat. 3638 (Dec. 17, 2004) , and directed TSA to \ndevelop “a strategic plan to  promote . . . deployment of \nexplosive detection equipment at airports to screen individuals \nand their personal property . . . includ[ing] walk-through \nexplosive detection portals, doc ument scanners, shoe scanners, \nand backscatter x-ray scanners .”  49 U.S.C. § 44925(b)(1).  \nAnd after a spate of attemp ted terror attacks involving \n \n1 Our colleague dissents only insofar as he would hold that we lack \njurisdiction to consider Muir’s request for an accommodation pursuant to the Rehabilitation Act.   USCA Case #22-1318      Document #2127237            Filed: 07/25/2025      Page 3 of 264 \n nonmetallic explosives, Congr ess further directed the \nDepartment of Homeland Securi ty (DHS), the Cabinet-level \ndepartment overseeing TSA, to  “give a high priority to \ndeveloping, testing, improvi ng, and deploying” a new \ntechnology at airport screeni ng checkpoints “that detects \nnonmetallic, chemical, biological , and radiological weapons, \nand explosives.”  Id. § 44925(a).  TSA responded to these \ndirectives by prescribing the deta ils of the screen ing process in \na set of SOPs2 and by barring any pe rson from entering the \n“sterile area”3 of an airport “or board[ing] an aircraft without \nsubmitting to the screening and in spection of his or her person \n. . . in accordance with the procedures being applied to control access to that area or aircraft .”  49 C.F.R. § 1540.107(a).   \nIn 2007, TSA initially deployed AIT scanners as \nsecondary screening measures, but by 2010 AIT scanners were the primary method of screening.  “AIT creates an image of the \nfull body that highlights objects that are on the body.”  J.A. 196.  TSA deploys AIT scanners that use “non-ionizing radio \nfrequency energy in the millimeter wave spectrum to generate an image based on the energy reflected from the body,” J.A. \n197, and “detect metallic and no n-metallic objects on an \nindividual’s body or concealed in  his clothing without physical \ncontact,” 81 Fed. Reg. at 11,365.  An example of the image generated by millimeter wave AIT appears below: \n \n2 “TSA’s SOPs are internal documents that contain instructions for \n[Transportation Security Officers (TSOs)] on how to operate \nequipment and conduct screening.  TSOs receive extensive training to perform screening as described in  the SOPs.  These documents are \n[Sensitive Security Information] and cannot be shared with the \npublic.”  81 Fed. Reg. at 11,386. \n3 “Sterile area” is defined as the area of an airport “that provides \npassengers access to boarding aircraft and to which the access \ngenerally is controlled by TSA . . . through the screening of persons \nand property.”  49 C.F.R. § 1540.5. USCA Case #22-1318      Document #2127237            Filed: 07/25/2025      Page 4 of 265 \n  \nJ.A. 198.  \n“If an anomaly is detected [during the scan of a passenger], \na pat-down of the area where the anomaly is located is usually \nperformed to determine if a threat  is present.”  81 Fed. Reg. at \n11,365.  “A pat-down may include inspection of the head, neck, arms, torso, legs, and feet[,]” as  well as “sensitive areas such \nas breasts, groin, and the buttocks.”  Security Screening , TSA, \nhttps://www.tsa.gov/travel/secur ity-screening (last visited \nMar. 5, 2025) (“Pat-Down Screening” drop-down box).  TSA provides limited screening accommodations for those with \ndisabilities and medical conditi ons, but the agency emphasizes \nthat persons with such conditions  must also “undergo screening \nat the checkpoint.”  Disabilities and Medical Conditions , TSA, \nhttps://www.tsa.gov/travel/tsa-car es/disabilities-and-medical-\nconditions (last visited Mar. 5, 2025).  However, also, once an \nindividual has begun the screeni ng process, with or without \naccommodation, he or she must complete it.  81 Fed. Reg. at 11,382.  “Individuals are not allowed to leave partway through.”  Ramsingh v. TSA , 40 F.4th 625, 629 (D.C. Cir. \n2022).   \nB. \nOn July 15, 2011, in response to  an earlier legal challenge \n USCA Case #22-1318      Document #2127237            Filed: 07/25/2025      Page 5 of 266 \n asserting that TSA failed to enga ge in rulemaking regarding the \ndecision to use AIT for primar y screening, we remanded the \nmatter for TSA “to conduct a notice-and-comment rulemaking.”  Elec. Priv. Info. Ctr. v. DHS , 653 F.3d 1, 8 (D.C. \nCir. 2011).  As TSA explained in the preamble to its resultant \nproposed Rule, by that time Congress had responded to privacy concerns about AIT scanner-generated passenger images in the FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012, Public Law 112-\n95, which imposed a further requirement on TSA   \nto ensure that all AIT used to screen passengers must \nbe equipped with and em ploy automatic target \nrecognition (ATR) software.  49 U.S.C. § 44901(l).  That software eliminates passenger-specific ( i.e., \nindividual) images and instead indicates the  location of potential threats on a ge neric outline.  Since May \n2013, all AIT units deployed by TSA have been equipped with ATR capability.   \n81 Fed. Reg. at 11,365.  The following is an image from an AIT \nscanner using ATR:   \n \nJ.A. 199. \nAs required by this Court, TSA issued a Notice of Public \n USCA Case #22-1318      Document #2127237            Filed: 07/25/2025      Page 6 of 267 \n Proposed Rulemaking regarding AIT on March 26, 2013.  \nPassenger Screening Using Advanced Imaging Technology, 78 Fed. Reg. 18,287 (Mar. 26, 2013).  The proposal was designed \nto “codif[y] the use of AIT to sc reen individuals at aviation \nsecurity screening checkpoints,” id. at 18,289, and account for \nthe additional requirement to use ATR.  The Final Rule regarding AIT screening with ATR was promulgated on March \n3, 2016.\n4  81 Fed. Reg. 11,364. \nC. \n Muir asserts that he is “a qualified individual with a \ndisability under 42 U.S.C. § 12102 because” of his hernia.  J.A. \n109 ¶ 2.  Muir claims that he is “symptomat ic every day for at \nleast some part of the day.”  J.A. 110 ¶ 3.  Moreover, there is no way for him to tell when this partial intestinal incarceration is life-threatening.  \nOn August 9, 2018, Muir allege s that he attempted to \nboard a flight departing from Phoenix-Mesa Gateway Airport \nwhile symptomatic.  The AIT scanner identified a potential threat object located at Muir’s right groin.  As a result, a TSA \nagent allegedly performed a physic al pat-down of Muir’s right \ngroin area despite his protestati ons causing him extreme mental \nand physical pain and suffering.  Three days later, on August 12, 2018, Muir allegedly experi enced the same hardship \nboarding a flight leaving Gene ral Wayne A. Downing Peoria \nInternational Airport.         \nAfter his experiences in August 2018, Muir sent TSA a \nproposal on November 1, 2019, requesting an informal discussion pursuant to 28 C.F. R. § 14.6 about his security \n \n4 We use “AIT scanners” or “AIT scanning” hereafter as a shorthand \nfor AIT scanners equipped with ATR software.   USCA Case #22-1318      Document #2127237            Filed: 07/25/2025      Page 7 of 268 \n screening issues, which TSA subsequently denied on \nNovember 19, 2019.  Muir then filed a complain t with DHS’s \nOffice for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties (CRCL) on \nDecember 15, 2019, alleging disc rimination based on his \ndisability.  On January 7, 2020, CRCL closed Muir’s complaint \nand took no action.    \n On December 1, 2022, while standing in the security \nscreening line at St. Pete-Clearwater International Airport, Muir contends that he realized that his hernia was not reducible—meaning he could not return the displaced tissue to its normal position—before passi ng through the AIT scanner.  \nAlyssa Pastorino & Amal A. Alshuqayfi, Strangulated Hernia , \nNat’l Libr. of Med., https://perma.cc/3HLU-28RN  (last \nupdated Dec. 19, 2022).  Faced with having to endure another \npainful pat-down, Muir did not board his flight.  \nApproximately two weeks later, he filed pro se a petition for \nreview on December 14, 2022, asking us to set aside the Final Rule as unlawful.\n5  Thereafter, we appointed amicus curiae to \npresent arguments on behalf of Muir.6   \n \nII.  \n \nWe have jurisdiction over Muir’s petition.  49 U.S.C.          \n§ 46110.  In reviewing a peti tion under § 46110, we uphold the \nagency’s decision unless it is “‘arbitrary, capricious, an abuse \nof discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law,’ or unsupported by ‘substantial evidence.’”  Suburban Air Freight, \nInc. v. TSA , 716 F.3d 679, 681 (D.C. Ci r. 2013) (first quoting \n5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(a); and then  quoting 49 U.S.C. § 46110(c)).  \n \n5 Muir named both DHS and TSA in his petition.  DHS is no longer \na party to this action after we dismissed all claims against it for lack \nof standing.    \n6 We express our gratitude to William Weaver, Haley Tuchman, and \nMichelle Li for their service.

We will uphol d the agency’s determination \nif it “examine[d] the relevant data and articulate[d] a satisfactory explanation for its  action includi ng a ‘rational \nconnection between the facts found and the choice made.’”  Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

United States , 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)). \n \nIII.  \n \nMuir, aided by appointed amicus, challenges the Final \nRule and TSA’s SOPs on several gr ounds.  First, Muir contends \nthat TSA’s use of AIT scanne rs with ATR technology does not \ncomport with statutory requireme nts and is therefore contrary \nto law.  Second, amicus asserts that TSA’s failure to respond to \ncomments raising concerns with the use of AIT scanners on travelers with disabilities rende rs the Final Rule arbitrary and \ncapricious.  Third, amicus also claims that TSA’s failure to provide alternative screening pr ocedures for passengers with \ninternal disabilities is arbitrar y and capricious.  Finally, Muir \nand amicus argue that the Final Rule and TSA’s SOPs, as applied to Muir, violate Secti on 504 of the Rehabilitation Act \nof 1973.   \n Before analyzing any of thos e issues, we address Muir’s \npending motion to supplement the administrative record with \nadditional documentation from a prior action in the United States District Court for the Di strict of Arizona.  We deny this \nmotion as the supplemental info rmation is unnecessary to our \ndecision.  As to his other clai ms, we conclude that Muir’s \nRehabilitation Act claim succeeds,  but all other challenges are \neither forfeited or meritless. USCA Case #22-1318      Document #2127237            Filed: 07/25/2025      Page 9 of 2610 \n    \nA. \n    \nBefore we consider the merits  of his petition, Muir must \novercome an administrative exhaus tion requirement.  Under     \n§ 46110(d), we have jurisdiction to “consider an objection to \nan order of the [TSA] . . . only if the objection was made in the proceeding conducted by [TSA].”  49 U.S.C.  § 46110(d).  This provision requires a pe titioner to raise a rulemaking challenge \nor point to where another party raised “the same objection[],” \nduring the notice-and-comment process.  Vaughn v. FAA , 756 \nF. App’x 8, 12 (D.C. Cir. 2018) (citing § 46110(d)).  Thus, we \nin turn may only review those arguments the administrative agency had the opportunity to cons ider in the first instance.  \nAdvocs. for Highway & Auto Safety v. Fed. Motor Carrier Safety Admin. , 429 F.3d 1136, 1150 (D.C. Cir. 2005) (“[A] \nparty will normally forfeit an opportunity to challenge an \nagency rulemaking on a ground that  was not first presented to \nthe agency for its initial consideration.”); Omnipoint Corp. v. \nFCC , 78 F.3d 620, 635 (D.C. Cir. 1996)  (“As a general rule, \nclaims not presented to the agency may not be made for the first time to a revi ewing court.”).   \n \n1. \n First, Muir contends that TS A did not have the statutory \nauthority to promulgate the Fina l Rule.  He complains that the \nFinal Rule eliminated “the millimeter wave scanner[’s] . . . ‘visual image’” requirement in contradi ction of 49 U.S.C.          \n§ 44901(l).  Pet’r Br. 13.  He next protests that it improvidently \nreplaced “human image operator agents with a narrow artificial intelligence algorithm as the final decision-maker regarding potential anomalies present in passenger screening data.”  Id.  \nAs to the former, Muir assert s that “Congress require[d] that \nthe millimeter wave scanner de vice [used in the screening of USCA Case #22-1318      Document #2127237            Filed: 07/25/2025      Page 10 of 2611 \n passengers] create a visual ima ge and the TSA removed the \ncapability of the device to create a visual image.”  Id. at 23.  As \nto the latter, Muir argues that “there is nothing in § 44901(l) to \nsuggest that the TSA need[ed] to replace the human image operator TSO with a narrow artifi cial intelligence algorithm to \nanalyze scanned data.”  Id.   \n TSA asserts that Muir forfeited those statutory challenges \nto the Final Rule by failing to either raise them during the public rulemaking proceedings or  provide a reasonable ground \nfor not making the objections.  Muir responds that because other parties articulated the very same objections he raises in their public comments to TSA, our  exercise of jurisdiction is \nproper under 49 U.S.C. § 46110(d).  Amicus further suggests \nthat it was reasonable for a person with Muir’s  disability to not \nmonitor the Federal Register  for notices of proposed \nrulemakings with the potential to affect him.   \n Here, TSA did not have an opportunity to consider Muir’s \nstatutory arguments during rulema king.  It is undisputed that \nMuir failed to personally raise the challenges, but his specific claims were also not preserved by other public comments during the notice and comment period.  While some public \ncomments addressed technologi cal issues, no commenter \nraised the very objections that Muir has presented to us.  Therefore, Muir forfeited his st atutory challenges to the Final \nRule.  \n2. \n \nNext, court-appointed amicus asserts that TSA failed to \naddress publicly raised concerns  “that (1) medically disabled \nindividuals are at a higher risk of triggering false positives by \nthe AIT scanner, and (2) the subs equent pat-down is simply not \nsafe for many of those travelers, because they can experience USCA Case #22-1318      Document #2127237            Filed: 07/25/2025      Page 11 of 2612 \n severe pain or potentially fatal health complications.”  Amicus \nReply Br. 4.  Amicus furthe r contends that while TSA \naddressed medical issues generally, the agency failed to either respond to comments or consid er procedures for airline \npassengers whose medical conditions cause consistent AIT alerts resulting in pat-downs.  In this regard, amicus contends, \nTSA’s failure to address the comments concerning disabled \npassengers supports the conclusi on that the Final Rule was \narbitrary and capricious.     \n Here, again, there is no di spute regarding whether Muir \nraised this two-part disabl ed passenger objection during \nrulemaking, because he did not.  However, while some commenters did reference the profiling of the medically \ndisabled, see, e.g. , J.A. 153, J.A. 160, J. A. 176, and others \ncomplained about the risks associated with pat-downs, see J.A. \n147, J.A. 149, J.A. 151, none addres sed the distinct burdens on \ndisabled persons who are simult aneously affected by both.  \nThus, TSA had no obligation to respond to Muir’s specific \ncircumstance when no comment raised anything materially \nanalogous to bring the issue to its attention.  Cf. Unemployment \nComp. Comm’n of Alaska v. Aragon , 329 U.S. 143, 155 (1946) \n(“A reviewing court usurps the ag ency’s function when it sets \naside the administrative de termination upon a ground not \ntheretofore presented and deprives the Commission of an opportunity to consider the matter, make its ruling, and state the reasons for its action.”).  We therefore hold that court-\nappointed amicus’ first challenge to the Final Rule  is forfeited \nbecause no party raised the ob jection during the notice-and-\ncomment period.               \nB. \n \nCourt-appointed amicus  also challenges the Final Rule \nbecause it does not provide altern ative screening procedures for USCA Case #22-1318      Document #2127237            Filed: 07/25/2025      Page 12 of 2613 \n travelers with internal physical disabilities, even though TSA \nroutinely uses such alternat ives for other categories of \npassengers—like PreCheck®7 passengers, passengers carrying \nan infant, child, or a small pet, passengers accompanied by service animals, and at airports th at lack AIT scanners.  Amicus \nargues that because TSA uses th e combination of walk-through \nmetal detectors (WTMDs) and e xplosive trace detection swab \ntests as alternatives for these travelers, it is arbitrary and \ncapricious to deny requests for alternative screening \nprocedures for passengers with internal physical disabilities.          \n TSA responds to amicus’ arguments by pointing out that \nalternative screening measures  are used for TSA PreCheck® \npassengers, children, and the elderly because TSA pre-determined them to be low-risk travelers.  Moreover, alternative screening measures are available to passengers for \nwhom AIT screeners cannot successfully produce an image, because they cannot raise their arms as required, must remain \nconnected to medical equipment,  or must remain accompanied \nby service animals and pets.  TS A further explained that the \ndifference between Muir and thes e passengers lies in the fact \nthat the latter have external ch aracteristics that are immediately \napparent to TSOs and do not crea te verification or proof issues \nthat would be impracticable to administer at security checkpoints nationwide.     \n In its explanation, TSA ra tionally connected the facts \nbefore it to its decision to offer alternative screening procedures for two categories of  passengers—(1) those deemed \na lower security risk base d on background checks or other \n \n7 “TSA PreCheck® is an exped ited screening program that makes \nrisk assessments about passengers prio r to their arrival at an airport \ncheckpoint.”  TSA PreCheck® , TSA, https://www.tsa.gov/news/pres \ns/factsheets/tsa-precheck   (last visited June 16, 2025) USCA Case #22-1318      Document #2127237            Filed: 07/25/2025      Page 13 of 2614 \n available intelligence; and (2) those whose images AIT \nscanners cannot succ essfully capture—wh ile declining to \nprovide a similar process fo r passengers with internal \ndisabilities like Muir’s.  Unlik e the first group, passengers with \ninternal disabilities, like Muir, have not been determined, as a \nclass, to present a lower security risk.  See J.A. 40.  And unlike \nthe second group, passenge rs with internal disabilities going \nthrough AIT scanners, do not impede the scanners’ ability to function to produce images  of those passengers.  See J.A. 60.  \nUnder 49 U.S.C. § 46110’s deferential standard of review, that is enough to establish that TSA’s decision to exclude \nalternative screening methods in  the Final Rule for travelers \nwith internal physical disabi lities is not arbitrary and \ncapricious.  Accordingly, we deny court-appointed amicus’ \nsecond challenge to the Final Rule.  As TSA noted, Muir’s challenge is more “properly pres ented and resolved in a claim \nunder the Rehabilitation Act,” Re sp’t Br. 28, to which we now \nturn.   \n  \nC. \n \nFinally, we consider Muir’s claim that the Final Rule and \nTSA’s SOPs, as applied to him,  violate the Rehabilitation Act \nof 1973, 29 U.S.C. §§ 701–797.  The Rehabilitation Act “empower[s] individuals with disabilities to maximize \nemployment, economic self-suf ficiency, independence, and \ninclusion and integrat ion into society.”  Id. § 701(b)(1).  The \nAct’s “basic tenet is that the Government must take reasonable affirmative steps to accomm odate the handicapped, except \nwhere undue hardship would result.”  Barth v. Gelb , 2 F.3d \n1180, 1183 (D.C. Cir. 1993).   \n Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act prohibits \ndiscrimination against disabled pe rsons by recipients of federal \nfunds.  29 U.S.C. § 794.  We star t by addressing two threshold USCA Case #22-1318      Document #2127237            Filed: 07/25/2025      Page 14 of 2615 \n issues.  First, Muir’s Rehabilitation Act claim is properly \nbefore us because we, not the district courts, have exclusive jurisdiction under § 46110(a) to  review claims that TSA \n“orders” are “not in accordance with law.”  Suburban Air \nFreight , 716 F.3d at 681.  A TSA SOP is such an “order,” \nRoberts v. Napolitano , 798 F. Supp. 2d 7, 10 (D.D.C. 2011), \naff’d , 463 F. App’x 4, 4–5 (D.C. Cir. 2012), which Muir asserts \nis not in accordance with the Rehabilitation Act.  Muir challenges the SOP, as applied to him, that instructs TSOs to conduct follow-up pat-downs of body parts flagged by AIT \nscanners, a practice that, wit hout appropriate accommodation, \nallegedly excludes Muir from participation in TSA’s security screening.  Pet’r Br. 44. \n Our dissenting colleague take s the position that we lack \njurisdiction because Muir did not specify any SOP in his \npetition for review.  He asserts that Muir has accordingly failed \nto satisfy the requirements of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure to “specify the order . . . to be reviewed” in the petition.  F\nED. R. APP. P. 15(a)(2)(C); see Partial Dissent at 1–\n2.  We disagree.  It is true that Muir, a pro se litigant, did not identify the relevant (nonpublic ) SOP in his petition, but only \ndesignated the Final Rule that authorizes it.  See Pet. for \nReview 1 (J.A. 32).  “But a ‘m istaken or inexact specification \nof the order to be reviewed’ is ‘n ot fatal,’ as long as the ‘intent \nto seek review of a specific order [i] can be fairly inferred from \nthe petition for review or from other contemporaneous filings, and [ii] the respondent is not  misled by the mistake.’”  Am. \nRivers v. FERC , 895 F.3d 32, 44 (D.C. Cir. 2018) (quoting \nEntravision Holdings, LLC v. FCC , 202 F.3d 311, 313 (D.C. \nCir. 2000)) (alterations in orig inal) (emphasis omitted).   \n Those conditions are met here.  Muir’s petition explained \nthat he is not able to proceed  through screening because “the \nconfiguration of the AIT [s canner] . . . algorithmically USCA Case #22-1318      Document #2127237            Filed: 07/25/2025      Page 15 of 2616 \n misidentifies [his] hernia as a threat object requiring a pat-\ndown to resolve.”  Pet. for Revi ew 2 (J.A. 33).  That statement \nsufficed to inform TSA that Muir  challenged its direction to \nsecurity personnel to conduct follow-up pat-downs of any potential threat object identified by an AIT scanner—a direction Muir now knows is spel led out in an SOP.  Notably, \nTSA claims no prejudice from the petition’s failure to specify \nan SOP.  Those circumstances show that the petition meets the requirements of Rule 15(a)(2).  Accordingly, we do not believe either Federal Appellate Rule of Procedure 15(a)(2)(C) or § \n46111(a) preclude our exercise of jurisdicti on over Muir’s \nRehabilitation Act claim.   \n Second, TSA suggests Muir’s challenge is foreclosed \nbecause Muir “did not avail hims elf of the opportunity to bring \nan administrative complaint alleging a violation of Section 504.”  Resp’t Br. 47.  But § 4611 0(d) excuses the failure to \nraise a claim for an accommodation in a proceeding before the agency “if there was a reasona ble ground for not making the” \nrequest.  49 U.S.C. § 46110(d).  As discussed below, Muir’s \nprior attempts at procuring an accommodation through the available administrative process we re exercises in futility that \nexcuse him from engaging in yet another such futile attempt.  \nSee Tesoro Refin. & Mktg. Co. v. FERC , 552 F.3d 868, 874 \n(D.C. Cir. 2009) (observing that the futility exception to exhaustion is “limited to situations ‘when resort to administrative remedies [would be] “clearly useless.”’”) (citation omitted).  Although our dissenting collea gue is correct \nthat the futility exception is us ed sparingly, Partial Dissent at \n5, we find present the requisite “certainty of an adverse decision,” id. (citation omitted), in TSA’s assertion that Muir’s \nrequested accommodation “woul d fundamentally alter the \nnature of TSA’s security screen ing program,” Resp’t Br. 14.  \nSee also  J.L. v. SSA , 971 F.2d 260, 271 (9th Cir. 1992) \n(“Exhaustion is futile where the agency’s position on an issue USCA Case #22-1318      Document #2127237            Filed: 07/25/2025      Page 16 of 2617 \n ‘appears already set,’ and it is ‘very likely’ what its result \nwould have been.”).  We accordi ngly need not decide in this \ncase whether non-employee petitio ners bringing Section 504 \nclaims ordinarily must firs t exhaust their administrative \nremedies.  Cf. id. at 270 (“[W]e recognize that the \nRehabilitation Act does not requir e exhaustion of remedies in \nall cases.”), rev’d on other grounds , Lane v. Pena , 518 U.S. \n187 (1996).  We thus proceed to co nsider the merits of Muir’s \nRehabilitation Act claim.         \n \n1. \n “To prove a violation of sect ion 504, [complainants] must \nshow that (1) they are disabled within the meaning of the Rehabilitation Act, (2) they ar e otherwise qualified, (3) they \nwere excluded from, denied th e benefit of, or subject to \ndiscrimination under a program or  activity, and (4) the program \nor activity is carried out by a federal executive agency or with \nfederal funds.”  Am. Council of the Blind v. Paulson , 525 F.3d \n1256, 1266 (D.C. Cir. 2008).  In addition, the disabled individual “bears the ‘initial burden’ of showing that a \nreasonable accommodation is possible” and  “[o]nce that showing is made, an [agency] may still avoid liability by \nshowing that the proposed accommodation would impose an ‘undue hardship’ on the [agency]’s operations.”  Ali v. Regan , \n111 F.4th 1264, 1269 (D.C. Cir. 2024) (c itations omitted).      \n TSA does not dispute Muir’s abil ity to satisfy the liability \nelements of a Section 504 claim, that is, he “is an ‘individual \nwith a disability’ as defined in 29 U.S.C. § 705(20), . . . he is \n‘otherwise qualified’ to pres ent to a TSA checkpoint and \nreceive security screening . . . [and] TSA’s security screening \nactivities are a ‘program or  activity conducted by an[] \nExecutive agency’ under 29 U.S.C. § 794(a).”  Resp’t Br. 44.  \nRather, TSA argues that Muir’s  requested accommodation is USCA Case #22-1318      Document #2127237            Filed: 07/25/2025      Page 17 of 26RANDOLPH , Senior Circuit Judge, concurring in part and\ndissenting in part:\nI join the majority opinion except for part III. C.  I dissent\nfrom that part because our court lacks jurisdiction to review\nMuir’s contentions regarding the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C.\n§ 701 et seq.\n \nMuir’s petition for judicial review invoked 49 U.S.C.\n§ 46110(a), a statute conferring jurisdiction on the federal courts\nof appeals—direct review—over a person’s1 “petition for\nreview” of an “order” of the Transportation Security\nAdministration.  The majority opinion declares that the\n§ 46110(a) “orders” establishing our jurisdiction are TSA’s\nStandard Operating Procedures, or “SOPs.”2  The opinion then\nconsiders Muir’s arguments (and those of a court appointed\n“amicus” attorney) regarding the Rehabilitation Act. \nThe majority has missed a step.  It first should have noticed\nthat Muir’s § 46110(a) petition did not designate any TSA\nStandard Operating Procedure as an “order” with respect to\nwhich he sought judicial review.  As a consequence, and as I will\nexplain, our court lacks jurisdiction to adjudicate Muir’s claims\nabout the Rehabilitation Act.  \nRule 15(a)(2)(C) of the Federal Rules of Appellate\nProcedure states: a petition for direct review of an agency\ndecision “must . . . specify the order or part thereof to be\nreviewed.”  Note the “must.”  Muir, although representing\n1 That is, “a person disclosing a substantial interest in an order” of the\nTransportation Security Administration. 49 U.S.C. § 46110(a).\n2 These are non-public directions to staff regarding screening\nprocedures. See Roberts v. Napolitano , 798 F. Supp. 2d 7, 9 (D.D.C.\n2011), aff’d, 463 F. App’x 4 (D.C. Cir. 2012). USCA Case #22-1318      Document #2127237            Filed: 07/25/2025      Page 22 of 262\nhimself, cannot claim ignorance of this rule—he cited Rule 15\nin his petition for judicial review.  To repeat, Muir’s petition\nnever mentioned any SOPs.3\nThe law of our circuit is that a petitioner’s failure to specify\nan “order” in compliance with Rule 15(a)(2)(C) deprives our\ncourt of jurisdiction to review that order.  See City of Benton v.\nNuclear Regul. Comm’n , 136 F.3d 824, 826 (D.C. Cir. 1998)\n(per curiam); John D. Copanos & Sons, Inc. v. FDA , 854 F.2d\n510, 527 (D.C. Cir.1988); Small Bus. in Telecomms.  v. FCC, 251\nF.3d 1015, 1022 (D.C. Cir. 2001).  Our opinion in City of Benton\nadded that the “jurisdictional requirements of Rule 15(a) may\nnot be waived.”  136 F.3d at 826 (citing Gottesman v. INS , 33\nF.3d 383, 388 (4th Cir. 1994)).\n3 Muir’s “contemporaneous filings” also failed to notify the\ngovernment of the order being challenged.  See Small Bus. in\nTelecomm. v. FCC , 251 F.3d 1015, 1019 (D.C. Cir. 2001). Muir filed\nhis petition on December 14, 2022. Fifteen days later, on December\n29, he filed the Docketing Statement, Statement of Issues, and\nUnderlying Decision from which Petition Arises. None of these filings\nmentioned the SOPs. The filings merely reiterated Muir’s objection\nto TSA’s promulgation of 49 C.F.R. § 1540.107(d) and DHS’s order\ncertifying the AIT devices.\nThe majority excuses Muir as a “pro se litigant” unable to\nidentify the “nonpublic” SOPs.  Majority Op. at 15. But Muir knew of\nthe SOPs when he filed his petition in this court in December 2022.\nIn January 2021, the District Court for the Central District of Illinois\ndismissed one of Muir’s suits because “TSA’s screenings are\nconducted pursuant to [the SOP] . . . and challenges to the SOP . . . lie\nwithin the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of appeals.” Muir v.\nTSA, 2021 WL 231733, at *11 (C.D. Ill. Jan. 22, 2021). Muir then\ndiscussed the SOPs in his Seventh Circuit brief in 2021. See Brief for\nthe Appellant at 13, Muir v. TSA , 857 F. App’x 251 (7th Cir. 2021)\n(No. 21-1312), ECF No. 15. USCA Case #22-1318      Document #2127237            Filed: 07/25/2025      Page 23 of 263\nThe next problem with part III.C of the opinion is this. \nSection 46110(a)—the provision Muir invoked to establish our\njurisdiction—requires a petition for review to be filed within 60\ndays of issuance of the “order.”  Our court has held that\n“simpl[e] ignorance of the order” will not excuse\nnoncompliance.  Matar v. TSA , 910 F.3d 538, 542 (D.C. Cir.\n2018) (quoting Avia Dynamics, Inc. v. FAA , 641 F.3d 515, 521\n(D.C. Cir. 2011)).  It is one thing if a person files his petition\nchallenging an order after the 60-day deadline expired.  Section\n46110(a) has an escape valve for those who have “reasonable\ngrounds” for delay.  The built-in assumption of § 46110(a) is\nthat the person, at some time after the 60 days had run, filed a\npetition for review of the “order.”  Muir was not late in filing. \nThe problem for him—and the majority—is not with delay.  It is\nthat he did not, and still has not, filed any § 46110(a) petition\nobjecting to an SOP.\nThe third jurisdictional defect in the majority’s analysis is\nas follows.  The majority excuses Muir from his failure to\nexhaust administrative remedies because “Muir’s prior attempts\nat procuring an accommodation . . . were exercises in futility.”\nMajority Op. at 16.  What “prior attempts”? The majority has\nonly one “attempt” in mind.  That is the single complaint Muir\nlodged with the DHS Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties\non December 15, 2019, three years before the events at the\nFlorida airport described in his petition for judicial review in this\ncase. Majority Op. at 8.  This Office—CRCL—responded to\nMuir’s complaint in a January 2020 letter.  The letter stated that\nafter reviewing the information Muir “provided, CRCL has\nrecorded it in our database.” Muir Reply Br. Addendum at 42. \nCRCL took no further action and Muir considered his complaint\nas having been “denied.” Muir Reply Br. at 17.\nThe DHS regulation governing complaints like Muir’s—6 USCA Case #22-1318      Document #2127237            Filed: 07/25/2025      Page 24 of 264\nC.F.R. § 15.70(d)—requires claims of disability discrimination\nto be filed within 180 days of the discriminatory conduct. \nMuir’s complaint alleged discrimination at two airports in\nAugust 2018.  He did not file  his complaint with CRCL until\nNovember 1, 2019, many months out of time.  \nMore important, CRCL’s letter was not “final agency\naction” subject to judicial review.  See Bennett v. Spear , 520\nU.S. 154, 177–78 (1997); Magassa v. Mayorkas , 52 F.4th 1156,\n1165 (9th Cir. 2022).  It was only an intermediate determination. \nIf Muir was dissatisfied with CRCL’s response, he had a right to\ntake an administrative appeal within 60 days.4  In such an appeal,\nit is “the Officer for Civil Rights  and Civil Liberties, or\ndesignee thereof, who will issue the final agency decision which\nmay include appropriate corrective action to be taken by the\nDepartment.”  6 C.F.R. § 15.70(i) (emphasis added).\nBut Muir never filed an administrative appeal regarding his\nNovember 2019 complaint.  In other words, he did not then\nexhaust his administrative remedies.5  And so the majority\nopinion is clearly mistaken in excusing Muir from having to\npresent any administrative complaint whatsoever before\n4 “Appeals of the findings of fact and conclusions of law or remedies\nmust be filed by the complainant not later than 60 days after receipt\nfrom the Department of the letter” denying the complaint. 6 C.F.R.\n§ 15.70(h).\n5 See, e.g., Smith v. Blue Cross & Blue Shield , 959 F.2d 655, 659 (7th\nCir. 1992) (requiring litigants challenging agency action to “show that\nit is certain that their claim will be denied on [administrative] appeal,\nnot merely that they doubt an appeal will result in a different\ndecision”).  Our court cited this portion of Smith with approval in\nTesoro Refin. & Mktg. Co. v. FERC , 552 F.3d 868, 874 (D.C. Cir.\n2009). USCA Case #22-1318      Document #2127237            Filed: 07/25/2025      Page 25 of 265\npursuing his Rehabilitation Act claim in this court.6  There is no\ntelling how the CRCL Officer would have ruled in 2020 had\nMuir appealed, and still less is there any way to know how he\nwould have been treated if he had filed an administrative\ncomplaint in 2022.  The majority therefore erred in applying the\nfutility exception of exhaustion.  That exception is “quite\nrestricted,” Comm. of Blind Vendors of D.C. v. District of\nColumbia , 28 F.3d 130, 133 n.5 (D.C. Cir. 1994), and is\nconfined to situations when resort to administrative remedies\nwould be “‘clearly useless,’” Randolph-Sheppard Vendors of\nAm. v. Weinberger , 795 F.2d 90, 105 (D.C. Cir. 1986) (quoting\nBaxter v. Claytor , 652 F.2d 181, 185 (D.C. Cir. 1981)); see also\nTesoro Refin. & Mktg. Co. v.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: The case involves K.P., a minor with disabilities, who sought to use a hand-held calculator during a computerized MAP test, a measure devised by the Northwest Evaluation Association (NWEA), arguing that her rights under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) were violated. Although the AI or automated system aspect is not explicitly discussed, the computerized MAP test, which features an on-screen calculator for specific questions only, establishes the context for the requested accommodation. The court upheld the defendant's decision, denying a preliminary injunction for the use of the hand-held calculator, partly reasoning that such accommodation could potentially skew test validity and results.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the refusal to allow K.P. to use a hand-held calculator during a standardized test violated her rights under the IDEA and ADA.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court denied the plaintiff's motion for a preliminary injunction, agreeing with the magistrate judge's recommendation. The court held that the refusal likely did not violate the IDEA because the lack of written notice did not cause substantive harm due to the parents' awareness of the testing conditions. Moreover, the court found the ADA claim unlikely to succeed, reasoning that allowing K.P. to use a hand-held calculator was not a reasonable accommodation as it would interfere with the integrity of the test designed to measure actual math computation skills.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: A student named K.P. needed special help because she learns differently from other kids. Her school wouldn't let her use a regular calculator on a test because they thought it would make her scores unfair compared to other students. The test already had a digital calculator for some math questions. Her mom disagreed and took the school to court. The court sided with the school, saying that using the regular calculator would give her an unfair advantage because the test wanted to see how she solves math problems on her own.",

Guzmán\n)\nCITY OF CHICAGO SD #299, )\n)\nDefendant. )\nMEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER\nPlaintiff alleges that defendant violated the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act\n(“IDEA”) and the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”) by refusing to let her use a hand-heldcalculator while taking the Northwest Evaluation Association Measure of Academic Progress(“MAP”) test.  Plaintiff filed a motion for a preliminary injunction, which the Court referred toMagistrate Judge Cole for a Report and Recommendation (“R&R”).  After briefing and argument,Judge Cole issued an R&R recommending that the motion be denied.  The case is before the Courton plaintiff’s objections to the R&R.  For the reasons set forth below, the Court overrules theobjections, adopts the R&R in its entirety, and denies plaintiff’s motion for preliminary injunction. \nFacts\nK.P. is an eighth grader who is eligible for special education services.  (Compl. ¶ 3.)  In\nJanuary 2013, the parties created an Individualized Education Plan (“IEP”) for K.P. that includes “useof a calculator” as a classroom mathematics accommodation, and states that K.P. will “participate inthe district [and state] assessments WITH ALLOWABLE accommodations/modifications that areCase: 1:14-cv-07296 Document #: 33 Filed: 02/25/15 Page 1 of 9 PageID #:<pageID>necessary to measure academic achievement and functional performance.”  (R&R at 3; see City\nMem. Opp’n Pl.’s Mot. Prelim. Inj., Ex. 10, 1/29/ 13 IEP at 7, 9.)  The 2013 IEP does not list a hand-\nheld calculator as an accommodation.  ( See generally  City Mem. Opp’n Pl.’s Mot. Prelim. Inj., Ex.\n10, 1/29/13 IEP.)\nSometime between January 2013 and July 2014, de fendant started requiring students to obtain\na threshold MAP score to qualify to take the en trance exams for selective enrollment high schools\nand using the test score as one-third of the 900 point selection rubric for those schools.  (R&R at 4.) The MAP test is taken on a computer, and for a portion of the math questions, an on-screen calculatorpops up for the student to use.  ( Id. at 3.)  For the rest of the ma th questions, however, the calculator\ndisappears, and the students must perform computations on their own.  ( Id.)\nThe Northwest Evaluation Association (“NWEA”), which created the MAP test, recognizes\ntwo kinds of accommodations:  (1) standard (also called allowable) accommodations; and (2) non-standard accommodations.  ( Id. at 4; see Def.’s Mem. Opp’n Pl.’s Mot. Prelim. Inj., Ex. 6, NWEA\nAccommodations for MAP® Assessments at 1-2.)  Standard accommodations are those that “will beirrelevant to, or only minimally affect the validity of the student’s test score.”  (R&R at 4; see Def.’s\nMem. Opp’n Pl.’s Mot. Prelim. Inj., Ex. 6, NWEA Accommodations for MAP® Assessments at 1.) Non-standard accommodations are those that “have the potential  to bias the students’ test score,” and\ninclude “[u]sing a calculator for questions that do not have an on-screen calculator.”  (R&R at 4; see\nDef.’s Mem. Opp’n Pl.’s Mot. Prelim. Inj., Ex. 6, NWEA Accommodations for MAP® Assessmentsat 2) (emphasis original).  The NWEA does not preclude schools from making non-standardaccommodations during MAP tests if, for example, an IEP requires it.  ( See Def.’s Mem. Opp’n Pl.’s\nMot. Prelim. Inj., Ex. 6, NWEA Accommodations for MAP® Assessments at 2.)  “However, [the\n2Case: 1:14-cv-07296 Document #: 33 Filed: 02/25/15 Page 2 of 9 PageID #:<pageID>school] leadership has the responsibility for . . . interp ret[ing] . . . the test results” and “track[ing] non-\nstandard accommodations so they can be factored in interpretations.”  ( Id.)  Further, the NWEA states\nthat “[t]he greater the use of non-standard accommodations . . . , the weaker the validity of theinference that can be drawn from the student’s score,” which “should be considered when interpretingtest scores or using them to make important educational decisions.”  ( Id.)\nIn May 2014, after discovering that the use of hand-held calculators was generally not\npermitted during the MAP test, K.P.’s mother wrote a letter to defendant asking whether K.P. would\nbe allowed to use one pursuant to her IEP.   (R&R at 5.)  Defendant did not respond to her letter,  butshe was contacted shortly thereafter about updating K.P.’s IEP.  ( Id.)  The parties met in July and\ncreated a new IEP that lists both “use of a calculator” and “[u]se [of a] hand held calculator” asclassroom mathematics accommodations, but also states that K.P. will take district and stateassessments “WITH ALLOWABLE accommodations/modifications.”  ( Id. at 3-4; see City Mem.\nOpp’n Pl.’s Mot. Prelim. Inj., Ex. 11, 7/16/14 IEP at 6-9.)\nIn September 2014, K.P.’s mother asked defendant to confirm that K.P. would be allowed to\nuse a hand-held calculator during the math portion of  the MAP test, which K.P. was scheduled to take\non October 4, 2014.\n1  (R&R at 6.)  Defendant told her that  K.P. would not be allowed to do so, and\nthis suit followed.\n1Defendant agreed to postpone the test until after this Court’s ruling on the objections to\nthe R&R.  ( See id. at 9 n.5.) \n3Case: 1:14-cv-07296 Document #: 33 Filed: 02/25/15 Page 3 of 9 PageID #:<pageID>Discussion\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 72(a) instructs the Court to make a de novo determination\nof those portions of the R&R to which plaintiff objects.  Id.  The Court may “accept, reject, or\nmodify” the R&R, “receive further evidence or recommit the matter to the magistrate judge withinstructions.”  28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1).\nPlaintiff objects to the Magistrate Judge’s conclusion that she is unlikely to succeed on her\nclaim that defendant violated the IDEA by failing to give her parents prior notice of the removal ofthe hand-held calculator accommodation from her IEP.  ( See Compl., Count I); 20 U.S.C. §\n1415(b)(3)(A) (requiring a school to give “[w]ritten prior notice to the parents of the child, . . .whenever [it] . . . propose[s] to in itiate or change” an IEP).  As an initial matter, the Magistrate Judge\nsaid it was not clear that there had actually been a change in plaintiff’s IEP, “given [its] wording . .\n. [,] its explicit limitation to ‘ALLOWABLE’ accommodations, [and] the NWEA guidelines onnon-standard accommodations.”  (R&R at 8.)  Even if there had been one, however, Judge Cole saidK.P.’s parents had actual notice of the alleged change, and thus the lack of written notice neitherprejudiced them nor violated the IDEA:\n. . . .  As far as the notice requirement, there is no harm, no foul because, as is clear\nfrom the plaintiffs’ submissions, they were well aware that K.P. would not be allowedthe hand-held calculator accommodation on portions of the Test where there is noon-screen calculator.  They have identified no prejudice resulting from lack of written\nnotice.  Nor have they cited any case law in support of injunctive relief for the failureto provide written notice.  They’ve filed suit, have had the testing schedule altered toallow for adjudication of their Americans With Disabilities Act (“ADA”) claim, andwill have their day in court without harm to K.P. \n(Id. at 9) (emphasis original). \nPlaintiff contends that this conclusion is erroneous because even a  non-prejudicial  violation\nof the notice provision is actionable.  The Court disagrees.  The purpose of the IDEA’s notice\n4Case: 1:14-cv-07296 Document #: 33 Filed: 02/25/15 Page 4 of 9 PageID #:<pageID>provision is “to ensure that the parents of a child with a disability are both notified of decisions\naffecting their child and given an opportunity to object to these decisions.”   C.H. v. Cape Henlopen\nSch. Dist. , 606 F.3d 59, 70 (3d Cir. 2010).  “Thus in cases where a violation of a notification\nrequirement does not actually impair the parents’ knowledge of, or participation in, educationaldecisions, the violation is not a substantive harm under the IDEA.”  Id.; see K.A. ex rel. F.A. v. Fulton\nCnty. Sch. Dist. , 741 F.3d 1195, 1204-05 (11th Cir. 2013) (dismissing IDEA claim, though school\nhad not provided required notice, because the violation did not prejudice the parents); Thomas v.\nCincinnati Bd. of Educ. , 918 F.2d 618, 625 (6th Cir. 1990) (“Although we are not called upon to\ndecide whether all violations of [IDEA’s] procedural requirements are to be assessed according toa separate test of prejudice, we are of the opinion that inquiry is proper [in the notice context], since\nthe only error was one of technical noncompliance which did not result in any substantivedeprivation.”),  superseded in part on other grounds by regulation as recognized in , N.W. ex. re. J.W.\nv. Boone Cnty. Bd. of Educ. , 763 F.3d 611 (6th Cir. 2014); see also Hjortness ex rel. Hjortness v.\nNeenah Jt. Sch. Dist. , 507 F.3d 1060, 1065 (7th Cir. 2007) (stating,  in the context of a school’s failure\nto hold a second IEP meeting, that “this procedural violation does not rise to the level of a denial of\na free appropriate public education . . . . [because the] parents’ rights were [not] in any meaningfulway infringed”).  Such is the case here.  Therefore,  the Court agrees with Magistrate Judge Cole that\nplaintiff does not have a likelihood of success on the merits of her IDEA claim.\nJudge Cole also concluded that plaintiff is not likely to succeed on her ADA claim because\nshe did not show that the accommodation she seeks is reasonable:\nAllowing K.P. to use a calculator to answer questions that are designed to assess her\nability to perform math calculations is not an accommodation that in the plaintiffs’words “level the playing field.”  Quite the contrary.  It would permit K.P. to replaceher allegedly limited computational skills with a mechanical tool of infinite capacity\n5Case: 1:14-cv-07296 Document #: 33 Filed: 02/25/15 Page 5 of 9 PageID #:<pageID>(at least in the context of this case) that likely exceeds the computational capabilities\nof perhaps all – and certainly most – non-disa bled students.  That is not a reasonable\naccommodation but a substitution of artificial intelligence for the very skill the Testseeks to measure.\nPlaintiffs allow that K.P.’s use of a hand-held calculator throughout the entire math\ntest will lead CPS to invalidat e the results, but insist that should . . . that occur that\nwill raise an issue that may be “ultimately be decided in this forum or elsewhere.”(Dkt. # 7-1, at 6). Implicit in this argument is a recognition that the Test will beinvalidated, thereby ensuring future litigation over the permissibility of thatinvalidation. But, an accommodation that serves to scrap the results of a three hourtest – and prompts additional litigation – does not qualify as “reasonable.”Accommodations are not reasonable if they impose undue financial andadministrative burdens.\n(R&R at 10-11) (footnotes and citations omitted). \nPlaintiff contends that she offered evidence, the declarations of her mother, J.P., and her\nlearning disabilities specialist, Katherine Siavelis, to show that her use of a hand-held calculatorwould not render her test results invalid, but Judge Cole erroneously refused to consider them.  ( See\nPl.’s Objs. at 4; R&R at 6-7 n.4 (stating that he disregarded the declarations because plaintiff\nsubmitted them for the first time on reply and the relevant portion of J.P.’s declaration wasinadmissible).)  Even if Judge Cole had considered the declarations, however, it would not havehelped plaintiff’s case.  Siavelis’ declaration does not address the validity issue at all, and J.P.’sdeclaration only addresses it through inadmissible hearsay.  ( See Pl.’s Reply, Ex. 4, J.P. Decl. ¶¶ 34-\n35 (quoting a passage from an article published by an education consortium); see generally id. , Ex.\n5, Siavelis Decl.).)  Because the declarations would not have bolstered plaintiff’s proof even if JudgeCole had considered them, his refusal to do so was not erroneous.  \nPlaintiff also argues that there is no basis for the finding that K.P.’s use of a hand-held\ncalculator would, in fact, render the test results i nvalid.  (Pl.’s Objs. at 7.)  Once again, the Court\ndisagrees.  The record shows that the MAP test’s cr eator:  (1) deems the use of a hand-held calculator\n6Case: 1:14-cv-07296 Document #: 33 Filed: 02/25/15 Page 6 of 9 PageID #:<pageID>to be a non-standard accommodation, i.e., one that has the potential to bias the score; (2) cautions\nschools that “the greater the use of non-standard acco mmodations . . . , the weaker the validity of the\ninference that can be drawn from the student’s score,” and discourages them from relying on suchinferences “to make important educational decisions”; and (3) makes schools responsible forinterpreting MAP test results and factoring the use of non-standard accommodations into thoseinterpretations.  (R&R at 4; see Def.’s Mem. Opp’n Pl.’s Mot. Prelim. Inj., Ex. 6, NWEA\nAccommodations for MAP® Assessments).  It further shows that defendant, the party vested withthe authority to and responsibility for interpreting the test results, deems MAP scores obtained by astudent who uses a hand-held calculator throughout the test to be invalid.  (Def.’s Mem. Opp’n Pl.’sMot. Prelim. Inj., Ex. 4, Barker Decl. ¶¶ 1, 13-14 (testimony of defendant’s Chief AccountabilityOfficer that, based on the NWEA guidance,“[i]f defe ndant learn[s] that a student used a non-standard\naccommodation, his/her score will be invalidated” and will not be used for determining eligibility forselective enrollment high school testing or admissions). )  In short, Judge Cole’s conclusion that the\naccommodation plaintiff seeks is unreasonable because  it would invalidate he r MAP test results is\nfully supported by the record.\nFinally, plaintiff objects to Judge Cole’s determination that the public interest disfavors\ninjunctive relief because K.P.’s use of a hand-held  calculator would give her more time to complete\nthe test than other students.  (Pl.’s Objs. at 3; see R&R at 16.)  Plaintiff asserts that the MAP test is\nnot timed, and thus the “advantage” identified by the Magistrate Judge is illusory.  Even if plaintiff’s\nassertion about the test is true, and she cites no evidence to support it, that fact would not changeJudge Cole’s conclusion about the public interest factor.  Rather, as the R&R makes clear, Judge\n7Case: 1:14-cv-07296 Document #: 33 Filed: 02/25/15 Page 7 of 9 PageID #:<pageID>Cole’s conclusion was based on the overall advantage over other students that the requested\naccommodation would give K.P.:\n[I]f plaintiffs’ contention is accepted, while other students are working through\nmathematical calculations in their head as best as their capabilities will permit, withinevitable mistakes, K.P. need only turn to her calculator to achieve likely perfectresults.  Moreover, because of the increased speed with which the calculator willenable her to go through the problems, K.P. will have more time than other studentsto answer the more difficult questions as she progresses through the phases of theTest, thereby effectively multiplying K.P.’s extra time accommodation as well.\nThe only sticking point might be if the plaintiffs’ contention – which is unsupported\nby any evidence – that incorrect answers on the calculation questions will rob K.P.of her opportunity to answer questions about mathematical concepts is correct.  Evenif it is, though, there is an inequity when the other students are considered.  Supposethere is an “adaptive” basketball skills competition that includes a dunk portion andthree-point shooting portion.  For every successful dunk, a player gets 5 three-pointshot attempts. One player – who has no problem shooting long range – has a handicapthat prevents him from jumping and he demands and receives a ten-foot ladder for thedunk portion of the Test.  The accommodated player is guaranteed not only a perfect\nscore on the dunk contest, but far more three-point attempts that the other players.That’s not a “level playing field,” and the public interest in fairness to the otherplayers – the other students here – is compromised.     \n(R&R at 16-17.)  Because the time element was not determinative of the public interest inquiry,\nJudge Cole’s alleged error is not a basis for rejecting his conclusion.\n8Case: 1:14-cv-07296 Document #: 33 Filed: 02/25/15 Page 8 of 9 PageID #:<pageID>Conclusion\nFor the reasons set forth above, the Court overrules plaintiff’s objections to Magistrate Judge\nCole’s R&R, adopts the R&R [21] in its entirety, and denies plaintiff’s motion for a preliminaryinjunction [4].\nSO ORDERED.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: Plaintiff Brendan Baker filed a class action lawsuit against CVS, alleging that during his job application process for a position in Massachusetts, he was unlawfully subjected to a lie detector test without the required notice of this statutory right under Massachusetts law. The case involves the use of a video-interview technology by HireVue, which utilizes artificial intelligence to analyze applicants' responses and provide employability scores, allegedly functioning as a lie detector test. The court denied CVS's motion to dismiss the claim that CVS violated the notice provision of Massachusetts' Lie Detector Statute.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether Massachusetts' Lie Detector Statute allows for a private right of action for its notice provision when allegedly violated and whether the use of HireVue technology constitutes a lie detector test within the meaning of the statute.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court held that the plaintiff had standing to pursue the claim regarding the failure to provide statutory notice, as he alleged that he participated in the HireVue interview without being informed of his rights. The court also held that the statute unambiguously authorizes a lawsuit for the violation of its notice provision and thus denied CVS's motions to dismiss.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine you wanted to get a job at a big store, and during the application, they asked you questions through a video while secretly trying to figure out if you're lying, using a fancy computer program. This computer program was supposed to be like a lie detector. There’s a local law that says stores can't do this without giving you a heads-up first, and if they do, you can take them to court. The court said you (and possibly others who had the same experience) have the right to complain to a judge because the store didn’t tell you about your rights and because a computer program might've been used to check if you were telling the truth without your knowledge.",

(collectively “CVS”)  under Mass. Gen. Laws ch.  149, § 19B \n(“Lie Detector Statute”) . Baker alleges that when he applied for \na job with CVS, CVS unlawfully subjected him to a lie detector \ntest and failed to provide him required notice of his  statutory  \nrights.  \nThe second amended complaint  contains  three counts. First, \nBaker seeks a declaratory judgment that CVS’s application process \nviolates Massachusetts law and an injunction on that process 2 \n (Count I). Second, Baker alleges that CVS violated Mass. Gen. Laws \nch. 149, § 19B(2) by subjecting him to a lie detector test \n(Count II). Third, Baker alleges that CVS violated Mass. Gen. Laws \nch. 149, § 19B(2)(b) by failing to provide him required noti ce of \nhis statutory rights (Count III).1 Baker seeks to represent a class \nof “[a]ll persons who applied for a Massachusetts CVS position” \nand a sub -class of all applicants who “participated in a CVS \nHireVue Interview ,” which Baker alleges constituted a li e detector \ntest. Dkt. 35 at 8.  \nDefendants do not challenge the sufficiency of the claims \nthat CVS violate d the Lie Detector Statute. CVS moves to dismiss \nonly the third count , arguing that the Lie Detector Statute  does \nnot create a private right of action to enforce its notice \nprovisions  (Dkt. 22), and alternatively,  that Baker lacks  Article \nIII standing to challenge the lack of notice  (Dkt. 42). After \nhearing,  the Court DENIES CVS’s motions to dismiss Count III \n(Dkts. 22 & 42). \nBACKGROUND  \nI.  Statutory Scheme  \n The Lie Detector Statute  prohibits employers in Massachusetts \nfrom subjecting employees or applicants to lie detector tests  as \n \n1 Baker’s second amended complaint contains two counts listed as \n“Count II.” See Dkt. 35 at 10 -11. The Court treats the second of \nthose -- Baker’s notice -violation claim -- as “Count III.”  3 \n a condition of employment or continued employment . Mass. Gen. Laws \nch. 149, § 19B(2) . Under the statute, a lie detector test is:  \n[A]ny test utilizing a polygraph or any other device, \nmechanism, instrument  or written examination, which is \noperated, or the results of which are used or interpreted \nby an examiner for the purpose of purporting to assist \nin or enable the detection of deception, the \nverification of truthfulness, or the rendering of a \ndiagnostic o pinion regarding the honesty of an \nindividual.  \n \nId. § 19B(1). Subsection (2) provides:  \nIt shall be unlawful for any employer or his agent, with \nrespect to any of his employees, or any person applying \nto him for employment  . . . to subject such person to, \nor request such person to take a lie detector test . . . \nor to discharge, not hire, demote or otherwise \ndiscriminate against such person for the assertion of \nrights arising hereunder . . . . \n \n(a) The fact that such lie detector test was to be, \nor was, admin istered outside the commonwealth for \nemployment within the commonwealth shall not be a valid \ndefense to an action brought under the provisions of \nsubsection (3) or (4).  \n \n(b) All applications for employment within the \ncommonwealth shall contain the followin g notice which \nshall be in clearly legible print:  \n \n“It is unlawful in Massachusetts to require or \nadminister a lie detector test as a condition of \nemployment or continued employment. An employer who \nviolates this law shall be subject to criminal penalties \nand civil liability. ” \n \nId. § 19B(2).  Finally, Subsection (4) states :  \n \nAny person aggrieved by a violation of subsection (2) \nmay institute within three years of such violation and \nprosecute in his own name and on his own behalf, or for \nhimself and for other similarly situated, a civil action \nfor injunctive relief and any dama ges thereby incurred, 4 \n including treble damages for any loss of wages or other \nbenefits.  \n \nId. § 19B(4).   \n \nII.  CVS’s Application  Process \nDrawing all inferences  in favor of Baker, the Court accepts \nthe following  factual allegations  from the second amended \ncomplaint  as true. Around January 2021, Baker applied for a supply \nchain position  in Massachusetts  with CVS. The application,  which \nCVS posted online, did not include the notice of rights mandated  \nby the Lie Detector  Statute.  \nTo screen applicants , CVS administers a video-interview  \ntechnology developed by a company called HireVue, Inc.  (“HireVue \nInterview ”). During the HireVue Interview, a n applicant answers a \nseries of questions while being video -recorded. These include \nquestions like “What does integrity mean to you?”, “What would you \ndo if you saw someone cheating on a test?”, and “Tell me about a \ntime that you acted with integrity.” Dkt. 35 at 5. HireVue then \nuploads recordings of applicants’  responses t o a third -party \nplatform  called Affectiva , which  analyzes candidates’ facial \nexpressions, eye contact, voice intonation, and inflection using \nartificial intelligence. Through Affectiva, HireVue  uses data from \nan applicant’s  interview recording to  “draw[] conclusions \nregarding [her] degree of cultural fit” with CVS . Id. at 6. HireVue \nconveys its findings to CVS with a numerical “employability score” 5 \n or “competency -level scoring report”  for each applicant.  Id. at 7 \n(cleaned up).  HireVue has stated that it  can detect  whether a n \napplicant “[h]as an innate sense of integrity and honor,” help \nwith “lie detection” and “screen[ing] out embellishers ,” and \norganize applicant  competencies including “reliability, honesty, \n[and] integrity.” Id. at 5, 7-8.  \nDuring Baker’s application process, CVS administered a \nHireVue Interview  on him. Dkt. 35 at 2 , 4. He was “unaware, at the \ntime, that the HireVue Interview was a lie detector t est,” and \nstates that if he had been, “he would not have participated in the \nHireVue Interview.” Id. at 3. \nDISCUSSION  \nI.  Standing   \n CVS argues that Baker lacks standing to bring his notice claim \nbecause he has plead ed only a bare procedural violation without \nshowing concrete harm. “To establish Article III standing, a \nplaintiff must show (1) an injury in fact, (2) a sufficient causal \nconnection between the injury and the conduct complained of, and \n(3) a likelihood that the injury will be redressed by a favorable \ndecision.”  Susan B. Anthony List v. Driehaus , 573 U.S. 149, 157-58 \n(2014) (cleaned up) . An “injury in fact” must be “both \nconcrete  and particularized”  and “actual or imminent,  not \nconjectural  or hypothetical.”  Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins, 578 U.S. 6 \n 330, 339 (2016) (quoting  Lujan v. Defs. of Wildlife , 504 U.S. 555, \n560 (1992)) .  \n“[T]he Supreme Court has repeatedly  said that denial of \ninformation  to which plaintiffs  have a legal right can be a \nconcrete  injury in fact.” Laufer v. Acheson Hotels, LLC, 50 F.4th \n259, 269 (1st Cir. 2022) (first citing Fed. Election  Comm’n v. \nAkins, 524 U.S. 11, 20-21 (1998); and then citing Pub. Citizen v. \nU.S. Dep’t of Just., 491 U.S. 440, 449-50 (1989)),  vacated as moot, \n601 U.S. 1 (2023). In some circumstances,  the Court has treated \nplaintiffs’  “asserted  uses for the information  they sought” as \nimmaterial  to the standing  analysis . Laufer v. Naranda Hotels, \nLLC, 60 F.4th 156, 170 (4th Cir. 2023); see, e.g., Havens Realty \nCorp. v. Coleman, 455 U.S. 363, 373-74 (1982) (“A tester who has \nbeen the object of a misrepresentation  made unlawful  under [the \nstatute]  . . . has standing  to maintain  a claim for damages under \nthe Act’s provisions.”);  Pub. Citizen, 491 U.S. at 449 (“Our \ndecisions  . . . have never suggested  that those requesting  \ninformation  . . . need show more than that they sought and were \ndenied specific  agency records.”) ; see also Akins, 524 U.S. at 21 \n(“{A] plaintiff  suffers an ‘injury in fact’ when the plaintiff  \nfails to obtain information  which must be publicly  disclosed  \npursuant  to a statute.”).   \nHowever,  the Supreme Court’s recent decision  in TransUnion  \nLLC v. Ramirez muddied the waters. 594 U.S. 413 (2021). There, the 7 \n named plaintiff  sued a credit-reporting  agency under the Fair \nCredit Reporting  Act, which requires  that agencies  “disclose  to \nthe consumer  all information  in the consumer’s  file” upon request \nand provide a “summary  of rights” with “each written disclosure.”  \nId. at 418-19 (cleaned  up). He alleged, among other things, that \nwhen he requested  a copy of his credit file, the defendant  \ninitially  sent an incomplete  file along with the required  summary \nof rights, and then a day later, sent him the rest of his file \nwithout another summary of rights. The Court held that because the \nplaintiff  had ”not allege[d] that [he] failed to receive any \nrequired  information ,” rather “only that [he] received  it in the \nwrong format,” Akins and Public Citizen were distinguishable.  Id. \nat 441 (emphasis  omitted) . “Moreover, ” the Court held, “the \nplaintiff [] ha[d] identified  no ‘downstream  consequences’  from \nfailing to receive the required  information.”  Id. at 442. Thus, \nthe plaintiff’s  alleged informational  injury did not support \nArticle III standing.  \nThe legal question  is how to apply TransUnion  in light of the \n“informational  injury” cases that preceded  it. Since TransUnion , \nsome circuits  have held that plaintiffs  asserting  informational  \ninjuries  must show “(1) the denial of information  and (2) some \nconsequence  caused by that omission”  that has “some relevance”  to \nan interest  that the statute was intended  to protect.  Kelly v. \nRealPage  Inc., 47 F.4th 202, 213 (3d Cir. 2022); Laufer v. Looper, 8 \n 22 F.4th 871, 881 & n.6 (10th Cir. 2022); accord Harty v. W. Point \nRealty, Inc., 28 F.4th 435, 444 (2d Cir. 2022). Other circuits  \nhave narrowly  construed  TransUnion ’s discussion  of “downstream  \nconsequences”  as applying  only to the type of informational  injury \nat issue there: receiving  required  information  in the wrong format. \nSee, e.g., Laufer, 60 F.4th at 170 (holding that because “Havens \nRealty squarely  rejected  [a] use requirement”  and TransUnion  did \nnot overrule  Havens Realty, “any use requirement  is limited to the \ntype of informational  injury at issue in TransUnion  and does not \nextend to the type of informational  injury presented  in Public \nCitizen and Akins”). \nEven under an expansive  interpretation  of TransUnion , Baker \nhas pleaded a concrete  informational  injury. Baker alleges that he \nwas denied the notice of his rights under the Lie Detector  Statute,  \nnot that he received  notice in the wrong format. Additionally,  he \nhas plausibly  alleged that as a downstream  consequence  of not \nreceiving  notice, he participated  in a HireVue Interview.  Although  \nthe notice would not have specifically  informed  Baker that the \nHireVue Interview  was a lie detector  test, it would have primed \nhim to view the interview  more critically . Baker’s injury is of \nthe kind the statute was designed  to protect.  Accordingly , CVS’s \nRule 12(b)(1)  motion (Dkt. 42) is DENIED.2 \n \n2 Applicants  who never took the HireVue Interview may well be in a \ndifferent boat on  the standing question . 9 \n II.  Statutory  Interpretation  \nCVS also argues that the Lie Detector Statute does not \nauthorize suits to enforce its notice provision. Statutory \ninterpretation starts with the plain language of the \nstatute.  See United States v. Lachman, 387 F.3d 42, 50 (1st Cir. \n2004). Here, the Lie Detector  Statute authorizes  suit by “[a]ny \nperson aggrieved  by a violation  of subsection  (2),” which includes  \nthe notice requirement.  Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 149, § 19B(4); see id. \n§ 19B(2)(b).  CVS’s appeals to the Lie Detector  Statute’s  \nlegislative  history are unavailing  because the statutory  language  \nis unambiguous.  See Gen. Motors Corp. v. Darling’s, 444 F.3d 98, \n108 (1st Cir. 2006). Accordingly, CVS’s Rule 12(b)(6) motion  \n(Dkt. 22) is DENIED. \nORDER \nThis Court DENIES CVS’s motion s to dismiss for failure to \nstate a claim (Dkt. 22) and for lack of standing (Dkt. 42) .  \n \nSO ORDERED.  \n       \n/s/ PATTI B.

    "summary": "1. **Summary:** The case involves Plaintiff Medicare Advantage customers suing UnitedHealth Group and others, alleging that UHC unreasonably denied their post-acute care claims using an AI program called nH Predict. The court partially grants UHC's motion to dismiss, allowing the claims for breach of contract and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing to proceed, but dismisses most other claims due to federal preemption and failure to exhaust administrative remedies.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue:** Whether Plaintiffs' claims, particularly relating to the denial of benefits using AI, must first be subjected to exhaustion of administrative remedies under the Medicare Act, and if those claims are preempted by federal law.\n\n3. **Court's Holding:** The court waived the exhaustion requirement due to futility and irreparable harm but found most of the Plaintiffs' claims preempted by federal law. Only the breach of contract and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing claims survive preemption.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation:** The people in this case are claiming that their health plan unfairly used a computer program instead of doctors to decide not to pay for their healthcare, making them suffer. Normally, they would have to go through a long process of asking for help before taking the issue to court, but the judge decided they didn't have to because it seemed like UHC was making it too hard by repeatedly denying claims. However, most of their claims can't be looked at by the court because there are federal rules that take priority over state rules when it comes to Medicare health plans. So, only a couple of their complaints can keep going—they have to do with whether or not UHC broke their promises in the insurance agreement.",

(collectively “UHC”).  Each Plaintiff \nsought coverage for post-acute care, and each was eventually denied that coverage.  \nThese denials resulted in worsening injuries and death in some cases.  Plaintiffs, on behalf \nof themselves and others similarly situated, bring seven causes of action under state law \ntheories alleging that UHC’s use of an artificial intelligence program, called nH Predict, to \ndeny coverage was unreasonable.   \nUHC filed a motion to dismiss Plaintiffs’ claims.  Because all of Plaintiffs’ claims are \ninexplicably intertwined with a claim for benefits, all of Plaintiffs’ claims are subject to the \nexhaustion of administrative remedies requirement.  The Court, however, will waive \nexhaustion on futility grounds.  Notwithstanding a waiver of the exhaustion requirement, \nthe broad preemption provision in the Medicare Act results in most of Plaintiffs’ claims \nbeing preempted.  Plaintiffs’ claims for breach of contract and breach of the implied \ncovenant of good faith and fair dealing, however, survive preemption because those \nclaims do not aim to regulate the same subject matter as the federal standards.  In other \nwords, the Court need only review insurance documents to resolve these claims.  The \nCourt will grant in part and deny in part UHC’s motion to dismiss, allowing the breach of \ncontract and breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing claims to proceed.  \nBACKGROUND \nI. FACTS \nPlaintiffs purchased Medicare Advantage (“MA”) health insurance coverage from \nUHC.  (Am. Compl. ¶¶ 30, 32, Apr. 5, 2024, Docket No. 34.)  UHC sold MA plans as an CASE 0:23-cv-03514-JRT-SGE     Doc. 91     Filed 02/13/25     Page 2 of 24-3- \n alternative to traditional Medicare.  ( Id. ¶¶ 30–31.)  When Plaintiffs purchased MA plans, \nUHC provided a written insurance contract which included a requirement to “provide \nbenefits for covered health services and [] pay all reasonable and medically necessary \nexpenses.”  ( Id. ¶ 32.)  UHC’s insurance agreements also state, “UnitedHealthcare’s \nClinical Services Staff and Physicians make decisions on the health care services you \nreceive based on the appropriateness of care and service and existence of coverage.”  ( Id. \n¶ 187.)   \nOne service that MA plans cover is “post-acute care” which is “medically necessary \ncare” following serious illness or injury.  ( Id. ¶¶ 33–34.)  Post-acute care is covered \nthrough a prospective payment system, meaning that patient claims are evaluated before \nor during treatment.  ( Id. ¶¶ 35–36.)  As such, claim denial can result in termination of \nactive post-acute services or refusal of services before they even commence.  ( Id. ¶¶ 36–\n37.)  When claims are denied, patients must choose to forgo treatment or pay out of \npocket for the services.  ( Id. ¶ 36.)    \nAfter a claim is denied, the Medicare Act outlines a four-level appeals process \nthrough which patients can challenge their coverage denial.  ( Id. ¶ 46.)  First, a patient \nmust appeal to Quality Improvement Organizations (“QIO”), which are independent third-\nparty organizations established to review claims determinations, per the Medicare Act.  \n(Id. ¶¶ 45–46.)  If the QIO affirms the denial, then, the patient may apply for \nreconsideration by the same QIO.  ( Id. ¶ 46.)  Then, if the QIO does not change its position, CASE 0:23-cv-03514-JRT-SGE     Doc. 91     Filed 02/13/25     Page 3 of 24-4- \n the patient may appear before an Administrative Law Judge.  ( Id.)  The final step includes \na hearing before the Medicare Appeals Council.  ( Id.) \nAll Plaintiffs submitted either a pre-authorization or a claim for benefits for post-\nacute care.  ( Id. ¶ 33.)  All claims were eventually denied.  ( Id. ¶¶ 36–37.)  Plaintiffs \nappealed their denials to differing points in the appeals process, but none completed the \nentire appeals procedure.  ( Id. ¶¶ 66–67, 77, 80, 83, 92, 106, 113, 122, 133, 136, 143, 146, \n156.)  Many Plaintiffs paid out of pocket for continuing care, while others went without \ncare.  (E.g. Id. ¶¶ 68, 86.)  The Amended Complaint alleges that Plaintiffs suffered \nworsening injury, illness, or death as a result of the denials.  ( Id. ¶¶ 109, 149.)  \nPlaintiffs claim that UHC used an artificial intelligence program, nH Predict AI \nModel (“nH Predict”), in lieu of physicians to make coverage determinations.  ( Id. ¶¶ 37–\n38.)  nH Predict compares the specific patient with similar patients and recommends an \nestimated amount of post-acute care needed.  ( Id. ¶ 39.)  Plaintiffs contend that UHC used \nthis model to determine the amount of coverage an individual patient needed, regardless \nof the recommendation made by their treating physician.  ( Id. ¶¶ 38–39.)  Plaintiffs \ndescribe the nH Predict as applying “rigid criteria” that UHC required its employees to \nfollow under the threat of termination.  ( Id. ¶ 42.)  Additionally, Plaintiffs allege that UHC \nknew of nH Predict’s inaccuracies because over 90% of claim denials are reversed on \nappeal and over 80% of preauthorization denials are reversed.  ( Id. ¶ 47.)  UHC denies any \nuse of nH Predict.  (Def.’s Reply at 10 n.1, July 15, 2024, Docket No. 65.)  CASE 0:23-cv-03514-JRT-SGE     Doc. 91     Filed 02/13/25     Page 4 of 24-5- \n Plaintiffs also allege that UHC has frustrated the appeals process.  (Am. Compl. ¶¶ \n48–49, 53.)   Plaintiffs claim that when a patient has a denial overturned, UHC \nimmediately issues another denial letter such that the patient is perpetually stuck in a \nloop of denial, appeal, denial until eventually they give up.  ( Id. ¶ 49.)  Additionally, \nPlaintiffs accuse UHC of approving any appeals that reach the late stages so that \nadministrative remedies are never exhausted.  ( Id. ¶ 53.) \nII. PROCEDURAL HISTORY  \nPlaintiffs filed their original class action complaint on November 14, 2023.  (Compl., \nDocket No. 1.)  Plaintiffs amended their class action complaint on April 5, 2024.  (Am. \nCompl.)  Plaintiffs Amended Complaint includes seven state law causes of action: breach \nof contract, breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, unjust \nenrichment, insurance bad faith, negligence per se, unfair and deceptive insurance \npractices, and unfair competition.  ( Id. ¶¶ 183–275.)  Plaintiffs seek damages as well as \ndeclaratory and injunctive relief.  ( Id. at 58.) UHC filed a motion to dismiss for lack of \njurisdiction for failure to exhaust administrative remedies and also for failure to state a \nclaim upon which relief can be granted based on a theory of preemption.  (Mot. Dismiss, \nMay 20, 2024, Docket No. 41.)   CASE 0:23-cv-03514-JRT-SGE     Doc. 91     Filed 02/13/25     Page 5 of 24-6- \n DISCUSSION \nI. STANDARD OF REVIEW \nArticle III of the Constitution requires that every matter before a court be a case or \ncontroversy.  U.S. C ONST. art. III, § 2.  This requirement must be met throughout all stages \nof the case, not just when the case is filed.  See Burke v. Barnes , 479 U.S. 361, 363 (1987). \nIn deciding a motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1), the \nCourt must first “distinguish between a ‘facial attack’ and a ‘factual attack.’”  Osborn v. \nUnited States , 918 F.2d 724, 729 n.6 (8th Cir. 1990) (quoting Menchaca v. Chrysler Credit \nCorp., 613 F.2d 507, 511 (5th Cir. 1980)).  A facial challenge requires the court to \n“determine whether the asserted jurisdictional basis is patently meritless by looking to \nthe face of the complaint . . . and drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the \nplaintiff.”  Biscanin v. Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc. , 407 F.3d 905, 907 (8th Cir. 2005) (citations \nomitted).  In a factual attack, the nonmoving party “does not have the benefit of 12(b)(6) \nsafeguards” and the court “inquires into and resolves factual disputes.”  Faibisch v. Univ. \nof Minn., 304 F.3d 797, 801 (8th Cir. 2002).1  \nIn reviewing a motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), the \nCourt considers all facts alleged in the complaint as true to determine if the complaint \nstates a “claim to relief that is plausible on its face.”  Braden v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. , 588 \n \n \n1 overruled in part on other grounds by Slayden v. Ctr. for Behav. Med. , 53 F.4th 464, 469 \nn.4 (8th Cir. 2022).  CASE 0:23-cv-03514-JRT-SGE     Doc. 91     Filed 02/13/25     Page 6 of 24-7- \n F.3d 585, 594 (8th Cir. 2009) (quoting Ashcroft v. Iqbal , 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009)).  “A claim \nhas facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to \ndraw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.”  \nIqbal, 556 U.S. at 678.  The Court construes the complaint in the light most favorable to \nthe plaintiff, drawing all inferences in the plaintiff’s favor.  Ashley Cnty., v. Pfizer, Inc. , 552 \nF.3d 659, 665 (8th Cir. 2009).  Although the Court accepts the complaint’s factual \nallegations as true and construes the complaint in a light most favorable to the plaintiff, \nit is “not bound to accept as true a legal conclusion couched as a factual allegation.”  \nPapasan v. Allain , 478 U.S. 265, 286 (1986).  In other words, a complaint “does not need \ndetailed factual allegations” but must include “more than labels and conclusions, and a \nformulaic recitation of the elements” to meet the plausibility standard.  Bell Atl. Corp. v. \nTwombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007).  \nII. ANALYSIS  \nPlaintiffs’ claims face two potential challenges: (1) failure to exhaust administrative \nremedies and (2) federal preemption.  Courts differ in how to evaluate these two issues, \noften blurring the requirements and language, but because failure to exhaust is a \njurisdictional issue, the Court will consider this issue first and then evaluate federal \npreemption.  See generally Yeomans v. Blue Shield of Cal. , 712 F. Supp. 3d 1336, 1343–46 \n(C.D. Cal. 2024).  Because UHC challenges only the allegations in the complaint, the Court \nconstrues the motion as a facial attack on subject matter jurisdiction.  BP Chems. Ltd. v. \nJiangsu Sopo Corp. , 285 F.3d 677, 680 (8th Cir. 2002). CASE 0:23-cv-03514-JRT-SGE     Doc. 91     Filed 02/13/25     Page 7 of 24-8- \n A. Exhaustion  \nThe Court must first determine if Plaintiffs’ claims are subject to the administrative \nexhaustion requirements and, if so, whether Plaintiffs met those requirements.  \n1. Applicability of Exhaustion Requirements \nAny claim arising out of the Medicare Act is subject to administrative exhaustion \ngoverned by Section 405(g) and (h) of the Social Security Act.  42 U.S.C. §§ 405(g)–(h), \n1395ff(b)(1)(A); Heckler v. Ringer , 466 U.S. 602, 605, 614–15 (1984); c.f. Weinberger v. \nSalfi, 422 U.S. 749, 760 (1975) (describing exhaustion of claims arising under the Social \nSecurity Act).  In other words, one must receive a “final decision” by the Secretary before \nbringing an action in federal court.2  42 U.S.C. § 405(g).   \nA claim arises under the Medicare Act when either (1) the “standing and \nsubstantive basis for the presentation” of the claims is the Medicare Act, or (2) it is \n“inextricably intertwined” with a Medicare benefits determination.  Ringer, 466 U.S. at \n614–15.  Claims are “inextricably intertwined” when, despite being brought under \ndifferent laws, they are nothing more than a challenge to a benefits decision.  Id. at 614; \nsee also Reuben v. Ziemer , No. 23-3423, 2024 WL 2477049, at *2–3 (D. Minn. May 1, 2024) \n(finding a claim was “inextricably intertwined” even when the complaint did not reference \n \n \n2 UHC argues that it is not the proper defendant and instead the claims should have been \nbrought against the Secretary.  However, private entities acting on behalf of the United States or \nthe Secretary as a Medicare Advantage Organization are subject to federal action.  Midland \nPsychiatric Assocs., Inc. v. United States , 145 F.3d 1000, 1003–04 (8th Cir. 1998);  Reuben v. Ziemer , \nNo. 23-3423, 2024 WL 2477049, at *3 (D. Minn. May 1, 2024). CASE 0:23-cv-03514-JRT-SGE     Doc. 91     Filed 02/13/25     Page 8 of 24-9- \n the Medicare Act).  In fact, even some claims that challenge Center for Medicare and \nMedicaid Services (“CMS”) regulations themselves arise under the Medicare Act because \nthey originate out of a denial of benefits.  Phillips v. Kaiser Found. Health Plan, Inc. , 953 F. \nSupp. 2d 1078, 1089 (N.D. Cal. 2011) (finding state law claims that challenged a Medicare \nAdvantage Organization’s conduct as violating the Medicare Act to constitute a claim for \nbenefits that must be exhausted).  \nAlthough Plaintiffs challenge the process of making the denial decision instead of \nthe denial itself, their claims clearly arise from a denial of benefits.  Plaintiffs ultimately \ntake issue with the fact that coverage was denied, and courts generally take an expansive \nview of “arising under” the Medicare Act.  See, e.g., Ringer, 466 U.S. at 614–15.  The \nPlaintiffs’ claims arise under the Medicare Act and are subject to the exhaustion \nrequirements.   \n2. Satisfaction of Exhaustion Requirements \nExhaustion requires two elements: (1) a nonwaivable presentment requirement, \nand (2) a waivable exhaustion requirement.  Bowen v. City of N.Y. , 476 U.S. 467, 483 \n(1986).   \nPresentment is satisfied where plaintiffs submitted a claim for benefits.  Ringer, \n466 U.S. at 617.  All Plaintiffs had claims denied, which means they submitted claims for \nbenefits and thus met the presentment requirement for exhaustion purposes.  However, \nno plaintiff has followed a claim through the entire appeals process and received a final \ndecision by the Medicare Appeals Council. CASE 0:23-cv-03514-JRT-SGE     Doc. 91     Filed 02/13/25     Page 9 of 24-10- \n Since Plaintiffs admit exhaustion has not been completed, the Court must \ndetermine whether exhaustion should be waived.  Waiver is appropriate when (1) the \nclaims are collateral, (2) irreparable injury would follow, and (3) exhaustion would be \nfutile.  Mathews v. Eldridge , 424 U.S. 319, 330–31 (1976); see also Bowen , 476 U.S. at 485. \nFirst, the Court finds it difficult to conceive of a situation where claims that arise \nunder the Medicare Act could also be “wholly collateral” to their overall claim for benefits \nunder the Act.  In re Heritage Sw. Med. Grp., P.A. , 309 B.R. 916, 920 (N.D. Tex. 2004); see \nalso Kaiser v. Blue Cross of Calif. , 347 F.3d 1107, 1115 (9th Cir. 2003).   So, while Plaintiffs \naccurately cite other precedent that presents similar factual circumstances where courts \nfound the claims were collateral, those cases did not first evaluate whether the claims \narose out of the underlying Act.  See Schoolcraft v. Sullivan , 971 F.2d 81, 86 (8th Cir. 1992) \n(evaluating a challenge to the appeals process of the Social Security Act); Bowen, 476 U.S. \nat 485 (same).  Because the claims arise out of the Medicare Act, the Court concludes that \nit cannot find the claims are “wholly collateral” to the Plaintiffs’ claims for benefits.    \nSecond, a finding that the claims are not wholly collateral is not dispositive, \nbecause the Plaintiffs allegedly suffered irreparable harm and showed the futility of \nexhausting administrative remedies.  Bowen, 476 U.S. at 484 (“The ultimate decision of \nwhether to waive exhaustion should not be made solely by mechanical application of the \nEldridge factors, but should also be guided by the policies underlying the exhaustion \nrequirement.”).  Further, the Eighth Circuit has not conclusively determined, and circuits CASE 0:23-cv-03514-JRT-SGE     Doc. 91     Filed 02/13/25     Page 10 of 24-11- \n differ, whether all three factors need to be met before waiver is appropriate.  Compare \nTitus v. Sullivan , 4 F.3d 590, 592 (8th Cir. 1993) (combining the waiver requirements with \n“and”) with In Home Health, Inc. v. Shalala , 272 F.3d 554, 560 (8th Cir. 2001) (combining \nthe waiver requirements with “ or”); see also Timmerman v. Thompson , No. 03-5221, 2004 \nWL 1765285, at *3–4 (D. Minn. Aug. 5, 2004) (explaining that the Eighth Circuit has not \nresolved this issue).   \nIrreparable harm is shown when a “deferment of judicial review until exhaustion \nof administrative remedies would cause [plaintiffs] injury that cannot be remedied by \nlater payment of the benefits requested.” Martin v. Shalala , 63 F.3d 497, 505 (7th Cir. \n1995); see also Manakee Pro. Med. Transfer Serv.,  Inc. v. Shalala , 71 F.3d 574, 581 (6th Cir. \n1995) (citing Eldridge, 424 U.S. at 331).  The Court has found no irreparable harm when \nbenefits continued during a pending appeal.  Timmerman , 2004 WL 1765285, at *5.  The \nfact that post-acute care claims require preauthorization or ongoing authorization makes \nthese claims unique because in order to continue receiving care, people often have to pay \nfor care themselves.  ( See, e.g., Am. Compl. ¶ 68.)  As evidenced in the Amended \nComplaint, many patients who had to decline treatment later suffered worsening injuries \nand even death.  Plaintiffs have therefore shown irreparable harm.   \nThird, UHC’s actions that make any attempt to fully exhaust the administrative \nremedies futile support a waiver determination.  The futility prong addresses whether \npursuit of relief through the administrative process will “serve the purposes of CASE 0:23-cv-03514-JRT-SGE     Doc. 91     Filed 02/13/25     Page 11 of 24-12- \n exhaustion, and not be futile in the context of the system.” Kaiser, 347 F.3d at 1115.  \nExhaustion serves to “prevent[] premature interference with agency processes, so that \nthe agency may function efficiently and so that it may have an opportunity to correct its \nown errors, to afford the parties and the courts the benefit of its experience and \nexpertise, and to compile a record . . . .” Id. at 1115 n.4 (quoting Salfi, 422 U.S. at 765).   \nTwo allegations, taken as true at the motion to dismiss stage, make the appeals \nprocess futile.  First, UHC allegedly issues repeated denials any time a patient is successful \non appeal.  As a result, any time a patient gets a denial overturned, another denial is on \nits way.  Second, for the very few appeals that reach the end of the appeals process, UHC \nallegedly pays the claims and terminates the process.  As alleged in the Complaint, this \npractice would make it virtually impossible for any claim to progress through the entire \nfour-step appeals process and be ripe for judicial review.  Thus, the irreparable injury and \nfutility of the appeals process suggests that waiver of administrative exhaustion is \nappropriate.  \nThe Medicare Act is clear in declaring that any claim “arising under” the Medicare \nAct must first progress through the administrative process before a district court can \nexercise jurisdiction.  While the exhaustion of administrative remedies is required in \nalmost every case, it is not absolute.  There are unique circumstances in which it is CASE 0:23-cv-03514-JRT-SGE     Doc. 91     Filed 02/13/25     Page 12 of 24-13- \n appropriate for the Court to waive that requirement.3  Here, the Court is presented with \nsuch a case.  These Plaintiffs allegedly suffered great harm, up to and including death, \nbecause of an allegedly defective procedure of denying claims compounded by efforts to \nobliterate any means of effective review through the administrative process.  As a result, \nthe Court will find that although Plaintiffs’ claims were subject to administrative review, \nwaiver is appropriate such that the Court can exercise jurisdiction.  \nB. Federal Preemption \nThe Court must next determine if any of the claims fail to state a claim upon which \nrelief can be granted because they are preempted by federal law.   \nUnder the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution, federal law “shall be the supreme \nLaw of the Land; and the Judges in every State shall be bound thereby any Thing in the \nConstitution or Laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding.”  U.S. Const. art. VI, cl. \n2.  In other words, “state laws that conflict with federal law are without effect.”  Altria \nGrp., Inc. v. Good , 555 U.S. 70, 76 (2008) (citation and quotation omitted).  “The purpose \nof Congress is the ultimate touchstone in every pre-emption case.”  Id. (cleaned up).  The \nCourt begins its “analysis with the assumption that the historic police powers of the States \nare not to be superseded by the Federal Act unless that was the clear and manifest \n \n \n3 UHC contends that waiver is only applicable for Constitutional claims relying on Califano \nv. Sanders , 430 U.S. 99, 109 (1977).  However, Califano merely indicates that when a \nconstitutional question is at issue, there is a presumed judicial review.  Id.  That proposition alone \ndoes not foreclose the potential for waiver under other circumstances. CASE 0:23-cv-03514-JRT-SGE     Doc. 91     Filed 02/13/25     Page 13 of 24-14- \n purpose of Congress.”  Id. at 77 (cleaned up).  When the statute includes an express \npreemption provision, the Court must first look to the statutory language to determine \nCongress’s purpose.  Pharm. Care Mgmt. Ass’n v. Wehbi , 18 F.4th 956, 971 (8th Cir. 2021).   \nThe Medicare Act, as amended in 2003, states, “The standards established under \n[Part C] shall supersede any State law or regulation (other than State licensing laws or \nState laws relating to plan solvency) with respect to MA plans which are offered by MA \norganizations under [Part C].”  42 U.S.C. § 1395w-26(b)(3) (effective Dec. 8, 2003); 42 \nC.F.R. § 422.402.  Prior to the 2003 amendment, the preemption clause included a \nrequirement that the state law or regulation be “inconsistent” with the federal standard.  \n42 U.S.C. § 1395w-26(b)(3)(A) (effective Dec. 21, 2000 to Dec. 7, 2003).  In conjunction \nwith the amendment, CMS has issued several statements indicating that the amendment \nintended to expand the scope of the preemption clause, including the common law to the \nextent it would “specifically regulate an MA plan.”  Do Sung Uhm v. Humana, Inc. , 620 \nF.3d 1134, 1156 (9th Cir. 2010) (citing 70 Fed. Reg. 4588-01, 4665 (Jan. 28, 2005)).  All \ncourts accept that “standard” means a “statutory provision or a regulation promulgated \nunder [the Medicare Act] published in the Code of Federal Regulations.”  Wehbi, 18 F.4th \nat 971. \n1. Common Law Claims \nA threshold issue requires the Court to evaluate whether the preemption clause \ncategorically excludes common law claims under Sprietsma v. Mercury Marine , 537 U.S. \n51 (2002).  Despite the similarities, the Court finds that Sprietsma  is distinguishable.   CASE 0:23-cv-03514-JRT-SGE     Doc. 91     Filed 02/13/25     Page 14 of 24-15- \n In Sprietsma , the Supreme Court determined that the phrase “a law or regulation” \nin the Federal Boat Safety Act (“FBSA”) most likely excluded common law claims and only \nencompassed positive legal enactments.  Id. at 63.  Sprietsma  excluded common law \nclaims because of the article “a” and the occurrence of law and regulation together.  Id.  \nThe Supreme Court further noted the FBSA’s saving clause excludes common law liability \nfrom the preemption clause.  Id.  \nThe preemption clause in the Medicare Act differs from that in the FBSA in two \nsignificant ways.  First, it states “ any law or regulation” instead of “ a law or regulation.”  \n42 U.S.C. § 1395w-26(b)(3) (emphasis added); 46 U.S.C. § 4306 (emphasis added).   \nSecond, the Medicare Act contains no such savings clause for common law claims, and \ninstead only explicitly excludes state licensing and claims related to plan solvency.  42 \nU.S.C. § 1395w-26(b)(3); Northwest, Inc. v. Ginsberg , 572 U.S. 273, 283 (2014) (describing \nSprietsma ’s substantial reliance on the FBSA savings clause).  \nTrue, the Medicare Act preemption language mirrors that of the FBSA in that it \nuses both the terms “law” and “regulation.”  As in Sprietsma , that would indicate an \nintention to reference only positive enactments to avoid surplusage.  537 U.S. at 63.  \nHowever, the Medicare Act’s language differs by the use of “any” and the lack of a savings \nclause for common law claims.  The difference between “a” and “any” is significant \nbecause “a” implies “discreteness,” while “any” implies a more expansive scope.  \nCompare id.  (analyzing “a”) with Ali v. Fed. Bureau of Prisons , 552 U.S. 214, 218–19 (2008) CASE 0:23-cv-03514-JRT-SGE     Doc. 91     Filed 02/13/25     Page 15 of 24-16- \n (analyzing “any”).  The use of “any” in the Medicare Act’s preemption clause thus \nbroadens the language.  Ali, 552 U.S. 219; Northwest , 572 U.S. at 283 (explaining that \nbroader wording in an express preemption clause is a critical difference from the clause \nin Sprietsma ).   \nIn addition to the differences in statutory language, the preemption clause in the \nMedicare Act is undisputedly broader than that in the FBSA.  The 2003 amendment \nspecifically removed any requirement that state laws must be inconsistent.  42 U.S.C. § \n1395w-26(b)(3)(A) (effective Dec. 21, 2000 to Dec. 7, 2003).  Further, CMS has clarified \nthat at least some common law claims are preempted.  70 Fed.Reg. at 4665.   \nTherefore, because the language is not limited by the article “a,” the preemption \nprovision includes no savings clause for common law claims, and CMS has indicated its \nintent to preempt at least some common law claims, the Court will apply the preemption \nclause to common law claims when appropriate, and not limit its application to positive \nenactments of state law. \n2. Scope of Express Preemption  \nWith the acknowledgement that preemption may apply to all of Plaintiffs’ claims, \nthe Court must now evaluate the scope of the express preemption clause.   \nThe Eighth Circuit addressed the scope of the Medicare Act’s preemption clause in \nWehbi, 18 F.4th at 970–72.  Wehbi held that state laws are preempted if they “(1) regulate \nthe same subject matter as federal Medicare [standards] (in which case they are expressly \npreempted), or (2) otherwise frustrate the purpose of a federal Medicare [standards] (in CASE 0:23-cv-03514-JRT-SGE     Doc. 91     Filed 02/13/25     Page 16 of 24-17- \n which case they are impliedly preempted).”  18 F.4th at 971.  Wehbi reached its \nconclusion by acknowledging the expansion but describing two remaining limitations: \nfirst, the language “with respect to [Medicare Parts C-D] plans” and second only when the \nfederal standard “supersedes” state law.  18 F.4th at 971.  The court further defined \n“supersede” to mean displace.  Id.  The court summarized its analysis of the preemption \nexpansion by noting it went from conflict to field preemption.4  Id. at 971–72.     \nUHC relies primarily on Ninth Circuit precedent, which the Plaintiffs claim takes a \nmore expansive view of the Medicare Act’s preemption clause than required.  However, \nit is not immediately clear to the Court how distinct the tests actually are.  The Ninth \nCircuit has described the preemption clause as applying to anything that is “directly \ngoverned by federal standards.”  Uhm, 620 F.3d at 1158.  Essentially, under this view \npreemption would cover any state law or regulation if a federal standard exists.  Morrison \nv. Health Plan of Nev. , 328 P.3d 1165, 1168–70 (Nev. 2014).  And the Tenth Circuit has \nfound that the Medicare Act’s expanded preemption clause is similar to field preemption.  \nPharm. Care Mgmt. Ass’n v. Mulready .  78 F.4th 1183, 1207–08 (10th Cir. 2023); see also \nMedicaid and Medicare Advantage Prods. Ass’n of P.R., Inc. v Emanuelli Hernandez , 58 \nF.4th 5, 12–13 (1st Cir. 2023).    \n \n \n4 Field preemption exists when “Congress has forbidden the State to take action in the \nfield that the federal statute pre-empts,” and conflict preemption exists where “compliance with \nboth state and federal law is impossible.”  Pharm. Rsch. & Mfrs. of Am. v. McClain , 95 F.4th 1136, \n1140 (8th Cir. 2024) (quotations omitted).   CASE 0:23-cv-03514-JRT-SGE     Doc. 91     Filed 02/13/25     Page 17 of 24-20- \n evaluation of the medical payments Plaintiffs allegedly should have received would \nregulate the covered serves already regulated by the Medicare Act.  As such, the unjust \nenrichment claim is expressly preempted. \nThe bad faith insurance claims fail for similar reasons.  Plaintiffs alleged that the \nstates in which they assert bad faith insurance claims “prohibit using bad faith or \nunreasonable means to make coverage determinations under an insurance policy.”  (Am. \nCompl. ¶ 214.)  Initially, the bad faith insurance laws seem to only require the Court to \ndetermine the motivation behind the coverage denials.  However, a finding of liability on \nthe bad faith insurance claims would force the Court to evaluate whether the denial of \ncoverage was reasonable and whether the use of nH Predict to make that denial decision \nwas reasonable.  The Medicare Act squarely regulates how coverage decisions are to be \nmade and what services are covered.  42 C.F.R. §§ 422.101, 422.566.  Thus, a \ndetermination on the reasonableness of denial or the reasonableness of how coverage \ndecisions are made would aim to regulate the same subject matter as the Medicare Act. \nBecause any evaluation of the bad faith insurance claims would require the Court to \nevaluate standards promulgated by the Medicare Act, as opposed to standards included \nonly in UHC’s own written documents, the Court finds the bad faith insurance claims to \nbe preempted.  CASE 0:23-cv-03514-JRT-SGE     Doc. 91     Filed 02/13/25     Page 20 of 24-21- \n In sum, the breach of contract and breach of implied covenant of good faith and \nfair dealing claims are not preempted, and thus may proceed.  But the unjust enrichment \nand bad faith insurance claims are preempted and will be dismissed. \nb. Statutory Claims \nPlaintiffs bring three statutory claims under Oregon’s Unfair Claims Settlements \nPractices Act, the Minnesota Unfair Claims Practices Act (“MUCPA”),5 and California’s \nUnfair Competition Law and Insurance Code.  All three statutes essentially require \ninsurers to use reasonable standards for prompt, individualized evaluation of insurance \nclaims.6  Because the Medicare Act describes how insurance claim decisions are to be \nmade and the time frame for such decisions, these statutes directly regulate the same \nsubject matter.  See 42 C.F.R. §§ 422.101, 422.566, 422.568.  \nThe only manner in which these claims could survive preemption then would be a \nfinding that the state standards supplement the federal standards as permitted under \nWehbi.  18 F.4th 973.  However, the Court cannot expand Wehbi’s supplemental standard  \nto this case.  First, Wehbi allowed states to supplement the federal regulations under a \n \n \n5 The parties dispute whether the Minnesota Unfair Claims Practices Act allows for a \nprivate right of action.  A private right of action seems likely based on Findling v. Grp. Health Plan, \nInc., 998 N.W.2d 1, 7 (Minn. 2023), but as the MUCPA claim is preempted, the Court need not \nresolve that issue here.  \n6 Plaintiffs’ claim under Oregon’s Unfair Claims Settlements Practices Act also raises the \nissue of prompt and sufficient notice of denial.  However, 42 C.F.R. § 422.568 heavily regulates \nthe timeframe and notice requirements of organization determinations.  So, the notice portion \nof the claim, while distinct, is also preempted. CASE 0:23-cv-03514-JRT-SGE     Doc. 91     Filed 02/13/25     Page 21 of 24-22- \n specific set of circumstances.  The issue in that case concerned pharmacy benefits, which \nWebhi noted is an area typically left to the states.  Id. at 972–73.  Here, the Plaintiffs have \nnot presented the Court with any basis to find that coverage decisions are typically left to \nthe states.   \nFurther, Wehbi allowed states to provide the specifics when the federal standards \nwere broad and generalized.  Id. at 973.  But the federal standards here are not as \ngeneralized as those discussed in Wehbi.  Compare 42 C.F.R. § 422.101 (requiring a \nmedical necessity determination based on whether the services are reasonable or \nnecessary and also the “enrollee’s medical history, . . . physician recommendations, and \nclinical notes”) with 42 C.F.R. § 423.505(b)(18) (mandating a “standard contract with \nreasonable and relevant terms and conditions”).   \nFinally, even if the Medicare standards were sufficiently general, it is unclear that \nthe state laws that Plaintiffs suggest supplement the Medicare standards would provide \nany additional specificity.  The state laws would only impose an additional requirement \nthat the insurers use “reasonable standards” in making coverage decisions.  Thus, while \nWehbi certainly suggests there are situations where states could provide supplemental, \ncomplementary standards to the federal Medicare Act standards, that is not the case \nhere.  As a result, the statutory claims are expressly preempted.   \n* * * CASE 0:23-cv-03514-JRT-SGE     Doc. 91     Filed 02/13/25     Page 22 of 24-23- \n The Court finds that although the Plaintiffs’ claims were subject to the \nadministrative exhaustion requirements, Plaintiffs presented sufficient information to \nsatisfy application of the waiver doctrine.  Yet even after surmounting the jurisdictional \nhurdle, most of the claims fail under preemption.  As a result, the only claims that survive \nboth exhaustion and preemption are the claims for breach of contract and for breach of \nthe implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.  The remaining claims will be \ndismissed.  \nCONCLUSION \nPlaintiffs bring a putative class action contesting UHC’s use of nH Predict, rather \nthan actual people, to make coverage decisions, contradicting UHC’s insurance policy \ndocuments.  Because all the Plaintiffs’ claims originate after a denial of benefits, the \nMedicare Act requires Plaintiffs to exhaust all administrative remedies before the Court \ncan exercise subject matter jurisdiction.  No plaintiff has met this requirement.  But \nbecause the Court finds that Plaintiffs suffered irreparable injury and that exhaustion \nwould be futile, the Court will waive this requirement.  Waiving the exhaustion \nrequirement does not save all of Plaintiffs’ claims, however; those claims must also \nwithstand the broad preemption clause.  Because the unjust enrichment, bad faith \ninsurance, and state statutory claims regulate the same subject matter as the Medicare \nAct, those claims are preempted.  The only claims that survive, then, are the claims for \nbreach of contract and for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing \nbecause the Court will only need to evaluate compliance with the insurance agreements.  CASE 0:23-cv-03514-JRT-SGE     Doc. 91     Filed 02/13/25     Page 23 of 24-24- \n Accordingly, the Court will grant in part and deny in part UHC’s motion to dismiss, allowing \nPlaintiffs’ breach of contract and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair \ndealing claims to proceed.  \nORDER \nBased on the foregoing, and all the files, records, and proceedings herein, IT IS \nHEREBY ORDERED that Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss [Docket No. 41] is GRANTED in \npart and DENIED in part as follows:  \n1.

The court addressed a joint motion to continue keeping certain documents under seal due to sensitive personal health information involved, and granted this motion to protect confidentiality.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue:** Whether documents containing sensitive and confidential personal health information related to a class action lawsuit should remain sealed, despite the common-law right of public access to judicial records.\n\n3. **Court's Holding:** The court granted the joint motion to continue sealing the documents, finding that the parties' interests in maintaining the confidentiality of sensitive personal health information outweighed the public's interest in accessing these documents.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation:** A group of people claimed their insurance company used a computer program to wrongly deny them coverage for necessary medical care. The court was asked to decide if documents with private health information should be kept secret. The judge agreed the documents should stay hidden to protect people's private health details, even though people usually have the right to see court records.",

In early 2021, Pinterest began to implement the \nspecial committee’s reforms (Dkt. No. 107).  These lawsuits were consolidated in a series of \norders issued between December 2020 and July 2021 (Dkt. Nos. 28, 39, 49, 86).  The parties \nreached a settlement in November 2021 (Dkt. No. 99).  The settlement provided incremental \nreforms beyond those provided by the special committee.  Preliminary approval was given in \nFebruary 2022 (Dkt. No. 115).   Final approval of the settlement was granted in June 2022 (Dkt. \nNo. 134) along with an award of $2,500,000  in attorney’s fees.  That same order also stated \nthat a further amount may be awarded in two years based on future compliance and a showing \nof actual benefit that has flowed from the incremental re forms  (ibid.).

In the \nlatest reports, plaintiffs’ counsel expressed that Pinterest leadership has complied with, and in \nsome case, “exceeded our expectations” in meetin g the goals of the settlement (Dkt. 143).   For \nexample, by June 2023, there was an increase in women represented in leadership positions \nfrom 33% to 40% (Dkt. No. 141).  Pinterest has also maintained an Ombuds Office pilot \nprogram over the past two years which is tasked with  providing  advice to individual employees  \nand gathering information regarding potentially systemic problems that may inhibit diverse and \ninclusive and diverse environments (Dkt. No. 142).  Pinterest also implemented a program \ncalled the Inclusive Product Program, which uses artificial intelligence to ensure that \ninformation and content on its platform represent different  body types, shapes, and sizes \n(ibid.).  Out  of the $50 million that Pinterest is required to invest in inclusion and diversity \ninitiative over the next ten years, Pinterest has spent about $12.5 million over the past two \nyears (Dkt.

Lokken and others filed a class-action lawsuit against UnitedHealth Group, Inc., and naviHealth, Inc., alleging the misuse of an AI program, nH Predict, to deny medical coverage in breach of insurance agreements. The United States District Court for the District of Minnesota addressed a motion by the defendants to bifurcate the discovery process, which would separately handle the merits of the named plaintiffs before addressing broader class certification, but the court denied this motion. The involvement of AI centers on whether nH Predict was used improperly instead of human medical directors to make coverage decisions violating contractual obligations.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the discovery process should be bifurcated to first address the specific claims of the named plaintiffs regarding their coverage denials allegedly made by AI, before moving to class-wide discovery and potential class certification.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court denied the motion to bifurcate the discovery process, finding that bifurcation would not promote judicial efficiency and could lead to additional legal disputes over the separation of merits and class discovery, possibly delaying the case unnecessarily.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine you and many others were told by an insurance company that doctors would always handle your case, but instead, they used a computer program to decide if they'd pay for your healthcare.

    "full_text": "  \n \n  \n UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nDISTRICT OF MINNESOTA \n \n \nThe Estate of Gene B. Lokken, et al., \n \n Plaintiffs, \n \nv. \n \nUnitedHealth Group, Inc., et al., \n \n Defendants.   \nCase No. 23-cv-3514 (JRT/SGE) \n \n \n \n \n                     ORDER  \n  \n \nThis matter is before the Court on Defendants’ Motion to Amend the Pretrial \nScheduling Order (Dkt. 115). The Court heard oral argument on the motion September 4, \n2025. (See Dkt. 125.) For the reasons stated during the hearing, United States Magistrate \nJudge Shannon G. Elkins, denied Defendants’ motion on the record. This Order \nmemorializes the Court’s ruling. \nBACKGROUND \nThis is a putative class action alleging that UnitedHealth Group, Inc., and \nnaviHealth, Inc., used an artificial intelligence program called nH Predict to deny medical \ncare coverage in violation of the terms of the Plaintiffs’ insurance agreements. Defendants \nmoved to dismiss the Complaint, and United States District Judge John R. Tunheim \ngranted-in-part and denied-in-part the Motion. (Dkt. 91.) Judge Tunheim determined that \nseveral of Plaintiffs’ state claims were preempted by federal statute, but he allowed \nPlaintiffs’ claims for breach of contract and breach of the implied covenant of good faith \nand fair dealing to proceed. He wrote that these claims “effectively arise out of CASE 0:23-cv-03514-JRT-SGE     Doc. 130     Filed 09/08/25     Page 1 of 7  \n \n2 \n [Defendants’] evidence of coverage documents because the question [is] whether UHC \ncomplied with its statement that claim decisions would be made by ‘clinical services staff’ \nand ‘physicians’ when it allegedly used artificial intelligence.” (Dkt. 91 at 19.)  \nAfter receiving this partially adverse ruling, Defendants requested Judge Tunheim \nallow them to file a motion to reconsider the Order. (Dkt. 95.) Judge Tunheim denied the \nrequest but clarified his previous order stating, \n. . . UHC requests clarification from the Court on the scope of the \ncontract claims and damages. The contract claims survived \npreemption due to their independence from the Medicare Act, which \nlimited the Court’s analysis to the Evidence of Coverage (“EOC”) \ndocuments provided by UHC. Accordingly, the contract claims are \nlimited to breaches of EOC terms. \n(Dkt. 104 at 2.)  \nDefendants then filed the instant motion on August 21, 2025, asking this Court to \namend the pretrial scheduling order to bifurcate discovery into two stages. Defendants \npropose the first stage would allow discovery only for the “threshold factual question of \nwhether Defendants used nH Predict in place of physician medical directors to make \nadverse coverage determinations related to the named Plaintiffs’ care in skilled nursing \nfacilities.” (Dkt. 117 at 7.) After the first stage of discovery, Defendants state, the case \nwould be ripe for summary judgment to determine whether a genuine issue of material fact \nexists with respect to the named Plaintiffs. Under Defendants’ proposal, stage two \ndiscovery, which would include expert and class-based discovery, would take place only \nif the court determines that the named Plaintiffs have demonstrated genuine issues of \nmaterial fact. CASE 0:23-cv-03514-JRT-SGE     Doc. 130     Filed 09/08/25     Page 2 of 7  \n \n3 \n DISCUSSION \nI. Legal Standard \nThe federal rules provide that the Pretrial Scheduling Order “may be modified only \nfor good cause . . . .” Fed. R. Civ. P. 16(b)(4). Rule 42 allows courts to “issue any . . . orders \nto avoid unnecessary cost or delay.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 42(a)(3). Furthermore, and much more \ngenerally, Rule 1 mandates that the Rules “be construed, administered, and employed by \nthe court and the parties to secure the just, speedy, and inexpensive determination of every \naction and proceeding.” \nThe federal rules also provide, “[a]t an early practicable time after a person sues or \nis sued as a class representative, the court must determine by order whether to certify the \naction as a class action.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(1)(A). Whether to bifurcate discovery is \nwithin the discretion of the Court. See, e.g., Adam v. CHW Grp., Inc. , Case No. 21-cv-\n0091-LRR-MAR, 2021 WL 7285904, at *1-2 (N.D. Iowa June 29, 2021). The party \nseeking bifurcation bears the burden of showing that it will be prejudiced if the discovery \nis not bifurcated, and the party must allege undue burden, expense, or prejudice associated \nwith discovery. See, e.g., Ameritas Life Ins. Corp. v. Fed. Ins. Co. , Case No. 16-cv-3006, \n2017 WL 432693, at *2 (D. Neb. Jan. 31, 2017), and United States v. Thompson , Case no. \n13-cv-180, 2014 WL 2624927, at *4 (D. Neb. June 12, 2014).  Although the Eighth Circuit \nhas not directly addressed the issue, the Court has noted that “[b]road discovery should \nusually be permitted prior to class certification.” Johnson v. Nekoosa-Edwards Paper Co. , \n558 F.2d 841, 845 n.5 (8th Cir. 1977), cited in Cosgrove v. OS Restaurant Servs., Inc. , \n2010 WL 11575055, at *3 (D. Minn. Aug. 31, 2010). CASE 0:23-cv-03514-JRT-SGE     Doc. 130     Filed 09/08/25     Page 3 of 7  \n \n4 \n There are occasions where bifurcation is appropriate where resolving a “narrow, \npotentially dispositive issue” could obviate the need for costly class discovery. Physicians \nHealthsource, Inc. v. Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. , Civ. No. 12-2132, 2014 WL 413534, \nat *4 (D.N.J. Feb. 4, 2014) (TCPA case). “Notwithstanding the general difficulty and \npotential drain on judicial resources in managing bifurcated discovery in class action \nlitigation, determining whether the advantages of bifurcation outweigh its disadvantages is \na factual inquiry assessed on a case-by-case basis.” Hanover 3201 Realty, LLC v. Village \nSupermarkets, Inc. , Civ. No. 14-1327, 2016 WL 4541870, at *2 (D.N.J. Aug. 31, 2016). \nII. Bifurcating discovery is inappropriate in this case.   \n \nDefendants argue that good cause exists to bifurcate discovery because it would \npromote efficient resolution of the dispute and preserve judicial economy. Defendants \npropose that the Court order the parties to conduct discovery into the merits of the named \nclass representatives first and require Plaintiffs to survive summary judgment before \nallowing any expert or class-based discovery. Plaintiffs argue that bifurcation would lead \nto additional, avoidable motion practice and that Defendants’ failure to seek bifurcation \nearlier in the litigation demonstrates a lack of diligence that undercuts their argument for \ngood cause. \nThe Court does not find Defendants’ arguments about efficiency persuasive. \nDefendants’ argument that bifurcation will save the parties the time and the expense of \nclass discovery assumes their success on a motion for summary judgment. However, if \ntheir motion for summary judgment fails, bifurcating discovery will only delay the case CASE 0:23-cv-03514-JRT-SGE     Doc. 130     Filed 09/08/25     Page 4 of 7  \n \n5 \n and prejudice the Plaintiffs by requiring them to litigate discovery and summary judgment \ntwice. \nReviewing how this case has proceeded thus far, the Court also disagrees that \nbifurcation would promote judicial economy. Defendants resisted proceeding with \ndiscovery at the initial Rule 26(f) Report stage, at the Rule 16 scheduling conference, and \nagain by successfully moving to stay discovery last August. (See Dkt. 56, 69.) Then, when \nDefendants received a partially adverse ruling from Judge Tunheim, they decided not to \nanswer many of Plaintiffs’ discovery requests and instead moved, for the first time since \nthis case was filed in 2023, to bifurcate discovery so that they would only have to produce \ndiscovery relevant to the eight named Plaintiffs.  \nDefendants do not propose to conduct discovery on a narrow legal issue that might \nresolve a lurking dispositive issue. Rather, they propose to litigate the entire case as to the \nnamed plaintiffs and proceed to litigate with respect to the class only if the named Plaintiffs \nsurvive summary judgment. Defendants submit that they want summary judgment to \nprecede class certification to resolve one “straightforward” and “limited” question—\nwhether or not Defendants breached the terms of the insurance contracts by allegedly \nmaking coverage care determinations based on their use of nH Predict instead of relying \non individualized decisions by physician medical directors. But bifurcating discovery \ncreates tension between what is “class-related” discovery and what is “merits” discovery.  \nThe Supreme Court has stated that class certification analysis under Rule 23 \n“generally involves considerations that are enmeshed in the factual and legal issues \ncomprising the plaintiff’s cause of action.” Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes , 564 U.S. 338, CASE 0:23-cv-03514-JRT-SGE     Doc. 130     Filed 09/08/25     Page 5 of 7  \n \n6 \n 351 (2011) (cleaned up). This inherent overlap, as well as the potentially thorny question \nof whether certain discovery would classify as class or merits discovery, has left courts \n“reluctant to bifurcate class-related discovery from discovery on the merits.” Ahmed v. \nHSBC Bank USA, Nat’l Ass’n , Civ. No. 15-2057, 2018 WL 501413, at *3 (C.D. Cal. Jan. \n5, 2018) (cleaned up).  \nA good example of this tension between class discovery and merits discovery played \nout in Plaintiffs’ contemporaneously filed Motion to Compel. ( See Dkt. 109.) Many of the \ndiscovery requests made by Plaintiffs went unanswered because Defendants perceived the \nrequests to relate to class discovery.  But many of the discovery responses Plaintiffs moved \nto compel would be relevant to both the “merits” of the case and the “class certification” \nissues.  \nThe Court finds that bifurcating discovery in this case would lead to avoidable \ndisputes over whether a particular discovery request relates to the merits or to class \ncertification. This would not economize the judicial involvement in this case and could \npotentially compound it, frustrating rather than furthering judicial economy. \nAdditionally, this Court does not read Judge Tunheim’s Order as narrowing the \nscope of the dispute in the way Defendants argue. This Court does not believe Judge \nTunheim intended the parties to litigate only the claims as they relate to the named \nPlaintiffs first. Rather Judge Tunheim’s task in ruling on the Motion to Dismiss was to \ndetermine whether the claims were preempted by the Medicare Act. As his subsequent \nOrder clarifies, the contract-based claims survived preemption due to their independence \nfrom the Medicare Act and because the contract claims were limited to breach of the CASE 0:23-cv-03514-JRT-SGE     Doc. 130     Filed 09/08/25     Page 6 of 7  \n \n7 \n Evidence of Coverage terms. This Court cannot conceive of a reading of Judge Tunheim’s \nOrders that limited discovery to the named Plaintiffs. \nThe Court has considered the general difficulty and potential drain on judicial \nresources in managing bifurcated discovery in this litigation and determines that the \nadvantages of bifurcation are outweighed by its disadvantages to both the parties and the \nCourt. Simply put, this Court determines that bifurcation would create more problems than \nit would solve in this particular case. \nORDER \nAccordingly, based on the foregoing, and all the files, records, and proceedings \nherein, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED THAT Defendants’ Motion to Amend the Pretrial \nScheduling Order (Dkt. 115) is DENIED.   \n \nDated:  September 8, 2025  \n      s/Shannon G.

(ECF No. 1- 1 at p. 3, 16, 19.)   Case 1:23-cv-02102-JRR   Document 17   Filed 05/10/24   Page 1 of 142 \n to sell [her] services to business es.”  Id.  Following that call, Plaintiff emailed her resume to Ms. \nCatone for a job posting at Uber.  I d. ¶ 7.  Ms. Catone shared the Uber job posting with Plaintiff.  \nId.  Plaintiff  then messaged  the Chief Privacy Officer at Uber  via LinkedIn  to let her know that  her \nresume would be submitted f or the position, and the Chief Privacy Officer responded that h er team \ndid not have any openings at that time.3  (ECF No. 1- 1 ¶ 8.)  Days later, Ms. Catone contacted \nPlaintiff about another position with Zendesk.  Id. at p. 19.  Plaintiff again provided her resume \nfor the position with Zendesk.  Id. ¶ 10.  Plaintiff then messaged the Chief Privacy Officer at \nZendesk via LinkedIn to inform her that her resume had been submitted, but the Chief Privacy \nOfficer r esponded that the position had been filled.  Id. ¶ 10.  Thereafter, Plaintiff asked  Ms. Catone \nfor an update on her applications and states Ms. Catone “did not confirm whether or not she sent \n[her] resume to either Uber or Zendesk.”  Id. ¶ 11.  On September 21, 2021, Ms. Catone emailed \nPlaintiff about a part -time position, which Plaintiff declined. Id. ¶ 12.  On May 4, 2022, another \nMLA employee emailed Plaintiff about another job, and  Plaintiff did not respond.  (ECF No. 1- 1 \n¶ 15.)  \n Plaintiff file d a charge of discrimination against MLA with the U.S. Equal Employment \nOpportunity Commission (“EEOC”)  on May 31, 2022, alleging that she  “think[s]” MLA “[is] \nusing s creening tools . . . to screen- out applicants ,” and that MLA “did not refer [her] for future \njobs and later disappeared.”   Id. at p. 21–22.  On May 8, 2023, EEOC issued a Right to Sue letter \nto Plaintiff .  Id. at p. 23.  Plaintiff filed the Complaint in this court on August 4, 2023 against MLA \nand Allegis Group, Inc. (“Allegis”).  (ECF No. 1.)  Plaintiff contends that  Allegis “owns MLA.”  \nId. ¶ 3.  Though at times inconsistent, Plaintiff asserts the follo wing claims : failure to refer  and \n \n3 The manner in which Plaintiff pleads  these allegations in her Complaint suggests  she found out that there was no \nopen position with Uber before  she sent her resume to Ms. Catone.  (ECF No. 1 -1 ¶¶ 6 –8.)  Because such a reading is \ninconsistent with her claims  and would certainly invalidate the claims  to that allegation , the court assumes  that dates \nidentified in the Complaint are typographical errors.  Case 1:23-cv-02102-JRR   Document 17   Filed 05/10/24   Page 2 of 143 \n “algorithmic bias” in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (“Title VII”) and the \nAge Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (“ADEA”); retaliation in violation of Title VII and the ADEA; and fraudulent i nducement in violation of Maryland law .  (ECF No. 1.)   \nPlaintiff alleges in her Complaint that Defendants use “algorithmic, machine learning, and \nother technical tools in the conduct of their business, and their use of such tools caused [her] to be unlawf ully discriminated against on the basis ” of her sex and age.  (ECF No. 1- 1 ¶ 19.)  Plaintiff \nadmits, however, Defendants asserted that they do not use artificial intelligence and that discovery is needed to ascertain the nature of the tools.\n4  Id.   She alleges that Defendants ’ artificial \nintelligence, “job progression” “tools” result in “automated discrimination ” and “result in negative \nresults and disparate impacts” against people who, like Plaintiff , have a “motherhood gap”  in their \nemployment.5  Id. ¶ 22.  As a result, Plaintiff believes that Defendants  unlawfully classified her in \na way that prevented her resume from being referred to businesses for employment.  Id. ¶ 23.  \nPlaintiff simultaneously argues that there were no available positions, an d that Defendants instead \nwanted her resume so they could be  “paid for [her] data .”  Id. ¶ 30.   \nPlaintiff also states that one of the Defendant s (but does not identify which one)  retaliated \nagainst her by “creating and furnishing . . . defamatory data” about her to others “in an effort to \ndisqualify [her] from being referred to employers because [she] filed” a charge of discrimination with EEOC.  (ECF No. 1- 1 at p. 1, ¶ 29.)   However, she admits  that discovery is needed to \ndetermine whether they actually did as alleged.  Id. ¶ 29.   \nFinally, Plaintiff alleges that one of the Defendant s, presumably MLA, knowingly induced \n \n4 Plaintiff’s response in opposition to the Motion further clarifies that her allegation is based on the assumption that \nbecause “Allegis made 14.8 Billion in 2022, brokering globally in rec ruitment and employment data,” that Defendants \ncannot process “all of [that] data” without artificial intelligence.  (ECF No. 10 at p. 7.)   \n5 Although Plaintiff does not define the phrase “motherhood gap,” it is apparent from context that it refers to the  period \nof time in her thirties when she was  raising her  children and  not actively  participating  in the workforce.

LEGAL STANDARD  \nA. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(f)  \nFederal pleading requirements require that a claim for relief contain “a short and plain \nstatement of the claim showing the pleader is entitled to relief.”  FED. R. CIV. P. 8(a)(2).  \nAccordingly, under Rule 12(f), the court may, on its own or on motion by a party, “strike from a \npleading . . . any redundant, immaterial, impertinent, or scandalous matter ” where it is insufficient.   \nFED. R. CIV. P. 12(f).  “ In determining whether to grant a motion  to strike , the court ‘enjoys wide \ndiscretion  . . . in order to minimize delay, prejudice and confusion by narrowing the issues for \ndiscovery and trial.’”  Baltimore  v. Baltimore  City L. Dep’t, No. CV ELH -22-1901, 2022 WL \n17812642, at *2 (D. Md. Dec. 16, 2022)  (quoting Haley Paint Co. v. E.I. du Pont de Nemours & \nCo., 279 F.R.D. 331, 336 (D. Md. 2012) ).  “Rule 12(f) motions are generally viewed with disfavor \nbecause striking a portion of a pleading is a drastic remedy and because it is often sought by the movant simply as a dilatory tactic .”  Waste  Mgmt.  Holdings, Inc. v. Gilmore , 252 F.3d 316, 347 \n(4th Cir. 2001) (citation omitted).  Accordingly, on a Rule 12(f) motion, the court “must view the pleading under attack in a light most favorable to the pleader.”   Haley Paint  Co., 279 F.R.D. at  \n336.  \nB. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6)  \nA motion asserted under Rule 12(b)(6) “test[s] the sufficiency of a complaint;” it does not \n“resolve contests surrounding the facts, the merits of a claim, or the applicability of defenses.”  Case 1:23-cv-02102-JRR   Document 17   Filed 05/10/24   Page 4 of 145 \n Presley v.

Accordingly, a “Rule 12(b)(6) motion should only \nbe granted if, after accepting all well -pleaded allegations in the plaintiff’s complaint as true and \ndrawing all reasonable f actual inferences from those facts in the plaintiff’s favor, it appears certain \nthat the plaintiff cannot prove any set of facts in support of his claim entitling him to relief.” Edwards , 178 F.3d at 244.   \n“While legal conclusions can provide the framework of a complaint, they must be \nsupported by factual allegations.”  Ashcroft v.

(citations omitted).  \nIII. ANALYSIS  \nDefendants first ask this court to strike the complaint, as it constitutes a “shotgun pleading” \nthat fails to apprise Defendant s of the claims against them and the grounds in support  of the specific \nclaims.6  (ECF No. 6 -1 at p. 8–9.)  Alternatively, Defendants argue that Plaintiff’s Complaint \nshould be dismissed because it fails to state plausible claims under Title VII , the ADEA, and \nMaryland law .7  Id. at p. 10 –18.  Plaintiff opposes the Motion.  (ECF No. 10.)   \nA. Motion to Strike Plai ntiff’s Complaint  \nDefendants argue the Complaint as a whole should be struck as a “shotgun pleading.”   (ECF \nNo. 6- 1 at p. 7.)  “A ‘ shotgun pleading’ is one that ‘fails to articulate claims with sufficient clarity \nto allow the defendant to frame a responsive pleading . . . or [one in which] it is virtually impossible \nto know which allegations of fact are intended to support which claims for relief[.]”  Baxter  v. \nAmeriHome  Mortg. Co., LLC, 617 F. Supp. 3d 346, 351 (D. Md. 2022) (quoting Lee v. Meyers , \nNo. ELH -21-1589, 2022 WL 252960, at *11 (D. Md. Jan. 27, 2022)).  See Lampkin- Asam  v. \nVolusia Cnty.  Sch. Bd., 261 F. App’ x 274, 277 (11th Cir. 2008) (“A complaint that fails to articulate \nclaims with sufficient clarity to allow the defendant to frame a res ponsive pleading constitutes a \n‘shotgun pleading.’”).  However, here, Plaintiff has articulated at least some claims with sufficient \nclarity.  For example , Plaintiff sets forth her allegations with respect to her fraudulent inducement  \nclaim in Paragraphs 30 through 32.   As a result, Defendants ’ argument to strike  the whole \n \n6 Defendants also argue that Plaintiff’s pleadings should not be afforded the “special judicial solitude” afforded to pro \nse parties  because she is a lawyer.  (ECF No. 6 -1 at p. 6.)  However, w hile Plaintiff is an attorney, she is not barred in \nthis court, nor has  she claimed any litigation practice or experience.  Despite being a lawyer, Plaintiff is still a pro se  \nlitigant whose pleadings are subject to liberal construction.  See Erickson , 551 U.S. at 94, supra .    \n7 Defendants  also argue that all claims against Allegis should be dismissed because Allegis does n ot own MLA \ncontrary to Plaintiff’s allegations.  (ECF No. 6 -1 at p. 9– 10.)  At this stage, the court accept s the allegations of the \nComplaint as true.  The court is  thus not persuaded that Allegis should be dismissed solely based on a factual dispute.   Case 1:23-cv-02102-JRR   Document 17   Filed 05/10/24   Page 6 of 147 \n Complaint is unwarranted.  The court will therefore decline to exercise its discretion to strike the \nComplaint and will instead view the Motion as one seeking to dismiss Plaintiff’s Comp laint \npursuant to Rule 12(b)(6).  To the extent there are remaining allegations and claims that may constitute impermissible “ shotgun pleading,” the court will address them in the context of the \nmotion to dismiss.  See McCrea  v. Wells  Fargo, No. CV RDB -18-2490, 2019 WL 2513770, at *7 \n(D. Md. June 17, 2019), aff’d, 852 F. App’ x 112 (4th Cir. 2021)  (discussing dismissal for \nimpermissible “shotgun pleading” under Rule 12(b)(6)).  \nB. Title VII and the ADEA Claims  \nBoth Title VII and the ADEA prohibit employment agencies —meaning, \n“any person regularly undertaking with or without compensation to procure  employees for  an \nemployer or to procure for  employees  opportunities to work for an employer”—from unlawfully \ndiscriminating against applicants.8  42 U.S.C. § 2000e(c).  See 29 U.S.C. § 630(c) (“ The term \n‘employment agency ’ means any  person regularly undertaking with or without compensation to \nprocure employees  for an  employer.”) .  Specifically, it is unlawful for an em ployment agency “to \nfail or refuse to refer for employment, or otherwise to discriminate against, any individual because \nof,” relevant her e, her sex or age.  42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(b) ; 29 U.S.C. § 623(b).   \n“[T]here are few cases dealing with discrimination by employment agencies ,” specifically  \nwith respect  to discrimination  in failure  to refer  for employment.   Syed  v. S.C. Vocational Rehab. \nDep’t, No. 2:14- CV-02576- RMG, 2015 WL 1622094, at *6 n.9 (D.S.C. Apr. 10, 2015).  See Koger \nv. Allegheny Intermediate Unit, No. CIV.A. 10- 1466, 2012 WL 603565, at *12 (W.D. Pa. Feb. 24, \n2012), aff’d, 495 F. App ’x 266 (3d Cir. 2012)  (same); Shah v. Littelfuse  Inc., No. 12 CV 6845, \n2013 WL 1828926, at *7 (N.D. Ill. Apr. 29, 2013) (same).  Considering the plain language of the \n \n8 At leas t for the purposes  of their Motion, Defendants appear to concede they are an employment agency within the \nmeaning of Title VII and the ADEA.  (ECF N o. 6-1 at p. 10.)   Case 1:23-cv-02102-JRR   Document 17   Filed 05/10/24   Page 7 of 148 \n statutes, “the plaintiff must show that the employment agency discriminated against her ‘ based on \nher [protected status ] in relation to referrals. ’”  E.E.O.C.  v. Kelly  Servs.,  Inc., 598 F.3d 1022, 1030 \n(8th Cir. 2010) (citing Williams  v. Caruso, 966 F. Supp. 287, 297 (D. Del.  1997).  Similarly, both \nTitle VII and the ADEA also make it unlawful for an employment agency to discriminate against \nany individual because she has, relevant here, “ made a charge, tes tified, assisted, or participated \nin any manner in an investigation [or] proceeding” under the statute .  42 U.S.C. § 2000e -3(a); 29 \nU.S.C. § 623(d).  See Scaglione v. Chappaqua Cent.  Sch. Dist. , 209 F. Supp. 2d 311, 315 (S.D.N.Y. \n2002) (“Like employers, employment agencies  may not retaliate against those opposing illegal \npractices.”).  \n1. Failure to Refer  Claim / Algorithmic Bias Claim  \nAs state supra, employment agencies may not “fail or refuse to refer for employment” and \nindividual because of h er sex or age.  42 U.S.C. § 2000e -2(b); 29 U.S.C. § 623(b).  To demonstrate \nsuch a claim, a plaintiff “must allege that the employment agency  refused or failed to refer the \n[her]  to an available position with an employer on the basis of a discriminatory animus regarding \nthe protected factor .”  Syed , 2015 WL 1622094, at *6 n.9.  See Kelly  Servs.,  Inc., 598 F.3d at  1030 \n(“The plain language of § 2000e –2(b) states that an employment agency violates Title VII if it \n“fail[s] or refuse[s] to refer for employment .  . . any individual because of his  . . . [protected \nstatus].” ).    \nTo the extent Plaintiff’s claim is based on disparate treatment, she has failed to state a \nclaim.  First, Plaintiff  does not allege that Defendants refused, or failed, to refer her for an available \nposition based on her protected status.  S he instead contends that  they did so because they wanted \nto profit from the sale of her data.  (ECF No. 1- 1 ¶ 30.)  Moreover, Plaintiff  alleges that no available Case 1:23-cv-02102-JRR   Document 17   Filed 05/10/24   Page 8 of 149 \n positions actually existed and instead were merely a ruse to access and misuse her personal \ninformation.  Id.  \nPlaintiff’s allegation of “algorithmic bias”  is similarly insufficient.  Plaintiff alleges that \nDefendants use “job progression” “tools” that “generally disqualif[y] and exclude [] anyone with a \ngap in their resume,” hav ing a disparate impact on women with a “motherhood gap,” like Plaintiff.  \n(ECF No. 1-1 ¶ 22.)  Under 42 U.S.C. 2000e-2(k), Title VII provides:  \nAn unlawful employment practice based on disparate impact is \nestablished under this subchapter only if- \n \n(i) a  complaining party demonstrates that a respondent uses a \nparticular employment practice that causes a disparate impact on the \nbasis of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin and the \nrespondent fails to demonstrate that the challenged practice is jo b \nrelated for the position in question and consistent with business \nnecessity  . . . \n \n42 U.S.C. § 2000e -2( k)(1)(A)(i).  See Smith  v. City of Jackson,  Miss. , 544 U.S. 228, 232 (2005)  \n(holding “that the ADEA does authorize recovery in ‘ disparate- impact’ cases”).   “Thus, a plaintiff \nestablishes a prima facie disparate- impact  claim  by showing that the employer ‘ uses a particular \nemployment practice that causes a disparate impact’ on one of the prohibited bases.”  Lewis  v. City \nof Chicago, Ill. , 560 U.S. 205, 212 (2010) (quoting 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(k)).   \nPlaintiff’s claim fails here because it is entirely speculative.  Plaintiff has not identified a \nparticular employment practice  that exists.  Her a llegation  is based solely on supposition that \nDefendants use artificial intelligence tools because they are large businesses.  (ECF No. 10 at p. \n7.)  Plaintiff’s allegation , however, that MLA stated that it did not use artificial intelligence tools, \ndirect ly contradicts her supposition.  (ECF No. 1- 1 ¶¶ 19, 22, 28.)  Ms. Catone ’s comment that she \nhad trouble “getting businesses past the ‘ motherhood gap’ ” does not change the court’s analysis ,  \nas Plaintiff still doe s not allege a particular employment practice.  Ms. Catone’s  comment, while Case 1:23-cv-02102-JRR   Document 17   Filed 05/10/24   Page 9 of 1410 \n perhaps raising suspicion, does not relate to MLA’s artificial intelligence system.  Id. ¶ 6.  Finally, \nas a separate matter, Plaintiff makes no meaningful allegation that the so -called “tools” have a \ndispa rate impact on applicants based on age.  See ECF No. 1- 1 at ¶ 22.  She instead conclusorily \nalleges that Defendants “violated” the ADEA with their purported use of the artificial intelligence.  \nId.  E ven considered in the light most favorable to Plaintiff , Plaintiff’s allegations are  simply \ninsufficient to state a plausible claim for relief for failure to refer in violation of Title VII and the \nADEA.  \n2. Retaliation  \n As explained supra, plaintiff s may prove that the employment agency “retaliated against \nthem for engaging in protected activity through one of two ways: (1) by direct evidence of \nretaliatory animus; or (2) through the McDonnell  Douglas Corp. v. Green , 411 U.S. 792 (1973), \nburden- shifting framework.”   Walton v. Harker , 33 F.4th 165, 171 (4th Cir. 2022)  (citing Foster  \nv. Univ.  of Md.-E. Shore , 787 F.3d 243, 249 (4th Cir. 2015)).  As is the case here, where there is \nno direct evidence of a retaliatory animus , a plaintiff must first set forth the elements of a prima \nfacie case of retaliation  under Title VII and the ADEA, meaning: “ (1) she engaged in a protected \nactivity, (2) the employer acted adversely against her, and (3) there was a causal connection \nbetween the protected activity and the asserted adverse action.”   Walto n, 33 F.4th at  177 (quoting \nHoyle v.  Freightliner,  LLC , 650 F.3d 321, 337 (4th  Cir. 2011) ).   \n Wh ile f iling a charge of discrimination with the  EEOC is certainly protected activity, \nPlaintiff otherwise fails to state a claim of retaliation under the law.9  See 42 U.S.C. § 2000e -3(a); \n29 U.S.C. § 623(d), supra.  The alleged adverse action on which Plaintiff rests is that Defendants \n \n9 Plaintiff’s Complaint is inconsistent with respect to whether she intended to assert a retaliation claim.  See ECF No. \n1 at p. 5; ECF No. 1 -1 at p. 1, ¶ 29 (stating in one part that she is not complaining of retaliation and stating in another \nthat she was subject to retaliation in the form of “creating and furnishing . . . defamatory data” about her to others ).  \nGiven the liberal pleading standard and for the sake of completeness, the court considers the claims.  Case 1:23-cv-02102-JRR   Document 17   Filed 05/10/24   Page 10 of 1411 \n “unlawfully furnished data to others about [her] in an effort to disqualify [her] from being referred \nto employers.”  (ECF No. 1-1 ¶ 29.)   However, Plaintiff concedes that “[d]iscovery is needed to \nascertain if any defamatory or other inaccurate information” was used —thus admitting that she \nhas no factual basis  beyond speculation to support her claim that such data was furnished to others.  \nId.  This is further illustrated by Plaintiff’s  failure to identify the purported defamatory information  \ndisseminated.  Further , elsewhere in the Complaint, Plaintiff  identifies a different purported motive \nfor Defendants’ actions: unlawfully furnishing data about her for their own profit.  Id. ¶ 21.  S imply \nspeculating something is true with no supportive factual allegations is insufficient to support a \nclaim for relief.  See Twombly , 550 U.S. at  555 (“Factual allegations must be enough to raise a \nright to relief above the speculative level. ”); McCleary-Evans v. Maryland Dep’t of Transp., State  \nHighway Admi n., 780 F.3d 582, 588 (4th Cir. 2015) (noting that, where a complaint left “open to \nspeculation” the cause of defendant’s employment decision, the cause was not plausible in light of the “obvious alternative explanation”).  Finally, p erhaps most fatal to her claim, Plaintiff has not \nalleged any connection between the purported adverse action and her protected activity beyond the conclusory allegation that Defendants  did so “because” she filed the EEOC complaint.  (ECF No. \n1-1 ¶ 29.)   The court cannot accep t the conclusory allegation as true.  See Iqbal , 556 U.S. at 678 \n(“Threadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of action, supported by mere conclusory \nstatements, do not suffice.”).  The court thus  concludes  that, to the extent she intended to assert \none, Plaintiff has failed to state a claim of retaliation  in violation of Title VII or the ADEA.  \nC.

Kellogg Brown  & Root, Inc. , 525 F.3d 370, 379 (4th Cir. 2008) (citation omitted).  \n“The tort of fraudulent inducement ‘means that one has been led by another ’s guile, \nsurreptitiousness or other form of deceit to enter into an agreement to his detriment.’” Rozen  v. \nGreenberg,  165 Md. App. 665, 674 (2005) (quoting Sec.  Constr. Co. v. Maietta, 25 Md. App. 303, \n307 (1975)).  To succeed on a claim of fraudulent inducement, Plaintiff must demonstrate :  \n(1) that the defendant made a false representation to the plaintiff,  \n(2) that its falsity was either k nown to the defendant or that the \nrepresentation was made with reckless indifference as to its truth,  (3) that the misrepresentation was made for the purpose of defrauding the plaintiff,  (4) that the plaintiff relied on the misrepresentation and had the right to rely on it, and  (5) that the plaintiff suffered compensable injury resulting from the misrepresentation.   \nCapitalSource Fin., LLC v. Delco  Oil, Inc., 608 F. Supp. 2d 655, 666 (D. Md. 2009)  (quoting Nails  \nv. S & R, Inc., 334 Md. 398, 415 (1994) ).  “Notably, ‘ fraud cannot be predicated on statements \nwhich are merely promissory in nature, or upon expressions as to what will happen in the future.’”  \nView  Point Med.  Sys., LLC v. Athena Health, Inc., 9 F. Supp. 3d 588, 612 (D. Md. 2014)  (quoting \nSass, 152 Md. App. at 438)).  “In fraudulent inducement cases, a defrauded party may elect Case 1:23-cv-02102-JRR   Document 17   Filed 05/10/24   Page 12 of 1413 \n between two remedies, which are exclusive [:] . . . to rescind the contract or to ratify the contract \nand seek damages, either affirmatively or by recoupment.”  Id.    \n Here,  Plaintiff’s allegations are , again , insufficient, especially considering the heightened \npleading standard under Rule 9(b).  Plaintiff has not alleged that she  was induced to enter any sort \nof agreement to her detriment.  See Rozen, 165 Md. App. at 674, supra.  She has instead alleged , \nat most,  that she was induc ed to send her resume to Ms. Catone.  (ECF No. 1- 1 ¶ 30; ECF No. 10 \nat p. 11.)  Neither of the “exclusive” remedies that exist to redress unlawful fraudulent inducement \nwould have any effect here.  See View  Point Med.  Sys., LLC, 9 F. Supp. 3d at  612, supra.  E ven \nassuming arguendo that an agreement exist s, Plaintiff still fails to plead the necessary elements of \na fraudulent inducement claim.  As best the court can tell, the alleged false representations she \nasserts were that Ms. Catone would provide Plaintiff’s  resume for consideration for two \nemployment positions and that “neither received [her] resume.”  (ECF No. 1 -1 ¶ 30. )  However, \nPlaintiff does not allege that Ms. Catone never provided her resume to Uber or Zendesk; she alleges \nthat the Chief Privacy Officers for each employer stated either that there was no opening (despite \nan online job posting) or, most notably, that the position had been filled.  Id. ¶¶ 7–10.  Simply \nbecause the employers stated that they did not have an opening or that a position had been filled \ndoes not raise a plausible inference that a recruiter sought out Plaintiff’s resume either falsely or \nwith reckless indifference to the truth and misrepresented the availability of positions for the \npurpose of defrauding her.  See McCleary-Evans , 780 F.3d at  588, supra.11  The court thus finds \nthat Plaintiff has failed  to state a claim for fraudulent inducement under Maryland law.  \nD. Remaining Allegatio ns \nThe court does not  discern any additional claims in Plaintiff’s Complaint.  To the extent \n \n11 Because Plaintiff’s claim is facially insufficient, the court  need not address Plaintiff’s assertion  of “intrusion upon \nprivacy” as her  compensable  injury, but does note that the assertion is again  based  entirely  on speculation .   Case 1:23-cv-02102-JRR   Document 17   Filed 05/10/24   Page 13 of 1414 \n Plaintiff intended to raise any additional claims or rely on any other allegations to  support her \nclaims addressed herein, such allegations fail as impermissible “shotgun pleading.”  See Baxter , \n617 F. Supp. 3d at  351, supra; Lampkin- Asam , 261 F. App’x at 277, supra.  See also Weller  v. \nDep’t of Soc. Servs.  for City of Baltimore , 901 F.2d 387, 391 (4th Cir. 1990)  (“The ‘special judicial \nsolicitude ’ with which a district court should view such pro se complaints does not transform the \ncourt into an advocate.”) .  \nIV. CONCLUSION \nFor the reasons set forth herein, by separate order , Defendants’ Motion to Strike Plaintiff’s \nComplaint, or, in the Alternative, M otion to Dismiss  (ECF No. 6) , construed as a motion to dismiss, \nwill be granted.   \nMay 10, 2024        /s/______________________ \nJulie R.
