Hale et al., the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas presided over a statutory interpleader action concerning competing claims to $25,000 from a life insurance policy. The court granted summary judgment in favor of Margaret S. Wood, the alternate beneficiary, because the primary beneficiary, Owen McDonald, predeceased the insured, Anna McDonald, and therefore his interest never vested. Russell McDonald and Brenda Hale, both claiming under the 'per stirpes' language, were denied any recovery as their claims relied on an interest that did not exist. The court also noted that while pro se parties attempted to use AI for legal research, it led to incorrect arguments by Russell and Brenda, whereas Margaret used AI more effectively, though still resulting in cited sources that could not support her conclusions."],["2025-06-11_USCOURTS-flsd-0_25-cv-61018_Huntington Bank v.

Major_ Lindsey _ Africa_ LLC et al.pdf","Heidi Saas filed a discrimination case against Major, Lindsey & Africa, LLC, and Allegis Group, Inc. alleging violations of Title VII and the ADEA based on claims of algorithmic bias and retaliation after her interactions with a recruiter. Saas contended that the defendants used automated systems that discriminated against candidates with gaps in their resumes, particularly women returning from maternity leave, while also asserting they retaliated against her for filing an EEOC complaint. The court granted the defendants' motion to dismiss, stating that Saas' claims were speculative and insufficiently pleaded, particularly regarding the functionalities of the AI and its impact on employment referrals."],["2025-04-30_USCOURTS-ctd-3_25-cv-00544_Moales v. Land Rover Cherry Hill et al.pdf","In the case of Moales v. Land Rover Cherry Hill, the plaintiff Kasaun Moales filed a pro se complaint alleging that a credit application he submitted to a car dealership constituted a 'credit contract' that was improperly handled. The U.S. District Court for the District of Connecticut dismissed the complaint due to lack of subject matter jurisdiction, finding that neither federal question nor diversity jurisdiction applied. The court noted that Moales's claims were rooted in state law and did not present substantial questions of federal law. Additionally, concerns were raised about the accuracy of legal citations in Moales's submissions, suggesting that he may have relied on artificial intelligence to draft them, which led to misstatements about legal precedents."],["2024-12-31_USCOURTS-mad-1_24-cv-12093_Olivier v. Military Intelligence et al.pdf","Herve Olivier, Jr. filed a complaint against several defendants, including government and intelligence agencies, while claiming violations of his rights during his incarceration in Massachusetts. The court dismissed the complaint, emphasizing that it lacked a legal basis and specific factual allegations, particularly regarding the conditions of confinement and claims related to artificial intelligence. The court found the allegations of harm related to AI, such as 'brain hacking,' to be conclusory and unsupported by fact."],["2024-02-01_USCOURTS-txwd-1_23-cv-01149_Fredrick v. Artificial Intelligence Fields.pdf","In the case of Darion Dion Frederick v. Artificial Intelligence Fields, the plaintiff sought to proceed in forma pauperis due to indigency, which was granted by the court. However, the court found Frederick's complaint to be frivolous and lacking merit, as it alleged emotional and physical distress caused by 'alien friends from other planets' and claimed emotional traumatization linked to artificial intelligence. The magistrate judge recommended the dismissal of the case with prejudice under 28 U.S.C. § 1915(e)(2)(B), as the allegations failed to state a valid claim and were deemed implausible, thus lacking a basis for federal jurisdiction."],["2024-06-21_USCOURTS-txwd-1_23-cv-01149_Fredrick v. Artificial Intelligence Fields.pdf","In the case of Fredrick v. Artificial Intelligence Fields, the plaintiff, Darion Dion Frederick, filed a complaint against the defendant related to artificial intelligence. The United States District Court for the Western District of Texas reviewed the magistrate judge's report and recommendation, which concluded that Frederick's complaint lacked merit. As Frederick did not file any objections to the recommendations, the court accepted them and dismissed the complaint without prejudice. The case centered around issues involving AI, although specific details of the claims were not provided in the
