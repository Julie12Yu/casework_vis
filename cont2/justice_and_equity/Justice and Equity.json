    "summary": "1. **Summary:** \nThis case involves Derek Mobley and other plaintiffs suing Workday, Inc., alleging that its AI-based applicant recommendation system discriminates against job candidates based on age, race, and disability, particularly affecting applicants over forty. The court granted preliminary collective certification for the age discrimination claim, allowing Mobley to notify similarly situated individuals so they can opt into the lawsuit. This stage focuses on the collective similarity of claims regarding whether Workday's system causes a disparate impact on applicants over forty.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue:** \nThe key legal issue is whether Workday's AI recommendation system causes a disparate impact on applicants over the age of forty, in violation of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA).\n\n3. **Court's Holding:** \nThe court granted preliminary collective certification, finding that Mobley adequately alleged a unified discriminatory policy through Workday’s AI system impacting applicants over forty. The court determined that the issue of whether the AI caused a disparate impact is suited for common proof across the proposed collective, thereby allowing preliminary certification of the collective age discrimination claim.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation:**\nImagine there's a robot that helps decide who gets a job interview by looking at their job applications. Some people think this robot is unfair to older applicants, not giving them a fair chance to move forward in job searches. A group of people, led by a man named Derek, went to court to make this case on behalf of many similar workers. The court decided that enough people could have been affected the same way, so they allowed Derek to tell others about the case and invite them to join in saying, \"If you feel the robot treated you unfairly due to age, you can join Derek in this lawsuit!\"",
    "full_text": "1  \n \n \nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT  \nNORTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA  \n \nDEREK MOBLEY , \nPlaintiff , \nv. \n \nWORKDAY, INC. , \nDefendant . \n Case No.   23-cv-00770 -RFL    \n \n \nORDER GRANTING PRELIMINARY  \nCOLLECTIVE  CERTIFICATION  \nRe: Dkt. No. 10 6 \n \n \nDerek Mobley brings this action for employment discrimination against Workday, Inc., \nalleging that Workday’s artificial intelligence (“AI”) -based applicant recommendation  system  \ndiscriminated against job applicants on the basis of race, age, and disability.   Mobley  is joined by \nfour other plaintiffs over the age of forty,  who allege that they too have applied for hundreds of \njobs via Workday and have been rejected almost every time without an interview, allegedly \nbecause of age discrimination in Workday’s AI recommendation  system .  Mobley now moves \nfor preliminary certification of a collective action on the age discrimination claim , which would \nallow him to notify similarly situat ed individuals of the lawsuit and provide them an opportunity \nto opt -in to having their claims heard on a collective basis .  (Dkt. No. 106.)  After additional \ndiscovery, Workday would then have an opportunity to present evidence that the collective is \nnot, in fact , similarly situated .  Workday could then  ask the Court to revisit its preliminary \ndecision by de -certifying the collective and requiring each plaintiff to proceed individually.  \nMobley’s  motion  for preliminar y certif ication of  the collective  is GRANTED .   \nThe proposed collective is similarly situated because Mobley has substantially alleged the \nexistence of a unified policy:  the use of Workday’s AI recommendation system to score, sort, Case 3:23-cv-00770-RFL     Document 128     Filed 05/16/25     Page 1 of 202 rank, or screen applicants.  The critical issue at the heart of Mobley’s  claim is whether that \nsystem has a disparate impact on applicants over forty .  That  issue  is susceptible to common \nproof —it cuts across the proposed collective, regardless of the degree  to which  particular \nemployers place weight on those  recommendations, the extent to which the system makes \ndiscriminatory recommendations across different  employers, or  the natural variations in the  \nqualifications or rejection rate for particular members of the proposed collective .  At this stage, \nthat is sufficient.  T he proposed collective need not be identical in all ways, because its members \nare alike in the central way that matters:  they were allegedly required  to compet e on unequal \nfooting due to Workday’s di scriminatory A I recommendations.  \nWorkday has raised concerns that there may be logistical hurdles to identifying members \nof the collective.  On the current record, those challenges do not appear insurmountable.  And, of \ncourse, c hallenges in identifying the collective  are not an excuse for denying notice  altogether .  \nNor does the size of the collective provide a basis to decline to provide notice .  If the collective is \nin the “hundreds of millions” of people, as Workday speculates, that is because Workday has \nbeen plausibly accused of discriminating against a broad swath of applicants.  Allegedly \nwidespread discrimination is not a basis for denyin g notice.  The parties shall meet and confer  \nand engage in further targeted discovery to develop a notice plan.  If necessary, publication \nnotice via social media or electronic notice to applicants using  Workday’s platform could be \nconsidered, but only if targeted notice cannot be accomplished.   \nI. BACKGROUND  \nA. Allegations and Supporting  Declaration s \nMobley seeks preliminary certification of a nationwide collective as to his Age \nDiscrimination in Employment Act (“ADEA”) claim.  The proposed collective includes “[a]ll \nindividuals aged 40 and over who, from September 24, 2020, through the present, [] applied for \njob opportunities using Workday, Inc.’s job application platform and were denied employment Case 3:23-cv-00770-RFL     Document 128     Filed 05/16/25     Page 2 of 203 recommendations.”  (Dkt. No. 106 at 14.)1   \nWorkday allegedly provides “human resource management services” including  applicant \nscreening services  on a subscription basis to businesses spanning numerous different industries.  \n(Dkt. No. 47  (“FAC” ), at 2, ¶¶ 89 –90.)  Workday  provides a  platform on the customer’s website \nto collect, process, and screen job applications.  ( See id. at 2, ¶¶  49–55.)  Workday’s website \nstates that it can “reduce time to hire by automatically dispositioning or moving candidates \nforward in the recruiting process.”  ( Id. ¶ 94. )  Workday allegedly “embeds artificial intelligence \n. . . into its algorithmic decision -making tools, enabling these applications to make hiring \ndecisions.”  ( Id. ¶ 99.)  Workday’s applicant screening tools allegedly integrate “pymetrics” that \n“use neuroscience data and AI,” in combination with existing employee referrals and \nrecommendations.  ( Id. ¶¶ 100 –01.)  According to Mobley, these tools “determine whether an \nemployer should accept or reject an application” and are designed in a manner that reflects \nemployer biases and relies on biased training data.  ( Id. at 3, ¶¶ 28, 38 –48, 102 –03.)  Mobley \nalleges that Workday’s AI  recommendation system can score, sort, rank, or screen an  applicant  \nand provide that data to the employer .  (Id. at 2–3, ¶¶ 28, 39, 98–101, 110 –12, 120 .)  In many  \ncases , an applicant can advance in the hiring process only if they get past Workday’s screening \nalgorithms.  ( Id. ¶ 98.)   \nAlthough discovery is ongoing, the  parties ’ preliminary collective certification briefing \ndiscusses  two Workday tools.  The first tool, Candidate Skills Match (“CSM”) , operates within a \nsubscription service called “Workday Recruiting” to “extract [] skills in the employer’s job \nposting” and the applicant’s materials “and determine the extent to which the applicant’s skills \nmatch the role to which they applied.  The results of CSM are reported [to the employer] as \n‘strong,’ ‘good,’ ‘fair,’ ‘low,’ ‘pending,’ a nd ‘unable to score.’”  (Dkt. No. 109 -6 at 4 .)  The \nsecond tool,  Workday Assessment Connector (“WAC”) is alleged to  use machine learning  to \n“observe that a client -employer disfavors certain candidates who are members of a protected \n \n1 Citations to page numbers refer to the ECF pagination.  Case 3:23-cv-00770-RFL     Document 128     Filed 05/16/25     Page 3 of 204 class, [and]  decrease the rate at which it recommends those candidates .”  (FAC ¶¶ 39, 100–01; \nDkt. No. 107 at 29 –30.)  Workday stated at oral argument —without introducing any evidence on \nthe issue —that WAC acts as a bridge to allow employers to access only “third -party” AI \nfeatures.  (Dkt. No. 120 at 8:6 –17; Dkt. No. 107 at 29 n. 6 .)  Via declaration, Workday also \nasserts that  customers with Workday Recruit ing subscriptions may  “enable, disable, use, or \nignore its many features ,” including its AI features .  (Dkt. No. 107 at 9 (citing Dkt. No. 108  ¶ \n10).)    \nSince 2017, Mobley has allegedly applied to over 100 positions with companies that use \nWorkday’s screening features  for talent acquisition and hiring.  ( FAC  ¶ 49.)  Mobley was \nallegedly denied employment for every one of the 100 -plus applications that he submitted to \ncompanies using Workday’s platform.  (Id. ¶ 88.)  In support of his motion, Mobl ey submits the \ndeclarations of four Opt-In Plaintiffs who likewise state that they are over forty and have \nsubmitted “hundreds of employment applications to prospective employers” through the \nWorkday system  and have been rejected nearly every time.  ( See Dkt. No. 106  at 6, 9 –13.)  Each \nOpt-In Plaintiff alleges that they  received at least one “automated” rejection email for a job for \nwhich the y met the qualification requirements.  ( Id.)  \nB. Motion to Dismiss Order  \nMobley  has already been found to have stated a plausible ADEA claim on a disparate \nimpact theory.  As explained in the order denying Workday’s motion to dismiss, Mobley has \nalleged that “Workday’s customers delegate traditional hiring functions, including rejecting \napplicants, to the algorithmic decision -making tools provided by Workday.”  ( Dkt. No. 80  at 9.)  \nSpecifically, “Workday’s software is not simply implementing in a rote way the criteria that \nemployers set forth, but is instead participating in the decision -making process by recommending \nsome candidates to move forward and rejecting others.”  ( Id.)  “Given Workday’s allegedly \ncrucial role in deciding which applicants can get their ‘foot in the door’ for an interview,” \nMobley had plausibly alleged that “Workday’s tools are engaged in conduct that is at the heart of \nequal access to employment opportu nities.”  (Id.)  Mobley has also adequately alleged that these Case 3:23-cv-00770-RFL     Document 128     Filed 05/16/25     Page 4 of 205 tools created a discriminatory disparity.  ( Id. at 15.)   \nII. LEGAL STANDARD  \nMobley  seeks preliminary  collective certification of his ADEA claim.  The AD EA \nprohibits employers from discriminating against a qualified individual on the basis of a disability \n“in regard to job application procedures” and “the hiring” of employees.  42 U.S.C. § 12112(a).   \nIn proving a claim for disparate impact under the ADEA “a plaintiff must (1) show a significant \ndisparate impact on a protected class or group; (2) identify the specific employment practices or \nselection criteria at issue; and (3) show a causal relationship between the challenged practices or \ncriteria and the disparate impact.”  Bolden -Hardge v. Off. of Cal. State Controller , 63 F.4th 1215, \n1227 (9th Cir. 2023).  \nThe ADEA is enforced “in accordance with the powers, remedies, and procedures” of the \nFair Labor Standards Act (“FLSA”).  29 U.S.C. § 626(b); Heath v. Google LLC , 345 F. Supp. 3d \n1152, 1164 (N.D. Cal. 2018).  Section 216(b) of the FLSA provides that one or more employees \nmay bring a collective action against any employer on behalf of “themselves and other \nemployees similarly situated.”  29 U.S.C. § 216(b).  Under this provision, “workers may litigate \njointly if they (1) claim a violation of the FLSA, (2) ar e ‘similarly situated,’ and (3) affirmatively \nopt into the joint litigation.”  Campbell v. City of Los Angeles , 903 F.3d 1090, 1100 (9th Cir. \n2018).  The FLSA does not define the term “similarly situated .”  See 29 U.S.C. § 216(b); \nCampbell , 903 F.3d at 1100 (“Given  the[] gaps [in the FLSA], much of collective action practice \nis a product of interstitial judicial lawmaking or ad hoc district court discretion.”).  However, \n“what matters is not just any similarity between party plaintiffs, but a legal or factual similarity \nmaterial to the resolution of the party plaintiffs’ claims, in the sense of having the potential to \nadvance these claims, collectively, to some resolution.”  Campbell , 903 F.3d  at 1115  (emphasis \nin original) .  Frequently, plaintiffs satisfy the “similarly situated” analysis with “substantial \nallegations, supported by declarations or discovery, that the putative class members were \ntogether the victims of a single decision, policy, or plan.”  See Villa v. United Site Servs. of Cal ., \nInc., No. 12 -cv-318-LHK, 2012 WL 5503550, at *13 (N.D. Cal. Nov. 13, 2012)  (collecting Case 3:23-cv-00770-RFL     Document 128     Filed 05/16/25     Page 5 of 206 cases) .  If such  similarit ies exist, the  collective  may be granted preliminary certif ication even if \nthere are  differences  that will ultimately require  a degree of  individual adjudication.  Id. at *14 \n(“certification is proper based on the allegations that Defendant operated under [a] common \npolicy, even though to prove liability, individual plaintiffs may still have to prove that they never \nactually took their breaks, and thus were underpaid”) .   \nIn Campbell , the Ninth Circuit described with approval the common practice in this \ndistrict of using  a two-step process to determin e whether a collective is “similarly situated.”  See \nCampbell , 903 F.3d at 11 10 (finding that “[t]here is good reason for th[e] consensus” on the two -\nstep approach).  First, “plaintiffs will typically move for preliminary certification.”  Id. at 1109.  \nAt this stage, the standard of review is “loosely akin to a plausibility standard, commensurate \nwith the stage of the proceedings,” and “the district court’s analysis is typically focused on a \nreview of the pleadings but may sometimes be supplemented by declara tions or limited other \nevidence.”  Id.2  If preliminary certification is granted, the “sole consequence . . . is the sending \nof court -approved written notice to workers who may wish to join the litigation as individuals.”  \nId. at 1101  (quoting Genesis Healthcare Corp. v. Symczyk , 569 U.S. 66, 75 (2013)) . \nAfter a collective has secured preliminary certification, the second stage of the analysis \n“will come at or after the close of relevant discovery. ”  Id. at 1109.  “The employer can move for \n‘decertification’ of the collective action for failure to satisfy the ‘similarly situated’ requirement \nin light of the evidence produced to that point.”  Id. (citing  1 McLaughlin on Class Actions § \n2:16 (21st ed.  2024 ); 7B Fed. Prac. & Proc. Civ. § 1807  (3d ed.  2025 )).  “The district court will \nthen take a more exacting look at the plaintiffs’ allegations and the record.”  Id.  “[T]he two -step \nprocess, culminating in a decertification motion on or after the close of rel evant discovery, has \nthe advantage of ensuring early notice of plausible collective actions, then eliminating those \n \n2 “The fact that a defendant submits competing declarations will not as a general rule preclude \n[preliminary]  certification.”  Harris v. Vector Mktg. Corp. , 716 F. Supp. 2d 835, 838 (N.D. Cal. \n2010) ; see also Sanchez v. Sephora USA, Inc. , No. 11-cv-03396 -SBA, 2012 WL 2945753, at *4 \n(N.D. Cal. July 18, 2012) (collecting cases that disregarded disputed evidence submitted by \ndefendants when certifying a collective at the notice stage).  Case 3:23-cv-00770-RFL     Document 128     Filed 05/16/25     Page 6 of 207 whose promise is not borne out by the record.”  Id. at 1110.  \nIII. DISCUSSION  \nA. Burden of Proof  \nAs an initial matter, Workday argues that Mobley  should be held to a significantly  higher \nburden of proof at the first stage of the “similarly situated” analysis  because the parties have \nalready engaged in some discovery.   (Dkt. No. 107 at 11 , 31–32.)  In essence, Workday proposes \na sliding scale, in which the more discovery has occurred, the more evidence plaintiff should \nhave to provide.  At oral argument , consistent with that approach,  Workday repeatedly faulted \nMobley for relying on his well -pled allegations and  for failing to come forward with  sufficient \nevidence .  The Court declines to apply a sliding -scale standard , which is contrary to the \nprocedure used by virtually all district courts in this circuit.  Such an approach would be \nimpossible to app ly with consistency , would encourage gamesmanship, and is contrary to the \npolicy considerations laid out in Campbell .   \nUnlike the straightforward standard described in Camp bell, a sliding scale standard \nwould require a court to weigh competing evidence on an incomplete record, attempting  to fairly \naccount for what percentage of discovery has yet to be exchanged.  Such a system would lead to \ninconsistent rulings.   How much weight should a court assign conflicting evidence proffered by a \ndefendant  when the court  estimates that only 20% of relevant discovery has been exchanged ?  \nWhat burden of proof should a plaintiff be held to where  90% of discovery is complete ?  What \nshould a court do where, as here, the parties disagree on  how much critical discovery remains to \nbe exchanged ?  Even more concerning, the system would encourage  gamesmanship.  P arties \ncould  withhold critical discovery until after preliminary  collective  certification  in an effort to win \nan early —and potentially dispositive —evidentiary battl e.  It would also allow defendants to  \nengineer a higher burden of proof for a plaintiff simply by negotiating for a lengthier discovery \nperiod prior to preliminary  certification, just as Workday did here in its proposed schedule at the \ninitial cas e management conference .  (See Dkt. No. 92.)  \nCampbel l endorses a two -step process where step one is “ loosely akin to a plausibility Case 3:23-cv-00770-RFL     Document 128     Filed 05/16/25     Page 7 of 208 standard ” and step two “resemble [s] a motion for partial summary judgment.”  Campbell , 903 \nF.3d at 11 09.  Its reasons for doing so are clear.  The system “ensur[es] early notice of plausible \ncollective actions” to the interested parties, and “then eliminating those whose promise is not \nborne out by the record.”  Id. at 1110.   Workday has provided no compelling reason for departing \nfrom the Ninth Circuit’s directive here, especially where Workday’s own evidentiary submission \nis limited to excerpts of  Plaintiffs ’ deposition transcripts, four interrogatory responses, and a \nsingle declaration.  (Dkt. Nos. 108, 109.)  Mobley ’s motion will therefore be assessed under the \n“substantial allegations” of similarity standard set forth above .   \nB. Mobley’s Proposed Collective  \nMobley argues that the proposed collective is “similarly situated” because all proposed \nmembers , like Mobley and the Opt -In Plaintiffs, were “together the victims of a single . . . \npolicy” :  “Workday’s artificial intelligence and machine learning screening products [which] \ntreat applicants over age 40 discriminatorily and have a disparate impact against them .”  (Dkt. \nNo. 106  at 15 , 18.)  He points to the allegations in the complaint, which have  already  been  found \nplausible, and the declarations of Opt -In Pl aintiffs who similarly experienced a high rejection \nrate of their application s processed through Workday.  ( Id. at 18.)   \nMobley  has substantially alleged an “identifiable factual or legal nexus [that] binds \ntogether the various claims of the [collective]  members in a way that hearing the claims together \npromotes judicial efficiency and comports with the broad remedial policies underlying the \nFLSA,” making the proposed collective  similarly situated.  See Rabin v. \nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP , No. 16 -cv-2276 -JST, 2018 WL 3585143, at *4 (N.D. Cal. July \n26, 2018) (citing Russell v. Wells Fargo & Co. , No. 07 -cv-3993 -CW, 2008 WL 4104212, at *3 \n(N.D. Cal. Sept. 3, 2008) ).  Specifically, he has  shown that the elements of his prima facie \ndisparate impact claim are susceptible to com mon proof.  Because Mobley has identified a \nunified policy applicable to all the putative collective members, common evidence can be used to \n“(1) show a significant disparate impact on [individuals over 40]; (2) identify the specific \nemployment practices or selection criteria at issue; and (3) show a causal relationship between Case 3:23-cv-00770-RFL     Document 128     Filed 05/16/25     Page 8 of 209 the challenged practices or criteria and the disparate impact.”  See Bolden -Hardge , 63 F.4th at \n1227  (listing the elements of a prima facie disparate impact case) .  Even under the more exacting \n“commonality” standard, the Ninth Circuit has found that the identification of a uniform policy \nthat allegedly generated a disparate impact creates a common question as to a prima facie case of \ndisparate impact age discrimination.  See Stockwell v. City & Cnty.  of San Francisco , 749 F.3d \n1107, 1114 –15 (9th Cir. 2014) ; see also Wal -Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes , 564 U.S. 338, 350 –56 \n(2011) (“If the employer ‘used a biased testing procedure to evaluate [] applicants for \nemployment. . .  , a class action on behalf of every applicant . . . who might have been prejudiced \nby the test clearly would satisfy the commonality and typicality requirements of Rule 23(a).’”) \n(quoting  Gen. Tel. Co. S w. v. Falcon , 457 U.S. 147 , 159 n. 15  (1982)).   \nThe mechanisms behind  Workday’s AI recommendation  system , the effects  on applicants \nwho are over 40 , and whether those “effects amount to a disparate impact on account of age, [] \nwill be so for all [collective]  members or for none; their claims rise and fall together.”  Stockwell , \n749 F.3d at 1115.  Therefore, as discussed in further detail below, preliminary collective \ncertification is proper.   \nC. Challenges to Any  Proposed Collective  \nWorkday advances several arguments for why it is impossible for any collective to be \nsimilarly situated under Mobley’s theory of the case.  First, Workday claims that it “does not \noffer ‘employment recommendations, ’ so no one belongs in this collective, including [Mobley] .”  \n(Dkt. No. 107 at 31 (emphasis in original).)  Second, Workday argues that the policy Mobley has \nidentified is not uniform, defeating preliminary collective certification .  Finally, Workday \nsuggests that the natural variation in the proposed  collective members ’ qualification s for the jobs \nto which they applied, number of jobs applied to, and rejection rate mean that no collective could \never be similarly situated.  Each of these arg uments is addressed in turn.     \n1. Whether Workday “Recommends” Applicants  \nCiting its interrogatory responses, Workday argues that “Workday does not recommend, \nscreen out, or otherwise assess or predict applicants’ likelihood of success in a role.”  (Dkt. No. Case 3:23-cv-00770-RFL     Document 128     Filed 05/16/25     Page 9 of 2010 107 at 31.)  Therefore, Workday claims that no one has ever been “denied employment \nrecommendations” by Workday and the proposed collective  has no members.  Id.  But this \nposition is contrary to the well -pled allegations in the complaint (incorporating Workday’s \nstatements on its own website), as well as Workday’s interrogatory responses.  For example:  \n \n• Workday’s website states that “[o]ur skills intelligence foundation \nhelps you build diverse teams by expanding candidate pools with \nequitable, AI- and ML -driven job recommendations .”  (FAC ¶ 111 \n(emphasis added).)3   \n \n• In discovery, Workday stated that: “Workday customers who \npurchase Workday Recruiting have access to Candidate Skills Match \n(‘CSM’), which they can choose to turn on or off.  If a customer \nchooses to turn on CSM, CSM utilizes artificial intelligence to par se \nan employer’s job posting and an applicant’s application and/or \nresume; extract skills in the employer’s job posting, on the one hand, \nand skills from the application and/or resume on the other hand; and \ndetermine the extent to which the applicant’s ski lls match the role to \nwhich they applied.  The results of CSM are reported as ‘strong,’ \n‘good,’ ‘fair,’ ‘low,’ ‘pending,’ and ‘unable to score .’”  (Dkt. No. \n109-6 at 4 (emphasis added).)  \n \n• Plaintiff alleges that Workday’s “algorithms are only trained on \nincumbent employees at a company, allowing the pymetrics Workday \nAssessment Connector to build a homogenous workforce not \nrepresentative of the applicant pool.”  (FAC ¶ 102.)   \nWorkday fails to explain why the conduct described above does not constitute \n“recommend[ing], screen[ing] out, or otherwise assess[ing] or predict[ing] applicants’ likelihood \nof success in a role.”  Workday appears to take the position that because its AI recommendation \nsystem  supposedly cannot auto -reject applicants without some degree of participation by the \nemployer , Workday  does not “recommend.”  But Mobley’s  disparate impact claim is based on \nthe theory that Workday’s AI “participat [es] in the decision -making process,” a concept that is \nbroader than auto -rejections.  ( Dkt. No. 80  at 9.)  Therefore, even if Workday is taken at its word \nthat its AI recommendation system cannot auto-reject an applicant, Workday is incorrect that the \nproposed collective  is memberless.   An individual who received a “low” CSM score, for \nexample, could  qualify as having been denied an employment recommendation.  Similarly, \n \n3 Quoting  https://www.workday.com/en -us/products/talent -management/talent -acquisition.html.  Case 3:23-cv-00770-RFL     Document 128     Filed 05/16/25     Page 10 of 2011 Mobley has substantially alleged that the WAC operates to recommend certain applicants over \nothers in a way that causes a disparate impact.    \nQuestions remain regarding where to draw the line between someone who was and \nsomeone who was not “recommended. ”  Does anything less than a “strong” CSM  score qualify \nas a denial of a recommendation?  How should  the results  of any  other  features  be measured?  \nHowever, the fact that these questions remain outstanding does not mean that no collective may \nbe certified.  See, e.g., Heath v. Google Inc. , 215 F. Supp. 3d 844, 859 (N.D. Cal. 2016) \n(certifying the collective and “instruct[ing] the parties to meet a nd confer on how to use \napplicants’ graduation date information as a proxy for age . . . to identify the candidates to whom \nthe third -party administrator will send notice” ).  Where the court has found that a collective \nshould receive preliminary certification, it cannot withhold notice simply because it will be \ndifficult to identify individual putative members.  See Campbell , 903 F.3d at 1110 ( stating that \n“in a valid collection action, ‘forbid[ding] the sending of notice altogether’ would be an abuse of \ndiscretion”) ( quoting  Woods v. N.Y. Life Ins. Co. , 686 F.2d 578, 580 (7th Cir. 1982)); see also  \nCarrillo v. Schneider Logistics, Inc ., No. 11 -cv-08557, 2012 WL 556309, at * 12–13 (C.D. Cal. \nJan. 31, 2012)  (authorizing alternative notice  where members of the collective  could not be \neasily identified) , aff’d on other grounds , 501 F. App’x 713 (9th Cir. 2012) .  Accordingly, the \nparties are ordered to meet and confer to determine how to define a “recommendation ,” along \nwith the other issues further detailed below.   \n2. Whether Mobley Has Identified a Unified  Policy  \nWorkday next argues that Mobley has failed to show that any uniform policy applies to \nall applications submitted through Workday, and that “[w]ithout that uniformity, there can be no \ncommon decision, policy, or plan justifying collective adjudication.”  (D kt. No. 107 at 29.)   \nSpecifically, Workday points out that employers can choose whether or not to use Workday’s AI \nfeatures.  ( Id. at 30.)  Furthermore, with respect to the “Workday Assessment Connector” feature  \nwhich Mobley alleges is used to “build a homogenous workforce” at a particular company, \nDefendant argues that whether or not this feature  cause s a disparate impact would necessarily Case 3:23-cv-00770-RFL     Document 128     Filed 05/16/25     Page 11 of 2012 vary based on the existing makeup of the employer’s incumbent workforce.  ( Id. at 29 –30.)  \nAs to the use of AI features  by Workday’s clients , the proposed collective already  \nencompass es only individuals whose applications were subject to  Workday’s AI  because the \nemployer turned on AI features .  By limiting the collective to those who were “denied \nemployment recommendation s” by Workday, the collective necessarily includes  only individuals \nwho were scored, sorted, ranked, or screened by Workday’s  AI and who either had this \ninformation conveyed to the employer  or who had their application withheld from the employer \nby Workday .  That is because  an individual who was scored, sorted, ranked, or screened based  \nonly on criteria  that were  specifically  selected by the employer  alone  has not been “denied [an] \nemployment recommendation” by Workday , even if the employer -directed  screening was \neffectuated through Workday.   In that hypothetical scenario , Workday would be no different \nfrom an excel spreadsheet operated by the employer  that sorted employees by age, so that the \nemployer could refuse to interview those above a certain cutoff.  (Dkt. No. 80 at 11.)  As \npreviously held in the motion to dismiss order, Workday would not be liable under an agency \ntheory in that scenario.  (Id.)  Accordingly, the individual w ould not be part of the proposed \ncollective.  The unified policy that Mobley has identified is Workday’s  AI recommend ation  \nsystem, and the proposed collective  reflects that limitation.   Workday will have the opportunity \nat a later stage of the case to present evidence that its AI system does not operate in a unified \nway.   \nWorkday’s argument  that certain of its AI features  could vary in their impact across \ndifferent employers  does not defeat the existence of common issues either .  In nearly every  large \ndisparate impact case , certain  units of the whole —for example, regions of a national company  or \ndivisions of a n organization —will demonstrate  the effects of a  unified  discriminatory policy to a \ngreater or lesser extent  than others , or may demonstrate no discriminatory effect at all .  But \nwhere a unified policy exists and  the net disparate impact of that unified policy can be proven \nthrough statistical evidence, such unit -level differences do not defeat the prima facie \ndiscrimination case .  The case re mains subject to collective proof.  For example, in Ellis v. Case 3:23-cv-00770-RFL     Document 128     Filed 05/16/25     Page 12 of 2013 Costco Wholesale Corp. , 285 F.R.D. 492  (N.D. Cal. 2012) , Costco  opposed  certification in a \ncase related to gender  discrimination in promotion.  Id. at 522 –23.  Costco ’s expert argued that \nthe court should look at “promotion numbers by region and evaluate each region separately ,” \nnoting  that some regions showed no evidence of discrimination.  Id.  The court found the  region -\nby-region  data unpersuasive  for several reasons, including that Costco’s top -down “promotion \npractices support a nationwide statistical analysis.”  Id.  Here , as well, Mobley has identified a \nunified policy that is the source of the alleged discriminatory disparate impact.  At this stage, the \nfact that the policy may not yield discriminatory results in every possible scenario  does not mean \nthat the proposed collective is not similarly situated.   \nFurthermore, if Workday intends to argue that any observable disparate impact is the \nresult of employer -driven bias and not attributable to Workday, that issue does not defeat \npreliminary certification  either .  How Workday’s AI recommendation  system works , and the \nextent to which any disparate impact is  generally driven by employer preferences  rather than \nWorkday’s own algorithm s, are issues susceptible to common proof.  To the extent Workday \ncontends that its advertised  AI recommendations are mere rote implementation of employer \npreferences, and thus that no uniform policy can be traced to its AI, that is an issue for the \nsecond stage of the  “similarly situated” analysis , and not this preliminary stage .  See Rabin , 2018 \nWL 3585143, at *4 ( “[c]onsiderations involving the merits of claims are more appropriately \naddressed at the second stage of the analysis when fewer facts  are in dispute” ) (citation omitted) ; \nsee also  Stockwell , 749 F.3d at 1114  n. 3 (in the more demanding Rule 23(b) context, affirmative \ndefenses are “not pertinent to the commonality question, as long as there is a common question \nas to the [] prima facie case of disparate impact age discrimination”) .   \n3. Whether the Individual Characteristics of Members of the Proposed \nCollective Make Certification Impossible  \nWorkday argues that because Mobley and the Opt -In Plaintiffs (i) did not meet the \nminimum qualifications for every job they were rejected from, (ii) sometimes omitted indicia of \ntheir age from their applications, and (iii) received some  interview s or job  offers  as the result of Case 3:23-cv-00770-RFL     Document 128     Filed 05/16/25     Page 13 of 2014 their applications via  Workday, they are not similarly situated to the hypothetical plaintiff who \ncould state a disparate impact claim against Workday.  (Dkt. No. 107 at 13 –15, 21 –24.)  \nWorkday sees Mobley and Opt -in Plaintiffs’ slightly varied  application  experiences as \n“emblematic”  of the fact that the individual characteristics  of potential collective members  will \noverwhelm, making “collective adjudication [] impossible .”  (Id. at 19, 24 (emphasis in \noriginal).)   At oral argument, Workday raised  further  concerns about  whether Mobley  would be \nable to carry his burden at the merits stage of statistically proving a disparate impact claim where  \nthe collective compris ed both  qualified and unqualified candidates for jobs .   \nMobley is not required to prove that each member of the proposed collective is \nidentically situated, or even that common questions predominate.  Villa , 2012 WL 5503550, at \n*14 (“conditional certification of a collective action does not require a showing that common \nclaims predominate”).  Instead, his burden is  to identify legal or factual similarit ies that are  \nmaterial to the resolution of the case.  Id.  As discussed above, Mobley has met that burden.  \nMobley has substantially  alleged  that the factors of his prima facie disparate impact claim are \nsusceptible to common proof.    \nIt is possible that , at the merits stage, Mobley will face challenges in proving  disparate \nimpact  for the reasons that Workday identifies .  However, that challenge is one that is common \nto the collective , and does not counsel against certification.  See Tyson Foods, Inc. v. \nBouaphakeo , 577 U.S. 442, 457 (2016) (“[r]espondents’ ‘failure of proof on this common \nquestion ’ likely would have ended ‘the litigation and thus would not have caused individual \nquestions to overwhelm questions common to the class. ’”) (quoting  Amgen Inc. v. Conn . Ret. \nPlans and Tr . Funds , 568 U.S. 455, 468 (2013))  (cleaned up) .  The variables may also be \nrelevant to Workday’s defenses in individual cases, and will likely  impact individual plaintiffs’ \nclaim for damages .  However, the “various defenses available to the defendant which appear to \nbe individual to each plaintiff” is properly assessed at the second phase of the collective \ncertification inquiry , and is not relevant to the  preliminary certification  analysis .  See Rabin , \n2018 WL 3585143, at *4 .  In sum , Workday has not identified a basis to deny preliminary Case 3:23-cv-00770-RFL     Document 128     Filed 05/16/25     Page 14 of 2015 certification.   \nD. Limits on the Collective  \nWorkday argues that the only individuals who could conceivably be entitled to join a \ncollective on Mobley’s theory of the case are those who applied to a high number of jobs, met \nthe minimum qualification for every job for which they applied, and had a “zero percent success \nrate.”  (Dkt. No. 106 at 12, 14, 20.)  Workday claims that no other applicants are “entitled to the \nsame ‘inference of  discrimination’ the Court gave [Mobley ] at the motion to dismiss.”  ( Id. at \n20–21.)  In support , Workday argues that t he FLSA  was amended to “limit[] private [ADEA] \nplaintiffs to employees who asserted claims in their own right and free[] employers of the burden \nof representative actions.”  (Dkt. No. 160 at 21 (quoting Hoffmann -La Roche , 493 U.S. at 173) \n(emphasis added by Workday).)   \nThis case, however, is no longer at the motion to dismiss stage and has moved into \ndiscovery.  As such, whether each member of the collective could allege disparate impact \nwithout the benefit of discovery is irrelevant.  Instead, the question is whether the proposed \ncollective members are similarly situated in the sense that they were actually “subject to the \nparticular employment practice with the alleged disparate impact .”  See Pottenger v. Potlatch \nCorp. , 329 F.3d 740, 749–750 (9th Cir. 2003 ); see also  Campbell , 903 F.3d at 1100 (individuals \nmay only “join a collective action if they [] claim a violation of the FLSA , [] are ‘similarly \nsituated ’ to the original plaintiff,  [] and affirmatively opt in”) (emphasis added).  Because the \nproposed collective encompasses only individuals who submitted applications through Workday \nand were “denied employment recommendations ,” this requirement is satisfied.   \nIt is unnecessary to examine each individual’s qualifications , application volume,  or \nrejection rate to determine if they are members of the collective.  Whether Workday’s AI \nrecommendation  system  has a disparate impact on applicants over forty is a question that is \naddressed across the collective, not on a member -by-member basis.  Workday cites Heath for the \nproposition the collective cannot include “ individuals who were not qualified for the jobs to \nwhich they applied .”  (Dkt. No 107 at 20 –23 (citing Heat h, 215 F. Supp. 3d at 857).)  But Heath  Case 3:23-cv-00770-RFL     Document 128     Filed 05/16/25     Page 15 of 2016 was a disparate treatment case.  Heath , 215 F. Supp. 3d at 848.  Therefore, unlike in Heath , \n“qualification” is not an element of Mobley’s prima facie disparate impact claim.  Compare id.  at \n857 (citing Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods., Inc. , 530 U.S. 133, 142 (2000)) with Bolden -\nHardge , 63 F.4th at 1227 .   \nMoreover, applicants do not need to show that they were qualified, got rejected, or would \nlikely have succeeded in being hired for the job in order to have standing to bring a disparate \nimpact claim  for injunctive relief .4  See Carney v. Adams , 592 U.S. 53, 66 (2020)  (reaffirming  \nthat an “aggrieved party need not allege that he would have obtained the benefit but for the \nunlawful barrier in order to establish standing”) (quotations omitted).  Here, in addition to \ndamages, Plaintiffs seek injunctive relief to stop Workday from continuing to engage in the \nallegedly discriminatory practice.  (FAC at 35.)  To allege an injury -in-fact sufficient to satisfy \nArticle III standing  to seek injunctive relief , applicant s need only show that they were denied the \nright to compete on equal footing against other candidates due to the allegedly discriminatory \nnature of Workday’s AI recommendation  system , and that they intend to  apply for jobs in the \nfuture through  Workday’s platform .   \n“In the context of an employment discrimination claim, a plaintiff may claim an injury in \nfact from the purported denial of the ability to compete on an equal footing against other \ncandidates for a job.”  Shea v. Kerry, 796 F.3d 42, 50 (D.C. Cir. 2015) (citing Ne. Fla. Chapter \nof the Associated Gen. Contractors of Am. v. City of Jacksonville,  508 U.S. 656, 666 (1993)).  \n“And because the injury lies in the denial of an equal opportunity  to compete, not the denial of \nthe job itself, the Court need not inquire  into the plaintiff’s qualifications (or lack thereof) when \nassessing standing.”  Id. (citing  Regents of Univ. of Cal. v. Bakke,  438 U.S. 265, 280 –81 & n. 14 \n(1978))  (emphasis in original) ; Cerrato v. S.F. Cmty. Coll. Dist. , 26 F.3d 968, 976 (9th Cir. \n1994) (“[t]o establish standing, a person need only allege that a discriminatory policy exists that \n \n4 Workday conceded at oral argument that it was not challenging the proposed collective \nmembers’ standing at this stage, but this order addresses the issue to avoid any doubt as to the \npropriety of defining the collective in the proposed fashion.  Case 3:23-cv-00770-RFL     Document 128     Filed 05/16/25     Page 16 of 2017 prevents him from competing on an ‘equal basis’”).5  Individuals over forty who were allege dly \nsubjected to the discriminatory policy —i.e., they had an application scored, sorted, ranked, or \nscreened by Workday’s AI —therefore have standing regardless of their qualifications, \napplication volume, or rejection rate and may be included in the collective.    \nTo be sure, an applicant’s qualifications could affect their standing to seek damages .  See \nBraunstein v. Ariz . Dep’t Transp. , 683 F.3d 1177 , 1186 –87 (9th Cir. 2012) (plaintiff  lacked \nArticle III standing  to pursue a  damages claim in an equal protection case  because he had not \nsubmitted bids or shown that he would have been “in a position to compete equally ” absent the \nalleged discriminatory policy ).  However, there is no basis for precluding members who have \nstanding to seek injunctive relief from joining the collective simply because they may not be able \nto state a claim for money damages.  At the  trial stage , the collective action could proceed first \non a representative or group basis as to liability and injunctive relief, before mo ving into a \ndamages phase on an individual basis .  See 7B Fed. Prac. & Proc. Civ. § 1807  (3d ed.  2025 ).  At \nthis stage, it is premature to limit the collective  in the way that Workday suggests.6  \nIn summary, preliminary certification is granted to  the collective comprising “[a]ll \nindividuals aged 40 and over who, from September 24, 2020, through the present, [] applied for \njob opportunities using Workday, Inc.’s job application platform and were denied employment \nrecommendations .”  In this context, being “denied ” an “employment recommendation” means \n \n5 Workday contended at oral argument that this line of  cases is distinguishable because they \ninvolved employment tests that were alleged to discriminate under  Title VII rather than the \nADEA.  But Workday offers no principled reason why the Article III standing analysis should \ntreat injury -in-fact due to age discrimination differently from injury -in-fact due to race or sex \ndiscrimination.  \n6 It is theoretically possible that the preliminary  collective will include some individuals who, \nnotwithstanding that they applied to jobs using Workday in the last four years, do not intend to \napply to a ny jobs using Workday’s software in the future .  This is likely to be a small percentage \nof the total collective , given Workday’s widespread role in the job market.  ( See Dkt. No. 108 ¶¶ \n6-7.)  Furthermore , many such individuals will still have standing under a damages theory .  \nFinally , while there  may be a small subset of individuals in the preliminary collective who are \nnot in either camp , this fact does not render the case unmanageable  at this stage .  See Hoffmann -\nLa Roche Inc ., 493 U.S. at 174 (the court’s “intervention in the notice process [is] for case \nmanagement purposes”) .   Case 3:23-cv-00770-RFL     Document 128     Filed 05/16/25     Page 17 of 2018 that (i) the individual’s application was scored, sorted, ranked, or screened by Workday ’s AI; (ii) \nthe result of the AI scoring, sorting, ranking, or screening was not a recommendation to hire ;7 \nand (iii) th at result was communicated to the prospective employer , or the result was an \nautomatic rejection  by Workday .   \nE. Feasibility of Providing Notice  \nWorkday raises a host of concerns regarding how the parties can identify and notify \ncollective members.  In addition to its line -drawing concerns already discussed above, Workday \nargues that it is contractually barred from accessing data about applications, and even if it could \naccess that data, there is no way to det ermine the age of applicants.  Finally, Workday makes the \npolicy argument that the proposed collective is simply too big, and therefore any notice would \namount to  an improper solicitation of cl aims.   \nOn the existing record, it appears that  Workday will likely be able to access the necessary \ndata to provide targeted  notice, and that it would not be unduly burdensome for Workday to \ngather and provide said data .  First, Workday acknowledge d at oral argument that it is able to see \nwhether its customer s have enabled any AI features .  Second, Workday  does not dispute  that \napplicant data is hosted by Workday, and that while Workday’s customers sign  contracts that  \nprohibit Workday from accessing applicants’ confidential personal data, the contract contains an \nexception  applicable when Workday is subject to a court order.   Third, Workday confirmed that, \nassuming customer consent, it can identify the score that its CSM  feature  gave an applicant (and \ncan presumably do so for other features  as well ).  Finally, although Workday’s counsel was \nunable to confirm what age -correlated data Workday customers collect, it is a fair inference that \ndatapoints such as graduation year or employment experience will frequently  be available to use \nas a proxy for age.  See Heath , 215 F. Supp. 3d  at 859 ( ordering the parties to  “meet and confer \non how to use applicants’ graduation date information as a proxy for age, where available in \nGoogle’s gHire database, to identify the candidates to whom the third -party administrator will \n \n7 The parties should meet and confer to determine what rank, score, or grouping constitutes a \n“recommendation.”  Case 3:23-cv-00770-RFL     Document 128     Filed 05/16/25     Page 18 of 2019 send notice.”) .   \nThe estimated size of the collective does not provide a basis to withhold notice either.  \nWorkday states that “1.1 billion applications were rejected using Workday” during the time \nperiod at issue and “any notice would still invite potentially hundreds of millions of potential \nplaintiffs to file their claims in this case.”  (Dkt. No. 107 at 24 –25 (emphasis in original) .)  First, \nthis rough estimate ignores the qualifiers  in the definition of the collective that will limit its \nscope.  Second, it is not the size of the proposed collective  (as Workday argues),  but rather the \ncontent of the proposed notice , that the Supreme Court instructs courts to police in order to \n“respect judicial neutrality .”  Hoffmann -La Roche Inc , 493 U.S. at 174.  In fact,  Hoffmann -La \nRoche reinforces the importance of providing “accurate and timely notice concerning the \npendency of the collective action, so that [individuals] can make informed decisions about \nwhether to participate.”  Id. at 170.  There is no basis for withholding notice simply because \nWorkday is alleged to have discriminated against a large number of applicants .   \nIV. CONCLUSION  \nBecause the proposed collective is similarly situated, Mobley’s Motion for Conditional \nCertification of Collective Action (Dkt. No. 106) is GRANTED , and notice should  issue to the  \ncollective members.  Although  disputes remain —regarding, for example, the parameters of the \n“court order exception”  in Workday’s customer contracts,  the availability of age -related proxies , \nand how to define a “recommendation” —it is premature to find that any of these issue s make \ntargeted  notice unfeasible , and none of the identif ied issues support the withholding of notice \naltogether .  See Rabin v. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP , No. 16 -cv-02276 -JST, 2019 WL \n9078785, at *4 (N.D. Cal., Apr. 5, 2019) (certifying a collective action but explaining that \n“[h]aving so ruled, the Court cannot yet order notice to potential members of the collective \naction because —as the parties themselves agree —furth er meet -and-confer efforts are required \nbefore they and the Court can determine who will receive such notice”).   \nThe parties are directed to meet and confer and engage in further targeted discovery to \nresolve the remaining disputes .  The parties are encouraged to work cooperatively and Case 3:23-cv-00770-RFL     Document 128     Filed 05/16/25     Page 19 of 2020 transparently in identifying the most sensible manner for providing comprehensive notice.  In the \nevent that a list of collective members is developed based on incomplete information in \ndiscovery, and later discovery reveals that a larger group should have  been noticed, the Court \nmay consider whether to authorize further round(s) of notice  and which  party should be \nresponsible for the costs of that notice .  The parties should also consider whether alternative \nnotice is necessary if more targeted notice  proves too difficult.   Carrillo v. Schneider Logistics , \nInc., No. 11 -cv-08557, 2012 WL 556309, at *13 (C.D. Cal. Jan. 31, 2012), aff’d , 501 F. App’x \n713 (9th Cir. 2012) (collecting cases allowing for alternate notice distribution methods where \nFLSA workers could not be easily identified).  \nIn addition, Workday identifies a variety of legitimate concerns about the content of the \nproposed notice, about which the parties are directed to meet and confer.  The parties shall file \nby May 28 , 2025 , a case management statement containing a  proposed schedule  for the targeted \ndiscovery, submission of the notice plan and revised notice, and briefing and a hearing on \naspects of the notice plan on which the parties cannot reach agreement, if any .  If the parties are \nunable to reach agreement on the proposed schedule , the joint filing shall include each side’s \nproposal as to that issue and the reasoning behind its requested approach .  A case management \nconference  to discuss this schedule is set for June 4, 2025, at 10:00 a.m.  via videoconference .  \n \nIT IS SO ORDERED.  \nDated: May 16, 2025  \n \n  \nRITA F.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: Plaintiff Mozart Saint Cyr sued JPMorgan Chase, alleging they violated Massachusetts law by subjecting him to a de facto lie detector test using an AI-powered HireVue Interview during his job application process and failing to provide statutory notice regarding lie detector rights. The court dismissed the lie detector claim due to insufficient allegations demonstrating the HireVue Interview's use for truth detection and remanded the notice claim to state court for lack of jurisdiction, as the plaintiff couldn't establish harm from not receiving the notice.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether JPMorgan Chase's use of AI-powered HireVue Interviews constitutes a violation of the Massachusetts Lie Detector Statute, and if the absence of statutory notice about lie detector tests results in a legal claim.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court found the plaintiff's lie detector allegations insufficient and unrelated to the HireVue Interview's purpose of detecting lies, leading to the dismissal of the lie detector claim. The notice claim was remanded to state court due to lack of Article III standing, as the plaintiff couldn’t show a concrete injury.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine you're applying for a job, and they ask you to do an online interview where a computer program analyzes your answers and expressions. You think this is like a lie detector test, but the court says you haven't shown enough evidence to prove the company used it to see if you were lying. Plus, you didn't lose anything when they didn't tell you about lie detector rules, so that part of your case goes back to state court, which has different rules for hearing cases.",

Gen. Laws \nch. 149, § 19B (the “Lie Detector Statute”).  Plaintiff brings these claims on behalf of himself and \non behalf of all others similarly situated.  JPMorgan has moved to dismiss.  For the reasons stated \nherein, the Court finds Plaintiff’s allegations insufficient as to the purported lie detector test and \nfinds that the Court lacks jurisdiction over his notice claim.  Accordingly, the Court will grant \nJPMorgan’s motion in part, deny the motion in part, and remand the notice claim. \nI. Background \nA. Factual Background \nThe Court draws the following facts from the Amended Complaint, Dkt. 17 (“Compl.”), \nand accepts them as true for purposes of the instant motion. Case 1:25-cv-11751-BEM     Document 29     Filed 10/22/25     Page 1 of 8 \n2 Plaintiff applied to work at JPMorgan in or around September 2023 and again in or around \nDecember 2024.  Id. ¶ 8.  Neither application included the following notice: \nIt is unlawful in Massachusetts to require or administer a lie detector test as a \ncondition of employment or continued employment.  An employer who violates \nthis law shall be subject to criminal penalties and civil liability. \nId. ¶¶ 1–2, 8; see also Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 149, § 19B(2)(b) (“All applications for employment \nwithin the commonwealth shall contain the following notice which shall be in clearly legible \nprint.”).  Also, as part of one or both applications, JPMorgan requested that Plaintiff take a HireVue \nInterview, which Plaintiff completed.  Compl.  ¶¶ 3, 8. \nHireVue Interviews are an artificial-intelligence-powered job candidate screening tool, \nprovided by HireVue, Inc (“HireVue”).  Id. ¶ 20.  HireVue Interviews work by having job \ncandidates answer a set of interview questions online while being recorded.  Id.1  Applicants may \nbe asked questions related to honesty or integrity ( e.g., “Tell me about a time that you acted with \nintegrity.”).  Id. ¶ 22.  HireVue analyzes interviews using three types of data: language input, \nspeech input, and video input.  Id. ¶ 23.  “Language input” refers to the content of job candidates’ \nspoken responses, which are transcribed and assessed using artificial intelligence against “relevant \ncompetencies.”  Id. ¶¶ 24–27 (brackets omitted).  “Speech input” and “video input” refer to a \ncandidate’s tone, expression, and other verbal-visual cues, which are analyzed using third-party, \nartificial-intelligence technology and converted into an “employability score” or \n“competency-level scoring report” by HireVue.

Procedural Background \nOn April 28, 2025, Plaintiff filed this lawsuit against JPMorgan in the Suffolk County \nSuperior Court for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.  Dkt. 14 at 3–10.  On June 16, 2025, \nJPMorgan removed to this Court pursuant to the Class Action Fairness Act (“CAFA”), 28 U.S.C. \n§ 1332(d)(2), asserting minimal diversity and an amount in controversy exceeding $5 million.  \nSee generally Dkt. 1.  On July 17, 2025, upon an earlier motion to dismiss, later denied as moot, \nPlaintiff amended his complaint.  Dkts. 12–13, 17–18. \nIn his Amended Complaint, Plaintiff alleges three claims on behalf of himself and on behalf \nof a putative class or sub-class of job applicants: (1) for declaratory and injunctive relief, Compl. \n¶¶ 44–47; (2) for violation of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 149, § 19B(2), Compl. ¶¶ 48–  55 (the “Lie \nDetector Claim”); and (3) for violation of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 149, § 19B(2)(b), Compl. ¶¶ 56–  59 \n(the “Notice Claim”). \nOn August 25, 2025, JPMorgan filed the instant motion to dismiss under Federal \nRule 12(b)(6).  Dkt. 21; see also Dkt. 22 (“Memo.”).  On September 8, 2025, Plaintiff opposed.  \nDkt. 23 (“Opp.”).  With leave, JPMorgan filed a reply on September 22, 2025.  Dkt. 28 (“Reply”). \nII. Legal Standard \nCourts analyzing claims under Federal Rule 12(b)(6) must determine whether a plaintiff’s \nfactual allegations—disregarding all “conclusory” statements—“state a claim to relief that is \nplausible on its face.”  Ashcroft v. Iqbal , 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009).  “The inquiry is usually limited \nto the facts alleged in the complaint, incorporated into the complaint, or susceptible to judicial \nnotice,” Whelden v. U.S. Bank Nat’l Ass’n , 494 F. Supp. 3d 68, 73 (D. Mass. 2020) (citing In re Case 1:25-cv-11751-BEM     Document 29     Filed 10/22/25     Page 3 of 8 \n4 Colonial Mortg. Bankers Corp. , 324 F.3d 12, 15 (1st Cir. 2003)), “but the court may also consider \nother documents the authenticity of which is not disputed by the parties, documents central to the \nplaintiff’s claim, and documents sufficiently referred to in the complaint,” id. (citing Watterson v. \nPage, 987 F.2d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 1993)). \nIII. Discussion \nA. The Lie Detector Claim \n“The Lie Detector Statute prohibits employers in Massachusetts from subjecting \nemployees or applicants to lie detector tests as a condition of employment or continued \nemployment.”  Baker v. CVS Health Corp. , 717 F. Supp. 3d 188, 190 (D. Mass. 2024).2  The statute \ndefines a “lie detector test” as: \n[A]ny test utilizing a polygraph or any other device, mechanism, instrument or \nwritten examination, which is operated, or the results of which are used or \ninterpreted by an examiner for the purpose of purporting to assist in or enable the \ndetection of deception, the verification of truthfulness, or the rendering of a \ndiagnostic opinion regarding the honesty of an individual. \nMass. Gen. Laws ch. 149, § 19B(1).  Thus, the statute creates two classes of lie detector tests: a \npolygraph constitutes a lie detector test ipso facto ; alternatively, “any other device, mechanism, \n \n2 In Baker, the defendants “[did] not challenge the sufficiency of the claims that [the defendants had] violated \nthe Lie Detector Statute” by subjecting their applicants to HireVue Interviews.  717 F. Supp. 3d at 189–90.  \nAccordingly, the Court did not have occasion to consider whether the HireVue Interviews, as used by those defendants, \nconstituted lie detector tests under section 19B. Case 1:25-cv-11751-BEM     Document 29     Filed 10/22/25     Page 4 of 8 \n5 instrument or written examination” can qualify as a de facto lie detector test if it used “for the \npurpose of” lie detection.  Id.3 \nPlaintiff alleges that JPMorgan subjected him to a ( de facto) lie detector test by requiring \nhim to take a HireVue Interview as part of his job application.  Compl. ¶¶ 48–55.  However, the \nAmended Complaint contains insufficient allegations to support the inference that his interview \nwas used for the purpose of truth assessment.  Plaintiff’s allegations do no more than establish that \nHireVue Interviews could constitute lie detector tests when used for that purpose.  However, this \nis not enough.  Any “device, mechanism, instrument or written examination” could qualify as a lie \ndetector test if used for that purpose.  To wit, if an employer were to give his applicant an IQ test \non the belief that people with certain IQs are inherently deceitful, wanting to find that out, that \nwould likely violate the Lie Detector Statute, notwithstanding the apparent silliness of that usage.  \nThus, that HireVue holds its product out as having any capability with respect to truth detection \n \n3 See also Auguste v. G4S Secure Sols. (USA), Inc. , No. SUCV14-3311-BLS1 (Mass. Sup. Ct. Apr. 25, 2016) \n(slip op.) (attached to JPMorgan’s Memo. at Dkt. 22-1).  Auguste considered, at summary judgment, an employer’s \nuse of the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-2 (the “MMPI-2”).  Id. at *1.  As explained in the opinion, \nthe MMPI-2 can indicate certain mental illnesses, including some that are correlated with dishonesty.  Id. at *3–4, \n9–10.  The MMPI-2 further relies on “validity scales,” including the “L” (“Lie”) scale, which can indicate a \n“non-credible pattern of responses” resulting from “intentional deception” or from other causes, such as a “high need \nto see oneself as extremely virtuous.”  Id. at *4–5, 10.  The Auguste court found that the MMPI-2’s diagnostic function \ndid not render it a lie detector test under section 19B because it merely indicated mental illness correlated with \ndishonesty, rather than dishonesty itself.  Id. at *9–10.  The court likewise found that the MMPI-2’s “L” scale did not \nturn the MMPI-2 into a lie detector test because that scale measured incredibility beyond just “intentional deception” \nand because the scale’s “purpose” was “to validate the test results,” rather than to “detect[] . . . lies.”  Id. at *10–12 \n(emphasis in original).  Further, the Court highlighted the statute’s “requirement that the test be employed for the \n‘purpose’ of determining deception or rendering an opinion regarding honesty,” noting that it “need not resolve the \nabstract question of whether the MMPI-2 could detect deception so as to possibly constitute a ‘lie detector test’ in \ncertain circumstances” but rather only whether the defendant’s “use of the MMPI-2 rendered it a lie detector test.”  Id. \nat *12 (emphasis in original).  The Court then turned to evidence that the defendant had used plaintiff’s MMPI-2 \nscores to determine his “psychological suitability” for the job, rather than to detect deception.  Id. at *12–13.  Thus, \nthe court concluded that the defendant did not violate section 19B by administering the test.  Id. at *14. \nPlaintiff points out that Auguste was decided at summary judgment and argues that his case, too, “merit[s] \nconsiderable discovery.”  Opp. at 4 n.1.  However, the availability of summary judgment to test the sufficiency of \nevidence does not obviate a plaintiff’s duty to plead his claims sufficiently in the first instance. Case 1:25-cv-11751-BEM     Document 29     Filed 10/22/25     Page 5 of 8 \n6 matters only insofar as it makes plausible that JPMorgan used the HireVue Interview for that \npurpose. \nPlaintiff’s allegations demonstrate the multi-utility of a HireVue Interview, making \nJPMorgan’s mere alleged use inadequate to demonstrate its purpose.  HireVue generates scores \nfrom its interviews based on “precise criteria [that] are often developed in consultation with the \nemployer,” “tailored to meet employers’ highly individualized needs.”  Id. ¶ 33.  Thus, a HireVue \nInterview might plausibly be employed for a wide variety of lawful (or unlawful) purposes, and \nnothing in the allegations suggests that lie detection is chief among its use cases, such to make any \ngiven user’s purpose readily apparent.  See, e.g., id. ¶ 35 (quoting a HireVue patent that includes \n“reliability, honesty, and integrity” on a non-exhaustive list of 23 “potential competencies” that \nthe platform can analyze (emphasis removed)).  JPMorgan’s use of HireVue Interviews is therefore \n“merely ‘consistent with’ unlawful action and is ‘just as much in line with’ lawful action.”  See \nFrith v. Whole Foods Mkt., Inc. , 38 F.4th 263, 270 (1st Cir. 2022) (quoting Ocasio-Hernandez v. \nFortuno-Burset , 640 F.3d 1, 9 (1st Cir. 2011)).  Plaintiff offers no other allegations that would \npermit the inference that JPMorgan has used or uses HireVue Interviews, either generally or as to \nPlaintiff’s application, for the unlawful purpose.4 \nAccordingly, the Court finds Plaintiff’s lie detector allegations “wholly conclusory” and \nso will dismiss the Lie Detector Claim.5  See id. \n \n4 Plaintiff does not argue, and the Court does not find, that JPMorgan’s requiring applicants to certify the \ntruthfulness of their applications converts the HireVue Interview into a lie detector test or else meaningfully suggests \nthat JPMorgan’s use of HireVue Interviews is for that improper purpose.  See Opp. at 7–10; Compl. ¶ 21; note 1, infra.  \nReading the Lie Detector Statute to prohibit employers from asking applicants not to lie on their applications would \nproduce “absurd results.”  See Commonwealth v. Morgan , 476 Mass. 768, 778 (2017) (advising courts to interpret \nstatutes “in a commonsense way”).  \n5 Likewise, the Court will dismiss that part of Plaintiff’s claim for declaratory and injunctive relief based on \nthe Lie Detector Claim allegations.  See Compl. ¶¶ 44–47. Case 1:25-cv-11751-BEM     Document 29     Filed 10/22/25     Page 6 of 8 \n7 B. The Notice Claim \nAs to Plaintiff’s Notice Claim, the parties focus almost exclusively on issues of statutory \ninterpretation—namely, whether the Lie Detector Statute creates a private cause of action for \nenforcement of its notice requirement and whether, if so, Plaintiff qualifies as a “person aggrieved” \nunder that statute for purposes of bringing such a claim.6  See Memo. at 15–25; Opp. at 10–26; \nReply at 9–16. \nBut before reaching these merits issues, the Court “must satisfy itself as to its jurisdiction, \nincluding [Plaintiff’s] Article III standing to sue . . . regardless of whether the litigants have raised \nthe issue of standing.”  See Pagan v. Calderon , 448 F.3d 16, 26 (1st Cir. 2006).  “The standing \ninquiry is . . . claim-specific,” meaning that the Court must determine whether Plaintiff “is entitled \nto have a federal court adjudicate each particular claim that he asserts.”  See id. \nWithout a viable allegation of having been subjected to a lie detector test, Plaintiff lacks \nArticle III standing for his Notice Claim, and so the Court lacks jurisdiction to consider it.  \nPlaintiff’s only purported injury is that he was not apprised of his rights under section 19B.  See \nCompl. ¶¶ 8, 18.7  Since this purely informational injury resulted in no “downstream \nconsequences”— i.e., Plaintiff did not, as a result, take a lie detector test contrary to his rights—it \n \n6 Compare Auguste v. G4S Secure Sols. (USA), Inc. , No. SUCV14-3311-BLS1, at *13–15 (Mass. Sup. Ct. \nApr. 25, 2016) (slip op.) (attached to JPMorgan’s Memo. at Dkt. 22-1) (concluding that there was no private cause of \naction to enforce the notice requirement and that the plaintiff, who had not shown that he was subject to a lie detector \ntest, was not a “person aggrieved” under the statute), with Baker , 717 F. Supp. 3d at 192–93 (concluding that there \nwas a private cause of action to enforce the notice requirement). \n7 Plaintiff also states that, “[h]ad [he] been made aware by Defendant that the HireVue Interview was a lie \ndetector test, he would not have completed the HireVue Interview.”  Compl. ¶ 8.  But the statutory notice does not \ninclude the definition of a lie detector test.  See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 149, § 19B(2)(b).  As such, it is not obvious why \nnotice would have helped Plaintiff evaluate whether the HireVue Interview was being used as a lie detector test. Case 1:25-cv-11751-BEM     Document 29     Filed 10/22/25     Page 7 of 8 \n8 cannot provide a basis for standing.8  See TransUnion LLC v. Ramirez , 594 U.S. 413, 442 (2021) \n(“An ‘asserted informational injury that causes no adverse effects cannot satisfy \nArticle III.’” (quoting Trichell v. Midland Credit Mgmt., Inc. , 964 F.3d 990, 1004 (11th Cir. \n2020))). \nBecause the Court finds a lack of Article III standing, a jurisdictional defect, “the proper \ncourse is remand.”  Maine Ass’n of Interdependent Neighborhoods v. Comm’r, Me. Dep’t of Hum. \nServs., 876 F.2d 1051, 1054 (1st Cir. 1989) (quoting Langford v. Gates , 610 F. Supp. 120, 122–23 \n(C.D. Cal. 1985)).9  Accordingly, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1447(c), the Court will remand the \nNotice Claim.10 \nIV. Conclusion \nFor the foregoing reasons, JPMorgan’s motion to dismiss is GRANTED in part and \nDENIED in part.  This action is hereby remanded to the Suffolk County Superior Court. \nSo Ordered.  \n \n /s/ Brian E. Murphy    \n Brian E. Murphy \nDated:  October 22, 2025 Judge, United States District Court \n \n8 In Baker, the court concluded that the plaintiff had stated a “concrete informational injury” because, “as a \ndownstream consequence of not receiving notice, he participated in a HireVue Interview.”  717 F. Supp. at 192.  \nHowever, in Baker, the defendants did not challenge the sufficiency of the plaintiff’s lie detector allegations.  Id. at \n190.  Thus, the court could take for granted that the HireVue Interview was a lie detector test and thus that its \nimposition was an injury “of the kind the statute was designed to protect.”  Id. at 192.  By contrast, in this case, \nJPMorgan has successfully shown that inference to be unreasonable.  Thus, Plaintiff’s position is akin to the \nhypothetical case, distinguished by the Baker court, of an “[a]pplicant[] who never took” any lie detector test, whom \nthe Baker court recognized “may well be in a different boat on the standing question.”  Id. at 192 n.2. \n9 As Plaintiff points out, Massachusetts courts, like state courts in general, are not subject to Article III \nlimitations.  See, e.g., Kenn v. Eascare, LLC , 103 Mass. App. Ct. 643, 649 (2024) (holding that an injury deemed \ninsufficiently concrete under Article III was nonetheless adequate for the claim to proceed in state court under \nMassachusetts standing principles). \n10 Likewise, the Court will remand that part of Plaintiff’s claim for declaratory and injunctive relief based on \nthe Notice Claim allegations.

    "summary": "1. **Summary:** In the case of Shared Partnership v. Meta Platforms, Inc., the United States District Court for the Northern District of California addressed discovery disputes related to the production of documents. The Plaintiff requested that Meta be compelled to complete document production by a certain date, especially concerning Meta's use of artificial intelligence (AI) to reject advertisements, including those related to the Plaintiff. The court denied the Plaintiff's request, finding it unjustified and premature, emphasizing that broad discovery into AI use was not proportionately relevant to the Plaintiff's claims in the current procedural context.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue:** The key legal issue revolved around whether Meta Platforms, Inc., should be compelled to complete its document production by a specific deadline, particularly concerning documents related to its use of AI in ad rejection.\n\n3. **Court's Holding:** The court denied the Plaintiff's request to force Meta to complete its document production by the specified deadline. Furthermore, it rejected the Plaintiff's attempt to establish broad discovery into Meta's use of AI to reject advertisements not related to the Plaintiff, due to lack of relevance and proportionality.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation:** Imagine you're arguing with someone to show you all their private documents right away, especially about how they use a robot helper to decide things. The judge said, “Not so fast!” They noted that it's not fair to ask for everything because it's not all related to what you're trying to prove, and it's way too much to ask for all at once. So, the judge said, “Let's do this step-by-step and only look at what really matters to the case.”",

Nos. 47, 49  \n \n \n Now pending before the court are a pair of discovery dispute letter briefs (dkts. 47, 49) \nthat, generally speaking, represent Plaintiff’s request  to compel the production of certain \ndiscovery. It app ears that the two letters are substantially the same, wit h the exception that the first \nletter appears to have been rushed to court  before Defendant could articulate its position as to one \nof the issues raised by Plaintiff ( see dkt. 47 at 3 -4; see also  dkt. 49 at 1, 4 -5). Defendant submits \nthat Plaintiff has involved the  court prematurely, that the dispute is not quite ripe for a motion to \ncompel, and that the parties should continue to engage one another in the discovery process. See \nLtr. Br. (dkt. 49) at 2. For the reasons stated below, the court wholeheartedly agrees.  \n Plaintiff has presented two issues . In the first, Plaintiff complains of the timing of \nDefendant’s document production. See id . at 1 -2. In this regard, Plaintiff subm its that it tendered  a \nset of interrogatories and requests for production in late October of 2022, and that Defendant’s \nresponses – which were served in mid -December of 2022, did not contain substantive information \nbut were rather limited to objections (pr esumably as to some requests) and statements to the effect \nthat responsive documents and information would be produced on a rolling basis (again, \npresumably as to certain other  requests). Id. at 1. Based only on the argument that Plaintiff should Case 3:22-cv-02366-RS     Document 50     Filed 03/14/23     Page 1 of 6 \n2 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  not be fo rced to agree to an  speculative  extension of the fact discovery deadline ( currently set for \nSeptember 21, 2023) and risk pushing back an already -scheduled  trial date of April 2024, Plaintiff \nsubmits that Defendant should now be forced “to complete its enti re document production by \nApril 7, 2023” because it “has had more than enough time – and has more than enough resources – \nto accomplish this.” Id. at 2.   \n Defendant respond s to the effect that Plaintiff’s 41  document requests  are relatively broad \nand that they seek , among other things , all documents relating to Plaintiff , all documents regarding \nPlaintiff ’s rejected advertisements  on Defendant’s platform , and all documents concerning \nDefendant ’s use of artificial intelligence to reject any and all advertisements  in general (that is, not \nsimply information limited to the rejection of Plaintiff’s own advertisements – the subject of this \naction) . Id. at 2. Nevertheless, Defendant submits that through its December responses, it agr eed to \nsearch for and  produce several categories of information  including documents relating to \nPlaintiff ’s rejected advertisements, notifications regarding those advertisements, and \ncommunications between the Parties . Id.  Following discussions  regarding the scope, relevance, \nand proportionality of the  requested  discovery, Defendant states that it  has agreed to produce a \nnarrowed set of documents for the majority of Plaintiff’s requests , and that it is working  diligently \nto gather responsive, non -privileged documents  for production. Id. at 2 -3.  \nHowever, Defendant contends that there are three  remining hurdles. As to the first, \nDefendant states that it “cannot produce any documents until a stipulated protective order is \nentered between the parties and Court, and the parties are currently negotiating the substance of \nthe protective order so that [Defendant]  can begin producing documents.” Id. at 3. The court finds \nthat this hurdle is easy to surmount. The Parties are herewith ORDERED  to promptly meet and \nconfer in a good faith effort to iron out their differences as to their respective views regarding  the \nsubstance of the protective order necessary such that Defendant can begin producing documents . \nThe court recommends, but does not require, using this district’s model protective order at least as \na starting point . In the event that the Parties cannot arrive at a stipulated resolution, the Parties are \nFURTHER ORDERED  to clearly and concisely present what dispute s remain in this regard \nthrough a jointly -filed letter brief conforming to the requirements set forth in ¶ 4 of the Case 3:22-cv-02366-RS     Document 50     Filed 03/14/23     Page 2 of 6 \n3 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  undersigned’s general standi ng order.1 \nAs to the second hurdle, Defendant submits that it  “continues to work diligently to search \nfor documents responsive to the majority of [the]  requests it has agreed to produce ” and that it \n“has already identified tens of thousands of potentially  responsive documents to [Plaintiff’s]  \nrejected advertisements and notifications regarding those rejected advertisements. ” Id. at 3. \nDefendant explains that the responsive discovery is voluminous and time -consuming to gather and \nproduce due to the fact tha t Plaintiff’s advertising relationship on Defendant’s platform “ goes back \nover ten years, and the volume of data is substantial ,” as well as the fact that “ the process to search \nfor, review, and pull those documents, which began months ago, is manual  — [and] there are thus \nmultiple, time -consuming steps [Defendant]  must undertake before it can produce information \nregarding [Plaintiff’s]  disapproved advertisements, of which there were many. ” Id. Defendant then \nadds that this is why it has focused on only pot entially responsive documents – that is, those \nrelated to Plaintiff’s rejected advertisements – rather than documents related to Defendant’s more \n“general purported use of artificial intelligence. ” Id. At bottom, Defendant contends that “[t] hese \ndocuments are probative of whether [Plaintiff’s]  ads were rejected and what notice [Plaintiff]  \nreceived regarding those ads, which is directly relevant to [the]  fraud -based claims. ” Id. The court \nfinds that the assertion of this hurdle is closely intertwined with the second issue raised by \nPlaintiff’s request to compel; accordingly, the court will address it below.  \nAs to the third hurdle, Defendant submits that it  has not yet provided a  specific  date by \nwhich  it will complete production of all resp onsive, non -privileged documents because it \n“continues to search for responsive documents, the extent of those documents, and  [because it is \ncurrently engaged in]  the labor -intensive process of pulling those potentially responsive \ndocuments. ” Id. In short,  Defendant submits that it “ has been working for months to gather and \nreview documents for production once the protective order is entered ,” and that it  “intends on \nproducing documents on a rolling basis shortly thereafter. ” Id.  \nIn essence, this dispute b oils down to Plaintiff’s desire to rush Defendant through the \n \n1 See https://www.cand.uscourts.gov/wp -content/uploads/judges/illman -rmi/RMI -Standing -Order -\nRevised9 -16-22.pdf  Case 3:22-cv-02366-RS     Document 50     Filed 03/14/23     Page 3 of 6 \n4 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  discovery process based only on a thin justification that Defendant “has had more than enough \ntime – and has more than enough resources – to accomplish this.” Id. at 2. The court finds this \nnotion to be unpersuasive. The alleged magnitude of Defendant’s resources, and the passage of a \nfew months of time does not justify arbitrarily setting a production deadline of April 7, 2023, as \nPlaintiff suggests. Once the Parties’ dispute about the terms of the forthcoming protective order \n(either by stipulation or by court order) are resolved, the court sees no  reason – and Plaintiff has \ncertainly  not suggested one – that Defendant’s production should not proceed on the rolling basis \nit has suggested and jus tified. Accordingly, Plaintiff’s request to force Defendant to complete its \nproduction by April 7, 2023, is DENIED . \nAs to the second issue, Plaintiff seeks an order “ making clear that [Defendant’s]  use of \nartificial intelligence to reject ads —including wha t it did and did not know about the ability of \nartificial intelligence to provide explanations for ad rejections —is both relevant and discoverable. ” \nId. Plaintiff then adds that “[t] his dispute is implicated by the following discovery requests: a) \nInterrog atories 2 -4 and b) RFP Nos. 15 -20; 25 -34; and 38 -41.” Id. at 4. Plaintiff has not include d \nthose discovery requests as attachments or exhibits to its letter brief. However, this omission is \nunimportant for two reasons.  \nFirst, Plaintiff has failed to convi nce the undersigned as to the probative value of this \noverwhelmingly broad request. Plaintiff points to the fact that its fraud claim survived dismissal \nwhen the presiding judge found that because Plaintiff had asserted that Defendant’s advertising \npolicie s contained a fraudulent statement to the effect that advertising  partners would be provided \nwith sufficient details to bring their rejected ads into conformity with Defendant’s  policies , it was \ntherefore plausible that a reasonable consumer would concur with Plaintiff ’s interpretation of the \npolicies, notwithstanding Defendant’s contrary interpretation.  Id. In short, in the context of \ndeciding a motion to dismiss, the presiding judge found that it was plau sible  that Defendant knew \nor should have known that it could not comply with this expectation due to its averred reliance on \nartificial intelligence.  Id. However, simply because an allegation has been found  to be sufficiently \nplausible such that  its associ ated claim  survives dismissal , it does not necessarily follow that \ndiscovery thereunder will automatically be found to be  relevant to that claim  at the discovery Case 3:22-cv-02366-RS     Document 50     Filed 03/14/23     Page 4 of 6 \n5 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  phase of a case . See e.g.,  Elgindy v. AGA Serv. Co. , No. 20 -cv-06304 -JST (RMI), 2021 U.S. Dist . \nLEXIS 211772, at *12 -13 (N.D. Cal. Nov. 2, 2021) ( “. . . the scope of Plaintiffs ’ 4 RFPs are more \ngeared to proving or disproving Plaintiffs ’ [own] speculative and editorial musings rather than \nthe[] actual claims. [R]elevance must be tethered to a claim , not simply to an allegation as seems \nto be implied by Plaintiffs ’ suggestion . . . ”). In this regard, the court finds – based on Plaintiff’s \npresentation (limited to the plausibility finding at the motion to dismiss stage) – that generalized \ninformation about Defendant’s suggested use of artificial intelligence to reject advertisements \nother than  Plaintiff’s  own advertisements  would have very little – if any – probative value to \nPlaintiff’s claims.  \nSecond, assuming arguendo  that the relevance of this requ est had been established, \nPlaintiff has expended no effort in justifying the proportionality of such a broad request , while \nDefendant has made a convincing case about its disproportionality . See id . at 3 -4, 5-6. It should be \nnoted  here that in order to suc ceed on a motion to compel, a moving party bears the burden of not \nonly demonstrating relevance, but also  demonstrating  that it has satisfied proportionality and other \nrequirements of Rule 26. See e.g.,  Rodriguez v. Barrita, Inc. , No. 09 -04057 RS  (PSG), 2011 U.S. \nDist. LEXIS 134079, at *4 (N.D. Cal. Nov. 21, 2011). In light of this, courts are required to limit \ndiscovery if its burden or expense outweighs its likely benefit; this is “the essence of \nproportionality, ” a frequently ignored or overlooked dis covery principle. See e.g. , Hegarty v. \nTransamerica Life Ins. Co. , No. 19 -cv-06006 -MMC (RMI), 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 203386, at *5 \n(N.D. Cal. Oct. 21, 2021) ; see also Williams v. Condensed Curriculum Int ’l, No. 20 -cv-05292 -\nYGR (RMI), 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2 11782, at *8 -9 (N.D. Cal. Nov. 2, 2021) ; see also  Mediatek, \nInc. v. Freescale Semiconductor, Inc. , No. 11 -5341 YGR (JSC), 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 122911, \nat *18 -19 (N.D. Cal. Aug. 28, 2013) ( “[U]nder Rule 26 ’s proportionality analysis, the Court must \nweigh t he burden versus the benefit of the discovery sought . . . [and] strike a balance between \nensuring that parties have access to relevant information regarding their claims and defenses, and \nthe burden on the producing party of providing the discovery sought .”). \nAs stated by Defendant, despite the fact that Plaintiff’s artificial intelligence theory was \nfound plausible at the motion to dismiss stage, by no means does it logically follow (as Plaintiff’s Case 3:22-cv-02366-RS     Document 50     Filed 03/14/23     Page 5 of 6 \n6 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  arguments imply) that broad -based and wholesale discovery  into all aspects of Defendant’s \npurported use of artificial intelligence to reject the advertisements of all of its many customers \nwould be proportional to the needs of Plaintiff’s case which involves a drastically smaller subset \nof events. Accordingly, P laintiff’s request for a finding as to the general discoverability of \nDefendant’s use of artificial intelligence to reject advertisements other than its own is DENIED .  \nIn closing, t he court also feels compelled to admonish the Parties to work together mor e \nefficiently  going forward  to resolve their discovery disputes with minimal need for court \nintervention.  “[T]this court is not a clearinghouse for resolving insignificant, unripe, or moot \ndiscovery disputes. Instead, counsel should be mindful that discove ry is the responsibility of the \nparties and turning to the court to resolve a discovery dispute should only be used as a last resort. ” \nMiranda Dairy v.

Attorneys practicing in this court are \nexpected to seek court involvement in discovery disputes only  as a last resort, and only when the \ndispute implicates truly significant interests that counsel cannot resolve through reasonable \ncooperation during the meet -and-confer process.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: The court dismissed the class action lawsuit filed by LGBTQ+ content creators against Google and YouTube, alleging discriminatory practices in content moderation, including demonetization and restriction of videos. The case referenced Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act as a defense, which protects online platforms from liability for content moderation decisions. The plaintiffs were given limited leave to amend one specific claim related to the breach of implied good faith, emphasizing that earlier claims could not be pursued further due to Section 230's protections.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether YouTube's content moderation practices, allegedly biased against LGBTQ+ creators, violated laws such as the Unruh Act and whether such claims are barred by Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court granted the motion to dismiss most claims, citing Section 230 as a shield against such lawsuits since it provides immunity for content moderation practices. The plaintiffs were allowed to amend their claim regarding the breach of implied good faith and fair dealing.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine you run a gigantic online video library and use a robot that decides if a video should be shown to everyone or just a few people. Some folks say your robot is unfairly choosing their videos to hide because of what's in them. They took you to court, but the judge said you've got special protection that says you can't get in trouble just for how your robot picks videos. However, the judge allowed one tiny part of their complaint to maybe change and come back to court.",

R. Civ. P. 73 ; Dkt. Nos. 5, 16, 17 . \n Case 5:19-cv-04749-VKD     Document 107     Filed 09/30/22     Page 1 of 35 \n2 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  YouTube .  Plaintiffs claim that  despite YouTube’s purported viewpoint neutrality, defendants have \ndiscriminated against them  based on their sexual or gender orientation, identity, and/or viewpoints \nby censoring , demonetizing, or otherwise interfering with certain videos that plaintiffs uploaded to \nYouTube.   Dkt. No. 67 ¶ 1; see also id . ¶¶ 35-44.2 \nPlaintiffs filed their original complaint on August 13, 2019 (Dkt. No. 1) and an amended \ncomplaint on November 12, 2019 (Dkt. No. 7).  \nOn January 6, 2020, the Court granted plaintiffs’ unoppose d motion for leave to file a second \namended complaint (“SAC”).  Dkt. No. 23.   The SAC asserted claims for (1) violation of plaintiffs’ \nFirst Amendment rights under 42 U.S.C. § 1983; (2) violation of Article I, section 2 of the California \nConstitution; (3)  violation of the Unruh Act, California Civil Code § § 51, et seq .; (4) unfair \ncompetition under California Business and Professions Code §§ 17200, et seq .; (5) breach of the \nimplied covenant of good faith and fair dealing; and (6) false advertising and fals e association in \nviolation of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1125, et seq .  In addition, plaintiffs sought  a declaration that \nSection 230 of the Communications Decency Act (“CDA”), 47 U.S.C. § 230(c), on which plaintiffs \nexpect ed defendants to rely as an affi rmative defense, is unconstitutional.  Plaintiffs also separately \nsought  a declaration that defendants violated the rights and obligations pled as the bases for all of  \nplaintiffs ’ other claims.  Dkt. No. 20.  \nDefendants moved to dismiss all of the claims in  the SAC  pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6)  for failure \nto state a claim and as barred by Section 230 of the CDA.  Dkt. No. 25.  On January 6, 2021, the Court \ngranted defendants’ motion to dismiss, with limited leave to amend.   Dkt. No. 65.   The Court \ndismissed pla intiffs’ First Amendment claim without leave to amend, concluding that defendants are \nnot state actors, YouTube is not a public forum, and that the availability of protections under CDA \nSection 230 does not amount  to government endorsement of defendants’ a lleged discrimination.  Id. at \n7-12.  Plaintiffs’ Lanham Act claim for alleged false advertising3 was dismissed with leave to amend.  \n \n2 The Court assumes the parties’ familiarity with the general background facts as described in its \nprior order  on defendants’ motion to dismiss plaintiffs’ second amended complaint  (Dkt. No. 65 at \n2-6) and does not repeat those facts i n this order . \n \n3 Plaintiffs withdrew their Lanham Act claim to the extent it was based on false association.  They \nalso appeared to abandon allegations that defendants violate the Lanham Act by describing Case 5:19-cv-04749-VKD     Document 107     Filed 09/30/22     Page 2 of 35 \n3 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  The Court concluded  that plaintiffs’  theory —i.e., that by making plaintiffs’ videos inaccessible \nthrough application of Restricted Mode, defendants falsely implied that the videos contain shocking or \ninappropriate content —is squarely foreclosed by Prager Univ. v. Google LLC  (“Prager III ”), 951 F.3d \n991 (9th Cir. 2020) .  Id. at 12 -14.  Having dismissed the only claims giving rise to federal jurisdiction, \nand n oting that the SAC did not expressly invoke federal jurisdiction under the Class Action Fairness \nAct (“CAFA”), 28 U.S.C. § 1332(d), the Court declined to exercise jurisdiction over plaintiffs’ state \nlaw claims  and dismissed those state claims without prejudice.  Id. at 16.   The Court dismissed \nplaintiffs’ claim for declaratory relief regarding CDA Section 230 because declarat ory relief is a \nremedy, not an independent cause of action; the claim was based on plaintiffs’ First Amendment \nclaim, which was dismissed; and because the Declaratory Judgment Act cannot be used to anticipate \nan affirmative defense.  Id. at 17 -18.  Plainti ffs’ omnibus claim for declaratory relief was dismissed as \nimproper , and because plaintiffs failed to state any federal claim over which the Court could exercise \njurisdiction , and because the Court declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over plaint iffs’ state \nlaw claims.  Id. at 18 -19. \nPlaintiffs were given leave to amend their Lanham Act false advertising claim, and to reassert \ntheir state law claims for relief.  They  were also given leave to attempt to plead CAFA jurisdiction.  Id. \nat 16, 19.  \nPlaintiffs’ operative  third amended class action complaint (“TAC”)  asserts a Lanham Act \nclaim  (claim 6) , as well as several state law claims for violation of Article I, section 2  of the California \nConstitution  (claim 2) ; violation of the Unruh Act  (claim 3) ; unfair competition under California \nBusiness and Professions Code § 17200, et seq . (claim 4) ; and breach of the implied covenant of good \nfaith and fair dealing  (claim 5) .  Additionally, p laintiffs again seek a declaration that  CDA  Section \n230, which defendants have raised as a defense , is unconstitutional  (claim 1) .  Plaintiffs assert  that \nfederal question jurisdiction exists by virtue of the Lanham Act claim .  They also conten d that the ir \ndeclaratory relief claim  provides an  additional  independ ent basis for federal question jurisdiction under \n28 U.S.C. § 1331.  The TAC further asserts that federal jurisdiction  also exists under CAFA , 28 U.S.C. \n \nYouTube as a viewpoint -neutral community that values freedom of expression .  See Dkt. No. 65 at \n12-13; see also  Dkt. No. 25 at 17 -18; Dkt. No. 36 at 24 -27; Dkt. No. 62 at 29:9 -13.

Plaintiffs assert that the Court has supplemental jurisdiction over their state law claims, 28 \nU.S.C. § 1367.   Dkt. No. 67 ¶¶ 61-62. \nDefendants move pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) to dismiss all claims in the TAC without \nfurther leave to amend , arguing that p laintiffs still fail to assert facts supporting a cognizable claim \nfor false advertising under the Lanham Act.  Defendants further contend that the TAC fails to state \nsufficient facts to support any of plaintiffs’ state law claims for relief, and that all such claims are \nbarred by CDA Section 230.  \nII. LEGAL STANDARD  \n“A motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) for failure to state a \nclaim upon which relief can be granted ‘tests the legal sufficiency of a claim.’”  Conservation \nForce v. Sa lazar , 646 F.3d 1240, 1241 -42 (9th Cir. 2011) (quoting Navarro v. Block , 250 F.3d \n729, 732 (9th Cir. 2001)).  When determining whether a claim has been stated, the Court accepts \nas true all well -pled factual allegations and construes them in the light most favorable to the \nplaintiff.  Reese v. BP Exploration (Alaska) Inc. , 643 F.3d 681, 690 (9th Cir. 2011).  While a \ncomplaint need not contain detailed factual allegations, it “must contain sufficient factual matter, \naccepted as true, to ‘state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.’”  Ashcroft v. Iqbal , 556 \nU.S. 662, 678 (2009) (quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly , 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007)).  A claim is \nfacially plausible when it “ pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable \ninference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.”  Id. \nThe Court is not  required to “ ‘assume the truth of legal conclusions merely because they \nare cast in the form of  factual allegations .’”  Prager  Univ. v. Google LLC (“Prager  I”), No. 1 7-\nCV-06064 -LHK , 2018 WL 1471939 , at * 3 (N.D. Cal. Mar. 26, 2018)  (quoting  Fayer v. Vaughn , \n649 F.3d 1061, 1064 (9th Cir. 2011)  (per curiam) ).  Nor does the Court accept allegations that \ncontradict  documents attached to the complaint or incorporated by reference, Gonzalez v. Planned  \nParenthood of L.A. , 759 F.3d 1112, 1115 (9th C ir. 2014) , or that rest on “ allegations that are \nmerely conclusory,  unwarranted deductions of fact,  or unreasonable inferences ,” In re Gilead Scis. \nSec. Litig ., 536 F.3d  1049, 1055 (9th Cir. 2008) . \nA court generally may not consider any material beyond the pleadings when ruling on a Case 5:19-cv-04749-VKD     Document 107     Filed 09/30/22     Page 4 of 35 \n5 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  Rule 12(b)(6) motion.  If matters outside the pleadings are considered, “the motion must be treated \nas one for summary judgment under Rule 56.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(d).  H owever, documents \nappended to the complaint, incorporated by reference in the complaint, or which properly are the \nsubject of judicial notice may be considered along with the complaint when deciding a Rule \n12(b)(6) motion.  Khoja v. Orexigen Therapeutics , 899 F.3d 988, 998 (9th Cir. 2018); see also Hal \nRoach Studios, Inc. v. Richard Feiner & Co., Inc. , 896 F.2d 1542, 1555 n.19 (9th Cir. 1990).   \nLikewise, a court may consider matters that are “capable of accurate and ready determination by \nresort to sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned.”  Roca v. Wells Fargo Bank, \nN.A., No. 15 -cv-02147 -KAW, 2016 WL 368153, at *3 (N.D. Cal. Feb. 1, 2016) (quoting Fed. R. \nEvid. 201(b)).  \nIII. DISCUSSION  \nA. Federal Jurisdiction  \nThe Court first examines the claims plaint iffs assert in support of federal jurisdiction .  As \ndiscussed above, the TAC alleges federal question jurisdiction, 28 U.S.C. § 1331, based on \nplaintiffs’ Lanham Act claim and on their claim for declaratory judgment .  The TAC also alleges \nCAFA jurisdiction  under 28 U.S.C. § 1332(d).  \n1. Lanham Act Claim  \nThe Court previously dismissed plaintiffs’ Lanham Act false advertising claim4 as \nforeclosed by Prager III , in which  the Ninth Circuit  held that statements about videos being \nunavailable in Restricted Mode are simply accurate explanations of the application of defendants’ \ncontent review and monitoring procedures , and are not actionable as commercial advertising or \npromotion.  See P rager III, 951 F.3d at 999-1000; see also  Dkt. No. 65 at 12 -14.  This Court \nfurther noted that plaintiffs “ do not explain how the purported competition between plaintiffs and \ndefendants transforms defendants’ explanatory statements into commercial advertising an d \n \n4 Although the TAC appears to re assert  allegations that defendants violate the Lanham Act \nthrough false association and defendants’ alleged “promotion of their service as a neutral public \nforum” ( see, e.g., Dkt. No. 67 ¶¶ 344, 350, 351, 355), as discussed above, plaintiffs were given \nleave to amend their Lanham Act claim only to the extent it was based on false advertising.  See \nDkt. No. 65 at 19.  Case 5:19-cv-04749-VKD     Document 107     Filed 09/30/22     Page 5 of 35 \n6 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  promotion or into specific representations of fact about particular videos. ”  Dkt. No. 65 at 14 . \nIn the TAC, p laintiffs’ false advertising claim  (asserted by plaintiffs on ly on  their own behalf ) \ncontinues to rest on the theory that b y making their videos  inaccessible through the application of \nRestricted Mode, YouTube falsely implies that the videos contain shocking or inappropriate content, \nsuch as “nudity, vulgarity, violence, hate,  shocking or sexually explicit material .”  See Dkt. No. 67 \n¶¶ 91-106; 34 1-357.  Plaintiffs further allege that defendants  “compete directly ” with plaintiffs  “in \nthe marketing of online video streaming ” and misapply Restricted Mode to plaintiffs’ videos in \norder to “ falsely  degrade and stigmatize ” plaintiffs’ videos “ while simultaneously enhancing the \nimage and goodwill  of [defendants’]  own content, and that of their partners and/or sponsored \ncreators .”  Id. ¶¶ 343, 354.  Plaintiffs claim that they have been injured  in the form of fewer \nsubscribers  and viewers , diverte d viewership, fewer notifications to subscribers regarding new \nvideo content, fewer or no recommendations  of their videos  by defendants to viewers, decreased \nad revenue , a reduction in advertisers willing to purchase advertisements shown on plaintiffs’ \nvideos,  and “damage to [plaintiffs’] respective brands, reputations and goodwill[.]”  Id. ¶ 356. \nPlaintiffs emphasize that the alleged false implications of Restricted Mode are communicated \nnot only to viewers, but also to advertisers, and are intended to sway viewers and advertisers to watch \ndefendants’ videos, rather than plaintiff’s videos.  See Dkt. No.  85 at 5.  However, nothing in the TAC, \nincluding in the particular paragraphs cited by plaintiffs ( see Dkt. No. 67 ¶¶ 3-4, 7, 13, 17, 22 -24, \n26.b., 80, 82 -89, 95 .b., 96-112, 133, 138 .c., 192 -93, 197, 201, 211, 232, 234, 238 -39, 243 -44, 246, \n257, 259, 262, 268, 341 -357) chang es the character of the challenged statements that videos are \n“unavailable” or “restricted” in Restricted Mode , which the Ninth Circuit has held are not actionable \nunder the Lanham Act.

Plaintiffs’ Lan ham Act false advertising \nclaim is dismissed without leave to amend.  \n2. Claim for Declaratory Judgment  \nPlaintiffs argue that their claim for a declaratory judgment  provides an independent basis \nfor federal jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1331.5  Citing Gunn v. Minton , 568 U.S. 251 (2013) and \nAtlantic  Richfield Co. v. Christian , 140 S. Ct. 1335 (2020), plainti ffs contend  that their \nconstitutional challenge to CDA Section 230, which has been raised by defendants as a defense  in \ntheir prior and present motions to dismiss , brings plaintiffs’  claim for declaratory judgment within \na “‘special and exceptional’ circumstance from which federal jurisdiction under § 1331 arises .”  \nDkt. No. 67 ¶ 54; see also id.  ¶¶ 283, 284 . \nFederal courts have original , or federal question,  jurisdiction over civil actions “arising \nunder the Consti tution, laws, or treaties of the United States.”  28 U.S.C. § 1331.  “‘[A] case can \n‘arise under’ federal law in two ways.’”  Negrete v. City of Oakland , 46 F.4th  811, 816  (9th Cir.  \n2022) (quoting Gunn , 568 U.S. at 257).  “First and ‘[m]ost directly, a cas e arises under federal law \nwhen federal law creates the cause of action asserted.’”  Id. at 816 -17 (quoting Gunn , 568 U.S. at \n257).  “Second, under the substantial federal question branch, ‘even where a claim finds its origins \nin state rather than federal law,’ the Supreme Court has ‘identified a ‘special and small category’ \n \n5 Defendants move to strike the declaratory judgment claim  on the ground that plaintiffs were not \nclearly given leave to reassert or amend that claim .  See Dkt. No. 77 at 1 , 9 n.9.  To the extent that \nthe Court’s order on defendants’ pr ior motion to dismiss may be ambiguous as to whether \nplaintiffs were permitted to reassert or amend this claim, defendants’ motion to strike is denied.  Case 5:19-cv-04749-VKD     Document 107     Filed 09/30/22     Page 7 of 35 \n8 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  of cases in which arising under jurisdiction still lies.’”  Id. at 817 (quoting Gunn , 568 U.S. at 258).  \n“Specifically, ‘federal jurisdiction over a state law claim will lie if a federal issue is: \n(1) necessarily raised, (2) actually disputed, (3) substantial, and (4) capable of resolution in federal \ncourt without disrupting the federal -state balance approved by Congress.’”  Id. (quoting Gunn , 568 \nU.S. at 258).  \nPlaintiffs do not co ntend that federal law creates their claim for declaratory relief.  Indeed, \nalthough the TAC correctly anticipates  defendants’ CDA Section 230 defense, “[f] ederal \njurisdiction cannot be predicated on an actual or anticipated defense ,” and “[i] t is not enou gh that \nthe plaintiff alleges some anticipated defense to his cause of action and asserts that the defense is \ninvalidated by some provision of [federal law].”   Vaden v. Discover Bank , 556 U.S. 49, 60 (2009) \n(internal quotations and citation omitted) ; see Atl. Richfield Co. , 140 S. Ct. at 1350 n.4 ( reiterating \nthat “‘[f]ederal jurisdiction cannot be predicated on an actual or anticipated defense.’”) (quoting \nVaden , 556 U.S. at 60); Negrete , 46 F.4th  at 817  (stating that federal question jurisdiction cannot \nbe based on “a federal defense, including the defense of pre -emption, even if the defense is \nanticipated in the plaintiff ’s complaint, and even if both parties concede that the federal defense is \nthe only question truly at issue.  And that remains true even  if, as here, the state -law complaint \nexplicitly seeks declaratory relief with respect to the anticipated federal defense.”) (internal \nquotations and citations omitted) . \nNor have plaintiffs demonstrated that their declaratory judgment  claim satisfies the f our \nrequirements for jurisdiction based on a substantial federal question.  Specifically, plaintiffs have \nnot shown that defendants’ invocation of CDA Section 230 as a defense is “necessarily raised” in \nthe sense contemplated by Gunn .  In Gunn , an element of the plaintiff’s state law claim for \nmalpractice necessarily required resolution of a federal patent law issue.  See Gu nn, 568 U.S. at \n259.  In the present case, defendants opted to assert CDA Section 230 as a defense, which cannot \nbe the basis for federal jurisdiction  for the reasons discussed above.  Even assuming that the CDA \n230 defense implicates issues of federal law , “a federal issue raised in anticipation of a defense is \nnot sufficient to establish federal question jurisdiction.”  Negrete , 46 F.4th  at 819.  Moreover, \n“[f]or  federal question jurisdiction to extend to a declaratory judgment action, the ‘claim itself Case 5:19-cv-04749-VKD     Document 107     Filed 09/30/22     Page 8 of 35 \n9 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  must present a federal question unaided by anything alleged in anticipation of avoidance of \ndefenses which it is thought the defendant may interpose.’”  Id. at 820 (quoting Skelly Oil Co. , 339 \nU.S. at 671)).   Plaintiffs have not, and cannot, make such a sho wing here.  \nPlaintiffs misplace their reliance on  United States v. Texas , 566 F.  Supp.  3d 605 ( W.D. \nTex. 2021) , which concerned the federal government’s  authority under In re Debs , 158 U.S. 564 \n(1895) to pursue a lawsuit to enjoin a state law as unconstitutional.  Texas  does not inform the \nCourt’s analysis of “arising under” jurisdiction in this  action, which concerns the propriety of a \nclaim for declaratory judgment by private cit izens against private entities based on a federal \ndefense.   As previously noted by the Court, “u sing the Declaratory Judgment Act to anticipate an \naffirmative defense is not ordinarily proper, and numerous courts have refused to grant declaratory \nrelief to  a party who has come to court only to assert an anticipatory defense.”  Veoh Networks, \nInc. v. UMG Recordings, Inc ., 522 F. Supp. 2d 1265, 1271 (S.D. Cal. 2007);  see also  Dkt. No. 65 \nat 18.  \nPlaintiffs have not established that their declaratory judgment c laim regarding the \nconstitutionality of CDA Section 230 provides an independent basis for the Court’s federal \nquestion jurisdiction.   This claim is dismissed without leave to amend.  \n3. CAFA Jurisdiction  \nThe TAC’s third  and final  asserted basis for federal jur isdiction is CAFA , 28 U.S.C. \n§ 1332(d) .  CAFA  was designed to permit a defendant to remove certain class or mass actions to \nfederal court .  It gives federal courts original jurisdiction over class actions where there are at least \n100 class members, at leas t one plaintiff is diverse in citizenship from any defendant, and the \namount in controversy exceeds $5,000,000, exclusive of interest and costs.   Dart Cherokee Basin \nOperating Co., LLC v. Owens , 574 U.S. 81 , 84-85 (2014) ; Yocupicio v. PAE Grp ., LLC , 795 F.3d \n1057 , 1059  (9th Cir. 2015) ; Ibarra v. Manheim In vs., Inc., 775 F.3d 1193, 1195 (9th Cir. 2015).  \nPlaintiffs’ CAFA allegations appear in paragraphs 55 -60 of the TAC.  Defendants do not contest  \nthe allegations regarding  CAFA’s jurisdictional requirement s of minimum diversity and class \nnumerosity.   They argue only that allegations regarding the amount in controversy are conclusory.   \nSee Dkt. No. 77 at 4 n.3; Dkt. No. 88 at 3 n.2.  With respect to the amount -in-controversy Case 5:19-cv-04749-VKD     Document 107     Filed 09/30/22     Page 9 of 35 \n10 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  requirement, the TAC alleges:  “T he matter in controversy exceeds the sum or value of Five \nMillion Dollars ($5,000,000), exclusive of interest and costs; moreover, the claims for relief seek, \namong other things statutory damages, compensatory damages, restitution, and other equitable \nrelief that substantially exceed One Billion Dollars ($1,000,000,000).”  Dkt. No. 67 ¶ 56. \n“In determining the amount in controversy, courts first look to the complaint.”  Ibarra , 775 \nF.3d at 1197.  Speculation and conjecture based on unreasonable assumptions are insufficient  to \ndemonstrate that CAFA’s jurisdictional threshold is satisfied .  Id.  While “ a damages assessment \nmay require a chain of reasoning that includes assumption s,” “those assumptions cannot be pulled \nfrom thin air but need some reasonable gro und underlying them.”   Id. at 1199.  Nonetheless, \n“Congress intended CAFA to be interpreted expansively.”  Id. at 1197 ; see also Jauregui v. \nRoadrunner Transp. Servs., Inc ., 28 F.4th 989 , 993  (9th Cir. 2022)  (“The [Supreme] Court has \nexplained that ‘CAFA’s provisions should be read broadly, with a strong preference that interstate \nclass actions should be heard in a federal court if properly removed by any defendant.’”) (quoting \nDart Cherokee , 574 U.S. at 89).   The amount in controversy  is “simply ‘the amount at stake in the \nunderlying litigation  . . . .’”  Jauregui , 28 F.4th at 994 (quoting Theis Rsch., Inc. v. Brown & Bain , \n400 F.3d 659, 662 (9th Cir. 2005)).   “Importantly, that ‘[a]mount at stake’ does not m ean likely or \nprobable liability; rather, it refers to possible  liability.’”  Id. (quoting Greene v. Harley -Davidson, \nInc., 965 F.3d 767, 772 (9th Cir. 2020)).  \nPlaintiffs’ allegations in paragraph 56 of the TAC regarding the amount -in-controversy are \nconcl usory.  Although the TAC generally asserts that plaintiffs have collectively lost “millions of \ndollars” (Dkt. No. 67 ¶ 356), t he named plaintiffs’ estimated damages do not appear to meet, much \nless exceed, the $5 million CAFA threshold.  See, e.g.,  Dkt. No. 67 ¶¶ 178, 194, 195, 196, 211, \n232, 233, 238, 255, 259, 262, 263.  Moreover, the TAC’s allegations indicate that not all of \nplaintiffs’ videos were excluded from Restricted Mode or demonetized ( see id . ¶¶ 191, 201, 203, \n214, 232, 234; see also  Dkt. No. 101 at 26:1 -6, 28:12 -16), and it is unclear precisely how often the \nalleged improper restriction of video content occurs.  \nNevertheless, plaintiffs maintain that defendants improperly censored or otherwise \ninterfered with many of their videos.  See Dkt. No. 67 ¶¶ 191, 201, 203, 214, 234 ; see also  Dkt. Case 5:19-cv-04749-VKD     Document 107     Filed 09/30/22     Page 10 of 35 \n11 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  No. 101 at 26:1 -6, 28:12 -16.  And their allegations regarding the amount in controversy  rest, in \nlarge part, on the sheer scale of defendants’  alleged billion -dollar  busines s, the potential millions \nof class members,6 and the artificial intelligence algorithms  and manual review policies  that \nreportedly are used to filter  video content based on unlawful criteria .  See Dkt. No. 67 ¶¶ 15, 57 -\n58, 65, 70,  113-114, 119, 269-70.  Notably, d efendants have not presented a factual challenge to \nthe TAC’s allegations regarding CAFA jurisdiction; they simply assert, without elaboration, that \n \n6 The YouTube Community Class is defined as:  \n \nAll persons or entities in the United States who are or we re members, \nusers and or consumers of YouTube who uploaded, posted, or viewed \nvideo content on YouTube subject to the choice -of-law and venue \nprovisions set forth in Defendants’ Terms of Service, Mission \nStatement, Community Guidelines, and/or any other co ntent -based \nfiltering, monetization, distribution, personal data use policies, \nadvertising or regulation and practices any other regulations or \npractices that are related to the YouTube Platform on or after January \n1, 2015 and continuing through to Decembe r 31, 2019 (the “Class \nPeriod”).  \n \nDkt. No. 67 ¶¶ 269.  The class excludes defendants, “ their employees, affiliates, parents, \nsubsidiaries, and co -conspirators, whether or not named in this Complaint, and the United States \ngovernment .”  Id. ¶ 269.  Plaintif fs believe that there are over 200 million class members.  Id. \n¶ 270. \n \n The LGBTQ+ subclass is defined as:  \n \nAll persons or entities in the United States who (a) are or were \nmembers, users and or consumers of YouTube who uploaded, posted, \nor viewed video content on YouTube subject to the choice -of-law and \nvenue provisions set forth in Defendants’ Terms of Service, Mission \nStatement, Community Guidelines, and/or any other content -based \nfiltering, monetization, distribution, personal data use policies,  \nadvertising or regulation and practices any other regulations or \npractices that are related to the YouTube Platform and (b) are part of \na protected class of persons under the California or Federal law \nbecause of sexual orientation, gender identity, or gen der or (c) create, \npost, distribute, monetize, or advertise video content on the YouTube \nPlatform that discusses or relates to topics, issues or viewpoints that \nadvocate for, are of interest to, or are intended for audiences, on or \nafter January 1, 2015 an d continuing through to December 31, 2019 \n(the “ Subclass Period”).  \n \nId.  The class excludes defendants, “ their employees, affiliates, parents, subsidiaries, and co -\nconspirators, and any YouTube users who create, post, distribute, promote or engage in vide o or \ncommunications on the YouTube Platform that is directed against Plaintiffs or Community and is \nobjectively violent, obscene, threatening, or homophobic as alleged in the Complaint .”  Id.  \nPlaintiffs believe that there are at least 9.33 million members  of the subclass.  Id. ¶ 270. \n Case 5:19-cv-04749-VKD     Document 107     Filed 09/30/22     Page 11 of 35 \n12 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  the TAC’s allegations are conclusory.   See Dkt. No. 77 at 4 n.3; Dkt. No. 88 at 3 n.2.  \nMoreover, as discuss ed below, the Court finds that plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged \nclaims for violation of the Unruh Act and California’s unfair competition law.  Even assuming that \nthe alleged improper restriction  of users’  videos occur red only on ce with respect to fewe r than half \nof the members of the putative YouTube Community Class, and further assuming minimal \ndamages of $1 per class member, the collective damages alleged in the TAC would exceed the $5 \nmillion CAFA threshold.   Accordingly, vi ewing the TAC’s allegatio ns as a whole,  and in a light \nmost favorable to plaintiffs, the Court finds that plaintiffs have pled sufficient facts demonstrating \na plausible possibility that CAFA’s amount -in-controversy requirement is satisfied .  However, as \ndiscussed below, the Court also finds that  even those claims that are sufficiently pled in the TAC  \nnonetheless are barred by CDA Section 230.  \nB. State Law Claims  \n1. California Constitution, Article I, Section 2  \nPlaintiffs assert a claim , for themselves and on behalf of the YouTube C ommunity Class,  \nfor violation of  their rights to liberty of speech and association  under the California Constitution.  \nDkt. No. 67 ¶¶ 305-317.  Contending  that defendants operate and maintain YouTube as “a public \nforum, or its functional equivalent,”  plain tiffs allege that defendants “expressly invite the public to \nvisit the YouTube platform to engage in freedom of expression,” and “ have restricted the speech \nand expressive conduct of the Proposed Class ” through censorship  of their videos  based on \nsubjectiv e, vague, and overbroad criteria .  See id. ¶¶ 307, 308 , 311.  \nArticle I, section 2 of the California Constitution provides that “[e]very person may freely \nspeak, write, and publish his or her sentiments on all subjects  . . ..”  Although t his provision of the \nstate constitution contains a state action limitation,  Golden Gateway Ctr. v.

Noting the “importance of the \npublic character of the property in determining the scope of California’s free speech clause,” the \nCalifornia Supreme Court subsequently clarified  that “the actions of a private property owner \nconstitute state action for pur poses  of California ’s free speech clause only if the property is  freely \nand openly accessible to the public .”  Golden Gateway , 26 Cal. 4th at 1033.  \nPlaintiffs contend that  defendants’ alleged conduct with respect to the regulation of content \nposted on YouT ube constitutes state action, arguing that YouTube is “the cyber -equivalent of a \ntown square where citizens exchange ideas on matters of public interest or concern.”  Dkt. No. 67 \n¶ 307.  However, no court has extended the Pruneyard  line of cases, which con cern physical \nproperty, to the Internet.

Bernardo Heights Country Club , 36 Cal. 4th 824, 853 (2005)).   Even so, evidence of \ndisparate impact “may be probative of in tentional discrimination in some cases,” subject to a \nproper foundation and the general rules of evidence.  Harris , 52 Cal. 3d at 1175 ; see also  GLAAD , \n742 F.3d at 426 n.4 (citing Koebke , 36 Cal. 4th at 854 ) (same).  \nDefendants argue that  plaintiffs’ Unruh Act claim  simply is based on  allegations about the \ndisparate impact of neutral policies that  apply equally  to all content creators .  “By its nature, an \nadverse impact claim challenges a standard that is applicable alike to all  such [protected \nclass ificatio ns] based on the premise that, notwithstanding its universal applicability, its actual \nimpact demands scrutiny.”  Turner , 167 Cal.

Here, defendants point out that the \nTAC alleges that defendants restricted and demonetized some plaintiffs’ videos, while leaving \nallegedly similar non -LGBTQ+ content unrestricted and fully monetized.  See, e.g.  Dkt. No. 67 \n¶¶ 191, 217 ; see also id . ¶ 235 (allegations concerning plaintiff  Stephanie  Frosch’s complaint \n“about how  Google/YouTube’s recent changes to the algorithm had disproportionately affected \nthe YouTube creators and viewers. ”).  Defendants maintain that these are quintessential disparate \nimpact allegations.   Additionally, defendants  contend that the TAC  asserts, in conclusory  fashion  \nand based solely on plaintiffs’ speculation, that YouTube’s algorithms flagged plaintiffs’ videos  Case 5:19-cv-04749-VKD     Document 107     Filed 09/30/22     Page 15 of 35 \n16 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  because they contain LGBTQ+ content .  See Dkt. No. 77 at 1 4 (citing Dkt. No. 67  ¶¶ 7, 17, 26.c, \n114, 119 , 204 ).  Defendants further argue that plaintiffs’ allegations concerning disparate impact \nare undermined by other allegations suggesting that many of plaintiffs’ videos remain available on \nYouTube, as well as allegations that  YouTube made LGBTQ+ outreach efforts and encouraged \nand s ponsored LGBTQ+ programs  from, for example, the BriaandChrissy channel .  See id. at 16 ; \nsee also  Dkt. No. 67 ¶¶ 35-44, 179, 180, 220, 259.  \nPlaintiffs contend that they have alleged more than mere disparate impact and have stated \nsufficient facts giving ris e to a plausible inference of discriminatory intent.  However, plaintiffs \nare not aided by their reliance on the declaration of plaintiff Stephanie Frosch (Dkt. No. 40 ), \npurported evidence that is not incorporated in or appended to  the operative complaint  and which \nthe Court has already determined cannot appropriately be considered in resolving a  Rule 12(b)(6)  \nmotion to dismiss.  See Dkt. No.  42. \nAs for particular paragraphs of the TAC that plaintiffs  do cite, most of them indicate that \nrestrictions placed on users’ content was an error that defendants took steps to rectify.  \nSpecifically, the TAC alleges that defendants acknowledged that Restricted Mode was not \n“working the way it should”  and “will never be perfect,” but  stated that they were working  on \nfixing Restricted Mode so that it “should not filter out content belonging to individuals or groups \nbased on ” a range of attributes  “like gender, gender identity, political viewpoints, race, religion or \nsexual orientation.”   The TAC further alleges tha t “[i]n response to complaints from the \nCommunity and other civil rights critics, ” defendants “ removed all restricted filtering on videos \nposted or produced by members and groups, and changed their policy, filtering algorithm, and \nmanual review policies pu rportedly to ensure that videos posted by vloggers were not being \ncensored solely because of the identity of the speaker. ”  See Dkt. No. 67 ¶¶ 29, 106, 140, 142.   \nThese allegations , standing alone,  do not raise a plausible inference that defendants  intenti onally \ndiscriminat ed against plaintiffs on the basis of their sexual orientation or viewpoints .  See \nNewman , 2021 WL 2633423  at *7 (finding that allegations regarding “an error caused by the \nYouTube algorithm used to filter content” did not support a plaus ible inference that defendants \nintentionally discriminated against content creators on the basis of race).

According \nto a purported transcript of that phone call,8 the advertisement was for a Divino Group Christmas \nepisode that launched on December 24; at the time of Mr. Knight’s phone call, Christmas was \nover and the ad remained under review.  When  Mr. Knight inquired why the ad remained under \nreview, a customer ser vice representative initially stated that “the ad has been disapproved because \nof shocking content[.]”  The call subsequently was transferred to a “floor manager.”  According to \nthe transcript, when Mr. Knight asked what “shocking content” caused the ad to  be flagged for \nreview, the manager responded that “the video has the sexuality content about the gays and \neverything” and  that “the major reason is about the gay thing.”  See Dkt. No. 20 at ECF 130 -135; \nsee also  Dkt. No. 67 ¶¶ 20, 24, 26.e., 32, 143, 155,  167, 354.   The TAC alleges that defendants \nlater apologized “for what they contend was a misunderstanding” and “eventually agreed to run \nthe ad”  more than  three weeks after the Christmas holiday passed.  Dkt. No. 67 ¶ 144. \nDefendants maintain that the cal l center episode is irrelevant to the extent it concerns  \nplaintiffs’ purchase of ad vertisements , rather than the restriction of  plaintiffs’ videos.  They also \nargue that  the TAC’s allegations are misleading and inconsistent insofar as they suggest that the  \nDivino Group ad was disapproved, when it  in fact was allowed to run.   As discussed above, \nhowever, the  overall theory of plaintiffs’ Unruh Act claim is that they are being unlawfully denied \nequal access to YouTube’s services because of their sexual orient ation and viewpoints.  The TAC \nalleges that the  Divino Group  ad was not allowed to run initially because of the “gay thing,” and it \nwas allowed to run later (after the advertised event was over) only after Mr. Knight called to \ncomplain .  Plaintiffs further allege  that, f ar from being an isolated incident, the same thing \nhappened to Divino Group at least five times before  the December 2017 call center in cident , and \nthat defendants subsequently “declined at least four additional ad requests from the same channel \n \n8 Plaintiffs apparently intended to, but did not , append the transcript to the TAC.  See Dkt. No. 67 \n¶ 20 n.6.   Nevertheless, both sides invite the Court to review the transcript appended to plaintiffs’ \nprior pleadings, most recently submitted as Exhibit A to plaintiffs’ SAC.  See Dkt. No. 20 at ECF \n130-135; Dkt. No. 85 at 18; Dkt. No. 88 at 7.

Enigma II , 946 F.3d at 1052.   Unlike Enigma II , however,  \nand despite the TAC’s allegations that defendants compete with plaintiffs for an audience and \nviewership,  the parties in the present acti on are not direct competitors.   See Dkt. No. 67 ¶¶ 35-46; \nsee e.g., Asurvio LP v. Malwarebytes, Inc. , No. 5:18-cv-05409 -EJD, 2020 WL 1478345,  at *5  \n(N.D. Cal. Mar. 26, 2020) (“The Court finds that the limitation to section 230(c)(2) (B) immunity \nrecognized in Enigma  does not apply to this case.  In Enigma , the parties were direct competitors \nwho sold computer security software nationwide.”) (internal  quotations and citation omitted).  \nIndeed, other courts have concluded that  “defendants’ creation of a ‘Restricted Mode’ to allow \nsensitive users to voluntarily choose a more limited experience of the YouTube service is exactly \nthe type of self -regulation  that Congress sought to encourage in enacting section 230, and fits \nwithin section 230(c)(2)(B)’s immunity for ‘any action taken to enable or make available to . . . \nothers,’ namely, YouTube users, ‘the technical means to restrict access to’ material ‘tha t the \nprovider or user considers to be obscene, . . . excessively violent, . . . or otherwise objectionable. ”  \nPrager Univ. , 2019 WL 8640569  at *10. \nDefendants have demonstrated that Section 230(c)(2)(B) immunity applies to the Unruh \nAct and UCL claims , to the extent those claims are based on YouTube’s application of Restricted \nMode . \nD. Plaintiffs’ Challenge to  Constitutionality of CDA  Section 230  \nThe Court is mindful of the doctrine of constitutional avoidance.  See Dep’t of Com. v. U.S. \nHouse of Representati ves, 525 U.S. 316, 343 (1999)  (“If there is one doctrine more deeply rooted \nthan any other in the process of constitutional adjudication, it is that we ought not to pass on \nquestions of constitutionality . . . unless such adjudication is unavoidable.” ) ((quoting Spector \nMotor Serv. v. McLaughlin , 323 U.S. 101, 105 (1944)).   However, in view of the Court’s \nconclusions that the TAC states some claims for relief, which nonetheless are barred by CDA \nSection 230(c), the Court finds it necessary to address plaintiffs’ argument that CDA Section 230 \nis unconstitutional . \nPlaintiffs argue  that CDA Section 230 (c) is unconstitutional because it violates  their free \nspeech rights under  the First Amendment .  Dkt. No. 85 at 27 -30.  Relying on Denver Area Educ. Case 5:19-cv-04749-VKD     Document 107     Filed 09/30/22     Page 31 of 35 \n32 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  Telecomm. Consortium, Inc. v. Fed. Commc’ns Comm’n , 518 U.S. 727 (1996), plaintif fs argue  \nthat “ the statute’s application results in  an unconstitutional permissive speech law that violates the \nFirst Amendment .”  Id. at 27.   Defendants respond that there is no valid basis for plaintiffs’ \nconstitutional attack on Section 230(c) because defendants are not state actors subject to the \nconstraints of the First Amendment .  Dkt. No. 77 at 24 -25; Dkt. No. 88 at 18 -20.  The United \nStates  argues that Section 230(c) is not unconstitutional because YouTube is not a state actor  and \nbecause Section 2 30(c) has not deprived plaintiffs of any valid underlying speech claim.   Dkt. \nNos. 47, 89.  \nThe Court agrees with defendants and the United States.  I n this Court’s prior order \ngranting defendants’ motion to dismiss the SAC, the Court concluded that plainti ffs failed to  \nestablish the presence of state action in support of their First Amendment claim because \n(1) YouTube’s hosting of speech on a private platform is not a traditional and exclusive \ngovernment function ; (2) plaintiffs failed to support their assertion that defendants effectively \ndeclared themselves the equivalent of state actors; (3) the availability of the affirmative defense \nunder Section 230(c) does not amount to government endorsement of defendants’ alleged \ndiscrimination ; and (4) nothing about Section 230 coerces private entities to take any particular \naction.  Nothing in the TAC or plaintiffs’ arguments requires the Court to alter its prior analysis or \nconclusions.  See Dkt. No. 65 at 7 -12; see also  Prager III , 951 F.3d  at 997-98; Newman , 2021 WL \n2633423 at *9 -10. \nPlaintiffs nonetheless maintain that under Denver Area , Section 230(c) is unconstitutional \nbecause it “was expressly enacted as a permissive regulation of speech” that allows defendants to \nregulate, restrict and block content on YouTube.  Dkt. No. 85 at 27 -28.  Plaintiffs’ arguments fail \nto persuade.  As discussed in the Court’s prior order dismissing plaintiffs’ SAC : \n \nUnlike the cable systems operators in Denver Area , YouTube is not \na government -regulated entity charged with prov iding public \nbroadcasting services.  And unlike the statute at issue in Denver \nArea , which permitted cable system operators to ban specific \ncontent, Section 230 of the CDA does not single out particular types \nof speech as suitable for private censorship.  At most, Section 230 \nprovides protection from civil liability for interactive computer \nservice providers who elect to host information provided by another \ncontent provider, or who in good faith act to restrict materials that Case 5:19-cv-04749-VKD     Document 107     Filed 09/30/22     Page 32 of 35 \n33 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  the provider or user considers “obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, \nexcessively violent, harassing, or otherwise objectionable,” \nregardless of whether that material is constitutionally protected.  \n[47] U.S.C. § 230(c); see also Roberts , 877 F.3d at 837 (concluding \nthat a permissive feder al statute giving a private entity the choice to \narbitrate does not “encourage” arbitration such that the private \nentity’s conduct is attributable to the government).  \n \nDkt. No. 65 at 11 -12; see also Lewis , 461 F. Supp. 3d at 952 -53 (concluding that Section 230(c)(1) \n“does not ban or restrict any speech.”) ; Prager Univ. , 2019 WL 8640569  at *12 (same) ; see \ngenerally Janus v. Am. Fed. of State, Cty. & Mun. Emps., Council 31 , 138 S. Ct. 2448, 2479 n.24 \n(2018) (noting that , while the issue has not yet bee n decided by the Supreme Court,  the \nproposition that a law “allowing, but not requiring, private parties ” to take certain action is \nsufficient to establish governmental action “is even more questionable today.”).12  Plaintiffs have \nnot presented any argume nt that compels a contrary conclusion.   Although plaintiffs maintain that \nUnited States v. Texas , 566 F.  Supp.  3d 605 ( W.D. Tex. 2021)  establishes that they need not \nestablish state action to pursue a constitutional challenge to CDA Section 230, that argum ent fails \nfor the reasons discussed above.  \nTo the extent the TAC  suggests that defendants’ invocation of CDA Section 230(c) as a \ndefense violates plaintiffs’ First Amendment right to “petition[] the courts for relief,” (see Dkt. \nNo. 67  ¶ 304), plaintiffs have not been precluded from presenting their legal disputes  to the courts, \n“express[ing] their ideas, hopes, and concerns to their government ,” or from “request[ing] action \nby the government to address those concerns.”  Borough of Duryea v. Gua rnieri , 564 U.S. 379, \n388-89 (2011).  Here, the United States argues, persuasively, that the Petition Clause does not \nrequire that the government guarantee plaintiffs the ability to continue to litigating their claims to \na particular outcome, or that defen dants must be denied the opportunity to avail themselves of a \ndefense under CDA Section 230.   See Dkt. No. 47 at 15 -16; Dkt. No. 89.   For example, i n \n \n12 The parties dispute whether d efendants  should be permitted to file a statement of recent decision \nconcerning Judge Chen’ s order  on a motion to dismiss  in Huber v. Biden , No. 21 -cv-06580 -EMC, \n2022 WL 827248 (N.D. Cal. Mar. 18, 2022).   See Dkt. Nos. 102, 103.  In briefing the matter, both \nsides present substantive arguments regarding their respective views on the relevance of Huber .  \nAs the parties have had an opportunity to brief the matter, t he Court grants defendants’ request for \nleave to file their statement  of recent decision .  The Court otherwise finds it unnecessary to rely on \nHube r; as discussed above, plaintiffs have not persuasively argued that Denver Area  requires \neither a finding of state action or a constitutional violation in the present matter .

Glock, Inc. , 565 F.3d 1126 , \n1140 -41 (9th Cir. 2009)  (concluding that law limiting liability did not deprive the plaintiffs of a \nvested property right because “although a cause of action is a species of property, a party’s \nproperty right in any cause of action does not ve st until a final unreviewable judgment is \nobtained.”).  \nPlaintiffs  have not established that the application of Section 230(c) as a defense is \nunconstitutional.  \nE. Leave to Amend  \nUnder Rule 15(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, leave to amend “shall be freely \ngiven when justice so requires,” because “the court must remain guided by the underlying purpose \nof Rule 15 . . . to facilitate decisions on the merits, rather than o n the pleadings or technicalities.”  \nLopez v. Smith , 203 F.3d 1122, 1127 (9th Cir. 2000) (en banc) (alterations and internal quotation \nmarks omitted).  “The decision of whether to grant leave to amend nevertheless remains within the \ndiscretion of the distr ict court,” which may deny leave to amend if allowing amendment would \nunduly prejudice the opposing party, cause undue delay, or be futile, or if the party seeking \namendment has acted in bad faith.  Leadsinger, Inc. v. BMG Music Publ’g , 512 F.3d 522, 532 ( 9th \nCir. 2008) (citing Foman v. Davis , 371 U.S. 178, 182 (1962)).  \nAs discussed above, plaintiffs are given leave to amend their claim for breach of the \nimplied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.  However, they will not be given leave to amend \nany other claims.  Plaintiffs  have now had several opportunities to plead  their claims.  See Dkt. \nNos. 1, 7, 20, 67.  They  have not articulated any additional facts that could be alleged in an \namended pleading to support  plausible claims for violation of the Lanham Act , the California \nConstitution,  or for declaratory relief reg arding the constitutionality of CDA Section 230 , much \nless additional claims for breach of contract, rescission, replevin or for an accounting ( see Dkt. \nNo. 67 at 1 n.1; Dkt.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: In Mazile v. Larkin University Corp. and ExamSoft Worldwide, Inc., Plaintiff Christelle Mazile, a doctoral student, claims that ExamSoft's AI-proctored exams led to false cheating allegations and her expulsion from Larkin University. The court ruled that Mazile's claims against ExamSoft must go to arbitration due to a binding arbitration clause in the clickwrap agreement she signed. Additionally, the court dismissed her claims against Larkin University for discrimination under the ADA and RA, among others, for failing to establish Larkin as a state actor or show that the university knew of any alleged discriminatory effects of the ExamSoft software.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the arbitration clause in the ExamSoft EULA is enforceable and whether Plaintiff's allegations state a valid claim of discrimination against Larkin University under various statutes, considering the use of AI in ExamSoft's software.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court compelled arbitration for the claims against ExamSoft, enforcing the arbitration clause in the EULA, and dismissed the Plaintiff’s claims against Larkin University. The dismissal was with prejudice regarding the § 1983 claim, finding Larkin is not a state actor, and without prejudice regarding the other discrimination claims, finding insufficient evidence for wrongful discrimination against Plaintiff due to her disabilities.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Christelle Mazile said a computer program in her university's online exam system incorrectly flagged her as a cheater, which led to her getting kicked out of school. She tried to sue both the university and the company behind the exam software. The court said she agreed to settle any issues with the software company in a special way (arbitration) when she clicked \"I agree\" before taking the test, so she has to handle that part outside court. As for the university, the court ruled her claims weren’t detailed enough to move forward, though she might get a second chance to explain them better in some cases.",

Being fully advised, the Motion [ ECF No. 34] is GRANTED.  \nI. BACKGROUND Plaintiff Christelle Mazile  attended Defendant Larkin University Corp. (“Larkin”) to \nobtain a doctorate degree in the ir pharmaceutical program, with an expected graduation date of \nMay 2021.  [ Compl. ¶ 11].  Mazile describes herself as an “African American female with \ndiagnosed anxiety and ADHD.”  [ Id.]   \nLarkin is a Florida non-profit corporation engaged in providing higher education services, \nand Larkin received forgivable loans from the federal  government via the Paycheck Protection \nProgram (“PPP”).  [Id . ¶¶ 2-3, 95c].   \nDefendant ExamSoft Worldwide, Inc. (“ExamSoft”), is a for -profit Texas corporation that \ncreates testin g software that Larkin use d to administer remote examinations for its classes .  [Id. ¶¶ \n2-3].   Case 1:23-cv-23306-DSL   Document 53   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/22/2024   Page 1 of 242 \n In the Spring of 2020, Mazile was scheduled to take her final examinations  at Larkin  in \nthree classes.  [ Id. ¶ 13].  She initially took examinations for these classes in person (without using \nExamSoft software ) but failed to achieve passing grades .  [Id. ¶¶ 16, 18].  As a result, Larkin \nrequired her to take remediation examinations.  [ Id. ¶¶ 20].  At the time of the remediation testing  \nand due to  the COVID-19 pandemic , Larkin arranged to have the ir students take  examinations \nremotely by using  ExamSoft software.  [ Id. ¶ 15].  T he ExamSoft software created “a continuous \naudio and video recording of the exam -taker using both webcam and screen capture, ” and after the \nexam was  completed the footage was  uploaded to ExamSoft for review by an artificial intelligence \nsystem to identify any potential irregular behavior.  [ Id. ¶ 25].  In  May 2020, Plaintiff took these \nexaminations remotely using ExamSoft ; she was not given an option by Larkin to take her \nexaminations in any other  manner.1  [Id. ¶¶ 21-24, 29].  After taking her remediation exams , \nExamSoft “flagged” Mazile for cheating, and she was expelled by Larkin as a result .  [Id. ¶¶ 30-\n31].   \nTo take her remote examinations using ExamSoft, Plaintiff signed a n Exam Soft \n“clickwrap” agreement, known as the End User Licensing Agreement (“EULA”), by checking a \nbox on her computer screen.  [ECF No. 36 at 7].  The EULA inc luded a clause mandating binding \narbitration for “any claim, demand, dispute or controversy of any kind or nature between the parties \nhereto arising out of or relating to this Agreement, its construction, interpretation, performance or alleged breach” that  is “not otherwise settled by agreement of the parties” (the “Arbitration \nClause”).  [ Compl., Ex. C  at 36].  The Arbitration Clause include d a choice-of- law clause \n \n1 In her Complaint, Mazile  claims to have taken the same remediation exams at different \ntimes.   At some points she claims they occurred in May 2020, and at other points she claims they \ntook place in May 2021.  [Compl. ¶¶ 21, 29, 30, 39, 50].   Because she admits in her response to \nDefendants’ Motion that the examinations occurred in May 2020, this Court will assume as such.  \n[See ECF No. 36 at 16].  Case 1:23-cv-23306-DSL   Document 53   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/22/2024   Page 2 of 243 \n specifying that Texas law applie d to any dispute “without regard to its conflict of laws rules.”  \n[Id.].   \nAs part of the expulsion determination, Mazile alleges that Larkin refused to allow her to \nretest, in person or otherwise, and refused to “consider or investigate her claims that the  \n[ExamSoft] Software had a discriminatory effect based on her race, as well as her ADHD and \nanxiety.”  [ Id. ¶ 32].  Mazile points out that ExamSoft ha d drawn  criticism “as early as December \nof 2020,” when six United States Senators wrote a letter to ExamSo ft expressing their concerns \nthat the ExamSoft software was accusing students of color  and those with disabilities  of cheating  \ndisproportionately.  [ Id., Ex. A at 19- 22].  Mazile also alleges that  “[n]umerous other articles, \nstories, or publications have been made which evidence a clear pattern of the [ExamSoft] Software, and its undoubted discriminatory effect on African America (sic) students, and those with disabilities.”  [ Id. ¶ 28].  \nMazile’s Amended Complaint contains seven counts .  Four counts are aga inst Larkin, \nalleging discrimination and failure -to-accommodate claims under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, the Americans \nwith Disabilities Act (“ADA”), and the Rehabilitation Act (“RA”) .  Three counts are against \nExamSoft, alleging intentional and negligent misreprese ntation and breach of warranty claims \nunder state law.  [ECF No. 16, Compl. ¶¶ 33- 104]. \nII. The Motion to Compel Arbitration  by ExamSoft  is GRANTED.  \nAs part of the Motion, ExamSoft moved to compel arbitration for the claims against it, \nclaiming that the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”) requires Plaintiff to submit her claims against ExamSoft to binding arbitration.  [ECF No. 34 at 3].  For the reasons tha t follow, this Court agrees  \nwith ExamSoft; these three counts must be decided in arbitration. \n Case 1:23-cv-23306-DSL   Document 53   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/22/2024   Page 3 of 244 \n A. Legal Standard  \nUnder the FAA, “[a] written provision in any . . . contract evidencing a transaction \ninvolving commerce to settle by arbitration a controversy the reafter arising out of such contract or \ntransaction . . . shall be valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, save upon such grounds as exist at law \nor in equity for the revocation of any contract [.]”  9 U.S.C. § 2.  “Confronted with a facially valid \narbitration  agreement, district courts shall  direct the parties to proceed to arbitration on issues as \nto which an arbitration agreement has been signed.”  Calcaterra v. Baptist Health S. Fla., Inc., No. 1:23- CV-20364- KMM, 2024 WL 2109349, at *2 (S.D. Fla. May 9, 2024) (emphasis in original); \n9 U.S.C. § 3.  “A motion to compel arbitration is treated generally as a Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.”  Calcaterra , 2024 \nWL 2109349, at *2 (citing Shea v. BBV A Compass Bancshares, Inc., 2013 WL 869526 at *2 n.3 \n(S.D. Fla. Mar. 7, 2013)).  Thus, a court “may consider matters outside the four corners of the complaint.”  Id . (citing Mamani v. Sanchez Berzain, 636 F. Supp. 2d 1326, 1329 (S.D. Fla. 2009)).  \nCourts s hould only compel arbitration if (a) the agreement is enforceable under “ordinary state -\nlaw contract principles” and (b) the claims before the court fall within the scope of that agreement.  Lambert v. Signature Healthcare , LLC, No. 19 -11900, 2022 WL 2571959, at *4 (11th Cir. July 8, \n2022). \nB. Discussion  \nIn diversity actions, this  Court is required to apply the forum state’s conflict -of-law rules.  \nDoe v. Roe , 500 F. Supp. 3d 1319, 1324 (S.D. Fla. 2020), aff'd , No. 20 -14456, 2022 WL 1447378 \n(11th Cir. May 9, 2022) (citing Klaxon Co. v. Stentor Elect. Mfg. Co., 313 U.S. 487, 496 (1941)).  In Florida, “[w]hen a false conflict exists, the law of the forum state –Florida –applies.”  Id . (citing \nCavic v. Grand Bahama Dev. Co. , 701 F.2d 879, 882 (11th Cir. 1983)).  A “false conflict exists Case 1:23-cv-23306-DSL   Document 53   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/22/2024   Page 4 of 245 \n where the laws of the interested jurisdictions would produce the same outcome[.]”  Id . (quotation \nmarks omitted).   \nMazile claims that both the choice -of-law provision and the Arbitration Clause are \nunconscionable.  [ See ECF No. 36 at 5].  This Court will review  the substantive law of \nunconscionability in both Florida and Texas to determine whether there is a “false conflict ,” such \nthat both courts in both states would “produce the same outcome” when deciding whether the \nchoice- of-law provision and the Arbitration Clause in the EULA are unconscionable.  If so, the \nCourt will apply Florida law. \n1. Substantive Law - Unconscionability  \n Florida Law \nUnder Florida law, “[w]hether an arbit ration provision is unconscionable is a question of \nstate law and therefore the provision is interpreted according to state law rules of contract \nconstruction.”  Valiente v. StockX, Inc. , 645 F. Supp. 3d 1331, 1339 (S.D. Fla. 2022).  “Both \nprocedural unconscionability and substantive unconscionability must exist before the provision is unenforceable.”  Id . (citing Golden v. Mobil Oil Corp., 882 F.2d 490, 493 (11th Cir. 1989)). \n“Procedural unconscionability focuses on (1) the manner in which the contract was  entered \ninto; (2) whether the complaining party had a meaningful choice at the time the contract was entered into; (3) whether the complaining party had a realistic opportunity to bargain regarding the terms of the contract; and (4) whether he or she had a reasonable opportunity to understand the terms of the contract.”  Valiente , 645 F. Supp. 3d at  1339 (internal quotations omitted).  Substantive \nunconscionability focuses on the “unreasonableness of the terms” in the “agreement itself.”  Basulto v. Hialeah Auto., 141 So. 3d 1145, 1157- 58 (Fla. 2014); Solis v. Am. Express Nat'l Bank , \nNo. 5:23- CV-208- JSM- PRL, 2023 WL 4474322, at *2 (M.D. Fla. July 11, 2023), report and Case 1:23-cv-23306-DSL   Document 53   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/22/2024   Page 5 of 246 \n recommendation adopted, No. 5:23- CV-208-JSM- PRL, 2023 WL 4831307 (M.D. Fla. July 28, \n2023).  However, while both procedural and substantive unconscionability “must be established \nto avoi d enforcement of the terms within an arbitration agreement[,] . . . . they need not be present \nto the same degree.”  Basulto, 141 So. 3d at 1159 (adopting a “sliding scale” approach for unconscionability). \nHere, Mazile signed the EULA  by checking a box before taking her remote exam s.  In \norder to take her exams, which were required for graduation, she had to agree to the terms provided \nby ExamSoft in the Arbitration Clause , with no effective negotiating power  to change the terms of \nthe software’s use.  [ECF  No. 37 at 7].  Plaintiff, therefore, had little meaningful choice when she \ntook her final examinations to not sign the EULA -- because if she did not agree to the terms as \npresented to her, she would certainly fail to graduate after she had spent over $135,000 in pursuit of her degree.  [Compl. ¶ 12].  Thus, it is clear to this Court that the second and third Valiente  \nfactors of procedural unconscionability are present .   \nHowever, the first and fourth Valiente  factors do not lead to a finding of procedural \nunconscionability.  T he Plaintiff had every opportunity to understand the clear terms of the \nArbitration Clause .  The clause, as Plaintiff admits, was “in the same font, text, color, and size as \nthe rest of the agreement” and was clearly titled “GOVERNING LAW AND ARBITRATION[.]”  [ECF No. 37 at 7].  Plaintiff had a duty to read the contract, which was less than four pages, before she agreed to it, and be cause the Arbitration Clause  was plainly  available for her to read , and not \nhidden in the contract , this Court does not find  that it is procedurally unconscionable.  See Valiente , \n645 F. Supp. 3d at  1340- 41. \nClickwrap agreements are generally valid and enf orceable in Florida , further supporting \nthe Court’s conclusion that the EULA is not procedurally unconscionable even though Plaintiff Case 1:23-cv-23306-DSL   Document 53   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/22/2024   Page 6 of 247 \n had little choice or bargaining opportunity before  signing it.  See, e.g., Matter of Chaves , No. 22-\n81648- CIV, 2024 WL 718033, at *8 (S.D. Fla. Feb. 9, 2024) (finding clickwrap agreements are \ngenerally upheld in Florida) ; Salco Distributors, LLC v. iCode, Inc., No. 8:05 CV 642 T 27TGW, \n2006 WL 449156, at *2 (M.D. Fla. Feb. 22, 2006).  W hile Plaintiff is correct that the EULA was \nlikely one of adhesion, which is a “standardized contract, imposed upon the subscribing party \nwithout an opportunity to negotiate the terms,” Senior Servs. of Palm Beach LLC v. ABCSP Inc. , \nNo. 12- 80226- CIV, 2012 WL 2054971, at *4 (S.D. Fla. June 7, 2012), adhesion contracts are not \n“per se unconscionable[,] ” Joyce v. Forest River, Inc. , No. 23- CV-81262, 2024 WL 517990, at *3 \n(S.D. Fla. Feb. 9, 2024) (holding that an adhesion contract is unconscionable only where more \nfactors are present, such as decepti on). \nThus, despite the presence of two  of the Valiente  factors necessary for procedur al \nunconscionability, the EULA is not strongly procedurally unconscionable .  See Valiente , 645 \nF.Supp.3d at 1339 ( holding that a clickwrap arbitration agreement was enforceable where there \nwas an opt -out clause, Plaintiff had a duty to read the terms and c onditions, and clause was not \nhidden in fine print).  \nWhile substantive unconscionability is a vague standard, because arbitration agreements \nhave been upheld consistently in Florida, and are expressly supported by federal policy, there is \nno evidence that the Arbitration Clause is substantive ly unconscionable .  See Hilton v. Fluent, \nLLC, 297 F. Supp. 3d 1337, 1340 (S.D. Fla. 2018) ; Sims v. Clarendon Nat. Ins. Co., 336 F. Supp. \n2d 1311, 1325 (S.D. Fla. 2004); Laizure v. Avante at Leesburg, Inc., 44 So. 3d 1254, 1257 (Fla. \nDist. Ct. App. 2010), approved, 109 So. 3d 752 (Fla. 2013); see generally AT&T Mobility LLC v. Concepcion, 563 U.S. 333, 339 (2011).  Mazile  states in correct ly that the Arbitration Clause’s \nrequirement  that she waive any class action right  creates substantive unconscionability .  See AT&T Case 1:23-cv-23306-DSL   Document 53   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/22/2024   Page 7 of 248 \n Mobility , 563 U.S. at 352 (finding that the FAA preempted a state ’s judicial rule  banning class \naction waivers  in arbitration clauses ); Pendergast v. Sprint Nextel Corp., 691 F.3d 1224, 1232 \n(11th Cir. 2012). \nAdditionally, Mazile has offered no explanation (beyond a conclusory statement ) as to why \napplying Texas law would be substantively unconscionable.2  Choice-of- law clauses are only held \nunreasonable and unenforceable when “(1) their formati on was induced by fraud or overreaching; \n(2) the plaintiff would effectively be deprived of its day in court because of the inconvenience and \nunfairness of the chosen forum; (3) the fundamental unfairness of the chosen law would deprive \nthe plaintiff of a remedy; or (4) enforcement of such provisions would contravene a strong public policy.”  Xena Invs., Ltd. v. Magnum Fund Mgmt. Ltd., 726 F.3d 1278, 1284–85 (11th Cir. 2013).  Clearly, the choice -of-law clause here does not meet this test for unreasonableness because (1) \nMazile does not allege fraud in the formation of the EULA ; (2) Mazile would not be deprived of \nher day in Court if Texas law applies as the application of Texas law itself does not forbid the Plaintiff from bringing any claim; (3) Texas law is not fundamentally unfair on unconscionability and closely mirrors Florida law (discussed below) ; and (4) Mazile has identified no strong public \npolicy that would counsel this Court against applying Texas law.  \nBecause Mazile has insuffici ently proven procedural unconscionability, and because there \nis no showing of substantive unconscionability, under Florida law, both clauses would be enforced \nand the Motion to Compel Arbitration would therefore be granted.  However, this Court must also analyze Texas law on unconscionability to determine whether a false conflict exists. \n \n \n2 To show substantive unconscionability under Florida law, Mazile has to show that it \nwould be unreasonable for this Court to apply Texas law  here.  Case 1:23-cv-23306-DSL   Document 53   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/22/2024   Page 8 of 249 \n  Texas Law  \n Similar to Florida, Texas courts analyze contractual unconscionability by determining both \nprocedural and substantive unconscionability.  Bongalis- Royer v. RJ Worldwide, LLC , No. 4:14-\nCV-330, 2015 WL 12778846, at *9 (E.D. Tex. July 16, 2015).  To do this, Texas courts examine \n“(1) the entire atmosphere in which the agreement was made; (2) alternatives, if any, available to \nthe parties at the time of formation; ( 3) the non -bargaining ability of a party; (4) whether the \ncontract was illegal or against public policy; (5) and whether it is oppressive or unreasonable.”  Id.; Delfingen US- Texas, L.P. v. Valenzuela, 407 S.W.3d 791, 798 (Tex. App. 2013).  Additionally, \nand like Florida, clickwrap agreements  are generally valid and enforceable in Texas , regardless of \nthe signatory’s purported lack of choice.   See, e.g., Bongalis- Royer , 2015 WL 12778846 at *9; \nRecursion Software, Inc. v. Interactive Intel., Inc. , 425 F. Supp. 2d 756, 782 (N.D. Tex. 2006); \nStubHub, Inc. v. Ball , 676 S.W.3d 193, 200 (Tex. App. 2023) (“Texas state and federal courts have \nrecognized the validity of clickwrap agreements.”).   \nJust as above, even though the atmosphere in which the agreement was made would suggest \nsome level of  procedural unconscionability, supra, the facts are insufficient to create strong \nprocedural or substantive unconscionability.  Arbitration clauses and choice of law provisions are neither  illegal nor against public policy (in fact, as discussed, federal law supports arbitration \nclauses) and the clickwrap terms were not “unfair or oppressive .”  Johnson v. Sw. Recovery Servs. \nInc., No. 3:22- CV-242-X- BH, 2023 WL 1944127, at *9 (N.D. Tex. Jan. 24, 2023), report and \nrecommendation adopted, No. 3:22- CV-0242-X- BH, 2023 WL 1879999 (N.D. Tex. Feb. 10, \n2023) ; supra. \nThus, because both Florida and Texas law would lead to the same conclusion that the \nEULA is not unconscionable , there is a “false conflict” between Texas and Florida law for the Case 1:23-cv-23306-DSL   Document 53   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/22/2024   Page 9 of 2410 \n enforceability of the Arbitration Clause .  This Court must therefore apply Florida law and , as \ndiscussed above,  finds that the Arbitration Clause is enforceable.  A ny claims that properly fall \nwithin the scope of the Arbitration Clause should be heard in arbitration.  \n2. Scope of the Arbitration Clause  \n The Arbitration Clause in the EULA  provides that any unsettled claim “shall be resolved \nby binding bi -lateral arbitration[.]”  [ECF No. 16 at 36 § 11].  A “claim” is “any claim, demand, \ndispute or controversy of any kind or nature between the parties hereto arising out of or relating to \nthis Agreement, its construction, interpretation, performance or alleged breach.”  [ Id.].  Because \nthis Court found that the choice of law clause in the Arbitration Clause is enforceable, Texas law applies to the determination of whether the Plaintiff’s claims fall under the Arbitration Clause.  \nUnder Texas law, a broad arbitration clause is one “where the language of the clause \nrequires arbitration of any dispute that arises out of or relates to ‘the agreement, or disputes that are in connection with the agr eement.”  Elkjer v. Scheef & Stone, L.L.P., 8 F. Supp. 3d 845, 855 \n(N.D. Tex. 2014).  Where there is a broad arbitration clause, for arbitration to be compelled over certain claims, those claims need only “touch” issues covered by the arbitration clause.  See id .   \nThe Arbitration Clause here is broad because it encompasses  “any claim . . . arising out of \nor relating to this Agreement[.]”   [ECF No. 16 at 36 § 11] .  Thus , any claim that relates to or \n“touches” the Agreement is covered  by the clause and shoul d be heard by an arbitral body, not a \nfederal court .  Here, the three claims against ExamS oft, Count IV (intentional misrepresentation), \nCount V (negligent misrepresentation), and Count VI (breach of warranty of fitness for a particular purpose), all relat e to the agreement which Mazile  signed because they concern her  examinations \nfor which she had to sign the EULA .  Case 1:23-cv-23306-DSL   Document 53   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/22/2024   Page 10 of 2411 \n In Count IV, Mazile states that she “acted on these, and other representations made by \nExamSoft as to the efficacy of its [ExamSoft] Software,  or nondiscriminatory impact thereof, in \nusing the EM Software to take her remediation examinations .”  [ECF No. 1 ¶ 74 (emphasis \nadded)].   In Count V, Mazile states that she “was injured as a direct and proximate result, as she \nwas in fact discriminated upon based on race and/or disability when using the [ExamSoft] \nSoftware[.]” [Id . ¶ 81] .  In Count VI she  states “Plaintiff and ExamSoft were in privity of contr act, \nby virtue of [the EULA.]”  [ Id. ¶ 81].    \nAs Mazile admits , all of these claims clearly  relate to or arise out of the Arbitration Clause.  \n[See ECF No. 36 at 2- 3; Compl. ¶ 8 (“Plaintiff’s claims arise directly out of ExamSoft’s activities \nin the state of Florida . . . the use of [the ExamSoft software] caused Plaintiff to be expelled.” ].  \nThese claims are only actionable because Mazile signed the EULA and decided to take the \nexaminations via ExamSoft.  Therefore, all of these claims should be hear d in arbitration.  The \nMotion to Compel Arbitration as to all counts against ExamSoft  (Counts IV, V, VI ) is GRANTED.  \nIII. The Motion to Dismiss by Larkin  is GRANTED.  \nDefendant Larkin moves to dismiss Plaintiff’s claims against it under Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 12(b)(6) for failure to state claims.  [ECF No. 34 at 5].  Specifically, Larkin argues that \n(1) it is not a state actor and therefore not amenable to suit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, (2) Plaintiff fails to properly plead discrimination under the ADA bec ause based on the facts presented in the \nAmended Complaint, Larkin could not have known of the possible discriminatory effect of ExamSoft, (3) Plaintiff fails to properly plead failure to accommodate under the ADA because Plaintiff did not demand an accomm odation, and (4) the legislative history of Section 504 of the \nRA implies that Larkin cannot be sued under the Act.  [ Id. at 6 -13].  For the reasons that follow, \nthe Motion is GRANTED. Case 1:23-cv-23306-DSL   Document 53   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/22/2024   Page 11 of 2412 \n A. Legal Standard  \nTo survive a 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, “a complaint must contain sufficient factual \nmatter, accepted as true, to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.”  Ashcroft v. Iqbal , \n556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) (quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly , 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007) (internal \nquotations omitted)).  When reviewing a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), a court must \naccept as true all factual allegations contained in the complaint, and the plaintiffs receive the benefit of all favorable inf erences that can be drawn from the facts alleged.  See  Chaparro v. \nCarnival Corp., 693 F.3d 1333, 1337 (11th Cir. 2012); Iqbal , 556 U.S. at 678. \nA court considering a 12(b)(6) motion is generally limited to the facts contained in the \ncomplaint and attached  exhibits —but may also consider documents referred to in the complaint \nthat are central to the claim and whose authenticity is undisputed.  See  Wilchombe v. TeeVee Toons, \nInc., 555 F.3d 949, 959 (11th Cir. 2009).  While the court is required to accept as t rue all allegations \ncontained in the complaint, courts “are not bound to accept as true a legal conclusion couched as \na factual allegation.”  Twombly , 550 U.S. at 555; Iqbal , 556 U.S. at 678.  “Dismissal pursuant to \nRule 12(b)(6) is not appropriate unless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief.”  Magluta v. Samples , 375 F.3d \n1269, 1273 (11th Cir. 2004) (citation and quotation omitted).  “ [D]etermining whether a complaint  \nstates a plausible claim for relief is a context -specific task that requires the reviewing court to draw \non its judicial experience and common sense.”  Holland v. Carnival Corp. , 50 F.4th 1088, 1093 \n(11th Cir. 2022) (alterations accepted) (quoting Iqbal , 556 U.S. at 679). \n   Case 1:23-cv-23306-DSL   Document 53   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/22/2024   Page 12 of 2413 \n B. Discussion  \nCount I – 42 U.S.C. § 1983 \n Mazile alleges Larkin  violated Plaintiff’s Equal Protection rights under the Fourteenth \nAmendment and brings a claim under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.  [ Compl. ¶ 38].  Count I  fails to state a \nclaim and is plainly futile .  Section  1983, the great civil rights statute  of post -Civil War American \nlaw, was passed “ to deter state actors  from using the badge of their authority to deprive individuals \nof their federally guaranteed rights and to provide relief to victims if such deterrence fails.”  Wyatt \nv. Cole , 504 U.S. 158, 161 (1992)  (emphasis added).  Larkin is a private university, id . ¶ 2, and \nPlaintiff presents no reason that it should be considered a “state actor” subjecting it to suit under § \n1983.   A private party can be considered a state actor in three rare circumstances: “(1) the State \nhas coerced or at least significantly enco uraged the action alleged to violate the Constitution \n(“State compulsion test”); (2) the private parties performed a public function that was traditionally \nthe exclusive prerogative of the State (“public function test”); or (3) the State had so far insinua ted \nitself into a position of interdependence with the private parties that it was a joint participant in the enterprise (“nexus/joint action test”).  Charles v. Johnson, 18 F.4th 686, 694 (11th Cir. 2021) (quoting Rayburn ex rel. Rayburn v. Hogue , 241 F.3d 1341, 1347 (11th Cir. 2001)).  None of these \ncircumstances are present here.  \nMazile argues that  Larkin is a state actor because it (1) performs a primarily and \ntraditionally state function – education, and (2) in the alternative, there is “joint action or a nexus \nbetween the State and Larkin University because Larkin University accepts federal funds.  [ Compl . Case 1:23-cv-23306-DSL   Document 53   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/22/2024   Page 13 of 2414 \n ¶¶ 34 -35, 37].  These arguments are without merit, and Mazile cites no legal authority  holding a \nprivate university to be a state actor.3 \nCourts have consistently held that private universities are not state actors for purposes of § \n1983.  See Andela v. Univ. of Miami , 461 F. App'x 832, 836 (11th Cir. 2012); Driessen v. Univ. of \nMiami Sch. of L. Child. & Youth L. Clinic , No. 1:20- CV-22559- UU, 2020 WL 13368589, at *2 \n(S.D. Fla. June 23, 2020), aff’d 835 Fed.Appx. 489 (11th Cir. 2020); Driessen v. Univ. of Miami \nSch. of L. Child. & Youth L. Clinic , No. 19-21224-CIV, 2019 WL 8895219, at *2 (S.D. Fla. Sept. \n24, 2019); Althia bat v. Howard Univ., 76 F. Supp. 3d 194, 197 (D.D.C. 2014).  Moreover, the \nreceipt of federal funds “do[es] not elevate [] private educational institutions to the status of ‘state \nactor.’”  Richards v. Duke Univ., 480 F. Supp. 2d 222, 239 (D.D.C. 2007); see Manhattan Cmty. \nAccess Corp. v. Halleck, 587 U.S. 802, 814 (2019); Siyu Yang v. Ardizzone , 540 F. Supp. 3d 372, \n380 (W.D.N.Y. 2021), aff'd sub nom. Yang v. Eastman Sch. of Music , No. 21-1482- CV, 2022 WL \n1040418 (2d Cir. Apr. 7, 2022) (“[A] private entity does not become a state actor for purposes of \n§ 1983 merely on the basis of the private entity's creation, funding, licensing, or regulation by the government.”) (citing Fabrikant v. French, 691 F.3d 193, 207 (2d Cir. 2012)).  Plaintiff is incorrect \nthat Larkin’s receipt of federal funds intertwines it with the government such that it has become a state actor.  \nHaving identified no possible way for Larkin to be considered a state actor, Mazile cannot \nestablish that it is amenable to suit under § 1983.  Count I is DISMISSED with prejudice . \n \n3 The Defendant cites Braden v. Univ. of Pittsburgh, 552 F. 2d 948 (3d Cir. 1977) and \nKrynicky v. Univ. of Pittsburgh, 742 F.2d 94 (3d Cir. 1984) for the proposition that courts have \nheld that universities are state actors.  [ See ECF No. 36 at 11].  However, the University of \nPittsburgh is a “state -related” university that received “a massive infusion of moneys” from the \nCommonwealth of Pennsylvania.  Braden, 552 F. 2d at 959.  Larkin  is a private university , and \nthere is no allegation that it received anything close to a “massive infusion of moneys” from the State of Florida.  T hese cases are inapposite.  Case 1:23-cv-23306-DSL   Document 53   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/22/2024   Page 14 of 2415 \n Count II – ADA Discrimination  \nMazile’s next claim against Larkin under the ADA for discrimination is based on her \ndiagnosis of ADHD and anxiety.  Even if taken as true, however, Count II  is so bereft of \ninformation that  it cannot  amount to a discrimination claim under the ADA.  \nUnder the ADA, no employer “shall discriminate against a qualified individual on the basis \nof disability in regard to job application procedures, the hiring, advancement, or discharge of \nemployees, emp loyee compensation, job training, and other terms, conditions, and privileges of \nemployment.” 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a); Samson v. Fed. Exp. Corp., 746 F.3d 1196, 1200 (11th Cir. 2014).  “To establish a prima facie case of disability discrimination under the ADA, a plaintiff \nmust show that [s]he: (1) is disabled, (2) is a qualified individual, and (3) was subjected to unlawful discrimination because of h[er] disability.”  Samson v. Fed. Ex p. Corp., 746 F.3d 1196 (11th Cir. \n2014). \nTaking the Plaintiff’s assertions as true, Plaintiff properly pleads that she is disabled and \nthat Larkin  knew of the discrimination.  [ECF No. 16 ¶¶ 47, 50].  Thus, the first prong of the test \nis met.  \nTo be a “qualified individual” under the ADA, the Plaintiff must show that “she can meet \nthe essential eligibility requirements for participation in the program, either with or without reasonable accommodations.”  Redding v. Nova Se. Univ., Inc., 165 F. Supp. 3d 1274, 1290 (S.D. Fla. 2016); Earl v. Mervyns, Inc. , 207 F.3d 1361, 1365 (11th Cir. 2000).  Based on Mazile’s  \nallegations , she is a “qualified individual” because passing the exams was an essential requirement \nof the pharmaceutical program , the use o f ExamSoft impeded  her ability to succeed on the exams , \nand she identifies possible accommodations which could have aided her .  [Compl. ¶ ¶ 32, 63].  Case 1:23-cv-23306-DSL   Document 53   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/22/2024   Page 15 of 2416 \n However, Mazile’s allegations cannot establish that Larkin discriminated against her \nbecause of  her disabili ty, and thus, her complaint does not properly plead the third prong of ADA \ndiscrimination .  Larkin’s  use of ExamSoft for examinations during COVID -19 was for all  exams, \nregardless of the student.  [ See Compl. ¶ 22].  Plaintiff claims in both her Amended Complaint and \nher response to the Motion to Dismiss that the use of ExamSoft for all exams was discriminatory \nas to her because Larkin “had actual or constructive knowledge that the [ExamSoft software] had a discriminatory effect on individuals who has certa in learning disabilities [which was] gleaned \nfrom a highly publicized open letter from congress[.]”  [ Compl. ¶¶ 52 -53; ECF No. 36 at 15- 16 \n(“Plaintiff further avers that University knew that the [ExamSoft] Software was detrimental, and \nits choice to utiliz e the same amounts to circumstantial evidence that University intended to \ndiscriminate against individuals with ADHD, anxiety, and other disability such as Plaintiff.”) ]. \nThe only possible source of this knowledge that Plaintiff identifies is the letter to ExamSoft \nfrom the United States Senators, which was published in December 2020, seven months after \nPlaintiff took her exams.  [Id., Ex. A at 19- 22].  It is therefore impossible that Larkin would have \nhad knowledge of this letter  at the time Mazile used ExamSoft  for Larkin’s exams .  Mazile tries \nto downplay this fact by claiming that the letter “did not arise in a vacuum ,” and merely \n“solidifie[d] the magnitude  of complaints, studies, and issues in the months prior, including May \nof 2020[.]”  [ECF No. 36 at 16 (emphasis in original)].  While Mazile is entitled to all reasonable \ninferences resolved in her favor, this Court can only take the facts presented to it as true, and Mazile has presented this Court with no possible sources  from which Larkin  could have had \nknowledge of the discriminatory impact of ExamSoft.  See Tropical Soup Corp. v. City of Key W., No. 21- 10459, 2021 WL 3878250, at *1 (11th Cir. Aug. 31, 2021).   Case 1:23-cv-23306-DSL   Document 53   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/22/2024   Page 16 of 2417 \n Mazile, in her response to this Moti on, wants this Court to accept that it is a “ reasonable \ninference that ExamSoft had received, individually, at least one such complaint prior to May of \n2020” and would like to prove  this allegation through discovery.  [ECF No. 36 at 16 n.6].  \nHowever, “a P laintiff may not amend a complaint via a response to a motion to dismiss. ”  Guerrero \nv. Target Corp., 889 F. Supp. 2d 1348, 1356 n.6 (S.D. Fla. 2012) .  To find, based on her Amended \nComplaint, that there was at least one complaint to ExamSoft about its software would be to read extratextual facts into the record to cure the Amended Complaint’s deficiencies.  This Court will \nnot do so. \nEven assuming the ExamSoft software had a discriminatory effect on Mazile, the Amended \nComplaint alleges no facts that would give rise to even a reasonable inference that Larkin discriminated against Plaintiff because of her disability.  Beyond the Senators’ letter to ExamSoft, \nMazile alleges neit her a separate source of knowledge of ExamSoft’s discriminatory effect nor any \nfacts that would allow this Court to infer that Larkin engaged in purposeful discrimination against \nher.  Mazile’s assertion that Larkin “discriminated against Plaintiff because  of her ADHD and \nanxiety” is merely a legal conclusion unsupported by any facts in the ADA Complaint, and \ntherefore is insufficient for this Court to find that the third prong of the test to state a claim for \nADA discrimination has been met.  [Compl. ¶ 51] . \nThus, the facts that Mazile has  presented, taken as true, cannot amount to a finding that \nLarkin discriminated against Plaintiff because of  her disability .  Count II is  therefore  DISMISSED \nwithout prejudice .  \nCount II I – ADA Failure to Accommodate  \nNext, Mazile alleges  that Larkin “refused to provide reasonable accommodation to \nPlaintiff, with respect to her renumeration exam.”  [Compl. ¶ 59].  Plaintiff, however, fails to Case 1:23-cv-23306-DSL   Document 53   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/22/2024   Page 17 of 2420 \n because other courts have required a plaintiff to plead the demand , this Court finds that failing to \nplead this essential element of an ADA accommodation claim is grounds for dismissal.4  See \nGaston v. Bellingrath Gardens & Home, Inc., 167 F.3d 1361, 1363 (11th Cir. 1999) (holding that \na plaintiff cannot establish a failu re to accommodation claim without showing he or she demanded \nsuch an accommodation) ; see also D'Onofrio v. Costco Wholesale Corp., 964 F.3d 1014, 1022 \n(11th Cir. 2020).  \nPlaintiff does not allege anywhere that she requested an y accommodation from Larkin, so \nher pleading fails to allege an essential element of ADA failure- to-accommodate claims .  \nTherefore, t his count is DISMISSED without prejudice . \nCount VII – Violation of the Rehabilitation Act  \nFinally, Larkin seeks to dismiss Count VII on grounds that it does not receive federal \nfinancial assistance “as a whole,” because the PPP funds it received were restricted to use for \nparticular purposes.  [ECF No. 24 at 12- 13].  Larkin, however, does not discuss whether the \nPlaintiff’s Amended Complaint sufficiently alleges discrimination under the Rehabilitation Act, despite their argument to dismiss the ADA discrimination claim for failure to state a claim under \nthe exact same standard.   Therefore, this Court will  first analyze whether Larkin is subject to the \nRA based on its receipt of federal PPP funds , and then discuss whether Plaintiff stated a viable \nclaim under the RA.  \n \n4 Plaintiff claims that it must allege only that “reasonable accommodations were available” \nand the defendant “has the burden of persuasion on whether an accommodation would impose an \nundue hardship.”  [ECF No. 36 at 17 (citing Gary v. Ga. Dept. of Human Res., 206 Fed. Appx. 849 (11th Cir. 2006)) ].  Despite the presence of some helpful language for Plaintiff, Gary  does not \nsay that a Plaintiff need only allege that reasonable accommodations “ were available. ”  Rather, \nGary  dealt with an appeal from a district court’s grant of summary judgment and therefore does \nnot discuss  the requirements to adequately plead a claim of ADA failure to accommodate.  Gary , \n206 Fed. Appx. a t 852.  Further, Gary  is necessarily qualified by every other case in the Eleventh \nCircuit which follows it – cases which the Plaintiff conspicuously fails to discuss.\n Case 1:23-cv-23306-DSL   Document 53   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/22/2024   Page 20 of 2421 \n  Is Larkin a “Program or Activity” that Receives “Federal Financial Assistance?” \n Under the  RA, “No otherwise qualified individual with a disability in the United States ... \nshall, solely by reason of her or his disability, be excluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or ac tivity receiving Federal \nfinancial assistance.”  J.A.M. v. Nova Se. Univ., Inc., 646 F. App'x 921, 926 (11th Cir. 2016) (emphasis omitted ) (citing 29 U.S.C. § 794(a)).  “Program or activity” is defined, in relevant part, \nby the R A as  \n[A]ll of the operatio ns of an entire corporation, partnership, or other private organization, \nor an entire sole proprietorship— \n \n(i) if assistance is extended to such corporation, partnership, private organization, or sole proprietorship as a whole; or \n(ii) which is principally engaged in the business of providing education, health care, housing, social services, or parks and recreation \n  \n29 U.S.C. § 794(a)(3)(A)(i)- (ii).   \nThe parties devote substantial space in their arguments to whether Larkin, by accepting \nPPP fun ds, accepted this Federal financial assistance “as a whole” under § 794(a)(3)(A)(i).\n5  \nDefendant relies heavily on Ariza v. S. Moon Sales, Inc. for the proposition that acceptance of \n \n5 The United States Senate Report of the RA explained the meaning of Federal Financial \nAssistance extended to  an entity “as a whole:”  \n Federal financial assistance extended to a corporation or other entity “as a whole” refers to situations where the corporation receives general assistance that is not designated for a particular purpose. Federal financial assistan ce to the Chrysler Company for the purpose \nof preventing the company from going bankrupt would be an example of assistance to a corporation “as a whole.” Federal aid which is limited in purpose, e.g., Job Training Partnership Act (JPTA) [sic] funds, is not  considered aid to the corporation as a whole, \neven if it is used at several facilities and the corporation has discretion to determine which of its facilities participates in the program. A grant to a religious organization to enable it to extend assistan ce to refugees would not be assistance to the religious organization as a \nwhole if that is only one among a number of activities of the organization.   \n S. REP. 100-64 at *17 (1987).\n Case 1:23-cv-23306-DSL   Document 53   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/22/2024   Page 21 of 2422 \n federal funds via the Paycheck Protection Program is insufficient to show that a Defendant \nreceived federal financial assistance “as a whole,” as required by 29 U.S.C. § 794(b)(3)(A)(i).  No. 1:21- CV-23604, 2022 WL 4345136, at *4 (S.D. Fla. Sept. 7, 2022), report and recommendation \nadopted, No. 21- 23604- CIV, 2022 WL 4310972 (S .D. Fla. Sept. 19, 2022).  Ariza  depended  on \nthe Senate Report to inform its understanding of the definition of “federal financial assistance extended to such corporation . . . as a whole.”   Similarly, Plaintiff relies on Fernandez v. Bruno \nNorthfleet, Inc . to argue that any doubt which the Court has as to whether PPP funds are “Federal \nfinancial assistance” should be determined based on evidence from discovery.  568 F. Supp. 3d 1294, 1300 (S.D. Fla. 2021) (denying a motion to dismiss a claim under the RA because whether PPP loans are sufficient for purposes of Section 504 is a question better addressed through discovery) . \nThe parties’  arguments and § 794(b)(3)(A)(i), however, are irrelevant to the dispute at \nhand.  Ariza  focused on the phrase “as a whole” in § 794(b)(3)(A)(i) because the Defendant there \nwas a “corporation that owns and operates a retail apparel and accessory store[,] and therefore fell under § 794(b)(3)(A)(i) , not § 794(b)(3)(A)(i i).  2022 WL 4345136, at *4.  Likewise, in Fernandez , \nDefendant was a “corporation that owns and operates retail stores selling bracelets, handbags, shoes, and jewelry [.]” 568 F. Supp. 3d at  1298.  Larkin, however, is a private university that \nprovides Doctoral Pharmaceutical degrees, and thus is not subject to § 794(b)(3)(A)(i ), but rather \nfalls under § 794(b)(3)(A) (ii).  [Compl. ¶ 11].  \n  The parties ignore § 794(b)(3)(A)(i i), which clearly extends the definition of “program \nactivity” to any private organization “w hich is principally engaged in the business of provi ding \neducation [.]”  29 U.S.C. § 794(b)(3)(A)(i i).  Therefore, the limitation under subsection (i) that \nFederal financial assistance must be extended to the organization “as a whole” does not apply to Case 1:23-cv-23306-DSL   Document 53   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/22/2024   Page 22 of 2423 \n those organizations which are considered “programs or ac tivities” under subsection (ii).  Larkin is \na private university which is in the business of providing education, and thus, whether Larkin uses \nfederal financial assistance “as a whole,” or not has no bearing on whether its receipt of PPP funds subject s it to the RA.  The Senate Report only discusses Federal financial assistance extended “as \na whole” and thus, even if this Court were open to considering legislative history, it would not apply here.   \n Next, this Court must determine whether the PPP loans to Larkin should be considered \n“Federal financial assistance” under § 794(a), based on the ordinary and plain meaning of the term.  PPP loans “provide[d] small businesses with funds to pay up to 8 weeks of payroll costs including benefits” during the COVID -19 crisis and were “fully forgiven when used for payroll costs, interest \non mortgages, rent, and utilities[.]”  Small Business Paycheck Protection Program, U.S. Department of Treasury, available at https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/PPP%20--%20Overview.pdf  (accessed July 2, 2024).  In effect, PPP funds were transfers from the federal \ntreasury to businesses to assist with the severe economic fallout  resulting  from  the COVID- 19 \ncrisis.  Based on an ordinary reading of “Federal financial assistance,” money given from the Federal government to help organizations weather the economic fallout of the pandemic certainly constitutes “Federal financial assistance.”  Therefo re, Larkin is a “program or activity” that \nreceived “Federal financial assistance” and is subject to the R A.   \nHaving determined that  Larkin is subject to the RA, the Plaintiff still must state a claim \nunder the Act to survive this Motion to Dismiss.  \n Does Plaintiff State a Discrimination Claim Under the Rehabilitation Act?  \n The standard to state a discrimination claim under the RA  is the same used for ADA \ndiscrimination: to establish a prima facie case, “the plaintiff must demonstrate that [s]he (1) is Case 1:23-cv-23306-DSL   Document 53   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/22/2024   Page 23 of 2424 \n \ndisabled, (2) is a qualified individual, and (3) was subjected to unlawful discrimination because of \n[her] disability.”  J.A.M., 646 F. App’x at 926; Doe v. Univ. of Miami , 446 F. Supp. 3d 1000, 1010 \n(S.D. Fla. 2020) .  \nBecause the standard for claims brought  under ADA discrimination and RA  discrimination \nare identical , this Court relies on its analysis in for Count II  and determines that Mazile has pleaded \ninsufficient facts to show that Larkin discriminated against her because of  her disabilities, even \nwhen taking all facts in the Amended Complaint as true.  Therefore, Count VII is  DISMISSED  \nwithout prejudice . \nIV. CONCLUSION \nFor the reasons stated above, it is ORDERED AND ADJUDGED Defendants’ Motion to \nCompel Arbitration or, in the Alternative, Motion to Dismiss Amended Complaint [ ECF No. 34] \nis GRANTED.    \nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Counts IV, V, and VI against Defendant ExamSoft \nmust be heard in binding arbitration.  Arbitration of these three counts is compelled.    \nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Count I is D ISMISSED with prejudice, and Counts II, \nIII, and VII are DISMISSED without prejudice.

    "summary": "1. **Summary:**\n   Plaintiff Thierry Rignol, an MBA student at Yale School of Management, used generative AI in violation of exam rules, leading to an investigation by the Honor Committee. Despite Rignol's denial and failure to cooperate by not providing requested documents, the Committee found that he had used AI and imposed a penalty of an \"F\" and a one-year suspension. Rignol sought a preliminary injunction to avoid irreparable harm from suspension and to continue his studies, but the court denied the motion due to a lack of evidence of such harm.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue:**\n   The central legal issue is whether Rignol demonstrated a likelihood of irreparable harm that justifies a preliminary injunction against the disciplinary actions imposed by Yale University.\n\n3. **Court's Holding:**\n   The court held that Rignol failed to demonstrate irreparable harm that would justify granting a preliminary injunction. Consequently, his motion for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction was denied.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation:**\n   Imagine you broke your school's rules during an important test by using a robot to get answers — you weren't supposed to do that! When the school found out, they told you that you would have to leave school for a year and get a failing grade for that test. You asked a judge to let you stay in school and not have a failing grade right away, while your fight with the school happened in court. But the judge said \"no\" because you didn't prove that being out of school would harm you in a way that couldn’t be fixed later.",

After a teaching assistant flagged one of his exams in the spring of 2024, SOM \nadministrators conducted an investigation to determine whether Rignol violated examination \nrules by using generative artificial intelligence (“AI”). In the course of its investigation, \nSOM  determined  that Rignol  was not forthcoming during the investigation and did use AI ; \nSOM penalized Rignol by issuing him an F in the course and suspending him from classes \nfor one year.  \nRignol subsequently sought  a preliminary injunction that would reinstate him as a \nstudent in good standing at SOM such that he could graduate with his classmates in the class \nof 2025 this spring. Because I conclude that Rignol has failed to make the threshold showing of irreparable harm, I deny Rignol’s motion for a preliminary injunction.

The C ommittee chair conducts an \ninitial review to determine if the offense “would be of sufficient seriousness to warrant the \nattention of the committee.” If the chair determines the conduct is sufficiently serious, they \nmust notify the student and advise the student of how the Honor Committee will conduct its \ninvestigation. Id.  at 9, 10. The Bulletin requires the following be communicated to the \nstudent:  \n[T]he student will be directed to review the Committee Policies and Procedures \nto apprise the student of the rights:  (a) to appear before the committee, (b) to be \naccompanied by any member of the university community to act as the student’s adviser,\n2 (c) to examine any and all written materials being provided to the \ncommittee as soon as possible, and ordinarily at least forty- eight hours in \nadvance of the meeting, so that the student may have ample opportunity to \nquestion or refute them.  \nId. at 9.  The Honor Committee will notify the student of the membership of the C ommittee \nso that the student may request recusals of members the student believes to be “ prejudiced ” \nagainst them. Id.  at 11. The chair may accept or refuse a student’s request to recuse a \nCommittee member.

First, a student may meet with the dean responsible for \noverseeing their academic program to lodge  complaints regarding “procedural irregularity or \nprejudice.” The dean must  then “investigate the objection and may remand the matter to the \ncommittee to correct the procedural irregularity or to re -deliberate after disqualifying the \nmember or members found to be prejudiced.” Id.

Until now, Wendy and Dean Scully have told me that this matter \nhas not been formally referred to the Honor Committee. Further, I was told that \nyou had already received a copy of the submitted exam. I am of course happy \nto comply with the SOM policies at all times.  \nId. Choi responded:  \nThe first step in the process is for the chair of the Honor Committee to make a \ndetermination of whether the case will proceed to the Honor Committee. This \ncan involve some gathering of evidence. That is where we are right now. I have \nthe PDF file that you submitted. I am asking you to send us the Word file from \nwhich the PDF was produced. You seem to be weighing whether you will \ncooperate or not. It’s your choice, but if history is a guide, failure to cooperate \nwould be viewed by the Honor Committee as an extraordinary violation of the \nHonor Code.  \nId. Later that same day, Choi wrote to Rignol to inform Rignol that he had expanded his \ninvestigation to consider “deliverables you submitted for other courses.”  Defs.’ Ex. R , ECF \nNo. 41- 19.

Id.  Case 3:25-cv-00159-SFR     Document 89     Filed 05/05/25     Page 7 of 268 After this initial investigation, Choi referred Rignol to the full Honor Committee. Id. ¶ \n15. Choi relied in part on the many similarities between Rignol’s answers to exam questions \nand those produced when Choi submitted exam questions to ChatGPT. Id.  Choi felt that \nRignol’s refusal to provide requested documents provided further grounds to suspect Rignol \ncheated on the exams. Id. \nTsung wrote to Rignol on September 8, 2024, notifying him that Choi had referred an \ninquiry to the full Honor Committee. Defs.’ Ex. W at 2- 3, ECF No. 41- 24. Tsung noted that \nthe Committee would investigate whether Rignol “improperly utilized AI on the final exam \nin the course.” Id. at 3.  Tsung told Rignol that he was required to attend a meeting with the \nHonor Committee, directed  Rignol to consult the  Bulletin for a description of how the \nCommittee would conduct its activities, and shared a link for where Rignol could find a \ndirectory of Committee members should he decide to seek recusals.

Tsung asked that, if Rignol sought to provide a written response, Case 3:25-cv-00159-SFR     Document 89     Filed 05/05/25     Page 8 of 269 that he share it with her by October 30 so that she could distribute it to the entire C ommittee. \nId. \nRignol sought recusals beginning on November 3, 2024. In a message copying one of \nhis attorneys, he requested that Scully —the former dean of students and an ex officio  \nmember of the Committee —be recused from participation. Defs.’ Ex. Y. Choi granted this \nrequest. Choi Aff. ¶ 19.

Defs.’ Ex. Z, ECF No. 41- 27. Choi responded, noting that Tsung and Scully disputed Rignol’s recollection of \ntheir meeting , and reiterating that the Committee would follow the procedures described in \nthe Bulletin . Choi informed Rignol that the only proper grounds for seeking recusal was if a \nCommittee member “would be prejudiced in your case.” Id. On  November 5, after Rignol \nasked to recuse every member of the Committee who had reviewed evidence in his case or \nhad participated in the initial review of evidence, Choi declined, saying he felt the  recusal \nrequests  were “baseless .” Given the evidence had been shared with C ommittee members in \nadvance of the hearing that was occurring in three  days , Rignol’s requests would have \nrequired recusing the entire Committee and its chair. Choi Aff. ¶ 19.  \nThe Honor Committee met to consider Rignol’s conduct on November 8, 2024. Id. ¶ \n20. Notwithstanding Tsung’s instruction that Rignol submit any written materials by October \n30, Defs.’ Ex.

At the hearing, Rignol continued to deny that he had used AI \non his exam. Id.  Rignol told Committee members that he had ignored Choi’s emails Case 3:25-cv-00159-SFR     Document 89     Filed 05/05/25     Page 9 of 2610 requesting Microsoft Word copies of his exams because he had written  the exam in Apple \nPages , not Word.

Tsung Aff . ¶ 14. \nRignol produced this document while the Committee was still meeting.  Id. Rignol also \nrequested to be excused from attending class that afternoon. Compl. ¶ 109.  \nAfter Rignol left  the hearing , the Honor Committee began deliberating. Choi says that \nhe and other Honor Committee members found Rignol’s responses to their questions at the hearing  “incredible .” Choi Aff . ¶ 22. In particular, Choi says: “ The Honor Committee was \nstunned by [Rignol ’s] disruptive action of ignoring the request to submit any documents he \nwished us to consider at least twenty-four hours before the meeting, his prior failure to produce the electronic files requested, and his incredible explanation for why he had not \ndone so. It concluded that [Rignol’s] actions were unprecedented.”  Id. ¶ 24. As the \nCommittee deliberated, Choi reviewed the Pages file that Rignol had shared and researched \nwhether the file contained its editing history. Id.  ¶ 25. Choi determined that Pages does not \ntransmit the editing history of a file when the file is shared via email, but that the editing history would be available on the hard drive of the computer used to write the exam. Id.  In \nlight of this, approximately 90 minutes after Rignol had left the hearing , Tsung called Rignol \nto ask that he return with his laptop. Id. ¶ 26.

Choi Aff. ¶ 28. The \ndecision was “based largely on [Rignol’s]  unprecedented refusal to produce the documents it \nhad requested—a decision that . . . the Committee concluded had no justification —and his \nrefusal to return to the Committee.” Id.  It did not reach the issue of whether Rignol had \nindeed used AI on his Sourcing and Managing Funds exam because it determined that \nRignol’s “decision to not be forthcoming had become the primary issue.” Id. ¶ 29.

Tsung \nresponded:  \nI don’t know when the faculty will be meeting this week but like I said, they do \nplan to meet and your grade should be updated next week.

See Defs.’ Ex. \nDD, ECF No. 41- 31. Rignol asserted that he had been forthcoming. Id. at 5. In addition, \nrelying in part on an email from Tsung where she disclosed that there had been only one \nother student penalized in the past three years for not being forthcoming, and this penalty \nwas in connection with a determination that the student had falsified attendance records , \nRignol asserted that his discipline was the first instance where the Honor Committee had \nissued a standalone penalty for not being forthcoming without addressing the merits of the \nunderlying charge . Id. Rignol asserted that “not being forthcoming” has “always been an \nenhancement factor in sentencing, not a basis for the punishment in and of itself.” Id. at 4. He \nmaintained that the penalty in the case “incentivizes students to falsely confess in order to \nreceive a reduced penalty.” Id. at 5.  \nDeputy Dean Jain wrote to Rignol on November 19, 2024, to inform Rignol that the \nFaculty Review Board had denied Rignol’s appeal.

Rignol was not invited to appear again before the Honor Committee. See  Rignol \nDecl. ¶ 24 , Feb. 25, 2025. In this second meeting, the Honor Committee determined that Rignol Case 3:25-cv-00159-SFR     Document 89     Filed 05/05/25     Page 12 of 2613 had violated examination rules by using AI. Choi Aff. ¶ 31. Choi says the Honor Committee \nrelied on Rignol’s decision not to be forthcoming in reaching its decision that he used AI. In \nparticular, “[t]he Honor Committee felt that [Rignol’s]  refusal to provide the documents could \nonly be explained by [Rignol]  attempting to hide misconduct in light of the fact that the only \nalternative explanation [Rignol]  had offered (regarding his use of Pages instead of Mic rosoft \nWord ) was incredible.” Id. ¶ 33. In addition, in concluding that Rignol used AI, the Honor \nCommittee relied on the “strong similarities between [Rignol]’s response and the ChatGPT \nresponse to one of the Sourcing and Managing Funds exam questions.”  Id. ¶ 34. Choi says that \nthe Honor Committee did not rely on the ChatGPTZero scans produced by Rouwenhorst. Id. \n¶ 32. The Honor Committee reached this decision only with regard to Rignol’s exam in \nSourcing and Managing Funds. Although Choi and Committee members suspected Rignol may also have used AI in completing his exam in the Investor course, “it could not rule out t he \npossibility that the responses at issue were found via permissible Internet searches instead of \nimpermissible AI generation.” Id. ¶ 35. The Honor Committee determined that an appropriate \npenalty would be a mandatory “F” grade in Sourcing and Managing Funds. Id.  ¶ 31. \nRignol appea led this penalty to the Faculty Review Board on December 2, 2024. \nDefs.’ Ex. CC, ECF No. 41- 30. In his appeal, he challenged the ability of the Faculty Review \nBoard to remand his case to the Honor Committee to reach a decision on whether he violated \nexam rules. Id. at 5. Jain responded on behalf of the Faculty Review Board on December 11, \n2024. Defs.’ Ex. GG, ECF No. 41- 34. Jain  informed Rignol that his appeal was denied and \naddressed Rignol’s contention that the Faculty Review Board exceeded its authority in the \nway it handled his firs t appe al. Id.  Jain noted:  Case 3:25-cv-00159-SFR     Document 89     Filed 05/05/25     Page 13 of 2614 Your appeal statement included the claim that the FRB “exceeded the scope of \nits authority” by directing the Honor Committee to continue deliberating and \n“issue findings regarding a new charge ” (emphasis added). I wish to point out \nthat this claim is entirely erroneous. My letter of November 19, 2024 made it \nclear that it was my decision as the cognizant dean, and not the FRB’s, to ask \nthe Honor Committee to continue deliberating the original c omplaint of \nviolation of exam rules, a complaint on which the Honor Committee did not \nreach a decision in its first hearing. This directive to the Honor Committee is \nfully within my authority and responsibility as the cognizant dean. Moreover, \nthis directive did not issue a new charge to the Honor Committee. The only \ncharge the Honor Committee considered in its continued deliberation, and \nissued a ruling on, was the original charge of violating the exam rules in MGT \n423E.  \nId.  \nTsung wrote to Rignol on December 12, 2024, to inform him of the terms of his \nsuspension. Defs.’ Ex. HH, ECF No. 41- 35. Tsung’s letter notes that Rignol ’s suspension \nbegan on November 20, 2024. Id.

Tsung informed Rignol that his “suspension will be noted on your transcript while you are on leave and will be removed at your request when you \nreturn.” Id. In closing, Tsung reminded Rignol of the courses he would need to complete in \norder to meet the requirements  for graduation. See id.   \nAt the time of his suspension in November 2024, Rignol had started but not \ncompleted two courses. These courses ended on January 10, 2025. Rignol was withdrawn \nfrom two other courses that started after his suspension began. These courses ended on \nFebruary 8, 2025.

As the standard for a TRO is \nidentical to that for a preliminary injunction , Kreger v. McCance, 537 F. Supp. 3d 234, 239 (D. \nConn. 2021) , my opinion addressi ng Rignol’s entitlement to a preliminary injunction also resolves \nwhether he is entitled to a TRO.  Case 3:25-cv-00159-SFR     Document 89     Filed 05/05/25     Page 16 of 2617 to their anticipated argument that the equities did not favor Rignol because he had in fact \ncheated on his exam . ECF No. 25. Rignol filed a response on March 12, 2025. ECF No. 45. \nAfter hearing argument, the C ourt7 granted in part the motion to compel  on March 19, 2025, \nand required compliance with the order by March 28, 2025. ECF No. 54. I permitted both \nparties to file any supplemental evidence relating to the preliminary injunction motion by \nApril 9, 2025. ECF No. 71. On April 9, 2025, Defendants fi led two supplemental exhibits \nthey assert demonstrate Rignol’s violation of examination rules. ECF Nos. 80, 81.  \nThe parties twice confirmed that they did not request an evidentiary hearing \nconcerning the preliminary injunction. On March 7, 2025, the parties submitted a joint notice \nof their availability for oral argument that stipulated they did not seek an evidenti ary hearing. \nECF No. 32. The parties reiterated that position in response to my questions at a pre -hearing \nstatus conference on April 3, 2025. ECF No. 61. After setting  oral argument for April 7, \n2025, I postponed argument at the request of the parties so they could explore settlement. \nECF No s. 67, 78.8 The parties did not settle, so I heard oral argument on April 11, 2025. ECF \nNo. 83.9  \n \n7 The Honorable Thomas Farrish, United States Magistrate Judge, decided the motion to compel  \non an expedited basis . See ECF No. 26, Order of Referral. I thank Judge Farrish for his prompt \ndecision.  \n8 Settlement talks were convened by the Honorable Robert Spector, United States Magistrate \nJudge. I offer my thanks to  Judge Spector for his efforts  to mediate this dispute, as well as to the \nparties for attempting in good faith to resolve their differences . As I noted at oral argument, the \ndecision to explore settlement has no bearing on how I decide the matter before me, nor do I know  \nwhat positions the parties may have taken during confidential settlement talks.  \n9 At oral argument, Rignol’ s counsel clarified that  his request for a preliminary injunction was \nlimited to his contractual claims. Tr. 15:5- 7, ECF No. 82. Case 3:25-cv-00159-SFR     Document 89     Filed 05/05/25     Page 17 of 2622 the merits of the case . Furthermore , I reject Rignol’s assertion that  a preliminary injunction is \nnecessary to prevent the damage to his professional reputation he says would occur if \ninvestors, business associates , or classmates  realized that  SOM determined he violated \nexamination rules . A preliminary injunction is not an exoneration, and it would not remedy \nthe fact that this lawsuit  describing Rignol’s disciplinary record  is public record .12  \nRignol’s remaining arguments are unavailing. Rignol says his aspirations to pursue \ngraduate studies at another institution will be frustrated during  the pendency of this litigation \nbecause no institution will accept an applicant whose transcript discloses academic misconduct . Here again Rignol errs in assuming that if he were granted a preliminary \ninjunction it necessarily follows that graduate schools would not learn of the disciplinary proceedings  described in these public filings. Nor has Rignol  articulate d any  concrete or \nimmediate plan to pursue graduate studies. Thus, the harms to his aspirations of postgraduate \nstudies are too speculative to entitle Rignol to a preliminary injunction . See  Doe v. Vassar \nColl., No. 19- cv-9601 (NSR), 2019 WL 6222918, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 21, 2019)  \n(“Plaintiff’s broad assertion that he will be harmed by having to explain his suspension to \nemployers or graduate schools is too speculative to warrant injunctive relief, since he has \nidentified no plans to attend any graduate school . . . .”).  Similarly, while Rignol asserts that \n \n12 In his Complaint, Rignol seeks a declaratory judgment declaring , inter alia, that the “sanction \nof a grade of ‘F’ and suspension for one year should be reversed,” his disciplinary  record expunged, \nand any “record of the proceeding regarding the conduct of Plaintiff  is to be permanently \ndestroyed.” Rignol’s entitlement to a declaratory judgment will await a final adjudication in the \ncase. Notably, Rignol’s attorneys insisted repeatedly that whether Rignol violated examination \nrules by using AI is not relevant to the merits of his claims. See, e.g., Reply 4- 5 (asserting that \n“whether Plaintiff used AI is not relevant here”).  Neither  Rignol’s Complai nt nor his request for a \npreliminary injunction seek to prevent Defendants from convening the Honor Committee again  to \nconsider Rignol’s  conduct using the procedural protections to which he says he was entitled and \ndenied.  Case 3:25-cv-00159-SFR     Document 89     Filed 05/05/25     Page 22 of 2623 the suspension will undermine  valuable  relationships he has cultivated  with his classmates in \nthe EMBA class of 2025 and cause him to forfeit the one -time honor of serving as class \nmarshal at graduation, I find that those harms— which broadly assert that SOM has \ndiminished the value of Rignol’s degree —are compensable with money damages.13 \nMontague , 2017 WL 4942772, at *3- 4 (holding that not graduating with one’s fellow \nclassmates was a harm compensable with money damages); see also Doe v. Vassar, 2019 \nWL 6222918, at * 6-7 (similar) . \n Finally, Rignol asserts that, “with immigration policies constantly shifting,” the \ninvestor visa that entitles him  to live and work in the United States could be revoked if \nimmigration officials learned that Rignol took three years to complete a two -year course of \nstudy because of a finding of academic misconduct. Pl.’s  Mem. 13. I agree with Defendants \nthat any immigration consequences of Rignol’s suspension are too speculative to entitle him \nto a preliminary injunction. The lawsuit has publicly  disclosed Rignol’s disciplinary record. \nA preliminary injunction requiring Defendants to accommodate Rignol’s  graduation this \nspring would not exonerate Rignol nor prevent public disclosure of his discipline.  \n \n13 At oral argument, Defendants further asserted that, should Rignol return to SOM following his \nsuspension, he is eligible to compete with members of the class of 2026 for the honor of being \nclass marshal . Tr. 60:11 -14. This further supports my finding that forfeiting the honor of being \nclass marshal at graduation in spring 2025 is not an irreparable harm.  Moreover , Rignol’s claim \nthat he would be class marshal if I were to order  Defendants to reinstate him  and remove the F \ngrade for the Sourcing and Managing Funds  course  is speculative. The class marshal honor is \nawarded based on grades received for  certain first year classes, including Sourcing and Managing \nFunds . Tsung Aff. ¶ 35; Rignol  Decl. ¶ 8, Feb. 25, 2025. I do not know what grade  Rignol would \nreceive in the course were his exam  to be graded by his professors , and thus do not  know whether \nRignol  would indeed be entitled to the class marshal honor should he  otherwise manage to satisfy  \nthe requirements for graduation. Id.  Case 3:25-cv-00159-SFR     Document 89     Filed 05/05/25     Page 23 of 2624 I therefore conclude that R ignol has not met his burden of establishing he would be \nirreparably harmed absent a preliminary injunction.  \nB. Equities  \nSince I have concluded that Rignol has failed to show irreparable harm, I need not \nconsider  the other requirements  for issuing a preliminary injunction . Inkel v. Connecticut , \nNo. 3:17 -cv-1400 (MPS), 2019 WL 1230358, at *10 (D. Conn. Mar. 15, 2019) (stating that \nwhere “a plaintiff does not establish irreparable harm, the court need not address the other \nfactors necessary for the issuance of injunctive relief”) (internal quotation marks omit ted). \nHowever, I observe that the balance of equities  does not favor Rignol . \n“Courts ‘must balance the competing claims of injury and must consider the effect on \neach party of the granting or withholding of the re quested relief. ’” Winter , 555 U.S. at 24 \n(quoting Amoco Prod. Co . v. Gam bell, 480 U.S. 531, 542 (1987)). I understand that Rignol \nhas been under considerable stress since he was first accused of academic misconduct, and \nthat he has much to lose from delaying graduation. And I acknowledge Rignol’s apparent \nreadiness to complete all the assignments he has missed in order to graduate with his peers this spring. Rignol  Supp. Decl. ¶¶ 10 -11, Feb. 28, 2025, ECF No. 24. But at the same time, \nan injunction requiring Defendants to permit Rignol to graduate this spring would require \nDefendants to “fundamentally alter the Program.” Tsung Aff. ¶ 32.  \nThe parties dispute whether granting an injunction would entail significant hardship \nto Defendants. Rignol maintains this is an insignificant burden. See Tr. 47:4 -6 (“We’re \ntalking about watching some videos and maybe doing a couple of assignments to make up \nfor some lectures that weren ’t recorded.”). But I find Defendants’ description of the manner \nin which the EMBA program would need to be modified, as well as the hardships faced by Case 3:25-cv-00159-SFR     Document 89     Filed 05/05/25     Page 24 of 2625 administrators and instructors, far more persuasive than Rignol’s assertion that he could \nsubstitute five months of missed graduate instruction for recorded class lectures and make -up \nessays. Tsung explains that “attendance, participation, and group work through Learning \nTeams and otherwise  are core components of the Program” and “[c]lass participation  and \ngroup work are commonly components of student grades.” Tsung Aff. ¶ 31. Tsung observes \nthat adding Rignol to classes underwa y or not even being offered would “dilute the rigor of \nthe classes and require the diversion of substantial time and energy by professors and, with \nrespect to ongoing classes, other students away from their current endeavors.” Id. ¶ 32. I \ncredit Defendants’ assertion that an injunction would place an extraordinary burden on \nRignol’s professors and teaching assistants, who would be responsible for devoting a \nsubstantial amount of time to helping Rignol remediate coursework in classes he has missed.  \nThese hardships were only exacerbated by Rignol’s decision to wait until February \n25, 2025— more than three  months after his suspension began and more than two months \nafter his final appeal to administrators was denied —to apply for injunctive relief . Rignol \nretained counsel as early as September 9, 2024, when he copied several attorneys, one of whom has noticed an appearance in this case, in an email to Tsung and Choi. Defs.’ Ex. W at \n2. Counsel explained at oral argument that the delay is attributable in part to several medical \nemergencies faced by members of Rignol’s legal team. Tr. 81:5- 11. But while  I appreciate \nthat no one can control such occurrences , I cannot ignore the fact that the difficulty of \naccommodating Rignol’s request for an injunction is far higher now than it would have been \nhad Rignol moved for an injunction in December 2024. Indeed, even had I issued an \ninjunction the  day that  Rignol made his request  (and without affording the parties the \nbriefing and argument that they requested ), the balance of equities  would still have favored  Case 3:25-cv-00159-SFR     Document 89     Filed 05/05/25     Page 25 of 2626 Defendants. By February 25, 2025, Rign ol had already missed  four courses entirely  (which \nended in January and February 2025) and  had missed sessions of five  more courses \nunderway . Tsung Aff. ¶¶ 20-26 & Ex. 3. Thus even on that earlier date , accommodating \nRignol would have imposed a substantial hardship on Defendants.  \nI therefore conclude that the equities do not favor an injunction. \nIV. CONCLUSION  \nFor the foregoing reasons, Rignol’s application for a temporary restraining order and \npreliminary injunction , ECF No. 16, is DENIED.  \nThe parties shall confer and submit a Rule 26(f) report describing case management \ndeadlines for the remainder of this action on or before May 19, 2025. \nSO ORDERED.  \n \n \nBridgeport , Connecticut \nMay 5, 2025  \n/s/Sarah F.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: This case involves W.A., a student with a specific learning disability, and his parents who claimed that the Clarksville/Montgomery County School System (CMCSS) failed to provide a free appropriate public education (FAPE) under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). The court upheld an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) decision that CMCSS did not adequately address W.A.'s reading and writing difficulties, particularly his dyslexia, by focusing on fluency and expression rather than foundational reading skills. The ALJ awarded compensatory dyslexia-specific tutoring, which the court orders must be implemented promptly.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether CMCSS failed to provide W.A. with a FAPE as required by IDEA by not adequately addressing his specific learning needs related to dyslexia.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court affirmed that CMCSS denied W.A. a FAPE by failing to focus on his basic reading skill deficits and ordered 888 hours of compensatory dyslexia-specific education. However, it declined to mandate a specific vendor for the tutoring, as long as the education meets the necessary requirements.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: A student named W.A. was not learning how to read because his school was not giving him the right kind of help he needed. Even though they knew he was struggling, his teachers only helped with some parts of reading that weren’t the real problem. The judge decided that the school must now give W.A. a lot of extra special lessons that focus on the parts of reading he struggles with.",

The  IDEA and the Say Dyslexia Act  \nThe Individuals with Disabilities Education Act ( “IDEA ”), 20 U.S.C. § 1400 et seq. , \n“offers federal funds to States in exchange for a commitment: to furnish a ‘ free appropriate public \neducation ’—more concisely known as a FAPE —to all children with certain physic al or intellectual \ndisabilities. ” Fry v. Napoleon Cmty. Sch., 137 S. Ct. 743, 748 (2017)  (citing 20 U.S.C. §§ \n1401(3)(A)(i),  1412(a)(1)(A)) . “[T]he IDEA gives the ‘ primary responsibility . . .  for choosing the \neducational method most suitable to the child ’s needs  . . . to state and local educational agencies ”—\ncommonly referred to as “ SEAs ” and “LEAs ”—which work  “in cooperation with the parents or \nguardian of the child.”  Long v. Dawson Springs Indep. Sch. Dist., 197 F. App’ x 427, 433–34 (6th \nCir. 2006)  (quoting Bd. of Ed uc. of Hendrick Hudson Cent . Sch. Dist. v. Rowley , 458 U.S. 176, \n207 (1982) ).  \nThe IDEA defines “ FAPE ” to include “both ‘special education ’ and ‘related services. ’ \n‘Special education ’ is ‘specially designed instruction . . . to meet the unique needs of a child with \na disability ’; ‘related services ’ are the support services ‘ required to assist a child  . . . to benefit \nfrom ’ that instruction. ” Endrew F. ex rel. Joseph F. v. Douglas Cty. Sch. Dist. RE -1, 580 U.S. 386, \n390 (2017)  (quoting 20 U.S.C. § 1401(9) , (26), (29)) . Special education and related services must \nmeet four  general  requirements before they can be said to qualify as  providing a child with  a FAPE. \nSee 20 U.S.C. § 1401(9) . The first three of those requirements are that the education and services \n“must be provided at public expense, must meet the State ’s educational standards, [and] must \napproximate the grade levels used in the State ’s regular education.”  Rowley , 458 U.S. a t 203. The \nfourth requirement —identified by the Supreme Court as the “ centerpiece of the statute’ s education \ndelivery system for disabled children,”  Honig v. Doe , 484 U.S. 305, 311 (1988) —is that the child ’s \nCase 3:23-cv-00912     Document 27     Filed 05/24/24     Page 2 of 30 PageID #: <pageID>3 \n education must be “ provided in conformity with t he individualized education program  [‘IEP’]” \nresponsive to that child’s disability and circumstances. 20 U.S.C. §§ 1401(9) (D), 1414(d) . The IEP \nrequirement provides  “the means by which special education and related services are ‘ tailored to \nthe unique needs ’ of [that]  particular child. ” Endrew F. , 580 U.S. at 391 (quoting Rowley, 458 U.S. \nat 181).  \nThat IEP requirement, with its focus on individualization, recognizes  that what constitutes  \na FAPE may vary from child to child. The other FAPE requir ements, however, leave room for \nanother type of variation—based not solely on the needs of the child at issue , but also on the policy \nbaseline set by the relevant state’s educational system . The Sixth Circuit has held that, because the \nIDEA requires a FAPE to meet state educational standard s, a school district that otherwise  \n“complies with federal law, . . .  may still violate the [ IDEA]  if it fails to satisfy more extensive \nstate protections that may also be in place. ” Doe ex rel.  Doe v. Bd. of Educ. of Tullahoma City \nSch., 9 F.3d 455, 457 (6th Cir. 1993)  (quoting Thomas v. Cincinnati Bd. of Educ., 918 F.2d 618, \n620 (6th Cir. 1990);  citing  David D. v. Dartmouth Sch. Comm., 775 F.2d 411, 417 (1st Cir. 1985) ; \nGeis v. Board of Educ. of Parsippany -Troy Hills , 774 F.2d 575, 581 (3r d Cir. 1985) ). For example, \nTennessee has enacted specific legislation , the Special Education Behavioral Supports Act \n(“SEBSA”), Tenn. Code Ann. § 49 -10-1301 to - 1307, to govern  the use of restraints and isolation \nin the special education setting. Based on the IDEA’s assimilation of state standards, federal  courts \nhave held that a violation of SEBSA can also give rise to a violation of the IDEA. See, e.g., I.L. ex \nrel. Taylor v. Knox Cty. Bd. of Educ.,  257 F. Supp. 3d 946, 964 (E.D. Tenn. 2017) ; accord J.M. ex \nrel. Mata v. Tennessee Dep ’t of Educ ., 358 F. Supp. 3d 736, 744–47 (M.D. Tenn. 2018) . \nIn 2016, the Tenness ee General Assembly enacted, and the Governor signed, a piece of \nlegislation sometimes referred to as the “ Say Dyslexia Act ,” 2016 Tenn. Pub. Laws  ch. 1058 (S.B. \nCase 3:23-cv-00912     Document 27     Filed 05/24/24     Page 3 of 30 PageID #: <pageID>4 \n 2635) , codified, as amended, Tenn. Code Ann. § 49- 1-229. The Say Dyslexia Act directs the \nTennessee Department of Education ( “TDOE ”) to “ develop procedures for identifying \ncharacteristics of dyslexia through the universal screening process required by”  the state’ s \npreexisting “Response to Instruction and Intervention ” framework, which is often referred to as \n“RTI2.” Tenn. Code Ann. § 49- 1-229(a), (f)(2). “RTI2 is an ‘ academic three- tiered framework ’” \nthat calls on educators  “to intervene when students first start to struggle and to subsequently \naddress deficits in student learning so that students can avoid prolonged academic difficulties.”  \nMatthew B. ex rel. G.F. v. Clarksville Montgomery  Cnty. Sch. Sys., No. 3:22 -CV-00675, 2023 WL \n4633905, at *13 n.18 (M.D. Tenn. July 19, 2023)  (quoting TDOE materials) . The RTI2 framework \nis intended to assist any students in need of intervention, including students receiving a general \neducation who do not have any IDEA -covered disability. See Tenn. Code Ann. § 49- 6-311.  \nThe dyslexia screening required  by the Say Dyslexia Act is  mandatory for all Tennessee \nLEAs. Tenn. Code Ann. § 49- 1-229(a)(3).  If a student is found, by that process, to have \n“characteristics of dyslexia, ” then the LEA must:  \n(1) Notify the student ’s parent or legal guardian;  \n \n(2) Provide the student ’s parent or legal guardian with information and resource \nmaterial regarding dyslexia;  \n \n(3) Provide the student with appropriate tiered dyslexia -specific intervention \nthrough its RTI2 framework; and  \n \n(4) Monitor the student ’s progress using a tool designed to measure the \neffectiveness of the intervention. \n \nTenn. Code Ann. § 49- 1-229(c). The Act defines “ dyslexia -specific intervention”  as follows:  \n“Dyslexia -specific intervention ” means evidence- based, specialized reading, \nwriting, and spelling instruction tha t is multisensory in nature, equipping students \nto simultaneously use multiple senses, such as vision, hearing, touch, and \nmovement. Dyslexia -specific intervention employs direct instruction of systematic \nand cumulative content, with the sequence beginning with the easiest and most \nCase 3:23-cv-00912     Document 27     Filed 05/24/24     Page 4 of 30 PageID #: <pageID>5 \n basic elements and progress methodically to more difficult material. Each step must \nalso be based on those already learned. Components of dyslexia -specific \nintervention include instruction targeting phonological awareness, sound symbol association, syllable structure, morphology, syntax, and semantics  . . . .  \n \nTenn. Code Ann. § 49- 1-229(f)(1).  TDOE’s regulations implementing the Say Dyslexia Act \nrequire individualized, dyslexia -focused learning plans for students identified as dyslexic, but they \nexempt students with IEPs under the IDEA from that requirement. Tenn. Comp. R. & Regs. 0520-\n01-22-.02(f). Neither the Act nor the regulations, however, expressly exempt IDEA -eligible \nstudents from any other aspect of the Say Dyslexia Act’s framework.  \nB. W.A.’ s Education  and IEPs  \n W.A. is a CMCS S student who was in 12th grade for the 2023–2024 school year. \n(Administrative Record ( “A.R. ”), Vol. 1 at 396.2) W.A. and his parents —E.A. and C.A.—moved \nto Clarksville around the time of the 2016–17 school year , when he was in fifth grade . (Id. at 381.)  \nCMCSS, as a school system covered by the IDEA, has an obligation to take appropriate steps to \nidentify students with disabilities pursuant to what is typically referred to as the IDEA ’s “child \nfind” obligation. See 20 U.S.C. § 1412(a)(3); Bd. of Educ . of Fayette Cnty., Ky. v. L.M., 478 F.3d \n307, 313 (6th Cir. 2007) . CMCSS ’s initial evaluation of W.A. showed  significant deficits in \nreading and writing, and W.A. was identified as having an IDEA -covered learning disability, \nalthough he was not identified specifically as being dyslexic or potentially so. (A.R., Vol. 1  at \n381.)  \nW.A.’s  2016–17 IEP identifie d his “Primary Disability ” as a “ Specific Learning \nDisability, ” with a “Secondary Disability ” of “Language Impairments. ” (A.R., Vol. 2 at 683.)  The \n \n2 Although each party disagrees with aspects of the ALJ’ s analysis and conclusions in this case, they mostly \naccept the ALJ ’s account of the foundational facts. The court will, therefore, cite the ALJ ’s findi ngs for \nsome background facts. The court ’s conclusions, however, are based on the administrative record as a \nwhole.  \nCase 3:23-cv-00912     Document 27     Filed 05/24/24     Page 5 of 30 PageID #: <pageID>6 \n IEP set language- related goals for W.A., granted him some accommodations (such as additional \ntime for test taking), and established that he was to receive ninety minutes of speech/language \ntherapy per week with a speech pathologist, as well as a combined s ix hours per week of \ninterventional instruction with a special education resource teacher, consisting of two hours devoted to “ Reading Intervention,”  two hours devoted to “ Writing Intervention,”  and two hours \ndevoted to “ Math Intervention.”  (Id. at 689–96.) At the time that the IEP was formulated, W.A. \nwas capable of writing about 40 words per minute in response to a writing prompt, with an average of 28 words spelled correctly. The average fifth grader, according to the IEP, could write about 51 words per minute, spelling 48 correctly. ( Id. at 686.)  The IEP acknowledged that W.A. faced issues \nnot only with more advanced areas such as “Reading Fluency” and “Written Expression,” but also “Basic Reading Skills.” ( Id. at 684–85.)  \nW.A. ’s subsequent middle school  IEPs were  broadly similar  in terms of the services \nprovided, at least on their face. He continued to exhibit significant language deficits —for example, \ntesting in the 1st percentile of metrics measuring reading fluency and the 10th percentile for written. ( Id. at 70 4–05.) The IEPs ’ identifications of his deficits, however, began to omit any \nacknowledgment of a specific deficit related to basic reading skills, while continuing to note his deficits in fluency and comprehension. ( Id. at 703–10, 723, 726–30, 741, 744–46.)  \n W.A. ’s 2020–21 ninth grade IEP continued the approach of focusing on fluency and \nexpression, rather than foundational skills . (Id. at 776–87.) The special education teacher assigned \nto W.A., however, quickly became what she described, in an email exchange with  a school \npsychologist, as “ very concerned ” about W.A. In one  internal email, the teacher stated bluntly that \n“[t]his kid can’ t read. ” (A.R., Vol. 1 at 387–88, A.R., Vol. 2 at 812.) Over the course of the year, \nCase 3:23-cv-00912     Document 27     Filed 05/24/24     Page 6 of 30 PageID #: <pageID>7 \n W.A. ’s grades varied significantly . W.A. received F grades on multiple assessments, but he also, \nat times, received As, and he ultimately advanced to tenth grade. ( A.R., Vol. 1 at 388.)   \nW.A. ’s 2021–22 tenth grade IEP continued  the same general approach , supplemented with \nthe “transitional”  supports that become available to students as the y approach the point at which \nthey will transition out of the age for secondary schooling. ( A.R., Vol. 2 at 823–33.)  The IEP \ncontinued to f ocus on fluency and expression, rather than basic skills, and included no express \nreference to dyslexia. ( Id. at 823–33.)  \n In the eleventh grade, however, a teacher again developed concerns that W.A. ’s reading \nproblems went beyond the  deficits reflected in the IEP. The teacher , Bethanie Hargett -Slack,  told \nW.A. ’s mother that, in her view, W.A. could not read. The two discussed the possibility of having \ndyslexia screening performed on W.A. W.A.’s mother  identified this conversation as the first time \nshe learned that W.A.’s disabilities might include dyslexia. ( A.R., Vol. 1 at 390; A.R., Vol. 2 at \n434, 582.)   \nW.A. ’s 2022–23 IEP, however, continued to identify W.A. only as having a “ Specific \nLearning Disab ility” with deficits in “ Reading Fluency”  and “Written Expression ” and continued \nthe same general approach to providing accommodations and support. ( Id. at 840, 848–49.)   \n W.A. ’s grades  remained  mixed. One potential reason for that is that, when W.A. performed \ntake- home assignments, he used a system of interrelated technological supports that enabled him \nto bypass the conventional writing process . The administrative law judge (“ ALJ”) who consider ed \nthis case provided an example of how W.A. ’s system worked:  \nW.A. can speak the words of a topic such as “George  Washington”  into a Word \ndocument by using speech to text software. He can then paste that  written word, \n“George Washington,”  into an artificial intelligence bot, such as “ Chat GPT. ” . . . . \nThe artificial intelligence bot can create a paper about the subject matter, here  \nGeorge Washington, that W.A. can highlight and paste back into a Word document. \nW.A. can  then run the Word document through another software program, \nCase 3:23-cv-00912     Document 27     Filed 05/24/24     Page 7 of 30 PageID #: <pageID>8 \n “Grammarly, ” which will create  a demeanor or style (e.g., business, informal paper, \ngraduate level, u ndergraduate level, or  essay). Where words appear as underlined \nfor being contextually inappropriate, W.A. would click and change them per the \nsoftware ’s suggestion, although he would not understand the  changes being made \nby the software, or whether they w ere actually grammatically appropriate.  W.A. \nwill next use read -aloud software to read him the newly fashioned Word document, \nand he  then would change items that he was not satisfied with or that “ didn’ t sound \nright.”  At that point, if Word notes grammatic al errors, W.A. can again click to \nmake automatic changes that  would be inserted by the software. Once the product \nis finished, W.A. cannot read it himself —he  again would listen to the read- aloud \nsoftware.  \n \n(A.R., Vol. 1 at 392.)  Although that full range of tools may not have been available to him while \nat school, his in -school accommodations did include technical supports that similarly permitted \nsome circumvention of the need to actually read in a conventional manner , particularly through \ntechnology capable of “reading” photographed written language aloud to the user . (See, e.g. , A.R., \nVol. 2 at 829.)  \n The IDEA and its implementing regulations grant a child ’s parent “ the right to an \nindependent educational evaluation,”  or “IEE,” “at public expense if the parent disagrees with an \nevaluation obtained by the public agency. ” 34 C.F.R. § 300.502(b)(1); see 20 U.S.C . § 1415(b). \nOn November 13, 2022, W.A.’ s mother made such a request . (A.R. , Vol. 1  at 394; A.R., Vol. 2 at  \n857.)  Two assessments were performed in connection with the request. One of the assessments, \nby school psychologist Dr. Ryann King, focused on whether W.A. exhibited autism and/or \nattention deficit/hyperactivity disorder ( “ADHD” ). Dr. King concluded  that a finding of \nimpairments bas ed on those conditions was supported, but  she did not focus meaningfully on the \npossibility that W.A. might be  dyslexic . (Id. at 857 –64.)  \n The other assessment was performed by school psychologist Rebecca G. Townsend, who \nconcluded that W.A. exhibited dysl exia, dysgraphia, ADHD, and autism . (Id. at 865–80.)  \nTownsend found, among other things, that W.A. was below the 0.1 percentile rank for an array of \nCase 3:23-cv-00912     Document 27     Filed 05/24/24     Page 8 of 30 PageID #: <pageID>9 \n skills related to reading and writing —including, specifically, his “Basic Reading Skills,” such as  \n“Letter -Word Identification,” which were at around a second grade level.  (Id. at 873.) Townsend \nwrote : \n[W.A.]  demonstrates weaknesses in phonological processing that appear to \ninterfere with his reading and writing skills. In addition to using an evidence -based \nintervention to build [W.A. ’s] phonological processing skills, it may also help to \npractice playing wor d games that require rhyming, blending sounds together to \nform a word, removing a sound from a  word to form another word, and saying a \nword one syllable or one sound at a time. In some cases, incorporating letters  \n(orthography) is helpful for supporting and building phonological processing. For \nexample, use letter cards to build a word and then change one or more letters or \nletter combinations to form a different word.  \n \n(Id. at 879.) Townsend, however, did not dispute that W.A. also needed support with regard to \nmore advanced skills, like fluency. Rather, she explained that his fluency instruction should be \ncombined with instruction involving more basic skills:  \nReading teachers are encouraged to focus on developing [W.A. ’s] reading fluency \nand de -emphasize individual word analysis. Teachers can combine fluency \ntechniques such as imitative reading, repeated reading, radio reading, phrase  \nreading, paired reading, and echo reading with basic sight -word recognition, \ndecoding, vocabulary development, and  comprehension lessons. \n \n (Id.) \n In 2023, W.A. began receiving private tutoring from Dr. Sarah McAfee, a dyslexia \nspecialist. Dr. McAfee used the Wilson Reading and Language System with W.A. Dr. McAfee attended a February 2023 meeting of W.A.’ s IEP team, where she recommended that such one-\non-one tutoring be included in the IEP for the coming year. ( A.R., Vol. 1 at 401.)  \nCMCSS ’s proposed 2023–24 twelfth grade  IEP acknowledged his autism diagnosis  and \nhis parents ’ concerns regarding whether W.A. was r eceiving sufficient supports. ( A.R., Vol. 2  at \n888–89.) The IEP’s assessment of W.A.’s impairments, however, continued to focus on fluency \nand expression, rather than on basic skills. ( Id. at 891–92.) The IEP acknowledged that W.A. would \nCase 3:23-cv-00912     Document 27     Filed 05/24/24     Page 9 of 30 PageID #: <pageID>10 \n need language -related interventions to be provided in a special education setting, but it did not call \nfor services to be provided by an outside tutor like Dr. McAfee. ( Id. at 898 –99.)  W.A. ’s parents \nfelt that the proposed IEP was insufficient, and, while they signed it, they noted, in writing, that \nthey were agreeing only to the provision of the listed services “ versus none at all ” and did not \nagree that the IEP “ provides FAPE.” (Id. at 900.)  W.A. indicated agreement with that position. \n(Id.) \nC. Administrative Proceedings  and Evidence of Alleged Flaws in CMCSS ’s Approach  \n“The IDEA  . . . provides for administrative procedures to resolve disputes when the people \ninvolved in the creation of an IEP are not able to agree on its substance. ” Long, 197 F. App’ x at \n432 (citing 20 U.S.C. § 1415(b)); see 20 U.S.C. § 1415(b)(6), (f) –(g), (k).  Those procedures permit \nany affected party  to raise before  an ALJ any dispute “ with respect to any matter relating to the \nidentification, evaluation, or educational placement of the child, or the provision of a free appropriate public education to such child.”  20 U.S.C. § 1415(b)(6)(A).). “ Any party aggrieved by \nthe findings and decision made under ” the administrative complaint process “ shall have the right \nto bring a civil action with respect to the complaint presented ” in either state or federal court. 20 \nU.S.C . § 1415(i)(2)(A); see also  S.E. v. Grant Cty. Bd. of Educ., 544 F.3d 633, 642–43 (6th Cir. \n2008). On March 23, 2023, W.A. and his parents filed a Complaint before an ALJ pursuant to \nthose procedures. (A.R., Vol. 1 at 1–15.)  The Complaint asserted causes of action pursuant to the \nIDEA, the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”), Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, and 42 U.S.C. § 1983. ( Id. at 12 –13.)   \nThe plaintiffs  alleged that W.A. had been denied a FAPE by CMCSS ’s failure to address \nhis dyslexia, autism, and ADHD. (Id. at 8.)  In addition to their more general concerns regarding \nthe adequacy of the services provided to W.A., W.A. and his parents  faulted CMCSS for failing to \nCase 3:23-cv-00912     Document 27     Filed 05/24/24     Page 10 of 30 PageID #: <pageID>11 \n comply with the Say Dyslexia Act by failing to provide adequate screening for dyslexia, failing to \nprovide W.A. and his parents  with the notice and information required by the Act, and failing to \nperform any “ dyslexia -specific interventions.”  (Id. at 11.)  The parties engaged in discovery, and \nthe plaintiffs ’ challenge was ultimately heard by ALJ Phillip Hilliard  in a three- day due process \nhearing. ( See A.R. Vol. 1 at 1, Vol. 2 at 1–682.)  \nDuring the hearing, the ALJ heard testimony that W.A. was, at that time, on pace to \ngraduate successfully  with a 3.4 GPA. (A.R., Vol. 2 at 200–01.)  W.A. and his parents conceded \nthat that was the case, but argued that W.A. ’s grades did not reflect his progress, because, as his \nmother testified,  those grades had been enabled, at least in part, by his reliance on assistive \ntechnology, including ChatGPT, voice -to-text, and the Grammarly software. ( Id. at 458–60.)  She \nexplained that W.A. was capable of absorbing educational information from ordinary, spoken instruction, but that, if reading or writing was involved, that information recall only translated to good grades based on W.A.’ s “accommodations and workarounds. ” (Id. at 464.) She confirmed \nthat, if called on to write for himself, W.A. was not e ven consistently capable of spelling his \nsurname correctly.\n3 (Id. at 466.)   \nCounsel for W.A. likened W.A.’ s situation to that of a swimmer in a race who advanced \nfrom one side of the pool to the other by dragging himself along the ropes. Such a swimmer, counsel explained, could “ get from point A to point B,”  but would not be “actually swimming. ” \n(Id. at 16.)  In addition to the evidence presented regarding W.A. ’s use of technological assistance \nfor take -home assignments, the evidence at the hearing demonstrated the ways in which W.A.’ s \nin-school accommodations also enabled him to obtain passing grades , despite his reading and \n \n3 This fact is confirmed by W.A.’s signatures, including the signature on his proposed 12th- grade IEP.  \n(See A.R., Vol. 2 at 900.)  \nCase 3:23-cv-00912     Document 27     Filed 05/24/24     Page 11 of 30 PageID #: <pageID>12 \n writing difficulties. For example, W.A. was permitted to use “ Snap&Read ” technology on \nassignments , which converts a photograph of text into artificial speech. ( Id. at 92 . 147, 895.)  \nSome of the evidence presented  to the ALJ casts doubt on the possibility that it is \nnecessarily significant , in and of itself, whether  or not the documentation surrounding a child’ s \nspecial education specifically uses the term “ dyslexia.”  CMCSS Director of Special Populations \nTaylia Griffith  explained that CMCSS favored the use of more generic language because dyslexia \nwas not a recognized “ eligibility category ” under the IDEA. (Id. at 136–37.)  That characterization \nis an accurate statement of the law, in that “‘ [d]yslexia ’ is not a qualifying disability category ,” \nbut, rather, “ one example of various disabilities falling within the eligibility category of Specific \nLearning Disability.”  L.C. on behalf of A.S. v. Issaquah Sch. Dist., No. C17- 1365JLR, 2019 WL \n2023567, at *17 (W.D. Wash. May 8, 2019)  (citing 34 C.F.R. § 300.8(c)(10)(i) ). However, the \nterminology that Griffith  suggested would be appropriate instead of  an express reference to  \ndyslexia —an acknowledgment of deficits in “basic reading skills” —was precisely the term that \nbegan to be omitted from W.A.’s IEPs in favor of a focus on fluency and expression. (A.R., Vol. \n2 at 136.)  \nGriffith ’s testimony, moreover , did not suggest that IDEA’s failure to acknowledge \ndyslexia as a distinct eligibility category negated the possibility that a specific diagnosis of dyslexia might have a meaningful bearing on the appropriateness of interventions in the case of any particu lar student. Griffith , moreover, conceded that, while it is appropriate to use technology \nto assist disabled students, it can be a problem if the technology “mask[s] ” whether the student is \n“able to do the work ” or becomes a “ substitute ” for actually learn ing a necessary skill that the \nstudent is capable of learning. ( Id. at 232–37.)  \nCase 3:23-cv-00912     Document 27     Filed 05/24/24     Page 12 of 30 PageID #: <pageID>13 \n W.A. and his parents called, as an expert, Katheryn Elizabeth Metcalf, who had, until \nrecently, served as the Director of Special Education for the Crockett County School Syste m. (Id. \nat 242–44.) Metcalf testified that she had  been  specifically trained by the State of Tennessee \nregarding the dangers of allowing students with reading difficulties to become overly dependent \non technological supports. ( Id. at 24 5–47.)  \nShe also testified that a focus on more advanced topics of fluency and written expression, \nbefore a child has developed basic reading skills, is ineffective. ( Id. at 253–54.) She testified , \nhowever, that, based on her review, “ all of W.A. ’s evaluations and IEP s have focused on reading \nfluency but never addressed basic foundational reading skills .”4 (Id. at 320.) “Basic reading skills, ” \nMetcalf explained, are the foundational skills , such as those involving phonetics  and the alphabet , \nthat are typically learned in kindergarten through third grade , whereas “ fluency”  focuses on more \ncomplex issues such as tone and conventions. ( Id. at 369–73.) Both areas, Metcalf explained, are \nimportant, but fluency should be learned as a “ next step, ” rather than as an alternative to basic \nreading  skills. ( Id. at 371.)  \nAs a result  of CMCSS ’s failure to focus on W.A. ’s deficits in  basic reading skills , Metcalf \nopined, CMCSS was merely asking W.A. to “ do the same thing over and over ” without ever \n“getting at the ro ot cause”  of his difficulties. ( Id. at 328.) She testified that, in her professional \nopinion, W.A.’ s IEP goals “ were not written to assist him in developing”  the necessary basic skills. \n(Id. at 339.)  She opined that the IEPs were, therefore, not “ instructionally appropriate ” with regard \nto reading. ( Id. at 353.) W.A., in her view, needed intervention “ using dyslexia -specific materials ” \nthat would help him build “ foundational reading skills.”  (Id. at 354.) She explained that, in her \nview, “accommodations are wonderful, but they don’ t replace intervention and instruction to the \n \n4 As the court has noted, this statement is true with regard to  most of  the IEPs at issue in this case, but \nW.A.’s first IEP di d, in fact, acknowledge a deficit in Basic Reading Skills. (A.R., Vol. 2 at 684.)  \nCase 3:23-cv-00912     Document 27     Filed 05/24/24     Page 13 of 30 PageID #: <pageID>14 \n point where we don’ t keep trying.”  (Id. at 367.) Accordingly, IEPs should be written with “ specific \nskill deficits in mind, ” even if some of the effects of those deficits can be mitigated by \naccommodations. ( Id.) \nMetcalf testified that she examined W.A. herself, including by having him perform a \nwriting exercise without technological assistance, and she concluded that his deficits did, in fact, \nreflect a “[l]ack of foundational reading and writing skills,”  rather than simply a lack of fluency. \n(Id. at 337.)  Indeed, she concluded that he “ ha[d] not mastered the basic mechanical skills \nnecessary to produce a written product of more than one sentence that conveys a complete thought or idea. ” (Id. at 338.)  \nW.A. and hi s parents also presented testimony by Dr. McAfee, both as a fact witness , \nregarding her work with W.A., and  as an expert witness based on  her experience and training as a \n“dyslexia specialist reading interventionist.”  (Id. at 388–90.)  Dr. McAfee opined that W.A. was \n“not able to read much of anything that [she] put in front of him ” and needed “systematic decoding \ninstruction,”  meaning instruction that would “ go back to the very basic introduction of the \nalphabet, the alphabetic principle, [and] alphabet sequencing,”  in order to teach W.A. to “ learn \nletters and sounds in order to put them together to make words.”  (Id. at 397 –98.) She testified that \nshe had worked with W.A. about 35 times, over the course of three months, and that she had been able to advance him to Step 2 of the 12- step Wilson Reading and Language System . (Id. at 400–\n01.) She opined that, based on her experience with students  who had exhibited similar deficits, \nW.A. would likely be able to finish all of the steps within three or four years. ( Id. at 401.)  \nDr. McAfee testified that, in her experience, it is not uncommon to meet individuals who \nwere able to obtain formal diplomas without ever learning to read. She explained that, for some schools, “one answer to kids like [W.A.] is to just heavily accommodate  [and]  accommodate, \nCase 3:23-cv-00912     Document 27     Filed 05/24/24     Page 14 of 30 PageID #: <pageID>15 \n add[ing]  more accommodations ” that would permit the student to obtain adequate grades and \ngraduate without having addressed the student ’s language deficits. ( Id. at 414.)  \nCMCSS ’s hearing evidence related to reading focused, in significant  part, on W.A.’ s strong \ngrades.  (E.g., id. at 516 –17, 613.) An assistant principal at W.A. ’s school, Dr. Mandy Frost, \nacknowledged that sometimes students receive improperly inflated grades to enable their \nadvancement or graduation, but she said that W.A. ’s grades did not appear , to her , to reflect su ch \na pattern. ( Id. at 527–28.)  \nHargett -Slack —the teacher  who discussed the possibility of dyslexia with W.A.’s mother \nin eleventh grade —testified to  the importance of classroom -based work to the grades she awarded , \npotentially supporting the inference tha t W.A. ’s full system of technological supports available at \nhome might be unlikely to account for all of his strong grades. ( Id. at 588 –89.) Hargett -Slack , \nhowever, did not dispute that W.A., as his IEPs suggested, had access to some technological supports, particularly Snap&Read, in connection with classroom -based work . (Id. at 591–92.)  \nHargett -Slack further acknowledged that W.A. could have surreptitiously used ChatGTP \nin the classroom as well, given his continuous access to a computer . (Id. at 575–76, 592–93.)  \nHargett -Slack also conceded that, based on W.A. ’s accommodations granting him extra time on \nassignments, she permitted him to take some normally classroom -based work home to complete, \nand she acknowledged that, despite W.A. ’s ultimate passing grade, he received numerous Ds and \nFs on assignments. ( Id. at 593, 604.) Hargett -Slack admitted that she once asked W.A. to read one \nof his own completed assignments, but he could not do so and ultimately conceded that he had not written it himself. ( Id. at 606.)  She did not deny discussing the severity of W.A.’s situation with \nhis mother , although her recollection of the details differed slightly. (Id. at 581–82.)  Another \nCase 3:23-cv-00912     Document 27     Filed 05/24/24     Page 15 of 30 PageID #: <pageID>16 \n teacher, Chelsie Jensen, confirmed that W.A. received accommodations in connection with in-\nschool work. ( Id. at 621.)  \nAnother of W.A. ’s teachers, Lisa Elliott, testified that W.A. earned strong grades in the \nAlgebra II course that she t aught and that, during that course, she observed W.A. successfully \nperform ing in- classroom work. ( Id. at 613–614.)  CMCSS also presented testimony by Dr. King as \nan expert in school psychology. ( Id. at 492, 588–89.) Dr. King took issue with certain \nmethodological aspects of Metcalf ’s report, but she did not opine more broadly regarding W.A.’ s \ndyslexia -related needs. ( Id. at 505–06.)  \nOn July 28, 2023, the ALJ issued a Final Order, holding that the plaintiffs had “met their \nburden of proof to show that CMCSS did not provide W.A. with FAPE because CMCSS violated its obliga tion to provide W.A. with an appropriate individualized education program (IEP) \nreasonably calculated to enable W.A. to make progress appropriate in light of his circumstances, which deprived W.A. of an educational  benefit in the areas of  reading and writi ng, from the time \nof the 2017 -2018 IEP through the filing of the due process complaint.”  (A.R., Vol. 1 at 433–34.)  \nThe ALJ included a discussion of the Say Dyslexia Act, particularly with regard to CMCSS ’s \nfailure to provide “dyslexia -specific intervention s,” as discussed in Tenn. Code Ann. § 49- 1-\n229(f)(1). (Id. at 405.) The ALJ, however, also discussed CMCSS ’s alleged failure to address \nW.A. ’s dyslexia more generally . He specifically credited Metcalf ’s testimony in light of her \nrelevant education, experience, and expertise, and he concluded that the substance of her testimony \nwas “almost entirely unrebutted .” (Id. at 407.) The ALJ  noted, in particular,  the high school IEPs ’ \nconsistent failure to identify basic reading skills as a deficit area. ( Id. at 411.)  \nThe ALJ acknowledged W.A.’ s strong grades and expected graduation, but he also noted, \ncorrectly, that the Supreme Court has expressly “ declined to hold that . . . every [disabled]  child \nCase 3:23-cv-00912     Document 27     Filed 05/24/24     Page 16 of 30 PageID #: <pageID>17 \n who is advancing from grade to grade  . . . is aut omatically receiving a [FAPE]. ” Endrew F. , 580 \nU.S. at 402 n.2 (quoting Rowley, 458 U.S. at  203 n.25). He noted that, in contrast with W.A.’s  \ngrades, the actual skill assessments depicted in the IEPs showed “ relative stagnation ” in W.A.’ s \nreading and writing skills , as evidenced by comparing his percentile ranking in assessments, year \nover year . (A.R., Vol. 1 at 413–15.) The ALJ acknowledged that a lack of progress is not, in and \nof itself, evidence of a denial of FAPE. He concluded, however, that Metcalf ’s testimony \nestablished that W.A. ’s deficits could be addressed, at least to some degree, by basic reading skills -\nfocused interventions that w ere never provided. ( Id. at 417.)  \nThe ALJ awarded W.A. “888 hours of compensatory education in the form of 5 sessions \nper week, at 1 hour per session, of Dyslexia tutoring from a reading interventionist trained to \nprovide  Dyslexia tutoring through the Wilson Reading and Language System.”  (Id. at 434.)  The \nALJ also concluded that W.A.’ s claims under the ADA and Section 504 were supported, although \nhe did not award any additional remedies in connection with those claims . The ALJ rejected the § \n1983 claim. ( Id. at 433.)  \nOn August 11, 2023, CMCSS filed a Petition for Reconsideration focused on the nature of \nthe award of compensatory education. CMCSS argued that the “ extent and method”  of dyslexia -\nfocused compensatory education that W.A. receives should be de termined by the IEP team. ( Id. at \n436, 439.) CMCSS expressed a desire, in particular, not to have to rely on the Wilson Reading and \nLanguage system. ( Id. at 438.) On August 22, 2023, the ALJ denied the petition, holding that, \nwhile the IEP team did retain jurisdiction over prospective services provided for the 2023–24 school year, the award of compensatory education was granted by the ALJ in connection with a contested case, leaving it within the power of the ALJ to define the scope of the relief required. (Id. at 453.)  \nCase 3:23-cv-00912     Document 27     Filed 05/24/24     Page 17 of 30 PageID #: <pageID>26 \n reflected W.A. ’s work ethic and capacity for information retention, those grades do not establish \nthat he received a FAPE with regard to the specific area of reading and writing skills. Deficits \nalone , of course, do not show the denial of a FAPE —because a FAPE must be judge d “in light of \nthe child ’s circumstances, ” Endrew F. , 580 U.S. at 399, and some children have persistent deficits \nthat a school cannot be, and is not, expected by the IDEA to overcom e. The evidence in the \nadministrative record, however, shows that W.A. is, in fact, likely to be able to improve his reading and writing skills, at least to some degree, through interventions specifically designed for students \nwith dyslexia. Indeed, all of  the available evidence suggests that, for nearly the entirety of W.A.’s \ntime at CMCSS, he was being trea ted like a student whose  ill-defined learning disability \ncompromised his fluency and expression—not as a student who lacked basic reading skills due to  \ndyslexia. The court, accordingly, concludes, as the ALJ did, that CMCSS ’s failure to provide \ninterventions appropriate to W.A.’s disabilities resulted in a denial of FAPE with regard to basic \nreading skills . Although CMCSS undisputedly acknowledged that W .A. had reading and writing \ndeficits in his IEPs and provided some corresponding support, an individualized plan responsive to W.A.’ s specific circumstances would have focused on addressing his lack of foundational \nreading skills, which his IEPs did not.  \nThe court ’s finding, in that regard, is based on the likely efficacy of targeted instruction \nfocused on basic reading skills  for individuals with dyslexia , as compared to the education that \nW.A. actually received . The court, in other words, is not formalis tically relying on  whether W.A. ’s \nIEPs  expressly invoke d “dyslexia ” in describing the services provided. If the ALJ had, in fact, \nrelied solely on whether the support that W.A. received was expressly  designated as “ dyslexia -\nspecific, ” that may well have been error. That, though, is not what the ALJ did, and it is not what \nthe court is doing here . The ALJ considered W.A. ’s specific needs and concluded that a FAPE \nCase 3:23-cv-00912     Document 27     Filed 05/24/24     Page 26 of 30 PageID #: <pageID>27 \n required W.A. to receive certain specific tutoring services that would likely have been more \neffective than the  inadequate support he actually received. This court, based on its review of the \nrecord, reaches the same conclusion. The IDEA guarantees W.A. educational benefits appropriate to his situation —not merely generic support for children who struggle with language and a system \nof accommodations so sweeping that it makes the severity of his disability hard to notice.  \nSimilarly, this court does not base its conclusion on technical noncompliance with the Say \nDyslexia Act. If CMCSS violated all of the  Say Dyslexia Act ’s general requirements, but had \nnevertheless adequately addressed W.A. ’s specific disability -related needs, there would be no \nbasis for an award under the IDEA. Conversely, if CMCSS had made an effort to scrupulously comply with the Say D yslexia Act, but had nevertheless failed to provide necessary services, that \ntechnical compliance would not excuse the underlying IDEA violation. It may well be true that, if \nCMCSS had granted W.A. access to the structure envisioned by the Say Dyslexia Act , that would \nhave prevented a violation of his right to a FAPE. It is, however, that denial of an educational \nbenefit —not the details of how it might have been avoided—that support s an award to the \nplaintiffs.  \nW.A. has established, with evidence, that he likely would have benefited substantially from \none-on-one tutoring geared toward addressing his specific, dyslexia -correlated deficits, rather than \nthe more general support that he received , and that the adequacy of his educational benefit was \nsignificantly degraded by CMCSS ’s failure to provide that manner of services . An individualized \napproach tailored to W.A. ’s specific needs would not simply have provided him general language \nsupports, but would have recogni zed his specific need to focus on basic reading skills , guided by \nan awareness of his dyslexia. The court, accordingly, will uphold the ALJ ’s determination that \nCase 3:23-cv-00912     Document 27     Filed 05/24/24     Page 27 of 30 PageID #: <pageID>28 \n W.A. was denied a FAPE.5 The court, moreover, agrees with the ALJ’s assessment that the \nappropriate remedy for that denial is the provision of 888 hours of dyslexia -specific tutoring. \nD. Method for Providing Compensatory Education  \n The only remaining question, then, is the one that was first raised before this court: whether \nW.A. has a right to have the court further restrict the mechanisms through which his compensatory \ninstruction should be provided. As a preliminary matter, the co urt notes that the ALJ was correct \nthat he had the authority to require the use of the Wilson Reading and Language System , regardless \nof the fact that, if CMCSS had provided dyslexia -specific interventions in the first place, it would \nhave had the discreti on to choose between other alternatives. The IDEA takes a “flexible approach”  \nto remedies, L.M. , 478 F.3d at  316, allowing a court to “ grant such relief as [it] determines is \nappropriate. ” 20 U.S.C. § 1415(i)(2)(C)(iii). “ An award of compensatory education is an equitable \nremedy that a court can grant as it finds appropriate.”  L.M. , 478 F.3d at 316 (citing 20 U.S.C. § \n1415(i)(2)(C)(iii); Park ex rel. Park v. Anaheim Union High Sch. Dist., 464 F.3d 1025, 1034 (9th \nCir. 2006) ); see, e.g. , Somberg, 908 F.3d at  177; Woods v. Northport Pub. Sch., 487 F. App’ x 968, \n978 (6th Cir. 2012) . The ALJ concluded that, because W.A. had already received numerous \nsessions in connection with the Wilson Reading and Language System  and had advanced within \nthat syste m, continuing along that course would provide the appropriate remedy. The court agrees. \nWhether or not other systems might work adequately in the abstract, W.A. ’s individual situation \nis that (1) these interventions are occurring far later in his education than they should have and (2) he has already done substantial work in the Wilson Reading and Language System. The court holds \n \n5 In addition to the ALJ ’s focus on W.A.’ s general denial of a FAPE, the ALJ found that CMCSS had failed \nto provide W.A. with sufficient transition services, for which the ALJ ordered only very modest relief in \nthe form of providing W.A. with some career -related assessments. (A.R., Vol. 1 at 431.)  CMCSS briefly \naddresses this aspect of the ALJ’s holding in its briefing, but its argument is conclusory and amounts to \nlittle more than saying that the ALJ erred. The court finds no error with regard to this aspect of the ALJ’s \ndetermination.  \nCase 3:23-cv-00912     Document 27     Filed 05/24/24     Page 28 of 30 PageID #: <pageID>29 \n that the appropriate mechanism for  remedying his denial of a FAPE is continuation of that \napproach.  \n W.A. ’s primary  argument in favor of modifying the relief to require CMCSS to rely on the \nClarksville Center for Dyslexia  is that CMCSS ’s failure to provide W.A. with instruction under \nthe Wilson Reading and Language System  until now should be construed as either a refusal or  an \ninability  to do so. The court, however, finds no basis for drawing so strong an inference. For the \noverwhelming majority of the time that CMCSS failed to provide W.A.  with the manner of \ninstruction he needed, it did so because it appears to have been genuinely unaware of the specific \nnature of his needs. CMCSS has represented to this court that it is “ ready, willing, and able to \nprovide the compensatory education order ed by the Administrative Judge ,” as long as it is able to \nresolve “logistical problems ” surrounding (1) W.A.’ s schedule and (2) access to data regarding his \nprogress with McAfee. (Doc. No. 23 at 1.) This court ’s only remedial power, under the IDEA, is \nto order a remedy adequate to address the denial of W.A. ’s FAPE. The court cannot conclude, at \nthis stage, that instruction provided through W.A.’ s preferred source, the Clarksville Center for \nDyslexia, is the only potentially adequate source of such instructi on. \n W.A. and his parents ask the court to consider two additional pieces of evidence that, they \nargue , establish CMCSS ’s inability to provide instruction in the Wilson Reading and Language \nSystem: an audio recording of a November 2023 IEP meeting showing that CMCSS generally uses \nanother system and evidence  from another student ’s case suggesting that the “ literacy transition”  \nteachers at W.A. ’s school lack ed dyslexia -specific training  in 2020 and that there is some question \nregarding the extent of such training now . Neither of those pieces of evidence, however, suggests \nthat CMCSS is categorically incapable of providing the  necessary instruction through any \nmechanism other than through the Clarksville Center for Dyslexia.  \nCase 3:23-cv-00912     Document 27     Filed 05/24/24     Page 29 of 30 PageID #: <pageID>30 \n If CMCSS does prove to be wholly incapable of providing Wilson Reading and Language \nSystem  instruction with its own personnel  in a timely  manner , then it w ill, by necessity, have to \nlook to an outside vendor. The court, however, has no basis for requiring it to do so and certainly \nhas no basis for selecting one particular vendor . The court, accordingly, will require the same \ncompensatory education that the A LJ did and will stress that it must be provided expeditiously—\nincluding, if necessary, through an outside party .6 If CMCSS fails to meet that obligation, W.A. \ncan return to this court to seek enforcement of its Order. For now, though, CMCSS ’s obligation i s \nto provide the necessary compensatory education through whatever adequate staffing and funding \nmechanism it chooses.  Because the relief originally ordered by the ALJ will now become relief \nordered by this court, the plaintiffs ’ motion to enforce the ALJ ’s Order will become moot.  \nIV. CONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, the plaintiffs ’ Motion to Enforce Final Order of the \nAdministrative Law Judge (Doc. No. 19) will be denied as moot, the plaintiffs ’ Motion for \nJudgment on the Administrative Record (Doc. No. 25) will be granted as to all issues other than \ntheir requested modification of the remedy, and will, in that respect, be denied, and CMCSS ’s \nMotion for Judgment on the Administrative Record (Doc. No. 22) will be denied.  \nAn appropriate order will enter.  \n        ______________________________ \n        ALETA A. TRAUGER  \n       United States District Judge  \n \n6 The court will, however, omit the requirement that the instruction be provided by a “ reading \ninterventionist, ” because CMCSS has disput ed whether  “Sarah McAfee or anyone associated with the \nClarksville Center for Dyslexia is a reading interventionist within the meaning of Tennessee law. ” (Doc. \nNo. 26 at 2.) Whatever the import of that distinction is with regard to general, prospective com pliance with \nthe Say Dyslexia Act,  there has been no showing that a formal designation as a reading interventionist is \nnecessary for the provision of adequate compensatory education in W.A.’ s case.  The court will also permit \nsome greater flexibility with r egard to scheduling.  \nCase 3:23-cv-00912     Document 27     Filed 05/24/24     Page 30 of 30 PageID #: <pageID>",

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: Plaintiff Kevin J. Meehan filed a class action lawsuit against VIPKid and related companies, claiming they engaged in fraud, conversion, deceptive business practices, and labor law violations. A key allegation involves the use of biometric data captured from teachers on the VIPKid online platform to develop artificial intelligence and facial recognition technologies without their consent. The court dismissed the case, determining that any disputes should be resolved through arbitration as stipulated in the contract between the plaintiff and VIPKid.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the claims against VIPKid and associated defendants should be subject to arbitration, and whether the court had personal jurisdiction over the foreign defendants.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court upheld the report and recommendation to dismiss all claims and compel arbitration, as specified in the Independent Contractor Agreement between the plaintiff and VIPKid. The court also held that it lacked personal jurisdiction over some of the defendants, including China Renaissance and Sequoia.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine you agreed to a job online teaching kids English, and you signed a contract saying any big disagreements have to be worked out by a special referee instead of going to court. You later found out they might have been sneaky and used video calls to collect info about you without telling you. You tried to sue them in court but the judge said, \"Remember, you agreed to let a referee handle any drama like this.\" So, the judge closed the case and said you need to stick to the original agreement.",

Procedural History  \nA.  The Parties  \n1. Plaintiff  \n  Plaintiff is a domiciliary of Nassau County, New York, \nwho performed work for  VIPKid,2 an online teaching plat form, from \napproximately October 2016 to June 2020 .  (Am. Compl. at 2-3; See \nEx. A, ECF No. 71 -2; Dami Support Memo at 2.)  As discussed supra, \nPlaintiff brings the following causes of action against \nDefendants : (1) common law fraud; (2)  common law fraud in the \ninducement; (3)  common law conversion; (4)  deceptive business \npractices under N.Y. General Business Law  §§ 349 and 350; and (5) \nvarious breaches of N.Y. Labor Law for unpaid straight and overtime \nwages, unl awful wage deductions, failure to provide sick leave, \nand retaliation.   Plaintiff’s core allegation is that VIPKid, along \nwith the other named Defendants, engaged in a scheme to defraud \nPlaintiff and others by entici ng them to teach students on an \ninternet  platform (hereafter, the “ VIPKid Platform ”).  (Am. Compl. \nat 11.)  According to Plaintiff, unbeknownst to him and others  \nworking as teachers  for VIPKid, Defendants were harvesting the \n \n1 The Court presumes familiarity with the record and summarizes the facts only \nas necessary for resolution of the instant motion.  The facts discussed herein \nare derived from the Amended Complaint and the parties’ submissions relative to \nthe instant motions .  \n2 One of the issues in this case is whether Plaintiff was properly classified \nas an independent contractor.  The Court takes no position on that issue at \nthis time.  Case 2:20-cv-06370-JS-LGD     Document 102     Filed 01/25/24     Page 6 of 40 PageID #:\n<pageID>7 \n teachers’ biometric data in order to develop artificial \nintelligence, a rtificial general intelligence , and facial \nrecognition technology.  ( Id.)   \n2. The Dami Defendants  \n  VIPKid is a Hong Kong corporation that maintains “an \ninternet platform enabling American teachers to connect remotely \nwith students in China to provide Englis h language instruction.”  \n(Dami Support Memo at 2.)  VIPKid’s principal place of business is \nHong Kong .  (Id.)  From 2016 to 2020, VIPKid contracted with \nPlaintiff such that Plaintiff provided online teaching instruction \nto students via the VIPKid Platform.  (Dami Support Memo at 9.)   \nDuring this time period, VIPKid entered into a series of IC \nAgreements  with Defendant .  (Id.; see also  Ex. A.)  The IC \nAgreements each contained an arbitration provision whereby the \nparties agreed to arbitrate  “any past, existing or future claim, \nregardless of the date of its accrual” by either party “arising \nout of or related to” the IC Agreement.3  (Dami Support Memo at 9, \n11; Ex. A.)  \n  VIPKid Int’l is a wholly -owned subsidiary of  VIPKid, and \na Delaware corporation with its principal place of business in \n \n3 While Plaintiff and VIPKid executed  several IC Agreement s, it is undisputed \nthat the IC Agreements each contained an arbitration provision.  ( Dami Support \nMemo at 9.)  In their submissions relative to the instant Motions, the parties \nrefer only to the most recent IC Agreement executed by Plaintiff and VIPKid.  \n(See Ex. A).  For convenience , hereafter, the Court refers to the IC Agreements \nin the singular .

Plaintiff \nalleges that VIPKid Int’l is an “ex press beneficiary” of the IC \nAgreements executed between Plaintiff and VIPKid.  (Amended Compl. \nat 8.) \n  BDT is a Chinese corporation with its principal place of \nbusiness in C hina.  (Dami Support Memo at 2.)  According to \nPlaintiff, BDT is a “principal or core VIPKid company and owner of \nVIPKid trademarks used by [the] Dami Defendants and the VIPKid \nPlatform when it is being used in certain capacities.”  ( Am. Compl. \nat 8.)  BDT owns “at least nine VIPKID apps on Apple’s app store” \nand “owns VIPKid’s English -language website[,] www.VIPKid.com.” \n(Id.)  \n  BDFT is a Chinese corporation with its principal place \nof business in China.  (Dami Support Memo at 2.)  Plaintiff alleges \nBDFT is a wholly -owned subsidiary of VIPKid that owns patents for \ntechnology used on the VIPKid Platform “including patents for \nharvesting VIPKid Teacher biometric data.”  ( Am. Compl. at 8).   \n3. The Tencent Defendants  \n  Tencent Holdings is incorporated in the Cayman Islands \nand maintains its principal place of business in C hina.  (Tencent \nSupport Memo at 11; Byun Decl. ¶2.)  Tencent Holdings does not \nconduct any business in New York, nor does it have any business \noperations, offices, or employees in New York.  (Tencent Support \nMemo at 11; Buyun Decl. ¶3 -5.)

The Instant Motions  \n1. Dami Defendan ts’ Motion to Dismiss and Compel \nArbitration  \n \n  On January 21, 2022, the Dami Defendants moved  to dismiss \nthe Amended Complaint, arguing: (1) pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1), the \nCourt lacks subject -matter jurisdiction over Plaintiff’s claims \nbecause the parties  agreed arbitr ate pursuant to the  IC Agreement; \n(2) pursuant to Rule 12(b)(2), the Court lacks personal \njurisdiction over defendants ; and (3) pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), Case 2:20-cv-06370-JS-LGD     Document 102     Filed 01/25/24     Page 11 of 40 PageID #:\n<pageID>12 \n Plaintiff has failed  state a claim .  (See generally , Dami Support \nMemo.)  In support of their claims, the Dami Defendants argue  the \narbitration clause in the IC Agreement unequivocally require s \nPlaintiff to resolve his claims in this action before an \narbitrator.  ( Id. at 11.)  In particular, the Dami Defendants point \nto the specific provisions of the IC Agreement mandating the \nresolution of “most every type of dispute” via arbitration. ( Id.)  \nThe IC Agreement states , in pertinent part : \nARBITRATION OF CLAIMS:  In the event of a \ndispute between the parties , the parties agree \nto resolve the dispute as described in this \nSection (the “Arbitration Provision”).  This \nArbitration Provision is governed by the \nFederal Arbitration Act (9  U.S.C. § 1, et \nseq.) and evidence s a transaction involving \ncommerce.  The parties expressly agree that \nthis Arbitration  Provision shall be governed \nby the Federal Arbitration Act even in the \nEvent TEACHER and/or VIPKID are otherwise \nexempted from the Federal Arbitration Act.  \nAny disputes  in this regard shall be resolved \nexclusively by an Arbitrator.  In the event, \nbut only in the event, the Arbitrator \ndetermines the Feder al Arbitration Act does \nnot apply, the state law governing arbitration \nagreements in the state in which TEACHER \nperforms the majority of services covered by \nthis Agreement shall apply.  This Arbitration \nProvision applies to any past, existing or \nfuture claim, regardless of the date of its \naccrual, brought by either TEACHER or VIPKID, \narising out of or related to this Agree ment, \nTEACHER’s relationship with VIPKID, including \nwithout limitation, TEACHER’s classification \nas an independent contractor or termination of \nthe relationship with VIPKID, and TEACHER’s \nprovision of services to Students, whether \narising under federal, st ate, or local law.  \nThe terms of this Arbitration Provision will Case 2:20-cv-06370-JS-LGD     Document 102     Filed 01/25/24     Page 12 of 40 PageID #:\n<pageID>13 \n remain in force after the parties’ contractual \nrelationship ends.  Except as it otherwise \nprovides, this Arbitration Provision is \nintended to apply to the resolution of \ndisputes that otherwise would be resolved in \na court of law or before any forum other than \narbitration. THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION \nREQIRES ALL SUCH DISPUTES TO BE RESOLVED ONLY \nBY AN ARBITRATOR THROUGH FIN AL AND BINDING \nARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS, AND NOT BY \nWAY OF COURSE OR JURY TRIAL, OR BY WAY OF \nCLASS, COLLECTIVE, OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION.   \n \nClaims Covered by Arbitration Provision.  \nUnless carved out below, claims involving the \nfollowing dispute s shall be subject to \narbitration under this Arbitration Provision \nregardless of whether brought by TEACHER, \nVIKID or any agent acting on behalf of either: \n(1) disputes arising out of or related to this \nAgreement; (2) disputes arising out of or \nrelated to TEACHER’s relationship with VIPKID, \nincluding without limitation, disputes \nconcerning TEACHER’s classification as an \nindependent contractor, or termination of the \nrelationship with VIPKID; (3) TEACHER’s \nprovision of services to Students; and (3) \nexcept as otherwise set forth in section 13.B, \nClass Action Waiver, below, disputes arising \nout of or relating to the interpretation o f \nthe Arbitration Provision, including the \nvalidity, enforceability, revocability, \nconscionability, scope, or breach of the \nArbitrat ion Provision, or any portion of the \nArbitration Provision.  . . . Except as it \notherwise provides, this Arbitration \nProvision also applies, without limitation, to \nall such disputes between TEACHER and VIPKID’s \nfiduciaries, administrators, affiliates, \nsubsidiaries, parents, and all successors and \nassigns of any of them.  \n \n(Id.; Ex A. (bolded emphasis in original .))   \n  The Dami Defendants argue this Court does not have \npersonal jurisdiction over them because they are not domiciled  in Case 2:20-cv-06370-JS-LGD     Document 102     Filed 01/25/24     Page 13 of 40 PageID #:\n<pageID>14 \n New York and do not condu ct any activities in New York relating to \nthe claims at issue.  (Dami Support Memo at 16 (noting trademarks, \npatents, and apps purportedly owned by BDT and BDFT are unrelated \nto claims at issue and , thus, cannot be utilized to convey personal \njurisdiction .))  The Dami Defendants further argue Plaintiff fails \nto state a claim upon which relief may be granted because: (1) the \nAmended Complaint is a “shot gun” pleading that makes general \nallegations against numerous defendants  without distinguishing the \nacts of each defendant; (2) Plaintiff’s fraud claims fail to \nsatisfy Rule 9’s specificity requirement; (3)  even if Plaintiff \nmet Rule 9’s specificity requirement, he fails to state viable \nfraud claims because he has not identified any material \nmisrepresentations  of fact or plead Defendants had knowledge of \nthe falsity of their purported representations ;(4) Plaintiff fails \nto assert a viable cause of action for conversion because, even \nassuming Defendants copied or used Plaintiff’s biometric \ninformation , “Plaintif f was not prevented from also using that \ndata”; (5) Plaintiff fails to assert a viable cause of action under \nNew York General Business Law because he provides “no factual \nallegations to plead that any wrongful act by Defendants was \nconsumer -oriented”; and (6) Plaintiff fails to allege facts \nrequired to establish viable claims under New York Labor Law and \nthe Fair Labor Standards Act .  (Dami Support Memo at 18 -33.)

(Pl’s \nOpp’n Arb., ECF No. 79, at 16 ; Pl’s Opp’n PJ, ECF No. 78, at 11 -\n12; Pl’s Opp’n Claim, ECF No. 80, 8 -25.4)   \n2. Tencent Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss  \n  The Tencent Defendants move to dismiss the Amended \nComplaint, arguing: (1)Plaintiff failed to properly serve Tencent \nHoldings and Tencent Cloud, w arranting dismissal under Rule \n \n4 Plaintiff filed several opposition motions in this matter, each addressing \nseparate issues.  Plaintiff’s memorandum of law in opposition to Defendants’ \nmotions to compel arbitration and dismiss for lack of service is referred to \nherein as “Pl’s Opp’n Arb.”  Plaintiff’s memorandum of law in opposition to \nDefendants’ motions to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction is referred to \nherein as “Pl’s Opp’n PJ.”  Plaintiff’s memorandum of law  in opposition to \nDefendants’ motion s to dismiss for failure to state a claim is referred to \nherein as “Pl’s Opp’n Claim.”  \n Case 2:20-cv-06370-JS-LGD     Document 102     Filed 01/25/24     Page 15 of 40 PageID #:\n<pageID>16 \n 12(b)(5); (2) even if service had been proper, this Court does not \nhave personal jurisdiction over any of the Tencent Defendants, \nwarranting dismissal under Rule 12(b)(2); and (3) Plaintiff has \nfailed to state a claim upon wh ich relief can be granted, \nwarranting dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6).  (Tencent Support Memo \nat 2.)  Moreover, the Tencent Defendants claim they have no \ncorporate relationship with, and have never invested in, any of \nthe VIPKid Defendants.  ( Id. at 4.)  They further contend none of \nthe Tencent Defendants have ever authorized the VIPKid Defendants \nto act on their behalf ; nor have they had any involvement in the \ndesign, development, or maintenance of the VIPKid Platform.  ( Id. \nat 5.)5   \n  Plaintif f argues in  opposition : (1) service upon Tencent \nHoldings and Tencent Cloud was appropriate as Hague Convention \ncompliance was not necessary ; (2) the Court has personal \njurisdiction over Tencent Defendants by virtue of their \nrelationship with VIPKID and that their software is integrated in \nthe VIPKID Platform; and (3) the Amended Complaint should not be \ndismissed for failure to state a claim because it meets all other \npleading requirements sufficient to support Plaintiff’s claims.  \n \n5 The Tencent Defendants assert their business records indicate a subsidiary of \nTencent Holdings, Tencent Mobility Limited, invested  in a company named VIPKid \nLimited.  (Tencent Support Memo at 4; see also Byun Decl., ECF No. 70 -7, at ¶7; \nLeong Decl., ECF No. 70 -5, at ¶9; Xu Decl., ECF No. 11, at ¶11.)  Tencent \nMobility Limited is not a named Defendant in this action.  ( See generally,  Am. \nCompl.)

China Renaissance’s Motion to Dismiss  \n  China Renaissance moves to dismiss the Amended \nComplaint, arguing: (1) this Court does not have personal \njurisdiction over it because it is a foreign corporation with out \nsufficient “minimum contacts” to establish personal jurisdiction; \n(2) Plaintiff cannot establish jurisdiction via New York’s \nlong-arm statute because he has failed to sufficiently allege that \nChina Renaissance committed tortious conduct in, or caused i njury \nto, Plaintiff in New York; (3) exercising personal jurisdiction \nover China Renaissance would disturb “traditional notions of fair \nplay and substantial justice”; and (4) Plaintiff fails to state \nplausible claims for relief against China Renaissance.  (See \ngenerally  China Renaissance Support Memo.)   \n  Plaintiff argues in opposition: (1) this Court has \npersonal jurisdiction over China Renaissance because its \nwholly-owned subsidiary, China Renaissance Securities US, Inc. \n(hereafter, “China Renaissance Securities”) is a “mere department \nor agent” of China Renaissance which “triggers vicarious \njurisdiction” over China Renaissance; and (2) he has properly \nsubstantiated h is claims against China Renaissance.  ( See \ngenerally  Pl’s Opp’n PJ; Pl’s Opp’n Claim.)   \n  Case 2:20-cv-06370-JS-LGD     Document 102     Filed 01/25/24     Page 17 of 40 PageID #:\n<pageID>36 \n C. China Renaissance ’s and Sequoia’s  Motions to Dismiss \nfor Lack of Personal Jurisdiction  \n \n1. Judge Lindsay’s Report Should Be Reviewed for  \nClear Error  \n \n  Plaintiff objects to Judge Lindsay’s recommendation to \ndismiss claims against China Renaissance  and Sequoia  for lack of \npersonal jurisdiction.  In particular, Plaintiff argues Judge \nLindsay: (1) makes a series of unspecified “errors in its \nconsideration” of “Plaintiff’s theories”; (2)  errs in analyzing \npersonal jurisdiction against each individual Defendant as opposed \nto “Defendants acting collectively”;  (3) incorrectly required \nDefendants to have a physical presence in New York ; (4) incorre ctly \nrelied upon irrelevant evidence that China Renaissance and its \nU.S. subsidiary “maintain [their] own books and records and never \ncontracted with” Plaintiff; and  (5) ignores his request for a \npreliminary hearing on jurisdiction .  (Objs. at  13-16.)  Once more, \nPlaintiff’s arguments are “mere iterations” of previously  \narticulated arguments Plaintiff made in his underlying papers ; \nthus, clear error review applies.  (See Pl’s Opp’n PJ at 12, 19 -\n21, 23-24.)   Under this standard, the Court finds  Judge Lindsay’s \nReport to be well -reasoned and free of clear error.  Moreover, \neven if the Court were to review Judge Lindsay’s Report de novo, \nthe Court would reach the same conclusion.   \n  Case 2:20-cv-06370-JS-LGD     Document 102     Filed 01/25/24     Page 36 of 40 PageID #:\n<pageID>37 \n 2. Judge Lindsay’s Report Is Free of Clear Error  \n \n  Plaintiff utter ly fails to establish China Renaissance \nand Sequoia are  subject to this Court’s jurisdiction.  First, China \nRenaissance is organized under the laws of the Cayman Islands and \nmaintains its principal places of business in Hong Kong and China.  \n(Am. Compl. at 7; China Renaissance Support Memo at 9; Yee Decl., \nat ¶2.)  China Renaissance does not transact business in New York, \nhas no employees in New York, and owns no real property in New \nYork.  (China Resistance Support Memo at 9; Yee Decl. ¶4 -6.)  \nAccording to  Plaintiff, China Renaissance is VIPKID’s “exclusive \nfinancial advisor and capital markets partner” and “actively \nshap[es] VIPKID so that VIPKID’s activities are responsive to the \nnational policies of the Chinese Government.”  ( Am. Compl. at 7.)  \nThe Court agrees with Judge Lindsay that these facts fail to \nestablish a connection between China Renaissance and New York, or \nbetween China Renaissance and the instant case, sufficient to \nconfer personal jurisdiction.  (R &R at 34.) ; see also N.Y. C.P.L.R. \n§ 302(a).  \n  Plaintiff’s claims that because China Renaissance \nSecurities, a U.S. subsidiary of China Renaissance, receives \nfunding from China Renaissance, it must be a n “agent” or \n“department ” of China Renaissance such that China Renaissance is \nsubject to personal jurisdiction in New York.  (Objs. at 15-17).  \nAs discussed previously, in order to establish personal Case 2:20-cv-06370-JS-LGD     Document 102     Filed 01/25/24     Page 37 of 40 PageID #:\n<pageID>38 \n jurisdiction on a “mere agent” or “department” theory, Plaintiff \n“must show that the subsidiary does all the business  which the \nparent corporation would do were it here by its own officials.”  \nJazini v. Nissan Motor Co. , 148 F.3d 181, 184 (2d Cir. 1998)  \n(citations and quotation marks omitted) (emphasis added) .  \nPlaintiff has failed to allege any facts support ing such a finding.  \nFurther, Plaintiff asserts no plausible alternative basis for \nconferring personal jurisdiction over China Renaissance.   \n  Second, Plaintiff  has failed  to establish Sequoia has \nany relationship to the state of New York, or that Sequoia has \ncommitted or is responsible for a tortious act in New York , such \nthat personal jurisdiction may be conferred under N.Y. C.P.L.R. \n§ 302(a).  Sequoia is a n LLC incorpora ted in Delaware that \nmaintains its headquarters in California.  (Chang Decl. ¶3.)  \nSequoia does not own or maintain an office in New York ; nor does \nit own any assets in New York, such as bank accounts.  (Chang Decl. \n¶4-5.)  Sequoia is the “parent of certai n funds that were outside \ninvestors in VIPKid” but has not itself invested in VIPKid.  \n(Sequoia Support Memo at 5; Chang Decl.  ¶9.)  Even if the Court \nwere to accept as true Plaintiff’s claim that Sequoia is one of \nVIPKid’s “most strategic investors ,” Judg e Lindsay correctly \npoints out  Plaintiff fails to establish such investment was made \nin New York or Sequoia engaged in any related tortious conduct in \nNew York such that personal jurisdiction may be conferred.  (R&R Case 2:20-cv-06370-JS-LGD     Document 102     Filed 01/25/24     Page 38 of 40 PageID #:\n<pageID>39 \n at 37.)  Given these deficiencies , the C ourt cannot exercise \npersonal jurisdiction over Sequoia.   \n  For the reasons articulated supra, over Plaintiff’s \nobjections, the Court finds  Judge Lindsay’s Report and \nRecommendation to be well -reasoned and free of clear error  and \nadopts said Report and Re commendation in its entirety.  \nConsequently, the Court grants China Renaissance ’s and Sequoia’ s \nrespective Motions to Dismiss .  The Court declines Plaintiff’s \nrequest for a hearing on jurisdiction.   Moreover, b ecause the Court \ndismisses the claims against China Renaissance  and Sequoia for \nlack of personal jurisdiction, it need not address the other bases \nfor dismissal raised in their respective  Dismissal Motions .   \n  To the extent not fully addressed herein, the  Court has \nconsidered each of Plaintiff’s remaining objections and find s them \nto be without merit. \nCONCLUSION  \n  Accordingly, f or the aforementioned reasons , IT IS \nHEREBY ORDERED :  \n  Plaintiff’s Objections are OVERRULED , and the R&R (ECF \nNo. 91) is adopted in its entirety .  Accordingly:   \n  The Dami Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss and Compel \nArbitration (ECF No. 71) is GRANTED;  \n  The Tencent Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss (ECF No. 70) \nis GRANTED;  Case 2:20-cv-06370-JS-LGD     Document 102     Filed 01/25/24     Page 39 of 40 PageID #:\n<pageID>40 \n   China Renaissance’s Motion to Dismiss (E CF No. 72) is \nGRANTED; and  \n  Sequoia’s Motion to Dismiss (ECF No. 73) is GRANTED.  \n  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Plaintiff has any \nplausible claims against any of the Defendants, those claims are \nto be brought properly before an arbitrator .

    "summary": "1. Summary:\n   James Dean Kendrick filed multiple Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests seeking records about his criminal conviction from the DEA. Dissatisfied with the DEA's response, which included some redacted documents, he pursued legal action. The court ruled that while most DEA searches were adequate, exemptions validly applied to redacted materials, but it also found some searches inadequate and mandated further searching.\n\n2. Key Legal Issue:\n   The key legal issue in this case was whether the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) conducted sufficient searches and properly applied FOIA exemptions when withholding information from Kendrick.\n\n3. Court's Holding:\n   The court granted and denied motions for summary judgment in part, acknowledging that the DEA's application of exemptions to the redactions was appropriate, but the court found that some searches were inadequate and required the DEA to conduct further searches to ensure comprehensive compliance with Kendrick’s FOIA requests.\n\n4. ELI5 Explanation:\n   Imagine you're trying to get all the information about a time you were caught pulling a prank but some details are blacked out. Kendrick wanted to see all the files from the DEA on his case. The DEA searched their computers and found some papers, but not all. The court told the DEA to look harder and double-check some places, while agreeing with the DEA that some information needed to be kept secret to protect people's privacy and safety.",

The agency conducted several  searches and \nreleased 28 pages, with some material redacted.   Dissatisfied with that  resp onse, Kendrick  filed \nthis lawsuit.   \nBoth parties now move for summary judgment.  The Court holds that, on this record, \nsome of DEA’s searches were inadequate.  But the Court also concludes that for the material \nalready disclosed, the agency has properly invoked various FOIA exemptions.  The Court will therefore grant in part and deny in part both motions. \nI.   \n This FOIA case begi ns with a criminal conviction.  In 2016, a federal court  sentenced \nKendrick to “life imprisonment plus 30 years” for his involvement in a drug ring.  ECF No. 937, United States v. Kendrick, et al., No. 6:10- cr-6096 (W.D.N.Y.).  To s ubstantiate alleged \nprosecutorial errors related to his conviction, Kendrick filed a FOIA request with the DEA.  See \nCompl. at 2, ECF No. 1.  He sought (1) his NADDIS report, which refers to “an electronic data index system” used by DEA to locate records, Decl. of Angela Hertel ¶  6, ECF No. 14- 5 (Hertel Case 1:21-cv-01624-TNM     Document 26     Filed 08/25/22     Page 1 of 142 \n Decl.); (2)  his DEA investigative file ; (3) DEA forms pertaining “directly or indirectly” to him;  \nand (4) correspondence the DEA sent him at a New York county jail about  the seizure of money \nat the time of his arrest , see id.  ¶ 8.   \nDEA conducted multiple searches.  It first queried the NADDIS database and found one \ninvestigative file associated with Kendrick , the paper copy of which had been  destroyed by a \nfield office .  See id.  ¶ 9.  But the age ncy located an electronic copy in an “electronic file room.”  \nId. ¶ 11.  That file amounted to four pages.  See id. ¶  11.  And because Kendrick had asked about \na seizure, DEA sent a search request to its Asset Forfeiture Section  (AFS) , which located ten \nrelevant pa ges.  See id. ¶  10.  The agency released all 14 pages , with redactions on eight of them .  \nSee id.  ¶ 12. \n Kendrick appealed that response within the Department of Justice , DEA’s parent agency .  \nSee id.  ¶ 13.  The Department remanded the request for more searches, and DEA sent a search \nrequest to its Office of Administration, Investigative Records Unit, to locate logs showing who \nhad searched  NADDIS for Kendrick’s files.  See id. ¶¶ 13–14.  That Unit loc ated two pages.  See \nid. ¶ 15.  DEA also located three pages comprising Kendrick’s NADDIS report.  See id. ¶  16.  \nThe agency released those five pages with some redactions .  See id.  ¶¶ 1 5–16.   \nKendrick then filed another FOIA request that largely duplicat ed his earlier one but also \nsought any documents about the destruction of  his investigative file.  See id.  ¶ 17.  DEA \nresponded that “ everything related to his NADDIS report, the investigative file, and any other \ninvestigative records” had been released  previously.  I d. ¶ 18.  And as for  the destruction of  his \nfile, DEA released both its search request to the field office and th at office’s  response that it had \ndestroyed the paper files.  See id.  ¶ 18.  That release amounted to three pages, meaning the \nagency had released 22 pages  in to tal, 14 with redactions.  See id.  ¶ 19.  For those redactions, Case 1:21-cv-01624-TNM     Document 26     Filed 08/25/22     Page 2 of 143 \n DEA invoked FOIA Exemptions 6, 7(C), 7(E), and 7(F).  See id.  \nDissatisfied with the agency’s response, Kendrick filed this suit,  pro se , arguing that the \nDEA’s searches were inadequate and that the agency improperly relied on the exemptions.  See \ngenerally Compl.  DEA move d for summary judgment , see Def ’s. MSJ, ECF N o. 14, and \nKendrick cross -move d for the same, s ee Pl.’s MSJ, ECF No. 19- 1.  After th e motions became \nripe, however, DEA conducted another search of the AFS and found six more responsive pages.  \nSee Attach to Supp. Memo., ECF No. 25- 1.  The agency released those pages with some \nredactions under the same exemptions as before.  \nThe cross -motions are now ripe for decision.1 \nII.   \nTo prevail on a motion for summary judgment, a party must show that “there is no \ngenuine dispute as to any material fact.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a).  FOIA requires “disclosure of documents held by a federal agency unless the documents fall within one of nine  enumerated \nexemptions, which are listed at 5 U.S.C. § 552(b).”  U.S. Fish & Wildlife Serv. v. Sierra Club, Inc., 141 S. Ct. 777, 785 (2021) .  To obtain summary judgment, the agency bears the burden to \nshow the applicability of the claimed exemptions.  See ACLU v. DOD, 628 F.3d 612, 619 (D.C. Cir. 2011) .  This burden does not shift even when the requester cross -moves  for summary \njudgment.  See Hardy v. ATF , 243 F. Supp. 3d 155, 162 (D.D.C. 2017) .  Courts construe FOIA  \nexemptions narrowly, see Milne r v. Dep’t of the Navy , 562 U.S. 562, 565 (2011) , and review \ntheir applicability de novo, s ee King v. DOJ , 830 F.2d 210, 217 (D.C. Cir. 1987) . \nTo meet its burden, an agency may rely on declarations describing the applicability of a \nFOIA exemption to information that the agency has withheld.  See Shapiro v. DOJ , 893 F.3d \n \n1  The  Court has jurisdiction under 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(B) and 28 U.S.C. § 1331 . Case 1:21-cv-01624-TNM     Document 26     Filed 08/25/22     Page 3 of 144 \n 796, 799 (D.C. Cir. 2018).  Those declarations receive “a presumption of good faith.”  SafeCard \nServs., Inc. v. SEC , 926 F.2d 1197, 1200 (D.C. Cir. 1991).  The Court may grant summary \njudgment based solely on the agency’s declarations if they are unimpeached  by contrary record \nevidence or by evidence of the agency’s bad faith.   See Aguiar v. DEA , 865 F.3d 730, 734–35 \n(D.C. Cir. 2017) .  Most FOIA cases reso lve at this stage.  See AARC v. CIA, 317 F. Supp. 3d 394, \n399 (D.D.C. 2018), aff'd , 781 F ed. App ’x. 11 (D.C. Cir. 2019) (per curiam). \nKendrick proceeds pro se , so the Court “liberally construe[s]” his filings.  Erickson v. \nPardus , 551 U.S. 89, 94 (2007).  That accommodation does not, however, allow him “to ignore \nthe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.”  Oviedo v. WMATA , 948 F.3d 386, 397 (D.C. Cir. 2020) ; \nRaven v. Sajet , 334 F. Supp. 3d 22, 28 (D.D.C. 2018)  (noting that for pro se  plaintiffs, “ the \nultimate standard remains the same ”).  He st ill must show that a genuine issue of material fact \nexists as to whether the agency has inappropriately withheld records.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a).  \nIII. \nKendrick  challenges the adequacy of DEA’s search es and its invocation of FOIA \nexemptions .  See genera lly Pl.’s  Stmt.  of Undisputed Facts and Stmt. of Genuine Issues, ECF \nNo. 19- 3.  The Court first analyzes the searches  and then t he exemptions . \nA. \nFirst, the searches.  The adequacy of a search does not turn on “whether there might be” \nmore uncovered documents.  Kowalczyk v. DOJ, 73 F.3d 386, 388 (D.C. Cir. 1996) .  A search \ninstead is adequate if the agency shows that its search method “was reasonably calculated to \nuncove r all relevant documents.”  Oglesby v. Dep’t of Army , 920 F.2d 57, 68 (D.C. Cir. 1990) .  \nThe agency can carry its burden through affidavits “setting forth the search terms and the type of search performed[ ] and averring that all files likely to contain responsive materials  . . . were Case 1:21-cv-01624-TNM     Document 26     Filed 08/25/22     Page 4 of 145 \n searched [.]”  Id.   Any information about the agency’s search must be “specific enough to enable \n[plaintiffs] to challenge the procedures utilized.”  Weisberg v. DOJ, 627 F.2d 365, 371 (D.C. Cir. \n1980) .   \nOnce the agency has pro vided the necessary detail , the plaintiff must produce \n“countervailing evidence” showing a genuine dispute of material fact about the search’s  \nadequacy.  Iturralde v. Comptroller of Currency , 315 F.3d 311, 314–16 (D.C. Cir. 2003)  \n(cleaned up) .  Above all, “[i]f the record leaves substantial doubt as to the sufficiency of the \nsearch, summary judgment for the agency is not proper.” Kowalczyk , 73 F.3d at 388 (cleaned \nup).   \nAcross the two requests, DEA searched NADDIS, the Asset Forfeiture Section, the \nunnamed “electronic file room,” Hertel Decl. ¶  11, and the agency’s Office of Administration, \nInvestigative Records Unit.  Kendrick focuses most , however, on the destruction of  his paper \ninvestigative file.  DEA sent a search request for that file to the field office where the matter \noriginated.  See id. ¶  9.  Recall, however, that the office said it had destroyed the paper copies per  \nthe agency’s Record Management Schedule.  Se e id.  Kendrick says otherwise.  In his Complaint \nand his appeals within DOJ, he argued that DEA never destroys such files.  See Compl. ¶  25(6).  \nBut he includes no evidence supporting this assertion, relying instead on conclusory statements \nto rebut the agency’s declaration on this point.  Speculation is not enough to overcome the good -\nfaith presumption afforded that declaration.  Accord Eddington v. DOD , 35 F.4th 833, 839 (D.C. \nCir. 2022). \nMore, Kendrick has not refuted or otherwise questioned DEA’s later  search of the \nelectronic file room that yielded “a complete electronic version” of the investigative file.  Hertel Decl. ¶  11.  So even if DEA improperly destroyed the paper files, it has provided those files in Case 1:21-cv-01624-TNM     Document 26     Filed 08/25/22     Page 5 of 146 \n electronic form , complying with its duty to “search for the [requested] records in electronic form \nor format.”  5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(3)(C).  Because Kendrick does not refute that statement,2 the \nCourt credits it and rejects his assertion  that a genuine issue of material fact remains about the \ndestruc tion of  his paper file.  \nThat leaves the other three searches.  Kendrick never clearly states which of these he \nchallenges, instead asserting broadly that the agency never met its “duty to search for and locate \nrecords and documents.”  Pl.’s MSJ at 3 , ECF N o. 20; see also Pl.’s Reply at 7 (there is “a \ngenuine issue of material fact  . . . as to whether the DEA has conducted a reasonable search for \nresponsive records ”).3  Guided by the instruction to construe pro se filings broadly, see Erickson , \n551 U.S. at 94, the Court assumes that Kendrick challenges the adequacy of all other searches.  \nThe Court takes them in turn. \nFirst, the search of NADDIS.  When queried, that system allows DEA to locate any \n“intelligence and investigative records generat ed across all DEA offices.”  Hertel Decl. ¶  7.  The \nagency searches NADDIS through certain terms like a person’s “name, Social Security number, or date of birth.”  Id. ¶ 6.  NADDIS therefore is  a reasonable place to search for documents about \nKendrick.  An d the agency did so “using [Kendrick]’s name.”  Id.  ¶ 9.  Because the agency \nsearched a database likely to have responsive records and testifies that it used an appropriate search term, that search of NADDIS was adequate.  \nNot so for the searches of AFS and the Office of Administration.  To begin with, the  \n \n2  At most, Kendrick challenges the knowledge of Angela Hertel, the agency’s declarant.  See \nPl.’s Reply at 1, ECF No. 24.  His criticisms go nowhere.  Hertel “oversee[s] the processing” of \nFOIA requests and is therefore familiar with the agency’s “policies  and practices.”  Hertel Decl. \n¶ 2.  Thus, she “has a general familiarity with the responsive records and procedures used to \nidentify those records”  and is an adequate declarant.   Barnard v. DHS, 531 F. Supp. 2d 131, 138 \n(D.D.C. 2008).  \n   \n3  All page citat ions refer to the page numbers generated by the Court’s CM/ECF system.  Case 1:21-cv-01624-TNM     Document 26     Filed 08/25/22     Page 6 of 147 \n Court agrees with the agency that, because Kendrick sought records  about a seizure, AFS “was \nan appropriate office to search.”  Id.  ¶ 10.  But DEA says nothing more about how it conducted \nthat search.  It says that AFS used Kendrick’s “name ” to locate ten pages, but not  how it used his \nname to find those ten pages.  DEA’s declaration thus merely states the search’s results  without \n“information about its search strategies,” Morley v. CIA , 508 F.3d 1108, 1122 (D.C. Cir. 2007), \nor about  “how [ AFS] searched within” its own files , Aguiar , 865 F.3d at 738.  More, AFS \nunearthed more pages recently , creating “substantial doubt” as to the thoroughness of the initial \nAFS searches.  Kowalczyk , 73 F.3d at 388.  The Court therefore will grant Kendrick’s cross -\nmotion as to th e AFS search.  \nDitto the search of the Office of Administration.  About this searc h, DEA says that it \n“sent a search request to the Office of Administration, Investigative Records Unit , to locate the \nNADDIS Access Logs.  This search identified two (2) pages of records there were released in \npart via correspondence dated June 15, 2017.”  Hertel Decl. ¶  15.  That’s all.  Nothing about how \nthe Office located the logs or how this search was conducted .  Based on such a light record, the \nCourt cannot determine whether this search was adequate.  See DeBrew v. Atwood , 792 F.3d 118, \n122 (D.C. Cir . 2015).  The Court thus will grant Kendrick’s motion for summary judgment as to \nthis search.  Accord  Louise Trauma Ctr. v. DHS, No. 20- cv-1128 (TNM), 2022 WL 1081097, at \n*4 (D.D.C. Apr. 11, 2022) (granting plaintiff  summary judgment for search that agency di d not \nproperly describe).  \nB. \nThe Court now turns to the exemptions asserted by DEA.  Recall that the agency redact ed \ninformation under FOIA Exemptions 6, 7(C), 7(E) and 7(F).  T he agency must show why a \nparticular exemption applies .  But that is not all.  T he agency must also “reasonably foresee[] Case 1:21-cv-01624-TNM     Document 26     Filed 08/25/22     Page 7 of 148 \n that disclosure” of the material “would harm an interest protected” by a FOIA exemption.  5 \nU.S.C. § 552(a)(8)(A)(i)(I).   Agencies must articulate this foreseeable harm in a “focused and \nconcrete”  way .  Reps. Comm.  for Freedom of the Press v. FBI , 3 F.4th 350, 370 (D.C. Cir. 2021) .  \nBut even without a sufficient explanation from the agency, the “context and purpose” of withheld information can support a finding of foreseeable harm.  Id . at 372.  And as this Court \nexplained more fully in Reporters Committee  v. CBP , agencies can  more easily meet their \nforeseeable harm burden when invoking exemptions “for which the risk of harm through disclosure is more self -evident.”  567 F. Supp. 3d 97, 120 (D.D.C. 2021).  \nWith these principles in mind, the Court addresses DEA’s reliance on the various \nexemptions. \n1. \nFirst, a clarification on the exemptions at issue .  DEA invokes Exemption 6 and  \nExemption 7(C) , see Vaughn Index (VI), ECF No. 14- 4, which permit an agency to withhold \ninformation the disclosure of which would violate personal privacy, see Reps. Comm.  v. CBP , \n567 F. Supp. 3d at 125.  Though similar, 7(C) “provides broader privacy protections” and “thus establi shes a lower bar for withholding material.”   CREW v. DOJ , 854 F.3d 675, 681 (D.C. Cir. \n2017) .  So when agencies rely on both Exemptions 6 and 7(C) for the same material, the Court \nneed not “ consider Exemption 6 separately[.]”  Roth v. DOJ , 642 F.3d 1161, 1173 (D.C. Cir. \n2011) .  Here, DEA always invokes  the two exemptions in tandem.  See Hertel Decl. ¶  31.  The \nCourt thus considers only Exemption 7(C). \nWith Exemption 6 out of the picture, only Exemption 7 remains .  To justify \nnondisclosure under that Exemption, the withheld material must be compiled  “for law \nenforcement purposes .”  Shapiro v. DOJ , 893 F.3d 796, 800 (D.C. Cir. 2018) (cleaned up).  DEA Case 1:21-cv-01624-TNM     Document 26     Filed 08/25/22     Page 8 of 149 \n asserts that it gathered these records under its “law enforcement responsibility,” Hertel Decl. \n¶ 23, and as part of its “investigative authority” to enforce drug laws, id. ¶ 26.  Kendrick does not \nsay otherwise, so the Court considers only whether the  information meets the conditions of \nExemption 7’s subparts.  See ACLU v. DOJ, 655 F.3d 1, 6 (D.C. Cir. 2011). \n2. \nUnder 7(C), DEA redacted the names and other identifying information of third- party \nindividuals, including those of law enforcement personnel.  See Hertel Decl. ¶ 31.  That exemption covers  law enforcement records that “could reasonably be expected to constitute \nan unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.”  5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(7)(C).  “To determine whether an invasion of privacy is ‘unwarranted,’  courts balance the privacy interest against \nthe public interest in disclosure, including any potential interest in airing governmental misconduct.”  Prot . Democracy Project, Inc. v. N SA, 10 F.4th 879, 889 (D.C. Cir. 2021).   \nThe individuals have a more than cognizable privacy interest  here.  T he D.C. Circuit \nhas “consistently supported nondisclosure of names or other information identifying individuals appearing in law enforcement records, including investigators, suspects, witnesses, informants ,” Schrecker v. DOJ , 349 F.3d 657, 661 (D.C. Cir. 2003) , and “federal \ngovernment personnel,” CREW , 854 F.3d at 681; see also Blackwell v. FBI , 646 F.3d 37, 41 \n(D.C. Cir. 2011)  (“As a result of E xemption 7(C) , FOIA ordinarily does not require \ndisclosure of law enforcement documents (or portions thereof) that contain private \ninformation.” ).    \nThe Court now  “must balance the [substantial] privacy interests involved against the \npublic interest in disclosure .”  SafeCard Servs., Inc., 926 F.2d at  1205.  Kendrick bea rs the \nburden to show that interest.  See NARA v. Favish , 541 U.S. 157, 172 (2004) .  And the “only Case 1:21-cv-01624-TNM     Document 26     Filed 08/25/22     Page 9 of 1410 \n relevant public interest ” in the balancing analysis is “ the extent to which disclosure  . . . would \nshed light on an agency’s performance of its statutory duties or otherwise let citizens know \nwhat their government  is up to.”  EPIC v. DOJ , 18 F.4th 712, 720–21 (D.C. Cir. 2021)  \n(cleaned up) . \nKendrick suggest s no such interest.  He says instead that “he has a personal interest in \nobtaining the withheld documents and information . . . to help him fight his criminal case.”  Pl.’s Reply at 3.  That is indeed a weighty personal interest.  But such a  “personal stake in the \nrelease of the [redacted]  information i s irrelevant to the balancing ” required by 7(C).  Roth , \n642 F.3d at  1177;  see also DOD v. FLRA , 510 U.S. 487, 496 (1994)  (“[E]xcept in certain \ncases involving claims of privilege, the identity of the requesting party” and his motives simply have “no bearing on the merits” of a FOIA claim. ).     \nKendrick makes three other assertions , none persuasive .  First , he posits that the names \n“would not have been redacted if [the] documents were disclosed in discovery” and states that some names in fact were “released in the discovery of [his] 2000 State Drug Case.”  Pl.’s \nMSJ at 6.  Perhaps, but the FOIA analysis is entirely separate from discovery.  See Stonehill v. IRS , 558 F.3d 534, 538 –39 (D.C. Cir. 2009) ; cf. EPIC v. Nat.’ l Sec. Comm ’n on Artificial \nIntelligence , 466 F. Supp. 3d 100, 104 (D.D.C. 2020) (finding agency subject  to two se parate \ndisclosure regimes  under FACA and FOIA) . \nSecond, Kendrick  questions the purported redaction  of some DEA form number s.  See \nPl.’s Opp’n at 6.  DEA clarifies  that the redacted initials of DEA law enforcement personnel \n“happen to be on top of the DEA form numbers ,” so the agency redacted those initials, not \nthe form numbers.  Def.’s Reply at 6 , ECF No. 22 .  This is  acceptable under FOIA, which \npermits nondisclosure of non- exempt material when “inextricably intertwined with exempt Case 1:21-cv-01624-TNM     Document 26     Filed 08/25/22     Page 10 of 1411 \n portions.”  Evans v. Fed. Bureau of Prisons , 951 F.3d 578, 583 (D.C. Cir. 2020)  (cleaned up) .   \nFinally , Kendrick  contends that the redacted names are in the public domain.  See Pl.’s \nReply at 4 –6.  A n agency may not rely on a FOIA exemption to withhold information that is \nin the “public dom ain.”  Davis v. DOJ, 968 F.2d 1276, 1279 (D.C. Cir. 1992).  The  FOIA \nrequester  bears “ the initial burden of pointing to specific information in the public domain \nthat appears to duplicate that being withheld.”  Id . (cleaned up) .   \nKendrick does  nothing of the kind.  He merely offers  a long “list of witnesses [who]  \ntestified, for the Government” at his criminal trial “and who were also involved with the 2000 \ncase and/or [ i]nvestigation or work for the Rochester Police Department.”  Pl.’s Reply at 4 –5.  \nBecause FOIA disclosures are to the public at large, see Stonehi ll, 558 F.3d at 538, \nindividuals who testify at trial do not “waive the government’s right to invoke” exemptions in \nFOIA litigation .  Davis , 968 F.2d at 1281 (cleaned up).  And recall that  nondisclosure of the \nredacted names under Exemption 7(C) “r emains justified  where, as here, the public interest in \ndisclosure is virtually nonexistent.”  Id. at 1282.  More, the involvement of these names with \nhis case is not what DEA withheld.  The agency instead withheld their signatures and initial s \non forms an d paperwork.  Kendrick offers no reason to think those identifiers on these \nparticular documents are already in the public domain. \nThis brings us to the foreseeable harm from disclosure.  As this Court has noted, \nfulfilling the terms of exemptions outside  Exemption 5 “goes a long way to meeting the \nforeseeable harm requirement.”  Reps. Comm. v. CBP , 567 F. Supp. 3d at 127.  Given the \nlower burden, DEA says little but enough.  It asserts that disclosure would cause invasions of \nprivacy and would subject the  named individuals to “harassment,” “derogatory inferences,” \nand “suspicion.”  Hertel Decl. ¶  28.  “These predicted results of disclosure are exactly what Case 1:21-cv-01624-TNM     Document 26     Filed 08/25/22     Page 11 of 1412 \n Exemption 7(C) seeks to prevent[.]”  Ecol. Rts. Found. v. EPA , 541 F. Supp. 3d 34, 65–66 \n(D.D.C. 2021).  DEA has thus shown a risk of foreseeable harm from disclosure of this \ninformation and has therefore properly invoked Exemption 7(C). \n3. \nNext to Exemption 7(E), which protects information that “would disclose techniques \nand procedures for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions, or . . . guidelines for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions if such disclosure could reasonably be expected to risk circumven tion of the law.”  5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(7)(E).  DEA invoked the exemption to \nwithhold “sensitive case and file numbers, including NADDIS numbers and Geo- Drug \nEnforcement Program (G -DEP) identifiers.”  Hertel Decl. ¶ 33.   \nUnder this exemption, t he D.C. Circuit  has “set a relatively low bar for the agency,” \nrequiring it only to “ demonstrate logically how the release of the  requested information might \ncreate a risk of circumvention of the law.”  Blackwell, 646 F.3d at 42 ( cleaned up) .   \nDEA has done so.  It attests that disclosure of this information could identify “the \ninvestigative interest or priority given to such matters,” thereby  enabl ing suspects “to avoid \ndetection” or “apprehension” by changing “ their pattern of activity ” or creating “alibis for \nsuspected  activities.”   Hertel Decl. ¶  33.  “DEA’s redaction of G –DEP codes and NADDIS \nnumbers from records responsive to FOIA requests has been routinely upheld for [similar] reasons[.]”  McKneely v. DOJ , 132 F. Supp. 3d 44, 55 (D.D.C. 2015), aff ’d sub nom. \nMcKneely v. D EA, No. 15- 5317, 2016 WL 3040985 (D.C. Cir. May 5, 2016).  Kendrick does \nnot dispute DEA’s otherwise proper application of Exemption 7(E).  \nIn sum , the agency has shown a  self-evident risk of foreseeable harm .  If disclosed, \ncriminals could use these identifiers to change their activity and to evade detection.  See Case 1:21-cv-01624-TNM     Document 26     Filed 08/25/22     Page 12 of 1413 \n Hertel Decl. ¶  33.  DEA has t herefore met its burden on foreseeable harm.  The Court will \ngrant summary judgment to the agency on its withholdings under Exemption 7(E).  \n4. \nDEA also withheld information under Exemption 7(F) , which protects information that \n“could reasonably be expected  to endanger the life or physical safety of any individual.”   5 \nU.S.C. § 552(b)(7)(F).  But the agency relied on that exemption “always in conjunction with \nExemption[] 7(C).”  Hertel Decl. ¶ 35.  Because the Court upheld the assertion of 7(C), it need not consider whether DEA properly invoked 7(F).  See Larson v. Dep’t of State , 565 \nF.3d 857, 862–63 (D.C. Cir. 2009) (“[C]ourts may uphold agency action under one exemption without considering the applicability of the other.”).  \n5. \n To properly assert exemptions , DEA must  also “demonstrate that all reasonably \nsegregable material has been released.”  Johnson v. EOUSA , 310 F.3d 771, 776 (D.C. Cir. \n2002).  To meet this burden, the agency can rely on the combination of its declarations and Vaughn Ind ex.  See id.  The agency is also “entitled to a presumption that [it] complied with \nthe obligation to disclose reasonably segregable material.”  Sussman v. U.S. M arshals Serv., \n494 F.3d 1106, 1117 (D.C. Cir. 2007).  To overcome that presumption, Kendrick must provide a “quantum of evidence.”  Id.  \n DEA admittedly does not say much on segregability, but it says just enough.  The \nagency reviewed “[a]ll responsive informat ion” and withheld only that information that would \nimplicate one of the claimed exemptions.  Hertel Decl. ¶  38.  That is  barely enough to carry \nDEA’s burden.  And except for his argument about redacted file names, Kendrick marshals no evidence to overcome DEA’s representations about segregability.  The Court holds that DEA Case 1:21-cv-01624-TNM     Document 26     Filed 08/25/22     Page 13 of 1414 \n has fulfilled its segregability obligation.  \nIV. \nFor these reasons,  the Court  will grant  in part and deny in part both motions.  A \nseparate order will issue.  \n \n_____________________________   \nDated: August 25, 2022     TREVOR N. M cFADDEN, U.S.D.J.

Summary:**\nIn this case, Kevin Meehan filed a class action lawsuit against VIPKid and related entities alleging they conspired to use American teachers on its online platform to secretly collect biometric data without consent for developing AI and AGI. The court recommended dismissing the case and compelling arbitration due to arbitration agreements Meehan signed. The case prominently features AI as Meehan claims the defendants used facial recognition and AI-driven technologies to create \"virtual humans.\"\n\n**2. Key Legal Issue:**\nThe key legal issue is whether Meehan and other teachers’ biometric data was unlawfully collected and used by VIPKid and its affiliates as part of developing AI for future replacement of human teachers and whether this dispute falls under arbitration clauses in their contracts.\n\n**3. Court's Holding:**\nThe court recommended that Meehan's claims be dismissed and referred to arbitration based on arbitration clauses he agreed to in his contract with VIPKid. The court noted that issues about the validity and enforcement of these arbitration clauses should be decided by an arbitrator.\n\n**4. ELI5 Explanation:**\nImagine Meehan worked for a company teaching English to kids online. He found out they might have been secretly recording his facial movements to build robots that can teach like him. He sued, but the court said he signed a contract agreeing to settle disputes out of court, so they can't help him with the lawsuit. Instead, the matter has to be handled by a private judge-like arbitrator who will decide if the rules of the contract were fair.",

On December 30, 2020, the defendant VIPKid International, Inc. (“VIPKid Int’l.”) removed the action to this  Court pursuant \nto the Class Action Fairness Act of 2005 (“CAFA”), 28 U.S.C. § 1332(d).  On January 4, 2021, \nthe defendant Sequoia Capital Operations, LLC (“Sequoia Capital”) filed a Notice of Consent to the removal filed by VIPKid Int’l  and noted the existence of additional grounds for federal Case 2:20-cv-06370-JS-LGD     Document 91     Filed 08/29/23     Page 1 of 38 PageID #:\n<pageID>2 \n jurisdiction under the Fair Labor Standards Act (“FLSA”), 29 U.S.C. §§ 201 et seq .   On January \n29, 2021, Meehan moved to remand the action to the state court .  That motion was denied on \nSeptember 21, 2021. \nTwo days later, on September 23, 2021, the defendants, who are comprised of four \ngroups of multinational companies , all sought leave to file motions to dismiss.  However, by \norder dated October 25, 2021, District Judge Seybert denied the requests in an omnibus motion \nand granted Meehan leave to file an amended complaint .  The amended c omplaint was filed on  \nDecember 3, 2021.  On January 20 and 21, 2022, the four defendant groups then filed motions to dismiss the amended complaint pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1), 12(b)(2), 12(b)(5) and 12(b)(6).  The VIPKid companies  (referred to by the parties as the Dami \ndefendants) also sought to compel arbitration.  Th e motions were referred to the undersigned on \nApril 27, 2023 and are now before the Court.  For the reasons set forth below, the undersigned respectfully recommends that all four motions to dismiss be granted. \nBACKGROUND \n A. The Parties  \n Meehan is a New York resident who contracted with VIPKid HK to provide online services teaching English to children in China between October 2016 and June 2020.\n1  Am. \nCompl. ¶ 13.

He also asserts that BDT owns VIPKid’s English-\nlanguage website, www.vipkid.com, and at least nine VIPK id apps on Apple’s App Store.  Id.  ¶ \n55.  Meehan alleges that BDFT owns VIPKid’s Chinese language website, www.vipkid.com.cn.  \nId. ¶ 59.  As noted above, VIPKid HK, VIPKid Int’l, BDT and BDFT are collectively referred to \nby the parties as the Dami defendants.2   \n Tencent Holdings is a Chinese holding company incorporated in the Cayman Islands with a principal place of business in the People’s Republic of China.  Byun Decl. ¶ 2.  Tencent Holdings claims that it does not conduct business or have offices or employees in New York.  Id.  \n¶¶ 3-5.  Tencent Cloud is a Delaware limited liability company (“LLC”) with its principal place  \nof business in Delaware.  See Leong Decl. ¶ 2.  Tencent Cloud sells cloud services, which are \ngeneral computing, storage, and content delivery services provided by a centralized cloud provider.  Id.  ¶ 4.  Tencent Cloud similarly claims that it has  no offices or employees in New \nYork but acknowledges that it does have some limited business activities in  the state , including \nsome customers.  Id.  ¶¶ 5 -7.  Tencent A merica is a Delaware LLC with its principal place of \nbusiness in Palo Alto, California .  See Xu Decl. ¶¶ 2 -3.

It says that its New York activities are limited to  (1) reporting and editing \narticles regarding the financial industry within the United States; (2) developing business for Tencent within the United States; and (3) working with Tencent ’s customers and clients who are \n \n2 Meehan’s caption names other VIPKid entities – VIPKid, VIPK id Class HK Ltd.  and VIPTeach Inc.   However, it \nis clear from the papers that there are only four VIPKid entities at issue in this litigation.  Case 2:20-cv-06370-JS-LGD     Document 91     Filed 08/29/23     Page 3 of 38 PageID #:\n<pageID>4 \n based in the United States.  Id . ¶ 9.  Tencent  Holdings , Tencent Cloud and Tencent America are \ncollectively referred to as the Tencent defendants.    \n Meehan asserts  that Tencent Holdings has a multiyear partnership with VIP Kid HK.  Am. \nCompl. ¶ 28.  In fact, a ccording to the amended complaint, the Tencent divisions/departments \nthat partner with VIPKid HK include:  Tencent Youtu Lab, Tencent AI Open Platforms, Tencent \nEducation Business Forum, Tencent AI Labs and  Cloud and Smart Industries Group.  Id.  ¶ 35.  \nIn addition, Meehan alleges  that the “Tencent infrastructure” ensures that the VIPKid platform \nhas a smooth connection for efficient and seamless capture of data and videos, which enhances  \nuse of the platform for technological development .  Id. ¶ 30.  Meehan also alleges that VIPKid \nHK stores data on the Tencent Cloud and streams and stores recordings of VIPKid courses on Tencent  software/hardware.  Id.  ¶ 31.  Finally, Meehan claims that “ Tencent ” has infused \nhundreds of millions of dollars into VIPKid HK and its platform and that the Dami  defendants \nare disseminating the biometric data of VIPKid HK teachers through the Tencent  network.  Id.  ¶¶ \n34, 36.  In sharp contrast , the Tencent defendants con tend that Meehan has mistakenly sued \nthem.  Tencent Mem. at 1.  They claim  that none of the Tencent defendants have ever made any \ninvestment in or have any relationship of any kind with VIPKid HK.  Id. \n China Renaissance is a corporation organized under the laws of the Cayman Islands with its principal place of business in the People’s Republic of China.  See Yee Decl. ¶ 2.  China Renaissance is a financial institution that provides private placement and mergers and acquisitions advisory services, equity underwriting, sales and trading, research, and investment management.   Id. ¶ 3.  China Renaissance claims that it is not registered to do business nor does \nit own any real property in New York.  Id. ¶¶ 5, 6.   China Renaissance further notes that its \nexecutive and control functions are based in China and it has no employees in New York.  Id.  ¶ Case 2:20-cv-06370-JS-LGD     Document 91     Filed 08/29/23     Page 4 of 38 PageID #:\n<pageID>5 \n 4.  Meehan alleges that China Renaissance is VIPKid HK’s exclusive financial advisor and its \ncapital markets partner.  Am. Compl. ¶ 51.  He asserts that China Renaissance supports VIPKid HK by exploring the boundaries and possibilities of online education.  Id.  He also asserts that  \nChina Renaissance has advanced the “VIPKid Scheme” by actively shaping VIPKid HK so that \nits activities are responsive to the national policies of the Chinese government.  Id.  \n Sequoia Capital (“Sequoia”) is a Delaware corporation with headquarters in California. \nChang Decl. ¶ 3.   According to Sequoia, it does not have a physical location , own assets, have a \ntelephone number, or have any employees “who list their primary addresses as New York. ”  Id.  \n¶¶ 4-7.   In addition, Sequoia claims that it never negotiated or executed any contracts with \nVIPKid in New York .  Id. ¶ 8.   Meehan claims Sequoia is one of VIPKid’s earliest and most \nimportant strategic and financial partners.  Am. Compl. ¶ 43.  He alleges that Sequoia has played an active and key role in developing VIPKid HK, the VIPKid Platform and is a large part of the VIPKid Scheme.  Id.  ¶ 43.   Contrary to Meehan’s allegations, Sequoia attests  that it has never \ninvested directly in VIPKid  HK.  Chang Decl. ¶¶ 8-9.  Rather, it  advises two funds that have \ninvested in VIPKid HK.  Id.  But Sequoia says those funds also lack any meaningful connection \nto New York .  Id. \n Meehan refers to the Tencent defendants, China Renaissance and Sequoia collectively  as \nthe “Mastermind Defendants. ”  Am. Compl. ¶ 25. \n B. The Alleged VIPKid Scheme  \n The crux of Meehan’s complaint is that the defendants engaged in a conspiracy  (the \n“VIPKid Scheme ”) to fraudulently induce American teachers to work on the VIPKid educational \nplatform in order to harvest their biometric data without the ir teachers’ knowledge or consent.  \nId. ¶¶ 6-10, 76-8.  In fact, Meehan contends that the end goal of the VIPKid Scheme is to Case 2:20-cv-06370-JS-LGD     Document 91     Filed 08/29/23     Page 5 of 38 PageID #:\n<pageID>6 \n substitute “virtual humans” for “natural human teachers.”  Id. ¶ 18.  To this end, Meehan claims \nthat the Dami  defendants represented themselves as a vibrant and active community of teachers \noffering th e most exciting teaching work of the century.  Id. ¶ 124.  He says the defendants \ntargeted American public- school teachers,  who are known as being unsupported, low- wage \nearners , willing to pay out-of-pocket for school supplies.  Id.  ¶ 140; 159.  He further claims that \nthe Dami  defendants “psychologically profiled” teachers by appealing to their spiritual calling, \nclaiming the teachers would benefit spiritually  from teaching Chinese children online.  Id.  ¶¶ \n146, 150.   \n Meehan further alleges  that the employment agreement s he signed represented that the \nVIPKid platform would only be used “to enable Students to access the class  recordings for \neducational purposes...[and] by [ VIPK id HK] and its subsidiaries, affiliates, related  companies \nand licensees for marketing and promotional purposes.”3 Id. ¶ 105.  However,  he says that the \ndefendants had orchestrated a scheme to surreptitiously record and capture teachers’ facial movements and voices in order to develop facial recognition technology and artificial intelligence (“AI”) and to discover artificial general intelligence (“AGI”) necessary to create virtual humans.  Id. ¶ 24.  Meehan explains that VIPKid teachers were required to use a method of speaking called Total Physical Response, which is a slow, deliberate, exaggerated style of speaking and gesturing ideal for recording and capturing human speech and movements.  Id . ¶ \n90.  He also says that  VIPKid teachers were required to deliver classes by sticking to a specific \nscript and to use tools like digital stickers that mapped faces for pedagogical value.  Id . ¶¶ 92-3.   \n Meehan similarly  alleges that the defendants are s tockpiling recordings from American \npublic school students through VIPKid’s Lingo Bus program, which offers online Mandarin \n \n3 According to VIPKid HK, Meehan signed a series of Independent Contractor Agreements between 2016 and 2020.  \nVIPKid HK Mem. at Ex. A.  Case 2:20-cv-06370-JS-LGD     Document 91     Filed 08/29/23     Page 6 of 38 PageID #:\n<pageID>7 \n courses through a game-based curriculum run.  Id . ¶ 98.  Finally, Meehan states  that given the \nnumber of school-age children in China, the Dami  defendants’ lack of effort to expand their \ncohort of natural teachers evinces  the defendants’ inte nt to use virtual teachers  in the future.  See \nid. ¶¶ 95-6.   \n C. Allegations Concerning Meehan’s Employment Terms and Work Conditions \n The amended complaint, which has been cut down to 25 pages and 201 paragraphs from \nits original 92 -pages and 600 plus paragraphs, still includes employment claims under the F air \nLabor S tandards Act (“FSLA”)  and the New York Labor Law (“NYLL ”) on behalf of a putative \nclass  which is defined as “all current  and former VIPKid Teachers .” However, the amended \ncomplaint contains only scant details concerning Meehan’s own employment history.  Am. Compl. ¶¶ 173-201.  Meehan alleges that the defendants represented that V IPKid teachers could \nwork as much or as little as they wanted, could take breaks or go on vacation, could retain complete control over their schedule and could earn $1,000 to $2,000 per month.  Id.  ¶ 148.  But \nhe does not specify the number of hours he actually work ed or indicate how much or the manner \nin which he was paid.  Instead, h e simply includes the following generic statement:   \n[The Dami defendants] failed to pay VIPKid Teachers additional or higher \nwages because of their spread of hours, including overtime wages for all the \nhours that they worked in excess of 40 hours in a work week and additional compensation of one hour's pay at the basic minimum hourly wage rate for each day during which they worked more than 10 hours. \n Id. ¶ 192.\n4 \n In addition, without providing specifics as to the actual hours worked, Meehan complain s \nthat VIPKid t eachers were required to engage in unpaid, off-the-clock work preparing for \n \n4 In his affidavit, submitted in opposition to the motions, Meehan adds that his work schedule as a VIPKid t eacher \nwas inflexible and rigid.   Meehan Aff. ¶ 14.  He also states that he was paid 8 USD and 1 -2 USD based on various \nincentives.  Id. ¶¶  14 , 15. Case 2:20-cv-06370-JS-LGD     Document 91     Filed 08/29/23     Page 7 of 38 PageID #:\n<pageID>8 \n courses, producing post-lesson reports, and  offering  corrections for VIPKID mater ials and that \ntheir wages were subject to deduction if they did not complete tasks.  Id.  ¶ 181 , 186-87.  Again, \nwithout reference to his own employment history, he additionally asserts that  the Dami  \ndefendants owe each of their employees up to fifty-six hours of paid sick leave for each calendar \nyear they worked.  Id. ¶ 193.  Lastly, Meehan claims that VIPK id teachers were penalized and \ndischarged when they complained about the Dami  defendants’ conduct but he does not make \nclear  if he was one of the teacher s against whom the defendants  allegedly retaliated.  Id.  ¶ 194. \n D. The Independent Contractor Agreements  \n Although Meehan contends that he was wrongfully classified as an independent \ncontractor, he implicitly acknowledges  that he entered into a series of agreements, entitled \nIndependent Contractor Agreements (the “ ICAs ”), with VIPKid HK.  See id. ¶ 177.  The \ndefendants have provided the Court with a copy of the ICA.  Among other things, the ICAs  \nprovided for the resolution of certain disputes through final and binding arbitration on an individual basis.  Specifically, Meehan’s most recent ICA stated : \nIMPORTANT :  PLEASE REVIEW THIS AGREEMENT FULLY.  IN \nPARTICULAR, PLEASE REVIEW THE ARBITRATION PROVISION IN \nSECTION 13, AS IT REQUIRES THE PARTIES TO RESOLVE DISPUTES ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTE D \nBY LAW, THROUGH FINAL AND BINDING ARBITRATION.  BY ELECTRONICALLY EXECUTING THIS AGREEMENT, TEACHER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT TEACHER HAS READ AND UNDERSTOOD ALL OF THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING SECTION 13, AND HAS TAKEN TIME TO CONSIDER THE CONSEQUENCES OF EXECUTING THIS AGREEMENT.  \n \n *  *  * \n 13.  A RBITRATION PROVISION  \n A.  ARBITRATION OF CLAIMS:  In the event of a dispute between the \nparties, the parties  agree to resolve the dispute as described in this Section (the \n\"Arbitration Provision'). This Arbitration Provision is gove rned by the Federal Case 2:20-cv-06370-JS-LGD     Document 91     Filed 08/29/23     Page 8 of 38 PageID #:\n<pageID>9 \n Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. § 1, et seq.) and evidences a transaction involving \ncommerce.   The parties expressly agree that this Arbitration Provision shall be \ngove rned by the Federal Arbitrati on Act even in the event [teacher] and/or \n[VIPK id] are otherwise e xempted from the Federal Arbitra tion Act. Any  \ndisputes in this regard shall be resolved exclusively by an Arbitrator. In the event, but only in the event, the Arbitrator determines the Federal Arbitration Act does not apply, the state law gove rning arbitration agreements in the state \nin which [teacher] performs the  majority of services covered by this \nAgreement shall apply. This Arbitration Provision applies to any past, existing or future claim, regardless of the date of its accrual, brought by either [teacher] or [VIPK id], arising out of or related to this Agreement, [teacher’s]  \nrelationship  with [ VIPK id HK] , including without limitation, [teacher’s]   \nclassification as an  independent contractor or termination of the relationship \nwith [ VIPK id HK], and [teacher’s] provision of services to Students, whether \narising under federal, state, or local law. The terms of this Arbitration  \nProvision will remain in force after the  parties'  contractual  relationship  ends. \nExcept as it otherwise provides, this Ar bitration  Provision is intended to apply \nto the resolution of disputes that otherwise would be resolved in a cou rt of l aw \nor before any forum other than arbitration. THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION REQUIRES ALL SUCH DISPUTES TO BE RESOLVED ONLY BY AN ARBITRATOR  THROUGH FINAL AND BINDING \nARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS, AND NOT BY WAY OF COURT OR JURY.  i. Claims Covered by Arbitration Provision. Unless carved out below, claims involving the following disputes shall be subject to arbitration under this Arbitra tion Provision regardless of whether brought by [teacher], [VIPKid HK] \nor any agent acting on behalf of either. (1) disputes arising out of or related to this Agreement; (2) disputes arising out of or related to [teacher’s] relationship \nwith [VIPKid  HK], i ncluding without limitation, disputes concerning \n[teacher’s] classification as an independent contractor, termination  of the \nrelationship with [ VIPK id HK]; (3) TEACHER's provision of services to \nStudents . . ..  This Arbitration Provision also applies to . . . claims arising under . . .Fair Labor Standard Act . . . and all other federal, state and/or local statutory and legal or common law claims (including, without limitation, torts) arising out of or relating to this Agreement, [and] the [teacher’s] relationship \nwith [VIPKid  HK] . . .. \n \nDami  Mem. Ex. A. \n  E. Meehan’s Demand for Arbitration  \n According to the Dami  defendants, in July 2020, Meehan, from his home in Thailand, \nfiled a demand for arbitration with  JAMS in New York, claiming wrongful termination of his Case 2:20-cv-06370-JS-LGD     Document 91     Filed 08/29/23     Page 9 of 38 PageID #:\n<pageID>10 \n services by VIPKid HK a s well as  other mistreatment by the company.  Dami Mem. at 1.  In fact, \nit is undisputed that Meehan and VIPKid HK jointly selected Caroline Antonacci  (“Antonacci” ) \nto serve as the arbitrator  and she issued a Preliminary Order finding that “[t]here [were] no issues \nas to the arbitrability of [the] dispute.” Id.  In that same  Order, Antonacci directed  Meehan to  \n“provi de a more definite Statement of Claims or an A mended  Demand for Arbitration specifying \nhis claims, the alleged legal violations and governing law, and his damages.” Id. Ex. C.  \nHowever, according to the Dami defendants , Meehan did not comply with Antonacci’s  \ndirectives.   Id. at 1.  Instead, Meehan commenced this action in the New York State Supreme \nCourt.  Id.  at 1.   \n Meehan claims the arbitration has been closed since December 2020.  Meehan Aff. ¶ 17.  He states that  it is closed because the arb itrator found “ no cognizable claims.”  Id. ¶ 18.  Meehan \nalso describes Antonacci’s order as leaving the door open for him to submit a new demand letter.  Id. ¶ 19.  F. The Amended Complaint  \n The operative pleading includes six causes of action.  Specifically, Meehan alleges  that: \n \n(1) he was falsely classified as an  independent contractor and fraudulently \ninduced to work as a teacher (Fraud in the Inducement) ;  \n (2) the defendants defrauded him into continuing as a VIPK id teacher by \nmisrepresent ing the opportunities and benefits of working as a VIPKid t eacher  \nbut omitting that VIPKid teacher’s personal data was being harvested (Common Law Fraud);   (3) the defendants took his biometric data while  he was working as a VIPK id \nteacher (Conversion);  \n (4) the defendants engaged in unlawful and deceptive consumer-oriented practices when they took his biometric data ( Violation of N.Y. Gen. Bus. Law \n§§ 349 & 350);   Case 2:20-cv-06370-JS-LGD     Document 91     Filed 08/29/23     Page 10 of 38 PageID #:\n<pageID>11 \n (5) he was not paid in compliance with the NYLL  (Violation of the NYLL) ; \nand  \n \n(6) he was not paid in compliance with the FLSA (Violation of the FLSA). \n   See Am. Compl ¶¶ 118-201. \nDISCUSSION  \n A. Standards of Review  \n 1. 12(b)(1)  \n Under Rule 12(b)(1) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (“Fed. R. Civ. P.”), a federal \ncourt must dismiss a claim when it lacks jurisdiction over the subject matter of the action.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1); see also Makarova v. United States , 201 F.3d 110, 113 (2d Cir. 2000) \n(“A case is properly dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under Rule 12(b)(1) when the district court lacks the statutory or constitutional power to adjudicate it.”).  The party asserting subject matter jurisdiction  has the burden to prove the Court's jurisdiction by a \npreponderance of the evidence.  See Vailette v. Lindsay, No. 11- cv-3610, 2014 WL 4101513, at \n*3 (E.D.N.Y. Aug. 18, 2014).  In deciding a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, the Court must assume that all factual allegations in the complaint are true and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the non-moving party.  C.K. v. Bd. of Educ. of the Westhampton Beach Sch. Dist ., 185 F. \nSupp. 3d 317, 324 (E.D.N.Y. 2016).  However, the Court may refer to evidence outside the pleadings, such as affidavits, to resolve the jurisdictional issue.  Forbes v. State Univ. of New York at Stony Brook, 259 F. Supp. 2d 227, 231-32 (E.D.N.Y. 2003).  2. Rule 12(b)(2)   \n Rule 12(b)(2) authorizes a party to seek dismissal on the ground that the Court lacks personal jurisdiction over it.  See Eyeking, LLC v. JSS, LLC , 321 F. Supp. 3d 326, 329 (E.D.N.Y. Case 2:20-cv-06370-JS-LGD     Document 91     Filed 08/29/23     Page 11 of 38 PageID #:\n<pageID>12 \n 2018).  In such cases, “‘ [t]he plaintiff bears the burden of demonstrating personal jurisdiction \nover the person or entity being sued.’” Out of Blue Wholesale, LLC v. Pac. Am. Fish Co. Inc., \nNo. 19- CV-0254, 2019 WL 3997393, *3 (E.D.N.Y. Aug. 23, 2019) (quoting State of N.Y. v. \nMountain Tobacco Co., No. 12- CV-6276, 2016 WL 324970, at *4 (E.D.N.Y. Jan. 26, 2016)).  \nHowever, “ [w]here, as here, a district court in adjudicating a [Rule 12(b)(2)] motion . . . ‘relies \non the pleadings and affidavits, and chooses not to conduct a full- blown e videntiary hearing, [the \nplaintiff ] need only make a prima facie  showing of personal jurisdiction.’” S. New England Tel. \nCo. v. Glob. NAPs Inc., 624 F.3d 123, 138 (2d Cir. 2010) (quoting Porina v. Moward Shipping Co., 521 F.3d 122, 126 (2d Cir. 2008)).   \n As with the Rule 12(b)(1) motion, the materials presented by the plaintiff should be construed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff and all doubts resolved in the plaintiff’s  \nfavor.   See A.I. Trade Fin., Inc. v. Petra Bank , 989 F.2d 76, 79–80 (2d Cir.  1993).  In addition, \nwhere a case has been brought in federal court based on the diversity of the parties, the law of the forum in which the court sits is determinative.  See Kronisch v. United States , 150 F.3d 112, 130 \n(2d Cir. 1998) (declaring that a federal court's personal jurisdiction over a non-resident defendant is governed by the law of the forum state, subject to certain constitutional limitations of due process).   Accordingly, in this case, New York law applies and, in order to establish personal \njurisdiction over a defendant, a plaintiff must present evidence to satisfy three elements : “(1) \nprocedurally proper service of process on the defendant; (2) a statutory basis for personal jurisdiction; and (3) the exercise of jurisdiction . . . consistent with constitutional due process principles.” Roxx Allison Ltd. v. Jewelers Inc ., 385 F. Supp. 3d 377, 380 (S.D.N.Y 2019) \n(quoting Quinio v. Aala, 344 F. Supp. 3d 464, 479–80 (E.D.N.Y. 2018)).    3.

(quoting Cassano v. Altshuler, 186 F. Supp. 3d 318, 320 \n(S.D.N.Y. 2016)).  In addition, “‘ [o]nce a defendant challenges the sufficiency of service of \nprocess, the burden of proof is on the plaintiff to show the adequacy of service. ’” Id. (quoting \nVantone Grp. Ltd. Liab. Co. v. Yangpu Ngt Indus. Co., No. 13- CV-7639 (LTS), 2016 WL \n3926449, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. July 15, 2016) ). \n 4. Rule 12(b)(6)  \n In order to survive a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), a complaint must allege a \nplausible set of facts sufficient “to raise a right to relief above the speculative level. ”  See \nSwiatkowski v. Citibank , 745 F. Supp. 2d 150, 162 (E.D.N.Y. 2010), aff'd, 446 F. App'x 360 (2d \nCir. 2011) (citing Operating Local 649 Annuity Trust Fund v. Smith Barney Fund Mgmt. LLC, 595 F.3d 86, 91 (2d Cir. 2010)).  The Supreme Court clarified the appropriate pleading standard in Ashcroft v. Iqbal , 556 U.S. 662 (2009), in which the court set forth a two-pronged approach to \nbe utilized in analyzing a motion to dismiss.  District courts are to first “identify [ ] pleadings that, because they are no more than conclusions, are not entitled to the assumption of truth.”  Id.  \nat 679.  Though “legal conclusions can provide the framework of a complaint, they must be supported by factual allegations.”  Id .  Second, if a complaint contains “ well- pleaded factual \nallegations, a court should assume their veracity and then determine whether they plausibly give rise to an entitlement to relief. ”  Id.   “A claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads \nfactual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable Case 2:20-cv-06370-JS-LGD     Document 91     Filed 08/29/23     Page 13 of 38 PageID #:\n<pageID>14 \n for the misconduct alleged.  The plausibility standard is not akin to a ‘probability requirement,’ \nbut it asks for more than a sheer possibility that a [d]efendant has acted unlawfully.”  Id.  at 678 \n(citing Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly , 550 U.S. 544, 556-57 (2007) (internal citations omitted)).   \n Unlike the first three Rules described above, “[a]  court considering a motion to dismiss \nunder Rule 12(b)(6) generally limits its review ‘to the facts as asserted within the four corners of the complaint, the documents attached to the complaint as exhibits, and any documents incorporated in the complaint by reference.’ ” Florimon v. Allstate Ins. Co., 616 F. Supp. 3d 180, \n185 (D. Conn. 2022 (citing McCarthy v. Dun & Bradstreet Corp., 482 F.3d 184, 191 (2d Cir. 2007)).  However, “[w] here a document is not incorporated by reference, the court may \nnevertheless consider it where the complaint ‘relies heavily upon its terms and effect,’ thereby rendering the document ‘integral’ to the complaint.” Nicosia v. Amazon.com, Inc., 834 F.3d 220, 230–31 (2d Cir. 2016).  “ A ‘necessary prerequisite’ for taking into account materials extraneous \nto the complaint is that the ‘plaintiff rely on the terms and effect of the document in drafting the complaint .’” Id. (quoting Global Network Commc'ns, Inc. v. Cit y of New York, 458 F.3d 150, 156 \n(2d Cir. 2006)).  “This generally occurs when [, as here,]  the material considered is a ‘ contract . . . \ncontaining obligations upon which the plaintiff's complaint stands or falls, but which for some reason —usually because the document, read in its entirety, would undermine the legitimacy of \nthe plaintiff's claim—was not attached to the complaint.”\n5 Id.  \n 5. Motion to Compel Arbitration  \n Lastly , where a movant manifests an intent to compel arbitration , the Court may treat  a \nmotion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) as a motion to compel arbitration.6  Gilbert v. \n \n  5 Meehan attached two of the ICA’s to the original complaint as exhibits an d argued that the arbitration provisions \nwere unenforceable.  He choose to omit them from his amended complaint.   \n6 Many “courts in this district and elsewhere have held that motions to compel arbitration are properly brought \nunder Rule 12(b)(1), which pe rmits a court to dismiss a case for ‘lack of subject -matter jurisdiction.’”  Case 2:20-cv-06370-JS-LGD     Document 91     Filed 08/29/23     Page 14 of 38 PageID #:\n<pageID>15 \n Indeed, Inc., 513 F. Supp. 3d 374, 390 (S.D.N.Y. 2021).  “Courts deciding motions to compel \narbitration ‘ apply a ‘standard similar to that ap plicable for a motion for summary judgment.’” \nZachman v. Hudson Valley Fed. Credit Union, 49 F.4th 95, 101 (2d Cir. 2022) (citing Nicosia, 834 F.3d at 229).   Specifically, “‘ [i]f the undisputed facts in the record require the matter of \narbitrability to be decided against one side or the other as a matter of law, [the Court] may rule \non the basis of that legal issue and avoid the need for further court proceedings.’ ” Id. (citing  \nMeyer v. Uber Techs., Inc.,  868 F.3d 66, 74 (2d Cir. 2017)).  “If, however, there is an issue of \nfact as to the making of the agreement for arbitration, . . . a trial is necessary. ” (citing  9 U.S.C. § \n4).   \n As such, “ [w]hen resolving a motion to compel arbitration, a court must fir st determine \nwhether there is a valid agreement to arbitrate between the parties.”  Mineola Garden City Co., Ltd. Bank of Am., No. 13–CV –05615, 2014 WL 2930467, at *2 (E.D.N.Y. June 26, 2014) (citing \n9 U.S.C. § 4).  “The question of whether the parties have agreed to arbitrate, i.e ., the ‘question of \narbitrability, ’ is an issue for judicial determination unless the parties clearly and unmistakably \nprovide otherwise. ” Nicosia., 834 F.3d at  229.  If the Court finds that such an agreement exists, \nthe Court must then determine whether the dispute at issue falls within the scope of the arbitration clause.  Id.; see also In re Am. Express Fin. Advisors Sec. Litig., 672 F.3d 113, 128 \n(2d Cir. 2011) (setting forth two- part test).  \n \nAm. E Grp. LLC v. Livewire Ergogenics Inc., 432 F. Supp. 3d 390, 400 (S.D.N.Y. 2020) .  However, at least one \ncourt in this circuit has suggested that “because the FAA does not confer jurisdiction, a motion to compel is not \nproper under Rule 12(b)(1). ”  Id.  Nonetheless, an arbitration agreement is most certainly a forum selection clause \nand, thus, a motion to compel arbitration can, in any case, be treated as a motion to dismiss  for failure to state a \nclaim upon which relief can be granted.  Id. (citing Palcko v. Airborne Express, Inc.,  372 F.3d 588, 597 (3d Cir. \n2004)).  \n Case 2:20-cv-06370-JS-LGD     Document 91     Filed 08/29/23     Page 15 of 38 PageID #:\n<pageID>16 \n  Finally, on a motion to dismiss and/or compel arbitration, the Court may also take notice \nof public filings and documents integral to the complaint.  Cortec Indus. v. Sum Holding L.P., 949 F.2d 42, 47 (2d Cir. 1991).  All of the defendants contend that a number of grounds exist to dismiss the amended \ncomplaint.  Each of the defendants’ motions will be addressed in turn.  B. The Dami Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss and to Compel Arbitration  \n The first argument asserted by the Dami defendants is that the claims against them must \nbe dismissed because Meehan agreed to arbitrate his claims.  The Court, therefore, begins its analysis with a review of the law governing arbitration provisions.  The F ederal Arbitration Act \n(“FAA”)  “was originally enacted in 1925, 43 Stat. 883, and then reenacted and codified in 1947 \nas Title 9 of the United States Code. ” Gilmer v. Interstate/Johnson Lane Corp., 500 U.S. 20, 24, \n111 S. Ct. 1647, 1651, 114 L. Ed. 2d 26 (1991).  “Its purpose was to reverse the longstanding judicial hostility to arbitration agreements that had existed at English common law . . . and to place arbitration agreements upon the same footing as other contracts .” Id.  Indeed, section 1 of \nthe FAA expresses the strong federal policy favoring arbitration.\n  Siegel v. Milstein , No. 21- CV-\n4032 (JS)(SIL), 2021 WL 5052748, at *2 (E.D.N.Y. Nov. 1, 2021)  (citing Ragone v. Atl. Video \nat Manhattan Ctr., 595 F.3d 115, 121 (2d Cir. 2010) ).    \n As noted above, “ [t]he threshold question in any arbitration dispute is ‘whether an \narbitration agreement exists at all. ’” Gonzalez v. Cheesecake Factory Restaurants, Inc.,  No. \n21CV5017PKCSIL, 2023 WL 2477697, at *1 (E.D.N.Y. Mar. 13, 2023) (citing Abdullayeva v. Attending Homecare Servs. LLC , 928 F.3d 218, 223 (2d Cir. 2019) ).  Meehan does not dispute \nthat the ICAs he signed contain a valid agreement to arbitrate.  In fact, implicitly  acknowledging \nthe existence of the agreements, he claims that he was misclassified as an independent Case 2:20-cv-06370-JS-LGD     Document 91     Filed 08/29/23     Page 16 of 38 PageID #:\n<pageID>17 \n contractor.  Accordingly, t he sole issue for the Court to determine  is whether those arbitration \nclauses encompass his claims.    \n In this case,  the arbitration provision contained in each of the ICAs clearly covers a wide \nrange of disputes including: disputes arising out of or related to the ICA ; disputes related to  \nMeehan’s  relationship with VIPKid  HK ( including, disputes concerning his classification as an \nindependent contractor or the termination of his relationship with  the company); disputes under \nthe Fair Labor Standard Act and disputes governed by federal, state and/or local statutory or \ncommon law claims inc luding torts .  Dami Mem. Ex. A.   To the extent Meehan has asserted \nclaims for fraud  in the inducement, in addition to his statutory and other tort claims, the \ndefendants correctly note that “claims of fraud in the inducement of the contract  [containing the \narbitration provision] generally are for  arbitrators to decide.” Dowe v. Leeds Brown Law , 419 F. \nSupp. 3d 748 (S.D.N.Y 2019) ; Prima Paint Corp. v. Flood & Conklin Mfg. Co., 388 U.S. 395, \n406 (1967) ( finding that arbitration agreement encompassed claim th at agreement itself was \nprocured by fraud).  Moreover, the ICA s at issue  provide that the determination of whether a particular  claim \nfalls within the scope of the arbitration provision is to be decided by an arbitrator.  Specifically, \nthe ICA states:  \nUnless carved out below, claims involving the following disputes shall be \nsubject  to arbitration under this Arbitration Provision . . . (4) . . . disputes \narising out of or relating to the interpretation or application of this Arbitration Provision, including the validity, enforceability, revocability, conscionability, scope, or breach of the Arbitration Provision, or any portion of the Arbitration Provision. \n Dami Mem. Ex. A.  W here “parties explicitly incorporate rules that empower an arbitrator to \ndecide issues of  arbitrability, the incorporation serves as clear and unmistakable evidence of the Case 2:20-cv-06370-JS-LGD     Document 91     Filed 08/29/23     Page 17 of 38 PageID #:\n<pageID>34 \n  Moreover, China Renaissance has clarified that the subsidiary to which Meehan refers in \nthe amended complaint does not exist.   See Yee Decl. ¶  8.  It seems Meehan intended to \nreference China Renaissance Securities US, which is  a wholly owned subsidiary of China \nRenaissance,  incorporated in New York.15  See Yee Decl. ¶ 9.  Disregarding the  typographical \nerror in the pleading, Meehan , nonetheless, has only asserted,  in the most ge neral sense, that \nChina R enaissance is operating in New York through a subsidiary.  Notably, t he amended \ncomplaint lacks any  facts concerning the actual activities of the subsidiary that are being \nconducted in the state  or how those activities are connected to  China Renaissance’s alleged \nrelationship with VIPKid HK .  Without more, the “[m]ere ownership by a parent company of a \nsubsidiary that is subject to personal jurisdiction is insufficient to establish jurisdiction over the  \nparent.” Moreau v. RPM, Inc ., 20 A.D.3d 456, 457, 799 N.Y.S.2d 113, 114 (2005).   \n Similarly , although Meehan now alleges , in his opposition, that VIPKid HK is receiving  \n“cooperation” from China Renaissance Securities (US), Inc. , standing alone, this allegation falls  \nshort of what would be needed to establish long arm jurisdiction .  The only information offered \nby Meehan regarding the nature of this cooperation is that, according to his research, China Renaissance Securities US was formed to provide th ird-party research to institutional customers \nin the United States on companies based in China and Hong Kong.  Meehan Mem. (ECF No. 78) at 15.  However, he offers no suggestion as to how that “ research ” may be connected  to the \nconduct of VIPKid HK that caused his alleged injuries.  See Daimler AG  , 571 U.S. at  139, 134 \nS. Ct. at  761.  As noted above, there must be an articulable nexus or substantial relationship \nbetween the business transaction and the claim asserted .  See Wilson, 2023 WL 1072513, at *2; \nSPV Osus Ltd. v. UBS AG, 882 F.3d 333, 343-44 (2d Cir. 2018)(“Where the defendant has had \n \n15 According to China Renaissance, China Renaissance Securities US  maintains its own books and records and has \nnever contracted with or employed Meehan.  Yee Decl. ¶¶ 9-12. Case 2:20-cv-06370-JS-LGD     Document 91     Filed 08/29/23     Page 34 of 38 PageID #:\n<pageID>35 \n only limited contacts with the state it may be appropriate to say that he will be subject to suit in \nthat state only if the plaintiff's injury was proximately caused by those contacts.”).  Whatever connection there may be between China Renaissance, China Renaissance Securities (US), Inc., VIPKid HK and New York, the allegations in the amended complaint as to that relationship a re \nfar too tenuous to support the exercise of specific jurisdiction under section 302(a)(1).  Similarly, even if the Court were to accept  Meehan’s  allegations as true, Meehan cannot \nestablish jurisdiction over China Renaissance for the alleged torts that occurred in New York.   \nAs explained above, section 302(a)(2) typically requires that a defendant be  physically present in \nNew York while committing the tortious act.   See LaChapelle , 1 F. Supp. 3d at 169.  There is \nabsolutely no evidence that China Renaissance was present in New York when it provided financial advice to or capital support for VIPKid HK.  In addition, w hile C.P.L.R. § 302(a)(3) \ncan extend jurisdiction to non- domiciliar ies who commit tortious acts outside of the state , a \nplaintiff relying on § 302(a)(3 ) must make  a showing that the non- domicili ary expected  or should \nreasonably have expect ed the act to have consequences in the state.  Bank Brussels Lambert , 171 \nF.3d at  790.  Again, there is nothing in the record upon which the Court could  infer  that China \nRenaissance should have reasonably expected that their political and financial support for \nVIPKid HK would result in the consequences alleged in the complaint, that being, the ability of VIPKid HK to  trick  American teachers into working on its  teaching platform in order to \nsurreptitiously record and capture the teachers’  facial movements and voices.  For these reasons , \nthe undersigned further recommends that the claims against China Renaissance be dis missed.  \n E. Sequoia’s Motion to Dismiss \n Finally, the undersigned addresses the motion to dismiss filed by Sequoia, in which it too \nargues that there is no basis for personal jurisdiction.  As previously indicated, Sequoia is a Case 2:20-cv-06370-JS-LGD     Document 91     Filed 08/29/23     Page 35 of 38 PageID #:\n<pageID>36 \n Delaware venture capital firm headquarter ed in California. Chang Decl. ¶ ¶ 2, 3.   Like many of \nits co -defendants,  Sequoia does not have a physical location, own assets, have a telephone \nnumber, have a bank account, or have any employees who list their primary addresses as New \nYork.  Id . ¶¶ 4 -7.   In fact, while Meehan describes Sequoia as  one of “ VIPKid’s earliest and \nmost important strategic and financial partners ,” see Am. Compl. ¶ 43, its Deputy Chief \nCompliance Officer has attested that Sequoia has never interacted, executed contracts or communicated with VIPKid HK in New York.  Chang Decl. ¶ 8.  In addition, contrary to the \nbroad suggestion that it is a financial partner, Sequoia insists it has never invested directly in VIPKid HK.  To this end, Sequoia attests that its sole involvement with VIPKid HK lies in the fact that it advises two investment funds that have invested in the company.  Id . ¶ 9.   \n As the undersigned h as now repeated several times, in order to be subject to personal \njurisdiction under N.Y. C.P.L.R. § 302(a)(1), a defendant has to have “performed purposeful acts in New York.” Jonas v. Est. of Leven, 116 F. Supp. 3d 314, 325 (S.D.N.Y. 2015) (citing Bonsey v. Kates , 13 Civ. 2708, 2013 WL 4494678, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 21, 2013) ).  “Purposeful \nactivities are volitional acts by which the non -domiciliary ‘avails itself of the privilege of \nconducting activities within the forum State, thus invoking the benefits and protections of its laws.’” Id.  (quoting Paterno v. Laser Spine Inst., 24 N.Y.3d 370, 376, 998 N.Y.S.2d 720, 23 \nN.E.3d 988 (2014)).  In other words, m ore than limited contacts  are required to establish that the \nnondomiciliary transacted business in the state.  Id .   \n Notably, the Second Circuit has established four factors for courts to consider when determining whether a defendant’s contacts with New York are sufficient  to confer jurisdiction \nunder section  302(a)(1): \n(i) whether the defendant has an on-going contractual relationship with a New \nYork corporation; (ii) whether [a]  contract was negotiated or executed in New Case 2:20-cv-06370-JS-LGD     Document 91     Filed 08/29/23     Page 36 of 38 PageID #:\n<pageID>37 \n York and whether, after executing a contract with a New York business, the \ndefendant has visited New York for the purpose of meeting with parties to the contract regarding the relationship; (iii) what the choice-of- law clause is in any \nsuch contract; and (iv) whether the contract requires . . . payments into the forum state or subjects [defendants] to supervision . . . in the forum state.  \n Id. (citing Sunward Elecs., Inc. v. McDonald, 362 F.3d 17, 22 (2d Cir.2004)).  None of these \nfactors weigh in Meehan’s favor.   Meehan does not allege that  Sequoia has an ongoing \ncontract ual relationship  with VIPKid HK o r that any meeting with it took place in New York.  \nEven with respect to Sequoia’s funds, i t is not clear if the money was invested in New York or in \nHong Kong where VIPKid HK  has its principle place of business.  In fact, Sequoia attests that \nthe funds al so lack any meaningful connection to the state .  Chang Decl. ¶ 9.  Similarly, there are \nno allegations in the complaint that explain the nature of the investment, whether it was governed \nby an agreement with VIPKid HK and, if so, whose law  governed the relationship.  In deed , other \nthan the plaintiff’s conclusory contention that “Sequoia’s investment” was utilized to support the VIPKid Scheme, there is nothing in the amended complaint that  supports a finding of jurisdiction \npursuant to section 302(a)(1).\n16 \n Lastly , nothing in the amended complaint supports a finding that Sequoia committed a \ntortious act within the state or that it directed the commission of a tortious act, through an  agent, \nfrom outside of the state.  As previously stated, in order to establish jurisdiction under section 302(a)(3), Meehan would have to establish that when Sequoia provided its fund with advice, it somehow knew that one of the entities in which it was investing was going to surreptitiously record and capture the t eachers’ facial movements and voices.   No such showing can be made \nbased on the facts in the amended complaint.  Accordingly, the undersigned finds that the Court \n \n16 Meehan argues that Sequoia should have done more to explain its relationship with the funds and the relationship \nthe funds have with VIPKid HK.  He says, had they done so, he could have advanced more arguments in favor of \njurisdiction.  However, it Meehan, not the defendants, who bears the burden of demonstrating personal jurisdiction. See Grand River Enters. Six Nations, Ltd. v. Pryor , 425 F.3d 158, 165 (2d Cir. 2005).  Case 2:20-cv-06370-JS-LGD     Document 91     Filed 08/29/23     Page 37 of 38 PageID #:\n<pageID>38 \n may not exercise personal jurisdiction over Sequoia and respectfully recommends that the claims \nagainst it be dismissed.  \n F. The Defendants’ Arguments Under Rule 12(b)(6)  \n Each of the defendants has also argued that the facts alleged by Meehan are insufficient \nto support a claim that would entitle him to relief.  Given the Court’s determinatio n with respect \nto both the Dami defendants’ motion to compel arbitration and the remaining defendants’ motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction, the undersigned will not address the 12(b)(6) arguments. \nOBJECTIONS  \nA copy of this Report and Recommendation is being electronically served by the Court \non the parties .

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: This case involves Plaintiff Kevin Meehan seeking to remand his lawsuit against VIPKid and affiliates back to New York state court, after it was removed to federal court by the defendants under the Class Action Fairness Act (CAFA). The Plaintiff alleges fraud and improper use of his and other teachers' likenesses to develop AI technology, alongside employment-related violations. The court ultimately recommends denying the remand request, as the defendants have demonstrated CAFA jurisdiction adequately, and the Plaintiff has not met the burden to demonstrate an exception applies.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the case should be remanded back to state court due to exceptions under CAFA or via abstention doctrines despite federal jurisdiction being claimed under CAFA and federal question jurisdiction stemming from an FLSA claim.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court recommends the denial of Plaintiff's motion to remand the case back to state court, finding that federal jurisdiction under CAFA is established, and the plaintiff has not sufficiently proved the applicability of any CAFA exception or valid grounds for abstention.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Kevin Meehan, a teacher, sues VIPKid for fraud and using his digital likeness without consent, claiming it helped them make robots (AI). He wants the case tried in New York, but VIPKid moved it to federal court, saying federal rules allow it. He asked the court to send it back to New York, but the court said it should stay in federal court because VIPKid followed the proper rules for keeping it there.",

KATHLEEN TOMLINSON, Magistrate Judge:  \n \nI. PRELIMINARY STATEMENT  \n Defendant VIPKid International, Inc. (“ VIPKid Int’l. ”) removed this putative class and \ncollective action  to the Eastern District of New York pursuant to the Class Action Fairness Act \nof 2005 (“CAFA”), 28 U.S.C. § 1332( d).  See Notice of Removal of Civil Action from State \nCourt [DE 1].  Defendant Sequoia Capital Operations, LLC (“Sequoia Capital ”) filed a Notice of \nConsent to VIPKid Int’l. ’s removal and noted the existence of additional grounds for federal \njurisdiction under the Fair Labor Standards Act (“FLSA”), 29 U.S.C. §§ 201 et seq.   See Notice Case 2:20-cv-06370-JS-LGD     Document 54     Filed 08/27/21     Page 1 of 25 PageID #:\n<pageID>2 \n of Joinder In and Consent to Removal and Statement of Additional Ground by Defendant \nSequoia Capital [DE 7].  \nPlaintiff Kevin Meehan  (“Plaintiff”) now moves to remand this action to the Supreme \nCourt of the State of New York, County of Nassau, where it was originally filed.  See Legal Memorandum In Support (“Pl.’s Mem.”) [DE 46];  Plaintiff’s Response to Defendants’ Joint \nOpposition to Re mand (“Pl.’s Reply”) [DE 49].  Plaintiff argues his FLSA claim is an \ninsufficient standalone basis to confer federal jurisdiction and that the Court should exercise its discretion to remand pursuant to CAFA.  See generally Pl.’s Mem.; Pl.’s Reply.  Defenda nts \nVIPKid Int’l. , VIPKID HK Ltd., VIPKID Class HK Ltd., Beijing Dami Technology Co., Ltd., \nVIPTeach Inc., Tencent Holdings Ltd., Tencent America LLC, Tencent Cloud LLC, China Renaissance Holdings Ltd., and Sequoia Capital Operations,LLC (collectively, “De fendants”\n 1), \njointly oppose Plaintiff’s motion and argue that the Court has original jurisdiction based upon \nPlaintiff’s FLSA claim and that the Court cannot exercise its discretion to remand pursuant to \nCAFA based upon the circumstances of this case.  See Defendants’ Joint Opposition to \nPlaintiff’s Motion to Remand (“Defs.’ Opp’n”) [DE 48] at 4- 9. \n The Honorable Joanna Seybert referred Plaintiff’s motion to this Court for a Report and \nRecommendation as to whether the motion should be granted.  See May 5, 2021 Electronic Order.  For the reasons which follow, the Court respectfully recommends to Judge Seybert that \nPlaintiff’s motion to remand be DENIED.  \n \n \n1  There are 13 entities named as defendants in this case and Defendants’ opposition \nto Plaintiff’s motion to remand was submitted on behalf of all but three of these entities , namely,  \nBeijing Dami Future Technology Co., Ltd., VIPKid and Cloud & Smart Industries.  See Defs.’ \nOpp’n at 1 n.1.  Defendants then appear to explain that these three entities did not join in the \nopposition because, according to Defendants, Beijing Dami Future Technology Co., Ltd was not properly served and VIPKid and Cloud & Smart Industries “are not juridical entities.”  Id.   \n Case 2:20-cv-06370-JS-LGD     Document 54     Filed 08/27/21     Page 2 of 25 PageID #:\n<pageID>3 \n II. BACKGROUND  \n A. The Complaint  \nOn November 13, 2020, Plaintiff commenced this action in the Supreme Court of the \nState of New York, County of Nassau, against Defendant VIPKid HK Limited (“VIPKid HK”) \nand a dozen entities that are related to or in some fashion affiliated with VIPKid HK.  See generally Complaint (“Compl.”) [DE 1- 1].\n2  According to the Complaint, Defendants are \naffiliated with or responsible for operating VIPKid, an online  education platform which  \nfacilitates the instruction of English language skills by teachers from the United States and Canada to students in China.  Id.   VIPKid’s operation connects approximately 700,000 students \nwith more than 100,000 teachers.  Id.  ¶¶ 20-21.  The Complaint alleges the VIPKid enterprise is \nNew York -based and whose services are provided by entities domiciled in New York.  Id. ¶ 11.  \nHowever, the Complaint then alleges that even if these entities, i.e. , the Defendants, are \nconsidered to be domiciled outside of New York, their activities and interactions within the State satisfy jurisdictional requirements pursuant to C.P.L.R. § 302.  Id . ¶ 12.   \nPlaintiff, a New York resident, contracted with VIPKid Hk and VIPKid Int’l.  to provide \nservices teaching English to children in China.  Id.  ¶¶ 15 -16, 34, 85.  Plaintiff claims that over \nthe course of his four -year employment with VIPKid, he was “ living in an Orweillian nightmare \n[and] realize[d] that he had been the victim of a sophisticated fraud deliberately crafted to exploit \npeople like him —Americans in search of affordable paths to dignified careers.”  Id.  ¶ 6. He \nasserts 10 causes of action arising under state and federal law on behalf of himself and all current \nand former VIPKid teachers.  Plaintiff’s first two causes of action are for common law fraud and \n \n2  Plaintiff’s Complaint is 92 -pages long and contains more than 600 paragraphs of \nallegations.  See generally Compl.  The “ Background”  information set forth here is limited to the \nfacts necessary to resolve the instant motion.   \n Case 2:20-cv-06370-JS-LGD     Document 54     Filed 08/27/21     Page 3 of 25 PageID #:\n<pageID>4 \n fraudulent inducement.   Id. ¶¶ 393- 444.  These claims are based upon statements on VIP Kid’s \nwebsite concerning the terms and conditions of employment for online  teachers.  T he  Complaint \nlists more than 20 such statements which , for example, pertain to VIPKid’s mission  to provide \nChinese children an elementary school experience from the com fort of their own homes , the \nability for teachers to set their own schedule s and flexible hours, job perks, base pay rates, \nearnings calculations, contract lengths, and the low level of commitment required to be a VIPKid \nteacher, among other things.  Id.  ¶ 395.  Plaintiff alleges that he and the Class were induced to \nwork as VIPKid teachers based upon these statements which proved to be false.  Plaintiff’s third \ncause of action, a violation of N.Y. General Business Law § 349 based on unlawful and deceptive business practices, also stems from allegedly false and misleading advertising campaigns run by the Defendants.  Id.  ¶¶ 445- 57.  Plaintiff then asserts an independent cause of \naction for conspiracy, alleging the Defendants committed various overt acts related to Plaintiff’s fraud claims.  Id.  ¶¶ 469- 78.   \nNext, Plaintiff claims Defendants violated N.Y. Civil Rights Law §§ 50- 51 because \nDefendants exploited Class members’ “names, portraits, pictures, images, and/or voices to develop, e nhance, or inform its artificial intelligence technology  . . . without the knowledge or \nconsent of any VIPKid Teachers.”  See id.  ¶¶ 460, 462.  Defendants then utilized  this artificial \nintelligence to replace live instruction.  Id.  ¶ 464.  As a result of D efendants utilizing Class \nmembers’ images and likenesses  without their consent , Plaintiff also claims  that the Defendants \nwere unjustly enriched.  See id.  ¶¶ 479 -83.   \nPlaintiff also asserts a variety of claims concerning the conditions of his employment, \nnamely, FLSA and NYLL violations, on behalf of a collective which is defined as “all current and former VIPKid Teachers.”  Id.  ¶¶ 485 -86.  Regarding the FLSA violations, Plaintiff alleges , Case 2:20-cv-06370-JS-LGD     Document 54     Filed 08/27/21     Page 4 of 25 PageID #:\n<pageID>5 \n among other things, that  the Defendants failed to (1) pay minimum w ages, (2) overtime \ncompensation, (3) compensation for on- call time, (4) undercounted hours worked, (5) did not \nprovide rest or meal breaks or permit Collective  members to accept tips, and (6) failed to \nmaintain records and post required notices on the VIPK id website concerning wage and hour  \nlaws.  Id.  ¶¶ 515 -37.  The Plaintiff’s NYLL claims are, for the most part, analogous to the claims \nasserted  under the FLSA.  See id.  ¶¶ 538 -65.  However, Plaintiff also sets forth causes of action \npursuant to NYLL  § 215 and § 740 for retaliation.  See id.  ¶¶ 566 -606.  These retaliation claims \nare brought on behalf of a sub- class of the C ollective  which Plaintiff refers to as the “VIPKid \nWhistleblower Class.”  Id. ¶¶ 566, 602.  Plaintiff alleges that he was denied me aningful \nopportunities for advancement within VIPKid and ultimately was fired after complaining about \nthe company’s employment practices.  See id.  ¶¶ 566-606.   \n B. Procedural Background  \nOn December 30, 2020, VIPKids Int ’l. removed the  action to this Court  pursuant to \nCAFA.  See DE 1.  Sequoia Capital filed a N otice of J oinder and consented to the removal by \nVIPKids Int.  See DE 7.  In its notice, Sequoia Capital also stated that, in addition to CAFA, federal jurisdiction exists based upon Plaintiff’s cause  of action under the FLSA.  Id.  at 2.  The \nTencent Defendants  (i.e., Tencent America LLC, Tencent Holdings Ltd., Cloud & Smart \nIndustries, Tencent Holdings Ltd. a/k/a Cloud & Smart Industries at Tencent Holdings Ltd., and Tencent Cloud LLC ) filed a “notice  of joinder in and consent to removal” for the reasons \nproffered by VIPKids Int. and Sequoia Capital.  See DE 15.  W ithin their notice, the Tencent \nDefendants also contend that they were not properly served with the Summons and Complaint.  See id.  & n.1.  T he VIPKid Defendants, i.e. , VIPKids Int ’l., VIPKid HK, VIPKID Class HK Case 2:20-cv-06370-JS-LGD     Document 54     Filed 08/27/21     Page 5 of 25 PageID #:\n<pageID>6 \n Limited, Beijing Dami Technology Co., Ltd. and VIPTeach, Inc., also joined Sequoia Capital’s \nnotice related to the FLSA grounds  for removal.  See DE 20.   \nBetween January 22, 2021 and February 5, 2021, the VIPKid Defendants, the Tencent \nDefendants, Sequoia Capital, and China Renaissance Holdings Ltd. each filed separate pre -\nmotion conference requests to Judge Seybert for purposes of making a motion to dismiss.  See DE 29; DE 39; DE  40; DE 41.  On January 29, 2021, Plaintiff filed opposition to the VIPKid \nDefendants’ pre -motion conference request.  See DE 36.  In this opposition, Plaintiff noted he \nwould be seeking remand to state court and attached as an exhibit  to this letter  his l egal \nmemorandum in support of a  motion to remand.  Id.; DE 36 -1.  The VIPKid Defendants and \nSequoia Capital asked Judge Seybert to set a briefing schedule for Plaintiff’s motion to remand.  See DE 37; DE 38.  \nOn February 18, 2021, Judge Seybert issued the f ollowing Order regarding the Defendants’ \npre-motion conference requests and the Plaintiff’s opposition:  \nIn conjunction with his objection ( see ECF No. 36\n (hereafter, the \n“Objection Letter ”)) to the Letter Motion of [the VIPKid \nDefendants]  . . . seeking a pre -motion conference regarding a \nproposed dismissal motion ( see ECF No. 29 ), Plaintiff filed a \ntimely Motion to Remand. ( See EC F No. [36- 1] (hereafter, the \n“Remand Motion”); see also  ECF No. 36- 2 (Mem. of Supp. \nFacts).) The VIPKid Defendants oppose remand and request the \nCourt set a briefing schedule on the Remand Motion. ( See ECF \nNo. 37.) Defendant Sequoia Capital Operations LLC. similarly requests the Court set a briefing schedule on said Motion. ( See \nECF No. 38.)  \n Pursuant to the Court ’s inherent authority to manage its docket \nwith a “ view toward the efficient and expedient resolution of \ncases, ” Dietz v. Bouldin, U.S., 136 S. Ct. 1885, 1892 (2016):  \n (1) Plaintiff ’s Remand Motion (ECF No. [36- 1]) filed as an \nattachment to his Objection Letter is deemed to have been filed as a separate,  stand -alone motion;  Case 2:20-cv-06370-JS-LGD     Document 54     Filed 08/27/21     Page 6 of 25 PageID #:\n<pageID>7 \n  \n(2) For clarity on the Case Docket, the Clerk of Court is directed to file (a) the Remand Motion (ECF No. [36 -1]) as a separate docket \nentry, with a filing date of January 29, 2021, and (b) Plaintiff's Memorandum of Supporting Facts (ECF No. [36- 2]) as an \nattachment thereto;  \n (3) Any Defendant seeking to file a response to the Remand Motion shall do so by no later than March 26, 2021;  \n (4) Plaintiff shall have until April 16, 2021 to file replies, if any; and \n (5) The Defendants ’ various pre -conference Letter Motions \nregarding proposed dismissal motions (see ECF Nos. 29, 39, 40, and 41) are denied as premature and without prejudice to renew pending the final determination of the Remand Motion.  \nSee February 18, 2021 Electronic Order.  In accordance with Judge Seybert’s Order, Plaintiff’s \nmotion to remand and legal memorandum in support w ere re-docketed at DE 46, dated  \nJanuary 29, 2021.  See Pl.’s Mem.   Defendants filed a joint opposition to Plaintiff’s motion on \nMarch 26, 2021.  See Defs.’ Opp’n.  Plaintiff submitted a reply brief on April 16, 2021.  See Pl.’s \nReply.  Plaintiff’s motion was  then  referred to this Court for this  Report and Recommendation on \nMay 5, 2021.  C. The Parties’ Positions   \n  1. Plaintiff’s Motion  \n Plaintiff first argues that this Court does not have federal question jurisdiction because \nhis FLSA claims “do not present a necessary federal question.”  See Pl.’s Mem. at 4.  Plaintiff contends that the FLSA is the only federal law invoked by the Complai nt and that it “is invoked \nmerely as an alternative theory of recovery for injuries caused to Plaintiff” as a result of VIPKid’s alleged fraudulent scheme which is pled “in the context of a state law theory of recovery founded entirely in New York common l aw fraud.”  Id.  at 5.  Shifting then to a Case 2:20-cv-06370-JS-LGD     Document 54     Filed 08/27/21     Page 7 of 25 PageID #:\n<pageID>8 \n discussion of CAFA , Plaintiff seems to insist that “CAFA requires agreement on the existence of \na class action.”  Id.  at 6.  Plaintiff goes on to state that his “mere allegation of a class action could \nnot have suf ficed for removal  . . . on the basis of original jurisdiction.”   However, Plaintiff \nasserts that because Defendants have raised CAFA as such a basis for removal, “they agree this \nAction is a class action  . . . [and] implicitly and irreversibly accept the e xistence of a class \naction.”  Id.   Plaintiff then appears to concede that the Court has jurisdiction as a result of CAFA \nand Defendants “must litigate this Action as a class -action in open court.”  Id. at 7.   \n Having posited that argument, Plaintiff submits that he is entitled to discovery to verify \nthat CAFA jurisdiction exists .  However, he then immediately goes into a discussion regarding \nthe application of exceptions to CAFA jurisdiction which would warrant remand.  See id.  8-15.  \nTo demonstrate one exception to the applicability of CAFA here, P laintiff casts doubt  upon the \nveracity of his  own allegations in the Complaint which state that VIPKid employs over 100,000 \nteachers  in light of VIPKid’s LinkedIn page which apparently indicates that figure is cl oser to \n13,000.  Id.  at 10.  Plaintiff also notes that “[t]he highest concentration of VIPKid workers who \nname VIPKid on their LinkedIn profile identify as being located in the New York City area” and that “[t]he number of  . . . teachers in New York State is likely far higher.”  Id.  Based on this \ninformation, Plaintiff contends that “it is more likely than not that one or more CAFA exception applies.”  Id.   Consequently, Plaintiff asks for discovery to determine the total number of VIPKid \nteachers “by domi cile per state in the United States,” but adds that if the Defendants cannot \nprovide such information, then the Court should remand the case.  Id.   \n Plaintiff then argues that “[a]ssuming  [CAFA’s] numerical requirements are satisfied,” \nthe Court should exercise its discretion to remand under CAFA’s “interests of justice” exception.  \nId. at 11.  In making this argument, Plaintiff asserts that :  (1) his claims involve matters of Case 2:20-cv-06370-JS-LGD     Document 54     Filed 08/27/21     Page 8 of 25 PageID #:\n<pageID>9 \n national and interstate interest that can only be addressed at the state- level; (2) his claims are \ngoverned only by the laws of the State of New York; (3) the Complaint was not pled to avoid \nfederal law; (4) the action was originally filed in a forum with a distinct n exus to the class \nmembers, the alleged harm, and the Defendants; (5) the proposed classes are comprised of more citizens from New York than any other state; and (6) no other class actions asserting the same or similar claims were filed against the Defendan ts.  Id. at 11 -15.  In addition to the “interest of \njustice” exception to CAFA, Plaintiff also contends that there are grounds to remand this case based on the Pullman and Burford abstention doctrines.  Id.  at 15 -17.  Lastly, Plaintiff argues \nthat because “[t]his case presents a mixture of national and state interests,” if the Court retains \njurisdiction “over Plaintiff’s singular duplicative federal labor law cause of action,” it “should not hesitate to remand all of Plaintiffs [sic] state claims.”  Id.  at 17- 18.   \nIn his conclusion section, Plaintiff st ates that “this [C]ourt has jurisdiction for class -based \nadjudication only” pursuant to CAFA and essentially argues that “this Court risks upsetting the \ndelicate balance between federal and state power if it chooses to maintain jurisdiction under any other conditions.”  Id.  at 18 -19.  Plaintiff then recommends a  “course of action” for the Court to \ntake, which sets forth three scenarios:  (1) “i f this Court finds that Defendants must admit \nthis . . . is a class  action, then the Court must litigate this  . . . as a class action”; (2) if the Court \nhas doubts as to CAFA jurisdiction, an order for expedited discovery on the proposed class and citizenship of the Defendants should be issued; or (3) the Court should rem and this case “[i]n all \nother circumstances.”  Id. at 19. \n  2. Defendants’ Opposition  \n At the outset , Defendants argue that they have met their burden to establish CAFA \njurisdiction and that the Complaint provides the reasonable probability needed to do so.  See Case 2:20-cv-06370-JS-LGD     Document 54     Filed 08/27/21     Page 9 of 25 PageID #:\n<pageID>10 \n Defs.’ Opp’n at 4.  Defendants draw the Court’s attention to the allegations which assert:  (1) a \nclass of 100,000 members; (2) damages of nearly $13,000,000 for Plaintiff alone; and (3) diversity of citizenship between Plaintiff, a New York resident, and the primary Defendant VIPKids Int ’l.  See id.  (citing Compl. ¶¶  9, 14, 181).  Regarding the citizenship of VIPKids Int ’l., \nDefendants cite the Declaration of Huan Xiong, counsel for VIPKid Int’l. , which asserts that this \nentity is a Delaware corporation with its  principal place of business in California.  See \nDeclaration of Huan Xiong (“Xiong Decl.”) [DE 48- 2].  Defendants then argue that because \nCAFA jurisdiction exists, there is federal jurisdiction over the entire action.  See Defs.’ Opp’n at 4-5.  Although Plaintiff seems to have suggested that removal was improper to the extent it was \nbased on Plaintiff’s allegations regarding the number of VIPKid teachers, Defendants submit that it is routine for defendants to remove actions based on allegations in complaints.  Id.  at 5 (citing \nBlockbuster, Inc. v. Galeno, 472 F.3d 53, 56- 57 (2d Cir. 2006)).  Moreover, to the extent \nPlaintiff argues that the mere fact that the Court has CAFA jurisdiction constitutes automatic \nconsent to class certification, Defendants argue  that Plaintiff has provided no legal support for \nthis “unique take on the consequences of invoking CAFA jurisdiction because there is none.”  I d. \nat 6.  On this issue, Defendants note that whether a case may proceed as a class action  which  \nbinds individuals who are not participants is a question of law, not a matter of consent, and “failure to obtain class certification does not divest the Court of CAFA jurisdiction.”  Id.  at 6 n.2.   \n Defendants then address Plaintiff’s arguments regarding the applicability of an exception \nto CAFA.  See id.  at 6.  After pointing out that a plaintiff must prove by a preponderance of the \nevidence that such an excep tion applies, Defendants content that Plaintiff has offered no \nevidence whatsoever aside from a brief, insufficient statement in his opening memorandum which provides: “ [i]f the number of New York VIPKID Teachers is in the several Case 2:20-cv-06370-JS-LGD     Document 54     Filed 08/27/21     Page 10 of 25 PageID #:\n<pageID>11 \n thousands  . . . and there  are only some 13,000 VIPKID Teachers, then it seems more likely than \nnot that one or more CAFA exception applies to this Action.”   Id. (quoting Pl.’s Mem. at 10).  \nAlthough Defendants concede that there is no way to determine definitively the actual \ncitizenship of each putative class member without interviewing them, they submit that CAFA \nrequires courts to make reasonable assumptions regarding citizenship based on available evidence.  Id. at 8.  To this point, Defendants again cite the Xiong Declaration which provides \nthat VIPKid HK “has contracted with over 200,000 teachers” and “[t]he business mailing address of more than 96% of those teachers is outside of the State of New York.”  See X iong Decl. ¶  4; \nDefs.’ Opp’n at 8 -9.  Based upon this information, Defendants assert  that it is reasonable to \nconclude that fewer than one third of the putative class members are citizens of New York.  Id.   \nat 9.    Moreover, Defendants note that each CAFA  exemption requires a plaintiff to prove that \none or more defendants is a citizen of the forum state.  Id.  at 7.  However, according to counsel, \nthe Defendants  are all foreign entities -- and not New York citizens -- which means that none of \nthose exceptio ns applies and the Court has no discretion to remand.  Id.   With respect to their \ncitizenship, Defendants provide d the Court with a demonstrative chart which t he Court has \nreproduced here:  \nDefendant  Place of Incorporation or \nOrganization  Principal Place of  Business  \nVIPKid International, Inc.  Delaware  California  \nVIPKid HK Limited  Hong Kong  China  \nVIPKid Class HK Ltd.  Hong Kong  China  \nVIPTeach Inc.  Delaware  California  \nBeijing Dami Technology Co., Ltd.  China  China  \nBeijing Dami  Future Technology \nCo., Ltd.  China  China  \nCloud & Smart Industries  Cayman Islands  China  \nTencent America LLC  Delaware  California  \nTencent Cloud LLC  Delaware  Delaware  \nChina Renaissance Holdings Ltd.  Cayman Islands  China  \nSequoia Capital Operations LLC  Delaware  California  Case 2:20-cv-06370-JS-LGD     Document 54     Filed 08/27/21     Page 11 of 25 PageID #:\n<pageID>12 \n Id. at 7 -8.3 \n Next, Defendants oppose Plaintiff’s argument claiming that his FLSA cause of action \ndoes not confer federal question jurisdiction.  See id. at 9.  According to Defendants, Plaintiff’s \nFLSA claim “is not a  subtle point”  and is proclaimed in all capital letters.  Id. at 10.  In addition \nto its typeface, Defendants also point out that this violation of the FLSA is not “one of several theories of liability under state law” b ecause Plaintiff “expressly alleges a violation of a federal \nstatute and seeks a remedy created by that statute.”  Id.  (citing Abdale v. North Shore -Long \nIsland Jewish Health Sys., Inc ., 2014 WL 2945741, at *4 (E.D.N.Y. June 30, 2014)).  As such, \nPlaintiff’s attempt to distance himself from his FLSA claim is immaterial because he “ chose to \nallege a claim under federal law, devoting nearly forty paragraphs of the Complaint to detailing his alleged injuries arising under federal law in a claim that he described as an FLSA claim. ”  Id.  \nat 11 (ci ting Compl. ¶¶  500- 37).  In light of the fact that federal jurisdiction is measured at the \ntime of removal, Defendants argue that Plaintiff cannot now attempt to change or gloss over his \nallegations to argue that federal question jurisdiction is lacking.  Id.    \n Regarding Plaintiff’s argument on supplemental jurisdiction, Defendants contend that \nPlaintiff’s FLSA claims and state law claims derive from a common nucleus of operative fact s \nand will involve similar witnesses and evidence.  Id. at 11 -14.  In light of this commonality, \nDefendants ask the Court to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over Plaintiff’s state law claims.  \n \n3  The information in this chart is based on a combination of declarations submitted \nin support of Defendants’ opposition as well as allegations in the Complaint and other \ndocumentation.  Specifically, the citizenship of the VIPKid Defendants stems from the statements contained in the Xiong Declaration . See Xiong Decl. ¶  2.  Similarly, the citizenship of \nChina Renaissance Holdings is based upon the Declaration of Lixing Wang, its Head of Investment Banking.  See Declaration of Lixing Wang (“Wang Decl.”) [DE 48- 1].  T he \ncitizenship of the Tencent Defendants and Sequoia Capital was based upon the Complaint.  See Defs.’ Opp’n at 8 nn. 5, 7 (citing Compl. ¶¶  71, 77).  \n Case 2:20-cv-06370-JS-LGD     Document 54     Filed 08/27/21     Page 12 of 25 PageID #:\n<pageID>13 \n Id. at 14.  Lastly, Defendants submit that Plaintiff has misconstrued the purpose of Burford and \nPullman abstention, arguing that nei ther doctrine applies to the instant case.  Id.  at 14 -16. \n  3. Plaintiff’s Reply  \nIn his reply, Plaintiff argues that “Defendants have not alleged any estimate of class size \nrelevant to this action” and “falsely attribute to Plaintiff the so -called allegation that the putative \nclass consists of more than 100,000 individuals.”  See Pl.’s  Reply at 1 -2.  Plaintiff then \n“mount[s] a factual attack against VIPKid’s claim of the number of VIPKid Teachers.”  Id. at 2.  \nCiting Defendants’ statement that it has compensated more than 200,000 teachers, Plaintiff \nclaims that number is “not reasonably indicative of the number of proposed plaintiffs” because VIPKid HK “hires teachers for any number of reasons, for any number of educational platforms” that have no bearing on this case.  Id. at 2 -3.  Plaintiff also reiterates the “factual attack” set fort h \nin his opening brief regarding the claim on VIPKid’s website which states there are more than 100,000 teachers, but the VIPKid’s LinkedIn profile “listed around ten percent of [that] figure \nfor the total number of VIPKid affiliated individuals on the pla tform.”  Id.  at 4.   \nPlaintiff then claims that “VIPKid,” the first named Defendant in the Complaint, “is the \nprimary [D]efendant in this action” and is a New York citizen .  Plaintiff asserts that Defendants \ndo not “utter[] a single word that contradicts P laintiff’s allegations about VIPKid or its New \nYork Headquarters.”  Id. at 5.  Plaintiff then argues that despite Defendants’ claim that 96% of \nthe 200,000 teachers who contracted with VIPKid HK have mailing addresses outside of New York, this statement “s hine[s] no light on the question of the citizenship of the class for this \naction” because, once again, Plaintiff claims that this figure is not indicative of VIPKid teachers in America and Canada because it “likely include[s], in the majority, Chinese teachers in China performing any number of functions unrelated to VIPKid.”  Id.  at 5-6. Case 2:20-cv-06370-JS-LGD     Document 54     Filed 08/27/21     Page 13 of 25 PageID #:\n<pageID>14 \n  With regard to Defendants’ arguments concerning federal question jurisdiction provided \nby the FLSA, Plaintiff seems to argue that the existence of such a claim arising under federal law \ndoes not mean that a federal court must assert jurisdiction over it.  Id. at 6 -7.  In a similar vein, \nPlaintiff also argues that cases containing FLSA claims can be remanded when such claims are brought alongside state law claims.  Id. at 8.   Ultimately, Plaintiff argues that the Court must \nremand this action “regardless of the relevance of the [a]bstention [d]octrine,” but further asserts that the Court need not reach this  issue in order to remand the  case.  Id. at 10.  Plaintiff concludes \nthat if the Court does not remand this case, such action would send “ a signal to companies \nworldwide[] that CAFA is a quick and lazy path to federal court, regardless of the quality of facts and arguments the removing party alleges.”  Id.  \nIII. APPLICABLE LAW \n An action initially filed in state court may be removed to federal court if the federal court \nwould have had original jurisdiction.  See  28 U.S.C.  § 1441(a).  District courts have original \njurisdiction over cases involving federal questions, see 28 U.S.C. § 1331, and over certain cases involving diversity of citizenship.  See 28 U.S.C. § 1332.  The Class Action Fairness Act “allows \nfor the exercise of federal diversity jurisdiction over class actions involving 100 or more class \nmembers, in which the amount i n controversy exceeds the sum or value of $5,000,000 (exclusive \nof interest and costs), and there is minimal diversity, i.e. , where, inter alia , at least one member \nof the putative class and one defendant are citizens of different states.”  Richins v. Hofs tra Univ., \n908 F. Supp. 2d 358, 360 (E.D.N.Y. 2012) (quoting Anirudh v. CitiMortgage, Inc., 598 F. Supp. \n2d 448, 450 (S.D.N.Y. 2009)).  As such, CAFA expands federal jurisdiction to permit a \ndefendant to remove a class action “notwithstanding the absence of the complete diversity or \nfederal question otherwise required for removal.”  BlackRock Fin. Mgmt. Inc. v. Segregated Case 2:20-cv-06370-JS-LGD     Document 54     Filed 08/27/21     Page 14 of 25 PageID #:\n<pageID>15 \n Acct. of Ambac Assur. Corp., 673 F.3d 169, 175 (2d Cir. 2012) .  The removing party bears the \nburden of establishing federal jurisdiction under CAFA  by a reasonable probability.  Musiello v. \nCBS Corp., No. 20 Civ. 2569, 2020 WL 3034793, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. June 5, 2020) (citing \nBlockbuster v. Galeno, 472 F.3d 53, 59 (2d Cir. 2006));   Singer v. 3M Co., No. CV 17- 6962, \n2018 WL 3635074, at *3 (E.D.N.Y. June 27, 2018)  (citing Sorrentino v. ASN Roosevelt Ctr., \nLLC, 588 F. Supp. 2d 350, 353 (E.D.N.Y. 2008)) . \nCAFA also “ includes certain enumerated exceptions, some of which recognize the \npropriety of declining to exercise federal jurisdiction over matters of local concern.”  Id. (citing \nKanowitz v. Broadridge Fin. Solutions, Inc., No. CV 13- 649, 2014 WL 1338370, at *7 \n(E.D .N.Y. Mar. 31, 2014)) .  It is a plaintiff’s burden to demonstrate by a preponderance of the \nevidence that remand is warranted on the basis of one of these exceptions .4  Anderjaska v. Bank \nof Am., N.A., No. 1:19- CV-03057, 2020 WL 1503418, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. M ar. 30, 2020)  (citing \nGreenwich Fin. Servs. Distressed Mortgage Fund 3 LLC v. Countrywide Fin. Corp., 603 F.3d 23, 26 (2d Cir. 2010)) ; Singer , 2018 WL 3635074, at *3 (“ While the level of proof required to \nsatisfy a motion for remand has not been clearly stated by the Second Circuit, other circuits, as \nwell as courts within the Second Circuit, agree that remand must be demonstrated by a \npreponderance of the evidence standard.”).  \nCAFA’s exceptions delineate circumstances where remand is mandatory or where the \ndecision to remand is within the district court’s discretion .  There are two scenarios in which \nremand to state court is mandatory.  See Richins , 908 F. Supp. 2d at 360- 61.  F irst, remand is \n \n4  In his motion, Plaintiff misstates who bears the  burden of proving that an \nexception to CAFA jurisdiction exists by arguing that  “Defendan ts have complete knowledge of \nthe putative class and yet have not made any factual claims that adequately rule out remand to \nNew York on the basis of CAFA exceptions.”  See Pl.’s Mem. at 9.  Case 2:20-cv-06370-JS-LGD     Document 54     Filed 08/27/21     Page 15 of 25 PageID #:\n<pageID>16 \n required where:  (1) more than two thirds of the class are citizens of the state the action was \ncommenced in; (2) at least one defendant is a citizen of the state from whom “significant relief is sought, [and] whose conduct forms a ‘signifi cant basis’ for the asserted claims ;” (3) the principal \ninjuries suffered by the class were incurred in the state where the action was filed; and (4) no other class action asserting the same or similar factual allegations was filed against any of the defen dants in the past three years.  Id. (citing 28 U.S.C. § 1332(d)(4)(A)).  Second, remand is \nmandatory where “two -thirds or more of the members of all proposed plaintiff classes, in the \naggregate, and the primary defendants, are citizens of the State in whic h the action was originally \nfiled.”  28 U.S.C. § 1332(d)(4)(B).  The first of these mandatory remand exceptions is commonly referred to as the “local controversy” exception; the second is referred to as the “home state” exception.  See Camilo v. Lyft, Inc. , No. 17- CV-9116, 2018 WL 8582073, at *1- 2 (S.D.N.Y. \nMar. 19, 2018) .   \nA district court may also decline to exercise jurisdiction as a matter of discretion pursuant \nto CAFA’s “interest of justice” exception.  See Ramirez v. Oscar De La Renta LLC , No. 16- CV-\n7855, 2017 WL 2062960, at *8 (S.D.N.Y. May 12, 2017) .  This exception provides:  \nA district court may, in the interests of justice and looking at the \ntotality of the circumstances, decline to exercise jurisdiction  . . . over a class action in which greater than one -third \nbut less than two -thirds of the members of all proposed plaintiff \nclasses in the aggregate and the primary defendants are citizens of the State in which the action was originally filed based on considerations of — \n \n(A) whether the claims  asserted involve matters of national or \ninterstate interest;  \n(B) whether the claims asserted will be governed by laws of the \nState in which the action was originally filed or by the laws of other States;  \n(C) whether the class action has been pleaded in a manner that seeks to avoid Federal jurisdiction;  Case 2:20-cv-06370-JS-LGD     Document 54     Filed 08/27/21     Page 16 of 25 PageID #:\n<pageID>17 \n (D) whether the action was brought in a forum with a distinct \nnexus with the class members, the alleged harm, or the defendants;  \n(E) whether the number of citizens of the State in which the action was originally filed in all proposed plaintiff classes in the aggregate is substantially larger than the number of citizens from any other State, and the citizenship of the other members of the proposed class is dispersed among a substantial number of States; and  \n(F) whether, during the 3 -year period preceding the filing of that \nclass action, 1 or more other class actions asserting the same or similar claims on behalf of the same or other persons have been filed.  \n 28 U.S.C. § 1332(d)(3).   \nIV. DISCUSSION  \n A. CAFA Jurisdiction  Exists  \n On the one hand, Plaintiff does  not appear to dispute that the Complaint was properly \nremoved within the Court’s CAFA diversity jurisdiction.  See Pl.’s Mem. at 7 (“[T]his Court has \nCAFA jurisdiction and, as a result, Defendants may not remove this Action to arbitration and must litigate this Action as a class -action i n open court.”).  On the other hand, Plaintiff also \nseems to challenge the number of potential class members, arguing discovery is necessary to verify the existence of CAF A jurisdiction.  See id.  at 8-11.  The Court disagrees .  Because \nDefendants have established, by a reasonable probability, that the putative class is greater than 100 plaintiffs , discovery on that element of CAFA jurisdiction is not needed.  Despite Plaintiff’s \ncontention that he “did not allege any class size,” see Pl.’s Reply at 2 n.2, t he Complaint \nrepeatedly alleges that there are more than 100,000 VIPKid teachers in the United States and Canada.  See Compl. ¶¶  20, 21, 259, 275, 287, 382.  After Defenda nts utilized this figure as \ngrounds for removal under CAFA -- as it was pled by Plaintiff in the Complaint -- Plaintiff made \na series of convoluted attempts in his opening and reply briefs to walk back this number by Case 2:20-cv-06370-JS-LGD     Document 54     Filed 08/27/21     Page 17 of 25 PageID #:\n<pageID>21 \n WL 3635074, at *5 (denying motion to remand after finding plaintiff failed to demonstrate that \nbetween one-  and two -thirds of the proposed class are citizens of New York). \n The Court need not consider the second threshol d requirement of CAFA’s interest of \njustice exception .  However, even if Plaintiff satisfied the  pre-requisite concerning citizenship of \nthe class members, Plaintiff has not met his burden with respect to citizenship of the “primary \ndefendants.”  Plaintiff  argues that “VIPKid is a New York citizen and the primary defendant in \nthis action.”  See Pl.’s Reply at 5 (emphasis in original).  According to Plaintiff, he “has \nconsistently and continuously alleged a single Defendant:  VIPKid.”  Id.   As an initial matter, the \nCourt is concerned that “VIPKid” may not even be a suable entity based up on Defend ants’ \nrepresentation in its Opposition to the instant motion.  Nonetheless, this is not an issue which  \nrequires resolution at this juncture.  See Defs.’ Opp’n at 1 n.1 (stating “VIPKid” is not a \n“juridical”  entity).  E ven if “VIPKid” is a proper defendant  and a New York citizen , it is not the \nonly primary  defendant.  Despite Plaintiff’s contention that “VIPKid” is the only Defendant, \nprimary or otherwise, the Complaint is drafted in that manner .  The Complaint explicitly says \nthat this action was brought a gainst VIPKID “and (or as) all entities that ‘provide’ VIPKid, \njointly and severally .”  See Compl. ¶  27.  Consequently, Plaintiff “maintain[s] that [D] efendants  \nare each equally culpable and liable for the injuries purportedly suffered by the putative clas s \nmembers, [and] there is no rational basis upon which to differentiate the defendants’  status as \nbeing primary  or secondary.”  Brook v. UnitedHealth Grp. Inc., No. 06 CV 12954, 2007 WL \n2827808, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 27, 2007) .  The Complaint and the evidence submitted by \nDefendants demonstrates that some, if not all, of the Defendants have principal places of \nbusiness or headquarters outside New York.  For example, there are Defendants who maintain \ntheir principal places of business and/or headquarter s in Delaware, California, and even China -- Case 2:20-cv-06370-JS-LGD     Document 54     Filed 08/27/21     Page 21 of 25 PageID #:\n<pageID>22 \n and as a result are considered citizens of those locales.  Accordingly, the primary defendants in \nthis action are not all citizens of New York.   \n In light of the fact that Defendants have met their burden to pr ove that federal jurisdiction \npursuant to CAFA exists, and since Plaintiff has failed to sustain his burden to demonstrate an \nexception to the exercise of that jurisdiction, it is respectfully recommended to Judge Seybert that Plaintiff’s motion to remand be denied.\n8  \n C. Abstention  \n In a last -ditch effort , Plaintiff attempts to invoke the abstention doctrines set forth in the \nseminal Supreme Court cases of Burford v. Sun Oil and Railroad Commission of Texas v. Pullman.  See Pl.’s Mem. at 15- 17 (citing Bur ford v. Sun Oil Co., 319 U.S. 315 (1943); Railroad \nComm’n of Tex. v. Pullman, 312 U.S. 496 (1941)).   Pursuant to Burford, “a federal court may \nabstain from hearing a case or claim over which it has jurisdiction to avoid needless disruption of \nstate effort s to establish coherent policy in an area of comprehensive state regulation.”  Friedman \nv. Revenue Mgmt. of N.Y., Inc., 38 F.3d 668, 670 -71 (2d Cir.1994) .  The Supreme Court has \ndistilled the Burford doctrine as follows:  \nWhere timely and adequate state- court review is available, a federal \ncourt sitting in equity must decline to interfere with the proceedings \nor orders of state administrative agencies: (1) when there are \n“difficult questions of state law bearing on policy problems of \nsubstantial public impor t whose importance transcends the result in \nthe case then at bar”; or (2) where the “exercise of federal review of \nthe question in a case and in similar cases would be disruptive of \nstate efforts to establish a coherent policy with respect to a matter of \nsubstantial public concern.”  \n \n8  Based upon the Court’s finding that it is not divested of CAFA jurisdiction, the \nCourt does not need to determine whether Plaintiff’s FLSA claims constitute a sufficient federal \nquestion to invoke jurisdict ion pursuant to § 1331 nor whether the Court has supplemental \njurisdiction over his state law claims.  Case 2:20-cv-06370-JS-LGD     Document 54     Filed 08/27/21     Page 22 of 25 PageID #:\n<pageID>23 \n New Orleans Pub. Serv., Inc. v. Council of City of New Orleans , 491 U.S. 350, 361 (1989) \n(quoting Colorado River Water Conservation Dist. v. United States , 424 U.S. 800, 814 (1976)) . \nThe Second Circuit has identified three factors to consider in determining whether Burford \nabstention is appropriate:  “(1) the degree of specificity of the state regulatory scheme; (2) the \nneed to give one or another debatable construction to a state stat ute; and (3) whether the subject \nmatter of the litigation is traditionally one of state concern.” Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. v. Hurlbut , 585 \nF.3d 639, 650 (2d Cir.2009). In light of that standard, Burford abstention is not appropriate here \nbecause this case does not intrude on state policy or regulatory concerns, nor does Plaintiff even \nidentify a regulatory scheme at issue, let alone a complex one.  At best, Plaintiff appears to argue \nthat Burford abstention is appropriate because if this case is litigated in s tate court, the \nDefendants’ activities would then become  subject to the attention of state regulators.  See Pl.’s \nMem. at 16 -17.  This  argument , however, is an incorrect application of Burford and as a result \nthis Court respectfully recommends to Judge Seybert that abstention on these grounds be \nDENIED.     \n Pullman abstention is a “doctrine of constitutional avoidance” which permits a federal \ncourt to “abstain from deciding a state law issue ‘when it appears that abstention may eliminate \nor materially alter the constitutional issue presented.’”  Moore v. County of Suffolk , 851 F. Supp. \n2d 447, 456- 57 (E.D.N.Y. 2012) (quoting Ohio Bureau of Emp’t Servs. v. Hodory , 431 U.S. 471, \n481 (1977)).  Pullman abstention is only appropriate when three conditions are satisfied:  (1) a state statue is not clear or the issue of stat e law is uncertain; (2) resolution of the federal issue \ndepends upon the interpretation given to the state law; and (3) the state law can be interpreted in a way to avoid or modify the federal constitutional issue.  Id.  (citing McRedmond v. Wilson, 533 \nF.2d 757, 761 (2d Cir. 1976)).  Plaintiff contends that he has “created an unseemly conflict Case 2:20-cv-06370-JS-LGD     Document 54     Filed 08/27/21     Page 23 of 25 PageID #:\n<pageID>24 \n between” this Court and the State Court which could “lead to the premature determination of \nconstitutional questions as Plaintiff alleges fraud committed to advance virtual cloning of American citizens.”  See Pl.’s Mem. at 16.  This is another misapplication of  a federal abstention \ndoctrine.  Plaintiff has not identified a state statute at issue since his claim concerning “virtual cloning” is based upon common law fraud .  Nor has Plaintiff identified a federal constitutional \nquestion that is implicated by this case.   \n Accordingly, this Court respectfully recommend s to Judge Seybert that the Court decline \nto abstain pursuant to Burford or Pullman, and deny Plai ntiff’s request to remand his claims to \nthe extent his request is based upon principles of abstention.   \nV. CONCLUSION  \n For the foregoing reasons, the Court respectfully recommends to Judge Seybert that \nPlaintiff’s motion to remand be DENIED in accordance with this Report and Recommendation. \nVI. OBJECTIONS  \nPursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1)(c) and Rule 72 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, \nthe parties shall have fourteen (14) days from service of this Report and Recommendation to file written objection s.  See F\nED. R. CIV. P. 6(a), (e).  Such objections by an attorney of record shall \nbe filed with the Clerk of the Court via ECF.  A courtesy copy of any objections filed is to be \nsent to the Chambers of the Honorable Joanna Seybert.  Any requests for an extension of \ntime for filing objections must be directed to Judge Seybert  prior to the expiration of the \nfourteen (14) day period for filing objections .  Failure to file objections will result in a waiver \nof those objections for purpose s of appeal. Thomas v.

    "summary": "1. Summary:\nIn the case Sultan v. Trump, the plaintiff, Ahwar Sultan, a noncitizen student in the U.S., challenges the revocation of his F-1 visa and termination of his Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVIS) record, which occurred due to an Executive Order advocating the deportation of noncitizen students involved in protests. The court partially grants Sultan's request for a Temporary Restraining Order, finding that he has shown a likelihood of success on his claims under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and the Fifth Amendment for lack of due process. Notably, the case involves the use of AI in the \"Catch and Revoke\" program to identify and cancel visas of individuals associated with activities or groups deemed threatening to national security.\n\n2. Key Legal Issue:\nThe key legal issue is whether the revocation of Sultan's F-1 visa and termination of his SEVIS record, without adequate due process, violates the Fifth Amendment and the Administrative Procedure Act.\n\n3. Court's Holding:\nThe court held that Sultan is likely to succeed on his claims that the termination of his SEVIS record violated the APA and his procedural due process rights under the Fifth Amendment. Thus, the court granted a temporary restraining order requiring the reinstatement of Sultan's SEVIS record to its \"active\" status, preventing further adverse action until a full review on the merits.\n\n4. ELI5 explanation:\nImagine you’re a student from another country studying in the U.S., and one day the government suddenly takes away your permission to be here, without telling you why or letting you explain your side. A court has said that the government might have done this unfairly, so the judge temporarily put things back to normal while deciding the right way to handle it. The court wants to make sure students have a fair chance to argue their case before being told they have to leave the country.",

Factual Background \n During the 2024 presidential campaign, Defendant , then a candidate for President,  \nrepeatedly vowed to deport noncitizen students who participate in protest activity.  Compl. ¶ 108, ECF No. 1 (“Compl.”).  On or about October 28, 2023, he told one news outlet, “All of the resident aliens who joined in the pro- jihadist protest this month, nobody’s ever seen anything like it.  Come \n2025, we will find you and we will deport you.”  Id .  He repeated similar statements on May 14, \n2024, and on August 13, 2024, to reporters.

Order No. 14161, 90 Fed. Reg. 8451 (Jan. 30, 2025) .  Section 1(b)  of the EO  states that in \norder “[t]o protect Americans  . . . the  United States must ensure that admitted aliens and aliens \notherwise already present in the United States do not  bear hostile attitudes  toward its citizens, \nculture, government, institutions, or founding principles, and do not advocate for, aid, or support \ndesignated foreign terrorists and other  threats to our national security .”  Compl . ¶ 112 ( internal \nquotation marks and citation omitted ) (emphasis added) .  The EO requires Defendants Secretary \nof Homeland Security Kristi Noem , Attorney General Pam Bondi , and the Director of National \nIntelligence Tulsi Gabbard to do the following:  \n1. Section 2(a)(i): “[I]dentify all resources that may be used to ensure that all aliens  . . . who \nare already in the United States, are vetted and screened to the maximum degree possible.”  \n \n2.

Only Sultan, however, brought claims under the Administrative \nProcedure Act  (“APA”) , the Fifth Amendment ’s Due Process Clause, and the Immigration and \nNationality Act.  Id. ¶¶ 165 –90.  In Sultan’s  motion for a temporary restraining order, however, he Case 1:25-cv-01121-TSC     Document 12     Filed 04/24/25     Page 3 of 11Page 4 of 11  \n relies  on his APA claim and his Fifth Amendment claim for procedural and substantive due \nprocess.  Pl. ’s TRO  at 9–10.  H e ask s the court  to: \n1. Declare that Defendants’ termination of his  F-1 student status under the SEVIS system \nwithout affording him sufficient notice and opportunity to be heard violates the Fifth \nAmendment and APA;  \n \n2. Order  Defendants to provide adequate individualized proceedings before an impartial \nadjudicator;  \n \n3. Order Defendants to reinstate his  SEVIS record at OSU  \n \na. or provide him with a reasonable period to maintain his valid F -1 status by allowing \nhim to transfer to another Department of Homeland Security (“DHS ”)-approved \nschool if his reinstatement at OSU is not accepted; \n \n4. Enjoin Defendants from detaining him  while this matter is  pending. \n Id. at 14 . \n \nB. Legal Background  \n An F-1 visa controls a noncitizen  student ’s entry into the United Sates, not  their lawful \nstatus  while in the country.  Congress requires a noncitizen with an F-1 visa to be a “bona fide \nstudent” and “to pursue a full course of study,” 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(15)(F)(i), or “engag[ e] in \nauthorized practical training.”  8 C.F.R. § 214.2(f)(5)(i).   \n The SEVIS database is maintained by I mmigration and Customs Enforcement (“I CE”) to \nmanage and track noncitizen s’ compliance  with the terms of their  visa status.   Compl. ¶  33; 8 \nU.S.C. § 1372(a)(1) ; 86 Fed. Reg. 69663 (Dec. 8, 2021) .  A noncitizen student maintains F -1 legal \nstatus only if the “student is making normal progress toward completed a course of study.”  8 \nC.F.R. § 214.3(f)(5) (i).  Designated School Officials must report through SEVIS when a student \nfails to maintain status.  Id. § 214.3(g)(2) (ii)(A).  If a student’s SEVIS record is terminate d, there \nare consequences : \n1. The s tudent loses all on-  and/or off -campus employment authorization.  Case 1:25-cv-01121-TSC     Document 12     Filed 04/24/25     Page 4 of 11Page 5 of 11  \n 2. The s tudent cannot re -enter the United States on the terminated SEVIS record.  \n3. ICE agents may investigate to confirm the departure of the student.  \n4. Any associated F -2 or M -2 dependent records are terminated.  \n “Terminate a Student,” U.S. Dep’t of Homeland Security, https://perma.cc/5K2T -2JXD.  \nIn addition, when a student’s SEVIS record is terminated , there is “no grace period” for “duration \nof status ”: “If the student and dependents are still in the United States, the student must either \napply for reinstatement, or the student and dependents must leave the United States immediately. ”  \nId.   \n DHS  can terminate a noncitizen’s F -1 legal  status in one of two ways : (1) student -initiated \nfailure; (2) an agency -initiated termination.  Under  the first category, a noncitizen  student  can lose \ntheir lawful status if they engage in unauthorized employment, 8 C.F.R . § 214.1(e), provide  false \ninformation to DHS , id. § 214.1(f), or is convicted of a “crime of  violence ” with a potential \nsentence of more than a year .  Id. § 214.1(g).  For the second category, DHS can terminate a \nstudent’s F -1 status under three circumstances:  \n1. When a previously- granted waiver under INA § 212(d)(3) or (4) is revoked;  \n \n2. When a private bill to confer lawful permanent residence is introduced in Congress; or  \n \n3. When DHS publishes a Federal Register notification identifying national security, diplomatic, or public safety reasons for termination. \nId. § 214.1(d).  Visa revocation is not  a basis for SEVIS  record  termination.  In fact, in a \n2010 policy guidance document, DHS stated that “[v] isa revocation is not, in itself, a cause for \ntermination of the student’s SEVIS record.”  Pl. ’s Reply, Ex. A, Dep’t. Homeland Security, Policy Case 1:25-cv-01121-TSC     Document 12     Filed 04/24/25     Page 5 of 11Page 6 of 11  \n Guidance 1004- 04-Visa Revocations, at 3 (2010) , ECF No. 9- 1 (“Ex. A”) .2  While visa r evocation \ndoes not necessarily terminate a noncitizen’s  status in the United States , the reason for the \nrevocation could lead DHS to review the student’s record and determine that the individual is out \nof status.  Id. at 1 –3.   \n The Secretary of State has wide latitude to refuse entry or deport noncitizens if he has \n“reasonable grounds to believe” that their  presence or activities “would have potentially serious \nadverse foreign policy consequences for the United States.”  See 8 U.S.C. §  1227(a)(4)(C)(i).  \nII. LEGAL STANDARD  \n A temporary restraining order is “an extraordinary remedy that should be granted only \nwhen the party seeking relief, by a clear showing, carries the burden of persuasion.”  Postal Police \nOff. Ass ’n v. U.S. Postal Serv., 502 F. Supp. 3d 411, 418 (D.D.C. 2020)  (citation omitted) .  As \nwith a preliminary injunction, a party seeking a temporary restraining order  must establish “(1) \nthat he is likely to succeed on the merits, (2) that he is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the \nabsence of preliminary relief; (3) that the balance of equities tips in his favor; and (4) that an \ninjunction is in the public interest .”  Aamer v. Obama, 742 F.3d 1023, 1038 (D.C. Cir. 2014) \n(quoting Sherley v. Sebelius , 644 F.3d 388, 392 (D.C. Cir. 2011)).  The third and fourth factors \nmerge when the gover nment is an opposing party.  Nken v. Holder , 556 U.S. 418, 435 (2009).  \n A court also considers the “underlying purpose” of a temporary restraining order —\n“preserving the status quo and preventing irreparable harm” until it has an opportunity to rule on the merits.  See Granny Goose Foods, Inc. v. Bhd. of Teamsters & Auto Truck Drivers Loc. No. 70 \nof Alameda Cnty., 415 U.S. 423, 439 (1974); Shelley v. Am. Postal Workers Union, 775 F. Supp. \n \n2 Defense counsel represented at the court’s hearing on April 28, 2025, that he has “not received \na response” “as to whether or not” the 2010 policy “has been cancelled.”  Temp. Restraining \nOrder Hr’g Tr. at 17:8 –10. Case 1:25-cv-01121-TSC     Document 12     Filed 04/24/25     Page 6 of 11Page 7 of 11  \n 2d 197, 202 (D.D.C. 2011) (“The court may issue a temporary restraining order (‘TRO’) when a \nmovant is faced with the possibility that irreparable injury will occur even before the hearing for a preliminary injunction required by Federal Rule of Civil Proc edure 65(a) can be held.”); Elec. \nData Sys. Fed. Corp. v. Gen. Servs. Admin., 629 F. Supp. 350, 352 (D.D.C. 1986) (“In the context of the limited purpose of a temporary restraining order, the Court ’s analysis of these factors seeks \nprincipally to ensure pr eservation of the status quo.”).  \nIII. ANALYSIS  \nA. Irreparable Harm  \n Demonstrating irreparable harm is “a threshold requirement in granting temporary \ninjunctive relief.”  Beattie v. Barnhart , 663 F. Supp. 2d 5, 8 (D.D.C. 2009) (citing CityFed Fin. \nCorp. v. Off. of Thrift Supervision, 58 F.3d 738, 747 (D.C. Cir. 1995)).  To show irreparable harm, \nthe “injury alleged must be ‘both certain and great, actual and not theoretical, beyond remediation, and of such imminence that there is a clear and present need for equitable relief.’”  Church v. Biden, \n573 F. Supp. 3d 118, 138 (D.D.C. 2021) (quoting Mexichem Specialty Resins, Inc. v. EPA , 787 \nF.3d 544, 555 (D.C. Cir. 2015)  (emphasis in original) ). \n Sultan has shown that he faces  irreparabl e harm from  Defendants’ actions .  His SEVIS \nrecord has been  terminated , Ex. 3 at 1, and Defendants  confirm ed that his F-1 visa has also been  \nrevoked.  Temp. Restraining Order  Hr’g Tr. at 9: 9–10.  Yet , despite being asked by the court at \nthe temporary restraining order  hearing, defense counsel stated that he did not know  whether  \nSultan  is accruing unlawful presence in the United States because he is waiting for a response from \nICE.  Id. at 13:15–14: 3.  Defense counsel also stated that he could not say whether the government  \nintends  to initiate removal proceedings.  Id. at 22:12–15.  As a result, Sultan is in a c atch-22 \nsituation —he cannot attend  school or work because his SEVIS record is terminated; nor do es he \nknow whether he should leave the United States  immediately or risk being subject to removal Case 1:25-cv-01121-TSC     Document 12     Filed 04/24/25     Page 7 of 11Page 8 of 11  \n proceedings , because Defendants refuse to provide him with the necessary information.  Sultan \nmust therefore wait in legal limbo , at possible risk of detention, until Defendants decide whether \nand how he should be removed.  \n To be sure, Defendants are correct that  “the burden of  removal alone cannot constitute the \nrequisite irreparable injury .”  Nken , 556 U.S. at 435.  But Sultan’s harm does not end there.  He is \n(1) unable to work without a work authorization; (2) harmed by the allegation that he has a criminal \nrecord; and (3) is accruing unlawful presence in the United States, which places him at risk of detention and deportation and jeopardizes any opportunity he may have to return to the U nited \nStates  for employment, educa tion, or personal travel.  Pl. ’s TRO at 10–11.  Other district judges \nin this C ircuit considering similar challenges for terminating certain international students’ SEVIS \nrecords and F -1 visas have found similar harm and, as a result, have entered at least seven \ntemporary restraining orders  to date .  Temp. Restraining Order Hr’g Tr. at 2:15–24.\n3 \n Defendants’ arguments to the contrary are unpersuasive.  They argue  that Sultan has not \nlost his “ability to complete his academic studies ,” nor does he “include allegations” that ICE \n“revoked any employment authorization.”  Defs.’ Opp’n at 13, ECF No. 8 (“Defs.’ Opp’n”).   Yet \nSultan was instructed  by OSU on April 3, 2025, to cease all F -1 related activity , including school \nand work.  Ex. 3 at 1.  Defendants respond that OSU, not DHS, sent Sultan the April 3 email.  \nTemp. Restraining Order Hr’g Tr. at 17:17–19.  But r egardless of who sent the email , DHS’s  own \npolicy is that termination of  a noncitizen student’s  SEVIS record means that the y should at least \n \n3 See also Hinge v. Lyons , No. 25- 1097 (RBW);  Dogan v. Noem , No. 25- 1130 (RBW); Mashatti \nv. Lyons , No. 25- 1100 (RJL ); Bushireddy v. Lyons , No. 25- 1102 (SLS) ; J.I.O. v.

Temp. Restraining \nOrder Hr’g Tr. at 14:17–25, 15:1 –5.  As an officer of the court, counsel has a duty of candor to \nanswer its questions.  United States v. Bruce , 89 F.3d 886, 894 (D.C. Cir. 1996) (explaining that \nthe duty of candor applies even if compliance risk disclosure of confidential information and \nincludes the obligation “to avoid making a false statement to the tribunal”).  At this juncture, more \nthan two weeks ha ve elapsed since Sultan filed his  Complain t and  the court is highly skeptical of \ncounsel’s representations  that Defendants are still w aiting for ICE to confirm whether Sultan’s \npresence in the United States is unlawful .  Temp. Restraining Order Hr’g Tr. at 13: 15–14: 3.  \nTherefore, the court will order  Defendants to designate  a representative to appear at the court’s \nnext hearing who can make authoritative representations on behalf of DHS  and ICE .  \nB. Likelihood of Success  \n Sultan  has also shown a likelihood of success on at least his APA claim  that Defendants’ \nactions are arbitrary and capricious, violate DHS regulation s, and fail to accord him  due process .  \nPl.’s TRO at 8 –9; Compl. ¶¶  165–75.  As an initial matter, terminating  Sultan’s SEVIS record is \nlikely a final agency action, as it has  a potentially severe legal consequence  for P laintiff, who can \nno longer work and who may have to leave the United States.  Bennett v. Spear s, 502 U.S. 154, \n178 (1997) (requiring a two- step inquiry for finality: (i) action must mark the end of the agency’s \nprocess, and (ii) action must be one  from  which legal consequences will flow).  Defendants point \nto no legal authority to ter minate Sultan’s SEVIS record based on his expunged, and indeed, \ndismissed April 2024 charges.  Defs.’ Opp’n at 5– 18.  Consequently, OSU’s notification to  Sultan \non DHS’s behalf that his SEVIS record termination was because he was  “identified in  [a] criminal Case 1:25-cv-01121-TSC     Document 12     Filed 04/24/25     Page 9 of 11Page 10 of 11  \n records check ” does not appear to be based on  reasoned decision making, and therefore may be \narbitrary and capricious .  Ex.3 at 1; 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A).   Even though Defendants refuse to  \nconfirm whether Sultan ’s F-1 legal status is terminated, it is reasonable to assum e that it is , because \nhis visa has been revoked and his SEVIS record terminated, in which case Defendants have  \nviolated 8 C.F.R. § 214.1(d)  by not following its own regulation before doing so.  And because the \nAPA provides for due process, Defendants ’ failure to  provide Sultan with an opportunity to be \nheard regarding his SEVIS record termination  also indicates a likelihood of success on the merits .  \n5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(D).   \nC. Balance of Equities and Public Interest  \nFinally, t he balance of equities and public interest tip in favor of granting a  temporary \nrestraining order.  Pursuing A m.’s Greatness v. FEC , 831 F.3d 500, 511 (D.C. Cir. 2016)  (stating  \nthat the equities and public interest are “one and the same” when  the government is the non -\nmovant).  Sultan risks deportation or accrual of unlawful presence; in contrast, DHS is not harmed \nby temporarily reactivating Sultan’s SEVIS record pending further review of this case’s  merits .   \n Accordingly, to preserve the status quo, the court will grant Sultan ’s Motion insofar  that it \nseeks his SEVIS record  be returned  to “Active” as of April 3, 2025, and that Defendants be  \nenjoined from modifying Sultan’s SEVIS record  based on  his April 23, 2024, arrest at OSU.  Pl. ’s \nTRO at 14 –15. \nIV. CONCLUSION \n For the foregoing reasons , the court will GRANT IN PART and DENY IN PART  \nPlaintiff’s Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order .  A corresponding order will follow shortly.  Case 1:25-cv-01121-TSC     Document 12     Filed 04/24/25     Page 10 of 11Page 11 of 11  \n Date: April 24, 2025 \nTanya S. Chutkan  \nTANYA S.

    "summary": "1. **Summary:** In this case, Plaintiff Zonna Lee filed a lawsuit against her former employer, ElectrifAi, LLC, and its associates, claiming various forms of retaliation and wrongful termination. The case highlights the involvement of AI, as Plaintiff alleged that ElectrifAi's AI products, which she was responsible for selling, were fraudulent, as they were not truly AI-powered but rather operated manually. The court dismissed most of Lee’s claims due to insufficiencies in pleading, including lack of specific allegations regarding discrimination or unlawful conduct.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue:** Whether the plaintiff’s complaint sufficiently establishes claims of retaliation, discrimination, and wrongful termination under Title VII, NJLAD, CEPA, and other legal theories, and whether any of the products her role involved are fraudulent in their advertised AI functionality.\n\n3. **Court's Holding:** The court granted the defendants' motions to dismiss, dismissing the majority of the claims without prejudice due to insufficient allegations that failed to establish plausible claims of discrimination or retaliation. Claims dismissed with prejudice include those against individual defendants where Title VII does not provide individual liability.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation:** Imagine you have a job where you're supposed to sell really cool robot products that the company claims can think for themselves. If you find out that these robots are actually people in costume, and then you get fired from your job, you might complain that your firing was unfair or based on you speaking out. In this case, the person telling the story didn't explain well enough why their firing was illegal or unfair according to the rules, so the judge couldn't let the case continue.",

BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY  \nPlaintiff, a Caucasian woman, is a former employee of ElectrifAi.1  (Am. Compl. ¶ 3).  \nPlaintiff was sixty -six years old while she worked for ElectrifAi.2  (Id.).  Over multiple weeks in \nFebruary, March, and April 2022, Plaintiff spoke with (i) Scott, ElectrifAi’s Chief Executive \nOfficer, (ii) Clark, ElectrifAi’s General Counsel and head of Human Resources, (iii) Agarwal, ElectrifAi’s Executive Vice President and  Head of Products and Alliances, and (iv) Wang, \nElectrifAi’s Chief Technology Officer, regarding her working in an executive sales capacity for ElectrifAi.  ( Id. ¶¶ 6 -9, 16).  During these discussions, Plaintiff was “repeatedly advised” \nElectrifAi’s products were machine learning or AI, and that her position would involve selling these products.  ( Id. ¶ 17).  Plaintiff also informed the Individual Defendants about her “medical \ncondition, which made it unsafe to receive a Covid -19 vaccine and thus unable to travel by plane.”  \n(Id. ¶ 19).  \nOn April 9, 2022, Plaintiff received an offer letter from ElectrifAi to work as a “Senior \nAccount Manager.”  ( Id. ¶ 20).  The offer letter provided, in relevant part: “This offer letter does \nnot create or imply any contract of employment, and your employment with the Company will at all times be on an ‘at -will’ basis.”  (ECF No. 27-1 at ¶ 8).   \nPlaintiff accepted ElectrifAi’s offer and returned a signed Offer Letter on or  around April \n12, 2022, and started  on May 2, 2022.  (Am. Compl. ¶ 23). \n When she began working at ElectrifAi, \nPlaintiff alleges her job title was changed to “Senior Director of Business Development” and then again, on May 19, 2022, to “Senior Vice President of Global Sales and Strategy.”  ( Id. ¶¶ 34 -35).  \nPlaintiff alleges Scott advised her the title was changed a third time “because her former title(s) \n \n1 The following factual allegations are taken from the Amended Complaint that are accepted as true.  Sheridan v. NGK \nMetals Corp., 609 F.3d 239, 262 n.27 (3d Cir. 2010).  \n2 Plaintiff alleges ElectrifAi is owned by White Oak.  (Am. Compl. ¶ 11).  Case 2:23-cv-02239-JXN-JRA     Document 67     Filed 09/13/24     Page 2 of 33 PageID:\n<pageID>3 \n did not have enough ‘push’ behind them to be of use while contacting clients.”  ( Id. ¶ 36).  Other \nthan the change of title, her position was identical in all “material respects,” including her pay and \nbenefits.  ( Id. ¶ 37).   \nPlaintiff further alleges her efforts to make sales were “significantly hindered” from the \nbeginning.  ( Id. ¶ 40).  Plaintiff was not provided “specific information” about how ElectrifAi’s \nproducts worked.  ( Id.).  Additionally, the Executive Committee took prospective clients away \nfrom the sales team when prospective clients indicated they were interested in purchasing ElectrifAi’s products.  ( Id. ¶ 42).  \nFurther, while working for ElectrifAi, Plaintiff alleges she learned information about \nElectrifAi’s dysfunctional and fraudulent products.  ( Id. ¶¶ 49 -53).  For instance, Plaintiff was \nadvised by “client -facing staff” that several of the machine learning/AI products “were not \nworking properly.”  ( Id. ¶ 49).  Thereafter, Plaintiff was advised by an ElectrifAi employee that \nthe products “were not actually operated by machine learning or artificial intelligence but rather \nby manual labor, and that ElectrifAi c ould not afford to staff these products sufficiently, resulting \nin several products losing functionality.”   (Id. ¶ 50).  Additionally, Plaintiff was informed by \nanother ElectrifAi employee that ElectrifAi was actually selling services, rather than products, like the one using machine learning/AI.  ( Id. ¶ 51).   \nPlaintiff also alleges the Individual Defendants disregarded her advice to (i) utilize \nstandardized systems for data storage, communications, and customer relationship management (“CRM”); (ii) hire a Salesforce Administrator to design a customized CRM system; or (iii) replace or reduce the number of unproductive assistants.  ( Id. ¶¶ 54 -66).  Additionally, Plaintiff alleges she \nwas provided “contradictory instructions” that restricted her ability to properly perform her position and left her “guessing” what was expected by ElectrifAi.  ( Id. ¶¶ 73 -88).   Case 2:23-cv-02239-JXN-JRA     Document 67     Filed 09/13/24     Page 3 of 33 PageID:\n<pageID>4 \n Moreover, Plaintiff alleges the work environment at ElectrifAi “was incredibly hostile in \nthat she was subject to rampant discriminatory, offensive, threatening language used by \nexecutives.”  ( Id. ¶89).  During daily videoconference or telephone meetings that Scott oversaw  \nand “less inclusive internal calls” with the Individual Defendants, Plaintiff alleges Scott regularly made “comments that were discriminatory on their face” and reflected “an obvious disdain for people of certain races, sexes, disabilities, and ages.”  ( Id. ¶¶ 90 -91).  For instance, in a client \nmeeting, Scott asked a potential client: “Are you Iranian?”  ( Id. ¶ 92).  Additionally, Scott \n“admonished Plaintiff in front of a large group of ElectrifAi employees as being ‘too stupid to understand’ something he mentioned.”  ( Id. ¶ 97).  Scott also regularly and publicly screamed at \ncertain members of ElectrifAi’s sales team.  ( Id. ¶ 99).   \nOn August 21, 2022, Plaintiff sent the Individual Defendants an email outlining the status \nof her calls made the previous Friday and upcoming email campaigns.  ( See ECF 27 -3 at 5 -6).  \nAfter Agarwal and Wang responded with follow -up questions and recommendations, Scott sent an \nemail regarding ElectrifAi’s “target list” and potential clients to contact.  ( Id. at 3-5).  Scott also \nstated:  \nIf I told you the amount of time it takes me to penetrate you would be shocked.  It’s \nstarts with a hook of what I call “industrial logic” as to why someone should take a meeting.. (sic) If you think you are good to send an untrained inside sales executives \nwith a random email who does not understand the client’s business and exactly how NLP, CV and Machine Learning can quickly drive value – you’re kidding yourself.  \nThere has to be basic  prep and I have not seen the sales team do that.  Talk to every \nperso n who responded to me and they will invariably say “there was something that \nstruck a chord in Ed’s note or phone call”.  \n It’s not done by chance.  It’s preparation.  We need visibility to Ms. Lee ASAP.  Rahul will manage and handle her one way or the other.   \n Case 2:23-cv-02239-JXN-JRA     Document 67     Filed 09/13/24     Page 4 of 33 PageID:\n<pageID>5 \n (Id. at 3).  On August 22, 2022, Plaintiff “immediately objected” to Scott’s email and responded \nto the accusations that she was untrained and “operating without visibility from leadership.”  (Am. \nCompl. ¶ 108; see also ECF No. 27- 3 at 1 -3).   \n Plaintiff remained “uncomfortable” and believed the email “was one of many instances of \nharassment perpetrated by the Executive Committee.”  (Am. Compl. ¶¶ 109 -10).  As such, Plaintiff \nscheduled a n August 25, 2022 meeting with the Human Resources representative and  discussed \nScott’s email and why Plaintiff believed it constituted harassment.  ( Id. ¶¶ 112, 114).  The Human \nResources representative indicated the contents of the meeting were “strictly confidential” and she “would explore the actions of [Scott ] and address them accordingly.”  ( Id. ¶¶ 113, 115).  \nApproximately three hours after the meeting, Plaintiff was terminated and advised “her ‘position’ had been ‘eliminated.’”  ( Id. ¶¶ 116 -17).   \n After her termination, Plaintiff alleges many of her prospective new employers would have \ncontacted her supervisors at ElectrifAi to discuss her qualifications or explain her “abrupt tenure.”  \n(Id. ¶ 122).  Plaintiff alleges ElectrifAi has attempted to ruin her reputation by “using false or \nmisleading statements which mischaracterize her tenure at ElectrifAi and/or her qualifications to continue working in an executive sales capacity for other companies.”  ( Id. ¶ 123).  Plaintiff further \nalleges ElectrifAi has reported “false, misleading, or otherwise erroneous information to various \nfederal or state agencies,” which has deprived her of the ability to collect unemployment and insurance.  ( Id. ¶ 125).  Additionally, Plaintiff alleges she was required to visit the hospital in \nFebruary 2023 for an irregular heartbeat, which “was obviously related to the stress Plaintiff experienced while working at ElectrifAi and immediately after her Termination. ”  (Id. ¶ 129).  \n On April 21, 2023, Plaintiff filed her initial complaint.  (ECF No. 1).  After ElectrifAi, \nWhite Oak, Clark, Agarwal, and Wang indicated they intended to file motions to dismiss for failure Case 2:23-cv-02239-JXN-JRA     Document 67     Filed 09/13/24     Page 5 of 33 PageID:\n<pageID>6 \n to state a claim, (ECF Nos. 14, 22), Plaintiff filed an Amended Complaint on September 13, 2023 \n(ECF No. 27).  The Amended Complaint alleges ten causes of action: (i) retaliation under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e, et seq.  (“Title VII”) (Count One); (ii) retaliation \nunder New Jersey’s Law Against Discrimination, N.J. Stat. Ann. § 10:5-1, et seq.  (“NJLAD”) \n(Count Two); (iii) retaliation in violation of public policy under Pierce v. Ortho Pharmaceutical Corp., 416 A.2d 505 (N.J. 1980) (Count Three); (iv) violation of the Conscientious Employee Protection Act, N.J. Stat. Ann. § 34:19-1, et seq.  (“CEPA”) (Count Four); (v) hostile work \nenvironment under Title VII (Count Five); (vi) hostile work environment under NJLAD (Count Six); (vii) intentional infliction of emotional distress (Count Seven); (viii) fraudulent misrepresentation (Count Eight); ( ix) defamation (Count Nine); and (x) breach of the implied \nwarranty of good faith and fair dealing (Count Ten).  (ECF No. 27).     On October 13, 2023, Defendants filed the pending motions to dismiss (ECF Nos. 32-34), which Plaintiff opposed (ECF Nos. 41- 43), to which Defendants replied.  (ECF Nos. 47- 48, 50).\n3  \nThis matter is now ripe for consideration.  \nII. LEGAL STANDARD  \nRule 8 requires that a pleading include “a short and plain statement of the claim showing \nthat the pleader is entitled to relief” and provide the defendant with “fair notice of what the claim is and the grounds upon which it rests[.]” Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly , 550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007)  \n \n3 The Court will refer to the parties’ respective motion papers as the following:  \n•  White Oak’s brief in support of its motion (ECF No. 32) will be referred to as “White Oak Br.”;  \n•  Plaintiff’s opposition to White Oak’s motion (ECF No. 42) will be referred to as “Opp’n to White Oak”;  \n•  White Oak’s reply brief (ECF No. 50) will be referred to as “White Oak Reply”;  \n•  ElectrifAi, Clark, Agarwal, and Wang’s brief in support of their motion (ECF No. 33) will be referred to as \n“ElectrifAi Br.”;  \n•  Plaintiff’s opposition to ElectrifAi’s brief (ECF No. 41) will be referred to as “Opp’n to ElectrifAi”;  \n•  ElectrifAi, Clark, Agarwal, and Wang’s reply brief (ECF No. 47) will be referred to as “ElectrifAi Reply”;  \n•  Scott’s brief in support of his motion (ECF No. 34) will be referred to as “Scott Br.”;  \n•  Plaintiff’s opposition to Scott’s brief (ECF No. 43) will be referred to as “Opp’n to Scott”; and  \n•  Scott’s reply brief (ECF No. 48) will be referred to as “Scott Reply”.

On a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, the “facts alleged must be taken as true” and dismissal \nis not appropriate where “it appears unlikely that the plaintiff can prove those facts or will \nultimately prevail on the merits.”  Phillips v. Cnty. Of Allegheny , 515 F.3d 224, 231 (3d Cir. 2008) \n(citation omitted).  A complaint will survive a motion to dismiss if it provides a sufficient factual basis to state a facially plausible claim for relief.  Ashcroft v. Iqbal , 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009).     \nIn analyzing the sufficiency of a complaint, the Third Circuit requires that courts engage \nin a three- part inquiry: (1) recite the elements that must be pled in order to state a claim; (2) \ndetermine which allegations in the complaint are merely conclusory and therefore need not be given an assumption of truth; and (3) “assume the[] veracity” of well -pleaded factual allegations \nand ascertain whether they plausibly “give rise to an entitlement for relief.”  Santiago v. Warminster Twp., 629 F.3d 121, 130 (3d Cir. 2010) (citations omitted).   \nIII. DISCUSSION\n4 \nA. Plaintiff Fails to Plead Plausible Title VII Claims (Counts One and Five)  \nThe Court first considers Plaintiff’s retaliation and hostile work environment claims under \nTitle VII.  As a threshold matter, Title VII requires a plaintiff bringing an action against an employer to first file an action with the EEOC within 180 days of the alleged conduct.  42 U.S.C. § 2000e -5(e)(1); Webb v. City of Phila., 562 F.3d 256, 262 (3d Cir. 2009) (“Before bringing suit \nunder Title VII in federal court, a plaintiff must first file a charge with the EEOC.”).  \nAfter filing a charge with the EEOC, a plaintiff must receive a “right to sue” letter before \nfiling with the district court.  See Burgh v. Borough Council of Borough of Montrose , 251 F.3d 465, \n470 (3d Cir. 2001) (stating the EEOC will then investigate the charge, and the plaintiff must wait until the EEOC issues a right -to-sue letter before she can initiate a private action); Ditzel v. Univ. \n \n4 For sake of clarity, when citing the parties’ briefs and supporting documents, the Court cites to the page number \nlisted in the ECF header.  Case 2:23-cv-02239-JXN-JRA     Document 67     Filed 09/13/24     Page 7 of 33 PageID:\n<pageID>8 \n of Med. & Dentistry of N.J., 962 F. Supp. 595, 602 (D.N.J. 1997).  This requirement is necessary \n“to put the EEOC on notice of the claims,” affording “it the opportunity to settle disputes” to  avoid \n“unnecessary action in court.”  Webb , 562 F.3d at 262.  “If a plaintiff brings suit under Title VII . . \n. before receiving a ‘right -to-sue letter,’ the matter may be dismissed pursuant to Federal Rule of \nCivil Procedure 12(b)(6) for failure to exhaust administrative remedies.”  Small v. Rahway Bd. of Educ., No. 17-1963, 2017 WL 1351400, at *2 (D.N.J. April 6, 2017) (citations omitted).   \nHere, the Amended Complaint contains no allegations that Plaintiff exhausted her \nadministrative remedies, nor does Plaintiff provide any such representations in opposition to the motions to dismiss.  Accordingly, dismissal of the Title VII claims is warranted.  Burg v. U.S. Dep’t \nof Health and Human Servs., 387 F. App’x 237, 241 n.6 (3d Cir. 2010) (recognizing that failure to exhaust may be raised, in appropriate circumstances, on a motion to dismiss).  Because Title VII does not provide for individual liability, the Court dismisses with prejudice all claims within Counts One and Five against the Individual Defendants .\n5  If Plaintiff fails to amend this Complaint \nto include allegations that she has exhausted all administrative remedies prior to filing her Title VII claims, the remaining Title VII claims at Counts One and Five will be dismissed with prejudice.  \nB. Plaintiff Fails to Plead a NJLAD Retaliation Claim (Count Two) \nElectrifAi and the Individual Defendants contend that Plaintiff has not established a prima \nfacie  case of retaliation under NJLAD because she has failed to plead facts that she engaged in a \nprotected activity.  (ElectrifAi Br. at 18 -20; Scott Br. at 1).  In opposition, Plaintiff argues she has \nsatisfied this burden through allegations that she had reported Scott’s August 25, 2022 email to \n \n5 The Court finds the Title VII claims must be dismissed against the Individual Defendants because Title VII does not \nsubject individual supervisory employees to liability.  See Sheridan v. E.I. DuPont de Nemours & Co. ¸ 100 F.3d 1061, \n1078 (3d Cir. 1996) (“Congress did not intend to hold individual employees liable under Title VII.”); Newsome v. \nAdmin. Off. of the Cts. of the State of N.J. , 51 F. App’x 76, 79 n.1 (3d Cir. 2002) (“It is settled that Title VII does not \nprovide for individual liability.”); Emerson v. Thiel Coll. , 296 F.3d 184, 190 (3d Cir. 2002) (“[I]ndividual employees \nare not liable under Title VII”).   Case 2:23-cv-02239-JXN-JRA     Document 67     Filed 09/13/24     Page 8 of 33 PageID:\n<pageID>9 \n Human Resources “under the belief this email was harassment.”  (Opp’n to ElectrifAi at 8).6  As \nPlaintiff has failed to sufficiently allege that she engaged in a protected employee activity, the \nCourt will dismiss the NJLAD retaliation claim.  \nThe NJLAD prohibits an employer from taking any retaliatory action against an employee \nwho engages in a protected activity.  N.J. Stat. Ann. § 10:5- 12(d).  To state a prima facie  case for \nretaliation under NJLAD, an employee must demonstrate: “(1) the employee engaged in a protected employee activity; (2) the employer took an adverse employment action after or contemporaneous with the employee’s protected activity; and (3) a causa l link exists between the \nemployee’s protected activity and the employer’s adverse action.”  Abramson v. William Paterson Coll. of N.J., 260 F.3d 265, 286 (3d Cir. 2001).\n7  “An NJLAD retaliation claim can only succeed \nwhere the plaintiff shows that he or she faced reprisal for opposing conduct that the NJLAD prohibits, including discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.”  \nSharp v. Kean Univ., 153 F. Supp. 3d 669, 676 (D.N.J. 2015) (internal quotation marks omitted).   \n“To engage in protected activity, the employee must identify what illegal employment \npractice is being opposed, by either implicitly or explicitly alleging that a protected characteristic was the basis for the adverse employment action.”  Phillip v. Starbucks Corp., 624 F. Supp. 3d \n \n6 As the Court discussed supra , Plaintiff’s Title VII claims fail due to her failure to exhaust administrative remedies \nprior to raising these claims.  Notwithstanding, because the analyses for Title VII and NJLAD claims are the same, \nthe Court’s analysis also applies to her retaliator y discharge claim brought under Title VII.  See Cortes v. Univ. of \nMed. & Dentistry of N.J. , 391 F. Supp. 2d 298, 311 (D.N.J. 2005) (explaining “[t]he analysis which is applied in Title \nVII claims is equally applicable to actions brought under other civil rights statutes, and thus the Title VII analysis applies to claims brought under the NJLAD as well.” (internal citation omitted); see also Hargrave v. Cnty. of Atl. , \n262 F. Supp. 2d 393, 410 (D.N.J. 2003) (“As a general matter, the same basic principles apply when evaluating [a] \n[p]laintiff’s claims under [Title VII and the NJLAD].”).  Accordingly, the Court finds, for the reasons set forth below, \nthat Plaintiff’s Title VII retaliatory discharge claim fails even if she had exhausted all administrative remedies prior \nto filing her claim.   \n7 Some courts explicitly include a fourth element in analyzing whether a plaintiff has stated a claim for retaliation in \nviolation of the NJLAD —i.e., that plaintiffs show they are in a protected class.  See, e.g. , Berdzik v. Physicians \nEndoscopy, LLC , No. 20 -11656, 2021 WL 3260857, at *7 (D.N.J. July 30, 2021); Victor v. State , 4 A.3d 126, 141 \n(N.J. 2010).  Other courts do not explicitly include this fourth element in their analysis. See, e.g. , Abramson, 260 F.3d \nat 286 (articulating three elements for a prima facie case of retaliation under Title VII and the NJLAD); Woods -Pirozzi \nv. Nabisco Foods , 675 A.2d 684, 695 (N.J. 1996) (same).  Case 2:23-cv-02239-JXN-JRA     Document 67     Filed 09/13/24     Page 9 of 33 PageID:\n<pageID>10 \n 530, 546- 47 (D.N.J. 2022) (internal quotation marks omitted).  “‘A general complaint of unfair \ntreatment,’ however, ‘is insufficient to establish protected activity’ under Title VII and the \nNJLAD.”  Id. at 547 (quoting Curay -Cramer v. Ursuline Acad. of Wilmington, Del., Inc., 450 F.3d \n130, 135 (3d Cir. 2006)).  “The ‘complaint[ ] must be specific enough to notify management of the particular type of discrimination at issue in order to constitute protected activity.”’  Id. (alteration \nin original) (quoting Sanchez v. SunGard Availability Servs. LP , 362 F. App’x 283, 288 (3d Cir. \n2010)).  \nHere, the Court finds Plaintiff failed to plead a retaliation claim in violation of the NJLAD \nbecause her reporting of Scott’s email does not constitute a protected activity.  Plaintiff alleges she complained to Human Resources that the email was harassmen t.  (Am. Compl. ¶¶ 114, 145).  \nHowever, Plaintiff never alleges she believed the email to be harassment as a result of any NJLAD -\nprotected characteristic.   \nNot every complaint, however, is considered a protected activity under the NJLAD.  \nOgunbayo v. Hertz Corp., 542 F. App’x 105, 107 (3d Cir. 2013).  In Ogunbayo, the court found the plaintiff’s complaints were not a protected activity because “she never mentioned any NJLAD -\nprotected characteristics in her letters, let alone attempted to connect the alleged mistreatment to any such characteristic.”  Id.  Instead, the court found it was merely a “‘general complaint of unfair \ntreatment’” that does not amount to a charge of illegal discrimination.  Id. (quoting Barber v. CSX \nDistribution Servs., 68 F.3d 694, 701- 02 (3d Cir. 1995)).  Similarly, here, Plaintiff’s email to Scott \ncomplains about his views of her work performance but does not allege discrimination based on a NJLAD category (i.e., race, gender, religion, etc.).  ( See ECF No. 27- 3).   \nMoreover, although Plaintiff described Scott’s email as “harassment” in the Amended \nComplaint, the use of this word alone is insufficient to convert her conversation with Human Case 2:23-cv-02239-JXN-JRA     Document 67     Filed 09/13/24     Page 10 of 33 PageID:\n<pageID>11 \n Resources about the email into a form of “protected activity.”  Ogunbayo, 542 F. App’x at 107 n.2; \nsee also Kelly v. Howard I. Shapiro & Assocs. Consulting Eng’rs, P .C., 716 F.3d 10, 17 (2d Cir. 2013) (“Although particular words such as ‘discrimination’ are certainly not required to put an employer on notice of a protected complaint, neither are they sufficient to do so if nothing in the substance of the complaint sugges ts that the complained -of activity is, in fact, unlawfully \ndiscriminatory.”).   \nAdditionally, Plaintiff’s allegation that the Individual Defendants violated NJLAD as \n“aiders and abettors of Plaintiff’s retaliation” similarly fails.  (Am. Compl. ¶ 149).  As stated above, \nPlaintiff fails to allege a retaliatory discharge claim under NJLAD.  Therefore, “because Plaintiff’s underlying causes of action fail, there can be no claim for aiding and abetting in violation of the NJLAD.”  Haddix v. Camden Cnty. Youth Det. Ctr., No. 13- 1594, 2015 WL 3755023, at *6 (D.N.J. \nJune 16, 2015) (citing Ivan v. Cnty. of Middlesex , 595 F. Supp. 2d 425, 463 (D.N.J. 2009)); accord \nMonaco v. Am. Gen. Assur. Co., 359 F.3d 296, 307 n.15 (3d Cir. 2004) (holding that, because plaintiff's underlying NJLAD claim fails, “any claim he brought against the individual defendants for aiding and abetting fails as well.”).  Accordingly, the Court dismisses Count Two without prejudice.  \nC. Plaintiff Fails to Plead a Pierce Retaliation Claim (Count Three) \nElectrifAi and the Individual Defendants next seek dismissal of Plaintiff’s Pierce claim \nbecause it seeks to vindicate rights already protected under NJLAD and CEPA and fails to adequately plead sufficient facts to establish a wrongful discharge claim.  ElectrifAi Br. at 21 -26; \nScott Br. at 1.  In opposition, Plaintiff argues the Pierce claim is not precluded by her NJLAD and CEPA claims and adequately sets forth adequate factual allegations.  Opp’n to ElectrifAi at 9; Case 2:23-cv-02239-JXN-JRA     Document 67     Filed 09/13/24     Page 11 of 33 PageID:\n<pageID>12 \n Opp’n to Scott at 9- 10.  As Plaintiff fails to allege any public policy that Defendants purportedly \nviolated, the Court will dismiss her Pierce claim.  \nIn Pierce, the New Jersey Supreme Court explained that “an employee has a cause of action \nfor wrongful discharge when the discharge is contrary to a clear mandate of public policy.”  Id. at \n512.  “To establish a case for common law wrongful discharge, the employee must identify the \nclear mandate of public policy and that the discharge itself was in violation of that public policy.”  Myers v. Advanced Stores Co., No. 19- 18183, 2020 WL 2744632, at *6 (D.N.J. May 27, 2020) \n(citing Tartaglia v. UBS PaineWebber Inc. , 961 A.2d 1167, 1183 (N.J. 2008)).   \nCritically, “more is needed than simply the breach of public policy affecting a single \nperson’s rights to constitute the breach of a ‘clear mandate’ of public policy that Pierce requires.”  Hennessey v. Coastal Eagle Point Oil Co., 609 A.2d 11, 19- 20 (N.J. 1992).  A plaintiff must “prove \nnot only that he or she complained about [an employer’s] policy, but that his or her resulting discharge violated a clear mandate of public policy.”  Tartaglia, 961 A.2d at 1184.  As such, “[i]f \nan employee does not point to a clear expression of public policy, the court can grant a motion to dismiss or for summary judgment.”  Pierce , 417 A.2d at 513. \nAs a threshold matter, there is no individual liability for a Pierce claim.  See Metzler v. Am. \nTransp. Grp., L.L.C., No. 07- 2066, 2008 WL 413311, at *5 (D.N.J. Feb. 13, 2008) (“A plaintiff is \nonly able to maintain a Pierce cause of action against his or her employer —not against individual \nemployees.”) (citing O’Lane v. N.J. Dep’t of Corr., 712 A.2d 1177, 1180 (N.J. Super. Ct. App. Div. 1998)).  Accordingly, the Pierce  wrongful discharge claim against the Individual Defendants is \ndismissed with prejudice.  Case 2:23-cv-02239-JXN-JRA     Document 67     Filed 09/13/24     Page 12 of 33 PageID:\n<pageID>13 \n  As for ElectrifAi and White Oak, Plaintiff does not allege any public policy – let alone one \nthat is clearly mandated – which  was purportedly violated.  As such, Plaintiff’s Pierce claim fails \nand Count Three will therefore be dismissed without prejudice as to ElectrifAi and White Oak .  \nD. Plaintiff Fails to Plead a CEPA Violation (Count Four) \nElectrifAi and the Individual Defendants next argue the CEPA claim should be dismissed \nbecause Plaintiff fails to allege facts showing that she reasonably believed ElectrifAi violated any \nlaw, rule, regulation, or public policy, that she engaged in whistle -blowing activity, or that the \nIndividual Defendants retaliated against her.  (ElectrifAi Br. at 24- 26; Scott Br. at 1, 3- 4).  In \nopposition, Plaintiff argues she has alleged “an obvious CEPA claim here.”  (Opp’n to ElectrifAi at 9-10; Opp’n to Scott at 9- 10).  As Plaintiff has failed to identify – and the Court cannot discern \n– any law, rule, regulation, or public policy that Defendants allegedly violated, the Court will \ndismiss Plaintiff’s CEPA claim with respect to all Defendants.  \nCEPA “creates a cause of action for an employee who is subjected to retaliation for \nreporting workplace misconduct.”  Battaglia v. United Parcel Serv., Inc., 70 A.3d 602, 624 (N.J. \n2013) (citing Dzwonar v. McDevitt , 828 A.2d 893, 900 (N.J. 2003)).  The Supreme Court of New \nJersey has emphasized that “CEPA is a remedial statute that ‘promotes a strong public policy of the State’ and ‘therefore should be construed liberally to effectuate its important social goal.’”  Id. \n(quoting Abbamont v. Piscataway Twp. Bd. of Educ., 650 A.2d 958, 971 (N.J. 1994)).  As relevant here, CEPA prohibits employers from taking “any retaliatory action against an \nemployee because the employee does any of the following:” \na. Discloses, or threatens to disclose to a supervisor or to a public body an activity, \npolicy or practice of the employer, or another employer, with whom there is a business relationship, that the employee reasonably believes: \n Case 2:23-cv-02239-JXN-JRA     Document 67     Filed 09/13/24     Page 13 of 33 PageID:\n<pageID>14 \n (1) is in violation of a law, or a rule or regulation promulgated pursuant to \nlaw, including any violation involving deception of, or misrepresentation to, any . . . employee . . . of the employer . . .; or  \n \n(2) is fraudulent or criminal, including any activity, policy or practice of deception or misrepresentation which the employee reasonably believes may defraud any . . . employee . . . of the employer  . . .  \n c. Objects to, or refuses to participate in any activity, policy or practice which the employee reasonably believes:  \n \n(1) is in violation of a law, or a rule or regulation promulgated pursuant to law, including any violation involving deception of, or misrepresentation to, any . . . employee . . . of the employer . . .; or  \n \n(2) is fraudulent or criminal, including any activity, policy or practice of \ndeception or misrepresentation which the employee reasonably believes may defraud any . . . employee . . . of the employer . . .; or  \n (3) is incompatible with a clear mandate of public policy concerning the public health, safety or welfare or protection of the environment. \n N.J. Stat. Ann. § 34:19- 3(a), (c).  \nTo state a claim for a violation of CEPA, the plaintiff has the burden to establish that:  \n“(1) he or she reasonably believed that his or her employer’s conduct violat[ed] either a law, rule, or regulation promulgated pursuant to law, or a clear mandate of public policy; (2) he or she performed a ‘whistle -blowing’ activity described in \nN.J.S.A. 34:19- 3(c); (3) an adverse employment action was taken against him or \nher; and (4) a causal connection exists between the whistle- blowing activity and the \nadverse emp loyment action.”  \nChiofalo v. State , 213 A.3d 900, 908 (N.J. 2019) (quoting Dzwonar , 828 A.2d at 900); Lindenberg \nv. Arrayit Corp., No. 14- 833, 2016 WL 659724, at *3 (D.N.J. Feb. 18, 2016) (citing Blackburn v. \nUnited Parcel Serv., Inc., 179 F.3d 81, 92 (3d Cir. 1999)) (applying the same test to N.J.S.A. 34:19-\n3(a)).   The first prong of a CEPA claim contains an “identification requirement.”  Chiofalo, 213 \nA.3d at 909.  With respect to claims brought pursuant to N.J. Stat. Ann. § 34:19- 3(a)(1) and (c)(1), \n“either ‘the court or the plaintiff’ must identify the statute, regulation, rule, or public policy that Case 2:23-cv-02239-JXN-JRA     Document 67     Filed 09/13/24     Page 14 of 33 PageID:\n<pageID>15 \n closely relates to the complained -of conduct.”  Id. (quoting Dzwonar , 828 A.2d at 901).  A plaintiff \n“need not show that his or her employer or another employee actually violated the law or a clear \nmandate of public policy,” as “[t]he goal of CEPA . . . is ‘not to make lawyers out of conscientious employees.’”  Dzwonar , 828 A.2d at 901 (quoting Mehlman v. Mobil Oil Corp., 707 A.2d 1000, \n1015- 16 (N.J. 1998)).  Nevertheless, a plaintiff must “set forth facts that would support an \nobjectively reasonable belief  that a violation has occurred.”  Id.  at 901.  “[T]he trial court must \n[then] make a threshold determination that there is a substantial nexus between the complained- of \nconduct and [the] law or public policy [that the plaintiff or the court] identified.”  Id.  “‘[W]hen no \nsuch law or policy is forthcoming,’ judgment can and should be entered for the defendant.”  Chiofalo, 213 A.3d at 909 (quoting Dzwonar , 828 A.2d at 901).   \n A similar requirement applies to claims brought under N.J. Stat. Ann. § 34:19- 3(a)(2) and \n(c)(2), which focus on “fraudulent or criminal” activities.  In Chiofalo, the court recognized that no previous decision had “mention[ed] any . . . obligation to identify some legal source rendering \nactivity fraudulent.”  Id. at 910.  “‘[C]riminal’ or ‘fraudulent’ activity,” the court explained, “is \noften apparent and commonly recognizable,” which “distinguishes claims [under Sections (a)(2) and (c)(2)] from CEPA’s re ferences in sections (c)(1) and (3) to violations of a more general ‘law, \nor a rule or regulation promulgated pursuant to law’ or of ‘a clear mandate of public policy.’”  Id.   \nNevertheless, the court concluded that “the better practice in CEPA actions brought under (c)(2)[ ] or . . . (a)(2)[ ] surely is to identify the statutory or other basis for claiming objected- to behavior \nis criminal or fraudulent.”  Id.  Although the court does “not expect whistleblower employees to \nbe lawyers on the spot[,] once engaged in the legal process, and with the assistance of counsel or careful examination by the court, . . . the legal underpinnings for claimed behavior that is perceived as criminal or fraudulent should be able to be teased out sufficiently f or identification purposes.”  Case 2:23-cv-02239-JXN-JRA     Document 67     Filed 09/13/24     Page 15 of 33 PageID:\n<pageID>16 \n Id. at 910.  In that regard, the court cautioned “that trial courts ‘must be alert to the sufficiency of \nthe factual evidence’”— allegations in this stage —“‘and to whether the acts complained of could \nsupport the finding that the complaining employee’s belief w as a reasonable one.’”  Id. at 910 \n(quoting Battaglia , 70 A.3d at 626).  Even where the relevant conduct appears to be criminal or \nfraudulent on its face, “if a defendant questions the source of law relied on by the plaintiff, that \nsource should be provided by the plaintiff.”  Id.  at 910- 11. \n Here, because Plaintiff appears to raise claims under Sections (a)(1) and (c)(1) , and (a)(2) \nand (c)(2), the Court will address each pair of provisions separately.  With respect to each set of provisions, Plaintiff has failed to satisfy the first element of a CEPA claim – namely, her reasonable \nbelief that Defendants’ actions violated a law or public policy, or that they were criminal or fraudulent.  \n Plaintiff’s claim pursuant to N.J. Stat. Ann. § 34:19- 3(a)(1) and (c)(1) fails because she has \nnot “identif[ied] [any] statute, regulation, [or] rule . . . that closely relates to the complained- of \nconduct.”  Chiofalo, 213 A.3d at 908.  Even after Defendants raised this objection in their moving papers, Plaintiff still did not identify in her opposition any “law, or a rule or regulation promulgated pursuant to law,” that she believed Defendants’ conduct to have violate d.  N.J. Stat. Ann. § 34:19-\n3(a)(1), (c)(1).  Plaintiff vaguely alleges that she attempted to report conduct “she reasonably believed constituted improper harassment, threatening behavior, or other discriminatory conduct in violation of relevant laws, rule[s], regulations, and public policies related thereto.”  (Am. Compl. ¶¶ 165, 167).  Yet, Plaintiff has not identified any statute or rule “‘that closely relates to’” such conduct.  Chiofalo, 213 A.3d at 909 (quoting Dzwonar , 828 A.2d at 901).  Further, other than a \ntangential connection to com mon law fraud, which is discussed below, the Court is unable to \nidentify any “law, or a rule or regulation promulgated pursuant to law,” which Plaintiff reasonably Case 2:23-cv-02239-JXN-JRA     Document 67     Filed 09/13/24     Page 16 of 33 PageID:\n<pageID>17 \n could have believed Defendants violated in these circumstances. Chiofalo, 213 A.3d at 909 \n(quoting Dzwonar , 828 A.2d at 901).  Accordingly, Plaintiff’s claim under Sections (a)(1) and \n(c)(1) is dismissed without prejudice.   \n Plaintiff’s claim pursuant to Sections (a)(2) and (c)(2), which rests on allegedly fraudulent \nconduct,8 similarly fails to satisfy CEPA’s identification requirement.  Although Chiofalo  \nrecognized that no prior case had imposed an identification requirement under Sections (a)(2) and (c)(2), the court concluded that, “once engaged in the legal process, and with the assistance of counsel or careful examination by the court, . . . the legal  underpinnings for claimed behavior that \nis perceived as . . . fraudulent should be able to be teased out sufficiently for identification purposes.”  Id. at 910.  Here, Plaintiff has engaged counsel, filed a Complaint and Amended \nComplaint, and responded to Defendants’ Motions to Dismiss.  Yet, despite Defendants’ argument in their moving papers that Plaintiff had failed to identify any specific law or poli cy that she \nbelieved Defendants had violated, Plaintiff does not refer to any statutory or common law,  or rule \nor policy, in her opposition papers.  See id. at 910 -11 (noting that “if a defendant questions the \nsource of law relied on by the plaintiff, that source should be provided by the plaintiff”).  \n Further, although the Court can identify common law fraud as conceivably relevant to \nPlaintiff’s claim, ( see Am. Compl. ¶¶ 33- 88), Plaintiff has not plausibly alleged a reasonable belief \nthat Defendants committed fraud.  Plaintiff need not establish that Defendants “actually violated the law,” and ultimately a jury “must determine whether the plaintiff actually h eld such a belief \nand . . . whether [it was] . . . reasonable.”  Dzwonar , 828 A.2d at 902.  However, Plaintiff “must \nset forth facts that would support an objectively reasonable belief that a violation has occurred,” such “that there is a substantial nexus between the complained -of conduct” and the law at issue.”  \n \n8 Neither the Amended Complaint nor  Plaintiff’s opposition papers refer explicitly –  or allude –  to conduct that could \nqualify as “criminal” under Sections (a)(2) and (c)(2).  Case 2:23-cv-02239-JXN-JRA     Document 67     Filed 09/13/24     Page 17 of 33 PageID:\n<pageID>29 \n Individual Defendants made “false statements regarding Plaintiff’s employment at their company, \nthe terms of her termination, or Plaintiff’s qualifications for future employment” to prospective new employers and “various federal or state agencies.”  (Am. C ompl. ¶¶ 225, 122- 23, 125; see \nalso Am. Compl. ¶¶ 122- 23, 125).  Even accepting all of Plaintiff’s allegations as true, Plaintiff’s \ngeneral allegations of “false statements” made to third parties is insufficient to support a claim of \ndefamation without additional facts.  See Russomanno v. Sunovion Pharms., Inc., No. 22-5032, 2023 WL 2649453, at *3 (D.N.J. Mar. 27, 2023) (dismissing defamation claim alleging the defendant “spoke about [the] [p]laintiff to potential employers in a ‘disparaging way’” as insufficient without additional facts); Veteran Relocation Project, LLC v. Borough of Bradley Beach , No. 22- 1817, 2022 WL 16822116, at *5 (D.N.J. Nov. 8, 2022) (dismissing defamation \ncomplaint alleging defendants “hurled abuse” at plaintiffs during a meeting for  failure to plead \nsufficient facts); Foy v. Wakefern Food Corp., No. 09- 1683, 2010 WL 147925, at *6 (D.N.J. Jan. \n7, 2010) (dismissing defamation claim for providing no information “beyond mere conclusory statements” and failing to plead facts sufficient to “identify the defamatory words, their utterer[,] and the fact of their publication”).  The Amended Complaint fails to allege with enough specificity: (1) that any of the Defendants made false and defamatory statements concerning her; and (2) fault that am ounts to negligence.  Since Plaintiff’s allegations are not sufficient to demonstrate a \nplausible claim for relief, the Court dismisses Count Nine without prejudice.    \nI. Plaintiff Fails to Plead a Breach of the Implied Covenant of Good Faith \nand Fair Dealing Claim (Count Ten)  \n \nElectrifAi and the Individual Defendants further argue that the Court should dismiss the \nimplied covenant of good faith and fair dealing claim because there is no contract between Plaintiff and Defendants .  Further, even if the Court were to find the Amended Complaint alleges a contract, \nthere are insufficient facts to suggest they acted in bad faith with a bad motive.  (ElectrifAi Br. at Case 2:23-cv-02239-JXN-JRA     Document 67     Filed 09/13/24     Page 29 of 33 PageID:\n<pageID>30 \n 37-38; Scott Br. at 4).  Plaintiff argues the Amended Complaint adequately alleges an implied \ncovenant of good faith and fair dealing claim based on her offer letter and “numerous allegations \nreflecting Defendant’s bad faith acts.”  (Opp’n to ElectrifAi at  11-12).  As Plaintiff has failed to \nadequately allege the existence of a contractual relationship between Defendants and herself, the Court will dismiss the breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing claim.  \nIn New Jersey, contracting parties are “bound by a duty of good faith and fair dealing in \nboth the performance and enforcement of the contract.”  Brunswick Hills Racquet Club, Inc. v. Route 18 Shopping Ctr. Assocs., 864 A.2d 387, 395 (N.J. 2005).  While the concept of good faith is difficult to define in precise terms, “[g]ood faith performance or enforcement of a contract emphasizes faithfulness to an agreed common purpose and consistency with the justified expectations of the other party[.]”  Wilson v. Am erada Hess Corp., 773 A.2d 1121, 1126 (N.J. 2001) \n(internal quotation marks omitted).  To allege such a claim, a plaintiff must assert: (1) a contract exists between the parties; (2) the plaintiff performed under the terms of the contract; (3) the \ndefendant acted in bad f aith with the purpose of depriving the plaintiff of rights or benefits under \nthe contract; and (4) the defendant’s actions caused the plaintiff to sustain damages.  TBI Unlimited, LLC v. Clear Cut Lawn Decisions, LLC , No. 12- 3355, 2014 WL 3853900, at *3 (D.N.J. \nAug. 5, 2014) (citing Wade v. Kessler. Inst., 778 A.2d 580, 586 (N.J. Super. Ct. App. Div. 2001), aff’d as modified, 798 A.2d 1251 (N.J. 2002)).  \nAs such, a claim based on a “[b]reach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing \nis not a free -standing cause of action; such a covenant is an implied covenant of a contract .”  \nLuongo v. Vill. Supermarket, Inc., 261 F. Supp. 3d 520, 532 (D.N.J. 2017) (emphasis in original); Wade v. Kessler Inst., 798 A.2d 1251, 1262 (N.J. 2002) (“To the extent plaintiff contends that a breach of the implied covenant may arise absent an express or implied contract, that contention Case 2:23-cv-02239-JXN-JRA     Document 67     Filed 09/13/24     Page 30 of 33 PageID:\n<pageID>31 \n finds no support in our case law.  In that respect, we agree with the court below that an implied \ncontract must be found before the jury could find that the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing had been breached.”); Noye v. Hoffmann- La Roche Inc., 570 A.2d 12, 14 (N.J. Super. Ct. \nApp. Div. 1990) (“In the absence of a contract, there can be no breach of an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.”); see also Varrallo v. Hammond Inc., 94 F.3d 842, 848 (3d Cir. 1996). \nHere, Plaintiff alleges she “was contracted to work at ElectrifAi as an executive sales \nrepresentative and was to be eligible for a commission in addition to her salary if certain performance standards were met.”  (Am. Compl. ¶ 234).  However, this does not constitute an \nallegation of the existence of an express or implied contract.  Additionally, Plaintiff’s reliance on the offer letter is similarly unavailing.  ( See Opp’n to ElectrifAi at 11 -12).  The offer letter \nexpressly states it “does not create or i mply any contract of employment, and [Plaintiff’s] \nemployment with the Company will at all times be on an ‘at -will’ basis.”  (ECF No. 27- 1 at ¶ 8).   \nIndeed, a breach of the implied covenant cannot occur in the absence of a contractual \nagreement.  See Schlichtig v. Inacom Corp., 271 F. Supp. 2d 597, 606- 07 (D.N.J. 2003) (“[B]ecause \nthe Court has concluded that the terms of this employee manual could not have given rise to an implied contract of employment, it necessarily follows that the manual’s provisions do not contain an imp lied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.”); Barone v. Leukemia Soc’y of Am., 42 F. Supp. \n2d 452, 457 (D.N.J. 1998) (“In the  absence of a contract, there is no implied covenant of good \nfaith and fair dealing which might be used as a basis for finding a right to continued employment.”); McDermott v. Chilton Co., 938 F. Supp. 240, 246 (D.N.J. 1995) (“Under New \nJersey law, an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing may not be invoked to restrict the authority of employers to fire at -will employees.”); D’Alessandro v. Varible Annuity Life Ins. Co. \n(VALIC), No. 89- 2052, 1990 WL 191914, at *5 (D.N.J. Nov. 20, 1990) (“New Jerse y courts have Case 2:23-cv-02239-JXN-JRA     Document 67     Filed 09/13/24     Page 31 of 33 PageID:\n<pageID>32 \n uniformly rejected the proposition that there is an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing \nbetween an employer and employee in an at -will situation.”) (cleaned up).  As Plaintiff fails to \nallege the existence of a contract between Defendants and h erself, her implied covenant of good \nfaith and fair dealing claim fails.  Accordingly, the Court dismisses Count Ten without prejudice.   \nJ. Plaintiff Fails to Plead Any Plausible Claims Against White Oak  \nFinally, White Oak also seeks dismissal of the claims asserted against it because there are \nno factual allegations that it participated in the complained -of conduct.  ( See generally White Oak \nBr.).  Plaintiff disputes this contention and argues she has set forth sufficient factual allegations to \nestablish White Oak could be liable as Plaintiff’s employer or the employer of the Individual Defendants.  (Opp’n to White Oak at 9).  As Plaintiff fails to set forth sufficient allegations regarding White O ak’s par ticipation in the alleged misconduct, the Court dismisses the claims \nagainst White Oak.   \nAs White Oak points out, the sole allegation in the Amended Complaint concerning it is: \n   Upon information and belief, Defendants White Oak Financial, LLC and White Oak Global Advisors, LLC (both entities referred to herein as “White Oak”) are limited liability companies formed under the laws of Delaware who owned ElectrifAi, appointed several members to ElectrifAi’s Board, and otherwise exerted control and/or oversight over ElectrifAi’s operations throughout the duration of Plaintiff’s Employment.   \n \n(Am. Compl. ¶ 11). \n Although the Court has already dismissed each Count of Plaintiff’s Amended Complaint \nbased on various pleading deficiencies, the Court agrees, as a general matter, that the Amended Complaint is devoid of any factual allegations suggesting that White Oak wa s itself responsible \nfor the purportedly unlawful conduct allegedly engaged by its subsidiary, ElectrifAi.  See generally Pearson v. Component Technology Corp., 247 F.3d 471, 484 (3d Cir. 2001) (“[M]ere ownership of a subsidiary does not justify the imposition of liability on the parent.”); Marzano v. Computer Case 2:23-cv-02239-JXN-JRA     Document 67     Filed 09/13/24     Page 32 of 33 PageID:\n<pageID>33 \n Science Corp. Inc., 91 F.3d 497, 513 (3d Cir. 1996); see also United States v. Bestfoods , 524 U.S. \n51, 61 (1998) (“It is a general principle of corporate law deeply ‘ingrained in our economic and \nlegal systems’ that a parent corporation . . . is not liable for the acts of its subsidiaries.”).  Thus, to the extent Plaintiff chooses to amend any claims and to reassert any such claims against White Oak, the complaint must be amended to include facts that would allow the Court to draw the reasonable inference that White Oak is liable for the misconduct alleged.  Iqbal , 556 U.S. at 678.  \nIV. CONCLUSION \nFor the reasons set forth above, Defendants’ Motions to Dismiss (ECF Nos. 32- 34) are \nGRANTED, and the Amended Complaint (ECF No. 27) is DISMISSED without prejudice , \nexcept for Counts One, Three , and Five, which are DISMISSED with prejudice as to the \nIndividual Defendants only . \nAn appropriate Order accompanies this Opinion.   \n \n             \nDATED:  9/13/2024     JULIEN XA VIER NEALS  \n United States District Judge  \n Case 2:23-cv-02239-JXN-JRA     Document 67     Filed 09/13/24     Page 33 of 33 PageID:\n<pageID>",

    "summary": "1. **Summary:** This case involves Michael Muir, who is challenging the use of Advanced Imaging Technology (AIT) scanners by the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) due to their impact on individuals with disabilities like his own, a congenital birth defect that presents as a hernia. Muir claims that the Automatic Target Recognition (ATR) software in these scanners wrongly identifies his condition as a threat, resulting in painful and invasive pat-downs. The court partially grants Muir’s petition, remanding it to the TSA to further consider accommodations under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 but denies all other aspects of his petition.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue:** Whether the TSA's use of AIT scanners violates the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 by failing to provide reasonable accommodations for passengers with disabilities.\n\n3. **Court's Holding:** The court grants Muir's petition in part, requiring the TSA to evaluate whether implementing Muir's requested accommodation would impose an undue burden on the agency under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, while denying the petition in all other respects.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation:** Michael Muir has a medical condition that makes airport security scanners, which find hidden objects, think he is hiding something dangerous. This means he has to undergo painful extra checks. He took TSA to court to ask for different screening procedures for people like him with medical conditions. The court agreed that the TSA should rethink whether it can give Muir and others like him a more comfortable security check without too much trouble for the agency.",

Muir contends that  his hernia causes him to \nexperience various problems ranging from severe pain to \npotentially life-threatening partial strangulation of his \nintestines.  Muir filed a peti tion challenging the Transportation \nSecurity Administration’s (TSA) Final Rule, which authorized its use of scanners  that use electroma gnetic radiation—known \nas Advanced Imaging Technology (AIT) scanners—to screen airline passengers at airport s ecurity screening checkpoints.  \nSee Passenger Screening Using Advanced Imaging \nTechnology, 81 Fed. Reg. 11,364, 11,365 (Mar. 3, 2016).   \n TSA posits that “AIT is th e most effective technology \ncurrently available to detect both metallic and non-metallic \nthreat items concealed on passengers.”  Id.  However, for Muir, \nAIT scanners equipped with Automatic Target Recognition \n(ATR) software inevitably flag his hernia as a threat object, which requires TSA agents to perform pain-inducing and potentially life-threatening pa t-downs of his groin area.  \nAccordingly, Muir implores us to  hold that the Final Rule and \nTSA’s standard operating proced ures (SOPs) are arbitrary and \ncapricious, contrary to TSA’s st atutory authority, and violate \nprotections afforded under Sec tion 504 of the Rehabilitation \nAct of 1973, 29 U.S.C. § 794.

S oon afterward, Congress \nestablished TSA, see Aviation and Trans portation Security \nAct, Pub. L. No. 107–71, 115 Stat. 597 (Nov. 19, 2001), and made it responsible “for the sc reening of all passengers and \nproperty” boarding passenger airplanes, 49 U.S.C. § 44901(a), and developing regulations prohibiting airlines from \ntransporting passengers who refuse to consent to the screening, \nid. § 44902(a)(1).  As a result, Congress charged TSA with \nensuring that passengers did not  board a commercial airline \nflight carrying dangerous weapons , explosives, or destructive \nsubstances.  Id. §§ 44901(a), 44902(a)(1).   \nThree years later, Congress enacted the Intelligence \nReform and Terrorism Preven tion Act of 2004, Pub. L. No. \n108–458, 118 Stat. 3638 (Dec. 17, 2004) , and directed TSA to \ndevelop “a strategic plan to  promote . . . deployment of \nexplosive detection equipment at airports to screen individuals \nand their personal property . . . includ[ing] walk-through \nexplosive detection portals, doc ument scanners, shoe scanners, \nand backscatter x-ray scanners .”  49 U.S.C. § 44925(b)(1).  \nAnd after a spate of attemp ted terror attacks involving \n \n1 Our colleague dissents only insofar as he would hold that we lack \njurisdiction to consider Muir’s request for an accommodation pursuant to the Rehabilitation Act.   USCA Case #22-1318      Document #2127237            Filed: 07/25/2025      Page 3 of 264 \n nonmetallic explosives, Congr ess further directed the \nDepartment of Homeland Securi ty (DHS), the Cabinet-level \ndepartment overseeing TSA, to  “give a high priority to \ndeveloping, testing, improvi ng, and deploying” a new \ntechnology at airport screeni ng checkpoints “that detects \nnonmetallic, chemical, biological , and radiological weapons, \nand explosives.”  Id. § 44925(a).  TSA responded to these \ndirectives by prescribing the deta ils of the screen ing process in \na set of SOPs2 and by barring any pe rson from entering the \n“sterile area”3 of an airport “or board[ing] an aircraft without \nsubmitting to the screening and in spection of his or her person \n. . . in accordance with the procedures being applied to control access to that area or aircraft .”  49 C.F.R. § 1540.107(a).   \nIn 2007, TSA initially deployed AIT scanners as \nsecondary screening measures, but by 2010 AIT scanners were the primary method of screening.  “AIT creates an image of the \nfull body that highlights objects that are on the body.”  J.A. 196.  TSA deploys AIT scanners that use “non-ionizing radio \nfrequency energy in the millimeter wave spectrum to generate an image based on the energy reflected from the body,” J.A. \n197, and “detect metallic and no n-metallic objects on an \nindividual’s body or concealed in  his clothing without physical \ncontact,” 81 Fed. Reg. at 11,365.  An example of the image generated by millimeter wave AIT appears below: \n \n2 “TSA’s SOPs are internal documents that contain instructions for \n[Transportation Security Officers (TSOs)] on how to operate \nequipment and conduct screening.  TSOs receive extensive training to perform screening as described in  the SOPs.  These documents are \n[Sensitive Security Information] and cannot be shared with the \npublic.”  81 Fed.

Priv. Info. Ctr. v. DHS , 653 F.3d 1, 8 (D.C. \nCir. 2011).  As TSA explained in the preamble to its resultant \nproposed Rule, by that time Congress had responded to privacy concerns about AIT scanner-generated passenger images in the FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012, Public Law 112-\n95, which imposed a further requirement on TSA   \nto ensure that all AIT used to screen passengers must \nbe equipped with and em ploy automatic target \nrecognition (ATR) software.  49 U.S.C. § 44901(l).  That software eliminates passenger-specific ( i.e., \nindividual) images and instead indicates the  location of potential threats on a ge neric outline.  Since May \n2013, all AIT units deployed by TSA have been equipped with ATR capability.   \n81 Fed. Reg. at 11,365.  The following is an image from an AIT \nscanner using ATR:   \n \nJ.A. 199. \nAs required by this Court, TSA issued a Notice of Public \n USCA Case #22-1318      Document #2127237            Filed: 07/25/2025      Page 6 of 267 \n Proposed Rulemaking regarding AIT on March 26, 2013.  \nPassenger Screening Using Advanced Imaging Technology, 78 Fed.

Muir claims that he is “symptomat ic every day for at \nleast some part of the day.”  J.A. 110 ¶ 3.  Moreover, there is no way for him to tell when this partial intestinal incarceration is life-threatening.  \nOn August 9, 2018, Muir allege s that he attempted to \nboard a flight departing from Phoenix-Mesa Gateway Airport \nwhile symptomatic.  The AIT scanner identified a potential threat object located at Muir’s right groin.  As a result, a TSA \nagent allegedly performed a physic al pat-down of Muir’s right \ngroin area despite his protestati ons causing him extreme mental \nand physical pain and suffering.  Three days later, on August 12, 2018, Muir allegedly experi enced the same hardship \nboarding a flight leaving Gene ral Wayne A. Downing Peoria \nInternational Airport.         \nAfter his experiences in August 2018, Muir sent TSA a \nproposal on November 1, 2019, requesting an informal discussion pursuant to 28 C.F. R. § 14.6 about his security \n \n4 We use “AIT scanners” or “AIT scanning” hereafter as a shorthand \nfor AIT scanners equipped with ATR software.

Muir then filed a complain t with DHS’s \nOffice for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties (CRCL) on \nDecember 15, 2019, alleging disc rimination based on his \ndisability.  On January 7, 2020, CRCL closed Muir’s complaint \nand took no action.    \n On December 1, 2022, while standing in the security \nscreening line at St. Pete-Clearwater International Airport, Muir contends that he realized that his hernia was not reducible—meaning he could not return the displaced tissue to its normal position—before passi ng through the AIT scanner.  \nAlyssa Pastorino & Amal A. Alshuqayfi, Strangulated Hernia , \nNat’l Libr. of Med., https://perma.cc/3HLU-28RN  (last \nupdated Dec. 19, 2022).  Faced with having to endure another \npainful pat-down, Muir did not board his flight.  \nApproximately two weeks later, he filed pro se a petition for \nreview on December 14, 2022, asking us to set aside the Final Rule as unlawful.\n5  Thereafter, we appointed amicus curiae to \npresent arguments on behalf of Muir.6   \n \nII.  \n \nWe have jurisdiction over Muir’s petition.  49 U.S.C.          \n§ 46110.

United States , 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)). \n \nIII.  \n \nMuir, aided by appointed amicus, challenges the Final \nRule and TSA’s SOPs on several gr ounds.  First, Muir contends \nthat TSA’s use of AIT scanne rs with ATR technology does not \ncomport with statutory requireme nts and is therefore contrary \nto law.  Second, amicus asserts that TSA’s failure to respond to \ncomments raising concerns with the use of AIT scanners on travelers with disabilities rende rs the Final Rule arbitrary and \ncapricious.  Third, amicus also claims that TSA’s failure to provide alternative screening pr ocedures for passengers with \ninternal disabilities is arbitrar y and capricious.  Finally, Muir \nand amicus argue that the Final Rule and TSA’s SOPs, as applied to Muir, violate Secti on 504 of the Rehabilitation Act \nof 1973.   \n Before analyzing any of thos e issues, we address Muir’s \npending motion to supplement the administrative record with \nadditional documentation from a prior action in the United States District Court for the Di strict of Arizona.  We deny this \nmotion as the supplemental info rmation is unnecessary to our \ndecision.  As to his other clai ms, we conclude that Muir’s \nRehabilitation Act claim succeeds,  but all other challenges are \neither forfeited or meritless. USCA Case #22-1318      Document #2127237            Filed: 07/25/2025      Page 9 of 2610 \n    \nA. \n    \nBefore we consider the merits  of his petition, Muir must \novercome an administrative exhaus tion requirement.  Under     \n§ 46110(d), we have jurisdiction to “consider an objection to \nan order of the [TSA] . . . only if the objection was made in the proceeding conducted by [TSA].”  49 U.S.C.  § 46110(d).  This provision requires a pe titioner to raise a rulemaking challenge \nor point to where another party raised “the same objection[],” \nduring the notice-and-comment process.  Vaughn v. FAA , 756 \nF. App’x 8, 12 (D.C. Cir. 2018) (citing § 46110(d)).  Thus, we \nin turn may only review those arguments the administrative agency had the opportunity to cons ider in the first instance.  \nAdvocs. for Highway & Auto Safety v. Fed. Motor Carrier Safety Admin. , 429 F.3d 1136, 1150 (D.C. Cir. 2005) (“[A] \nparty will normally forfeit an opportunity to challenge an \nagency rulemaking on a ground that  was not first presented to \nthe agency for its initial consideration.”); Omnipoint Corp. v. \nFCC , 78 F.3d 620, 635 (D.C. Cir. 1996)  (“As a general rule, \nclaims not presented to the agency may not be made for the first time to a revi ewing court.”).   \n \n1. \n First, Muir contends that TS A did not have the statutory \nauthority to promulgate the Fina l Rule.  He complains that the \nFinal Rule eliminated “the millimeter wave scanner[’s] . . . ‘visual image’” requirement in contradi ction of 49 U.S.C.          \n§ 44901(l).  Pet’r Br. 13.  He next protests that it improvidently \nreplaced “human image operator agents with a narrow artificial intelligence algorithm as the final decision-maker regarding potential anomalies present in passenger screening data.”  Id.  \nAs to the former, Muir assert s that “Congress require[d] that \nthe millimeter wave scanner de vice [used in the screening of USCA Case #22-1318      Document #2127237            Filed: 07/25/2025      Page 10 of 2611 \n passengers] create a visual ima ge and the TSA removed the \ncapability of the device to create a visual image.”  Id. at 23.  As \nto the latter, Muir argues that “there is nothing in § 44901(l) to \nsuggest that the TSA need[ed] to replace the human image operator TSO with a narrow artifi cial intelligence algorithm to \nanalyze scanned data.”  Id.   \n TSA asserts that Muir forfeited those statutory challenges \nto the Final Rule by failing to either raise them during the public rulemaking proceedings or  provide a reasonable ground \nfor not making the objections.  Muir responds that because other parties articulated the very same objections he raises in their public comments to TSA, our  exercise of jurisdiction is \nproper under 49 U.S.C. § 46110(d).  Amicus further suggests \nthat it was reasonable for a person with Muir’s  disability to not \nmonitor the Federal Register  for notices of proposed \nrulemakings with the potential to affect him.   \n Here, TSA did not have an opportunity to consider Muir’s \nstatutory arguments during rulema king.  It is undisputed that \nMuir failed to personally raise the challenges, but his specific claims were also not preserved by other public comments during the notice and comment period.  While some public \ncomments addressed technologi cal issues, no commenter \nraised the very objections that Muir has presented to us.  Therefore, Muir forfeited his st atutory challenges to the Final \nRule.  \n2. \n \nNext, court-appointed amicus asserts that TSA failed to \naddress publicly raised concerns  “that (1) medically disabled \nindividuals are at a higher risk of triggering false positives by \nthe AIT scanner, and (2) the subs equent pat-down is simply not \nsafe for many of those travelers, because they can experience USCA Case #22-1318      Document #2127237            Filed: 07/25/2025      Page 11 of 2612 \n severe pain or potentially fatal health complications.”  Amicus \nReply Br. 4.  Amicus furthe r contends that while TSA \naddressed medical issues generally, the agency failed to either respond to comments or consid er procedures for airline \npassengers whose medical conditions cause consistent AIT alerts resulting in pat-downs.  In this regard, amicus contends, \nTSA’s failure to address the comments concerning disabled \npassengers supports the conclusi on that the Final Rule was \narbitrary and capricious.     \n Here, again, there is no di spute regarding whether Muir \nraised this two-part disabl ed passenger objection during \nrulemaking, because he did not.  However, while some commenters did reference the profiling of the medically \ndisabled, see, e.g. , J.A. 153, J.A. 160, J. A. 176, and others \ncomplained about the risks associated with pat-downs, see J.A. \n147, J.A. 149, J.A. 151, none addres sed the distinct burdens on \ndisabled persons who are simult aneously affected by both.  \nThus, TSA had no obligation to respond to Muir’s specific \ncircumstance when no comment raised anything materially \nanalogous to bring the issue to its attention.  Cf. Unemployment \nComp. Comm’n of Alaska v. Aragon , 329 U.S. 143, 155 (1946) \n(“A reviewing court usurps the ag ency’s function when it sets \naside the administrative de termination upon a ground not \ntheretofore presented and deprives the Commission of an opportunity to consider the matter, make its ruling, and state the reasons for its action.”).  We therefore hold that court-\nappointed amicus’ first challenge to the Final Rule  is forfeited \nbecause no party raised the ob jection during the notice-and-\ncomment period.               \nB. \n \nCourt-appointed amicus  also challenges the Final Rule \nbecause it does not provide altern ative screening procedures for USCA Case #22-1318      Document #2127237            Filed: 07/25/2025      Page 12 of 2613 \n travelers with internal physical disabilities, even though TSA \nroutinely uses such alternat ives for other categories of \npassengers—like PreCheck®7 passengers, passengers carrying \nan infant, child, or a small pet, passengers accompanied by service animals, and at airports th at lack AIT scanners.  Amicus \nargues that because TSA uses th e combination of walk-through \nmetal detectors (WTMDs) and e xplosive trace detection swab \ntests as alternatives for these travelers, it is arbitrary and \ncapricious to deny requests for alternative screening \nprocedures for passengers with internal physical disabilities.          \n TSA responds to amicus’ arguments by pointing out that \nalternative screening measures  are used for TSA PreCheck® \npassengers, children, and the elderly because TSA pre-determined them to be low-risk travelers.  Moreover, alternative screening measures are available to passengers for \nwhom AIT screeners cannot successfully produce an image, because they cannot raise their arms as required, must remain \nconnected to medical equipment,  or must remain accompanied \nby service animals and pets.  TS A further explained that the \ndifference between Muir and thes e passengers lies in the fact \nthat the latter have external ch aracteristics that are immediately \napparent to TSOs and do not crea te verification or proof issues \nthat would be impracticable to administer at security checkpoints nationwide.     \n In its explanation, TSA ra tionally connected the facts \nbefore it to its decision to offer alternative screening procedures for two categories of  passengers—(1) those deemed \na lower security risk base d on background checks or other \n \n7 “TSA PreCheck® is an exped ited screening program that makes \nrisk assessments about passengers prio r to their arrival at an airport \ncheckpoint.”  TSA PreCheck® , TSA, https://www.tsa.gov/news/pres \ns/factsheets/tsa-precheck   (last visited June 16, 2025) USCA Case #22-1318      Document #2127237            Filed: 07/25/2025      Page 13 of 2614 \n available intelligence; and (2) those whose images AIT \nscanners cannot succ essfully capture—wh ile declining to \nprovide a similar process fo r passengers with internal \ndisabilities like Muir’s.  Unlik e the first group, passengers with \ninternal disabilities, like Muir, have not been determined, as a \nclass, to present a lower security risk.  See J.A. 40.  And unlike \nthe second group, passenge rs with internal disabilities going \nthrough AIT scanners, do not impede the scanners’ ability to function to produce images  of those passengers.  See J.A. 60.  \nUnder 49 U.S.C. § 46110’s deferential standard of review, that is enough to establish that TSA’s decision to exclude \nalternative screening methods in  the Final Rule for travelers \nwith internal physical disabi lities is not arbitrary and \ncapricious.  Accordingly, we deny court-appointed amicus’ \nsecond challenge to the Final Rule.  As TSA noted, Muir’s challenge is more “properly pres ented and resolved in a claim \nunder the Rehabilitation Act,” Re sp’t Br. 28, to which we now \nturn.   \n  \nC. \n \nFinally, we consider Muir’s claim that the Final Rule and \nTSA’s SOPs, as applied to him,  violate the Rehabilitation Act \nof 1973, 29 U.S.C. §§ 701–797.  The Rehabilitation Act “empower[s] individuals with disabilities to maximize \nemployment, economic self-suf ficiency, independence, and \ninclusion and integrat ion into society.”  Id. § 701(b)(1).  The \nAct’s “basic tenet is that the Government must take reasonable affirmative steps to accomm odate the handicapped, except \nwhere undue hardship would result.”  Barth v. Gelb , 2 F.3d \n1180, 1183 (D.C. Cir. 1993).   \n Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act prohibits \ndiscrimination against disabled pe rsons by recipients of federal \nfunds.  29 U.S.C. § 794.  We star t by addressing two threshold USCA Case #22-1318      Document #2127237            Filed: 07/25/2025      Page 14 of 2615 \n issues.  First, Muir’s Rehabilitation Act claim is properly \nbefore us because we, not the district courts, have exclusive jurisdiction under § 46110(a) to  review claims that TSA \n“orders” are “not in accordance with law.”  Suburban Air \nFreight , 716 F.3d at 681.  A TSA SOP is such an “order,” \nRoberts v. Napolitano , 798 F. Supp. 2d 7, 10 (D.D.C. 2011), \naff’d , 463 F. App’x 4, 4–5 (D.C. Cir. 2012), which Muir asserts \nis not in accordance with the Rehabilitation Act.  Muir challenges the SOP, as applied to him, that instructs TSOs to conduct follow-up pat-downs of body parts flagged by AIT \nscanners, a practice that, wit hout appropriate accommodation, \nallegedly excludes Muir from participation in TSA’s security screening.  Pet’r Br. 44. \n Our dissenting colleague take s the position that we lack \njurisdiction because Muir did not specify any SOP in his \npetition for review.  He asserts that Muir has accordingly failed \nto satisfy the requirements of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure to “specify the order . . . to be reviewed” in the petition.  F\nED. R. APP. P. 15(a)(2)(C); see Partial Dissent at 1–\n2.  We disagree.  It is true that Muir, a pro se litigant, did not identify the relevant (nonpublic ) SOP in his petition, but only \ndesignated the Final Rule that authorizes it.  See Pet. for \nReview 1 (J.A. 32).  “But a ‘m istaken or inexact specification \nof the order to be reviewed’ is ‘n ot fatal,’ as long as the ‘intent \nto seek review of a specific order [i] can be fairly inferred from \nthe petition for review or from other contemporaneous filings, and [ii] the respondent is not  misled by the mistake.’”  Am. \nRivers v. FERC , 895 F.3d 32, 44 (D.C. Cir. 2018) (quoting \nEntravision Holdings, LLC v. FCC , 202 F.3d 311, 313 (D.C. \nCir. 2000)) (alterations in orig inal) (emphasis omitted).   \n Those conditions are met here.  Muir’s petition explained \nthat he is not able to proceed  through screening because “the \nconfiguration of the AIT [s canner] . . . algorithmically USCA Case #22-1318      Document #2127237            Filed: 07/25/2025      Page 15 of 2616 \n misidentifies [his] hernia as a threat object requiring a pat-\ndown to resolve.”  Pet. for Revi ew 2 (J.A. 33).  That statement \nsufficed to inform TSA that Muir  challenged its direction to \nsecurity personnel to conduct follow-up pat-downs of any potential threat object identified by an AIT scanner—a direction Muir now knows is spel led out in an SOP.  Notably, \nTSA claims no prejudice from the petition’s failure to specify \nan SOP.  Those circumstances show that the petition meets the requirements of Rule 15(a)(2).  Accordingly, we do not believe either Federal Appellate Rule of Procedure 15(a)(2)(C) or § \n46111(a) preclude our exercise of jurisdicti on over Muir’s \nRehabilitation Act claim.   \n Second, TSA suggests Muir’s challenge is foreclosed \nbecause Muir “did not avail hims elf of the opportunity to bring \nan administrative complaint alleging a violation of Section 504.”  Resp’t Br. 47.  But § 4611 0(d) excuses the failure to \nraise a claim for an accommodation in a proceeding before the agency “if there was a reasona ble ground for not making the” \nrequest.  49 U.S.C. § 46110(d).  As discussed below, Muir’s \nprior attempts at procuring an accommodation through the available administrative process we re exercises in futility that \nexcuse him from engaging in yet another such futile attempt.  \nSee Tesoro Refin. & Mktg. Co. v. FERC , 552 F.3d 868, 874 \n(D.C. Cir. 2009) (observing that the futility exception to exhaustion is “limited to situations ‘when resort to administrative remedies [would be] “clearly useless.”’”) (citation omitted).  Although our dissenting collea gue is correct \nthat the futility exception is us ed sparingly, Partial Dissent at \n5, we find present the requisite “certainty of an adverse decision,” id. (citation omitted), in TSA’s assertion that Muir’s \nrequested accommodation “woul d fundamentally alter the \nnature of TSA’s security screen ing program,” Resp’t Br. 14.  \nSee also  J.L. v. SSA , 971 F.2d 260, 271 (9th Cir. 1992) \n(“Exhaustion is futile where the agency’s position on an issue USCA Case #22-1318      Document #2127237            Filed: 07/25/2025      Page 16 of 2617 \n ‘appears already set,’ and it is ‘very likely’ what its result \nwould have been.”).  We accordi ngly need not decide in this \ncase whether non-employee petitio ners bringing Section 504 \nclaims ordinarily must firs t exhaust their administrative \nremedies.  Cf. id. at 270 (“[W]e recognize that the \nRehabilitation Act does not requir e exhaustion of remedies in \nall cases.”), rev’d on other grounds , Lane v. Pena , 518 U.S. \n187 (1996).  We thus proceed to co nsider the merits of Muir’s \nRehabilitation Act claim.         \n \n1. \n “To prove a violation of sect ion 504, [complainants] must \nshow that (1) they are disabled within the meaning of the Rehabilitation Act, (2) they ar e otherwise qualified, (3) they \nwere excluded from, denied th e benefit of, or subject to \ndiscrimination under a program or  activity, and (4) the program \nor activity is carried out by a federal executive agency or with \nfederal funds.”  Am. Council of the Blind v. Paulson , 525 F.3d \n1256, 1266 (D.C. Cir. 2008).  In addition, the disabled individual “bears the ‘initial burden’ of showing that a \nreasonable accommodation is possible” and  “[o]nce that showing is made, an [agency] may still avoid liability by \nshowing that the proposed accommodation would impose an ‘undue hardship’ on the [agency]’s operations.”  Ali v. Regan , \n111 F.4th 1264, 1269 (D.C. Cir. 2024) (c itations omitted).      \n TSA does not dispute Muir’s abil ity to satisfy the liability \nelements of a Section 504 claim, that is, he “is an ‘individual \nwith a disability’ as defined in 29 U.S.C. § 705(20), . . . he is \n‘otherwise qualified’ to pres ent to a TSA checkpoint and \nreceive security screening . . . [and] TSA’s security screening \nactivities are a ‘program or  activity conducted by an[] \nExecutive agency’ under 29 U.S.C. § 794(a).”  Resp’t Br. 44.  \nRather, TSA argues that Muir’s  requested accommodation is USCA Case #22-1318      Document #2127237            Filed: 07/25/2025      Page 17 of 26RANDOLPH , Senior Circuit Judge, concurring in part and\ndissenting in part:\nI join the majority opinion except for part III.

I dissent\nfrom that part because our court lacks jurisdiction to review\nMuir’s contentions regarding the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C.\n§ 701 et seq.\n \nMuir’s petition for judicial review invoked 49 U.S.C.\n§ 46110(a), a statute conferring jurisdiction on the federal courts\nof appeals—direct review—over a person’s1 “petition for\nreview” of an “order” of the Transportation Security\nAdministration.  The majority opinion declares that the\n§ 46110(a) “orders” establishing our jurisdiction are TSA’s\nStandard Operating Procedures, or “SOPs.”2  The opinion then\nconsiders Muir’s arguments (and those of a court appointed\n“amicus” attorney) regarding the Rehabilitation Act. \nThe majority has missed a step.  It first should have noticed\nthat Muir’s § 46110(a) petition did not designate any TSA\nStandard Operating Procedure as an “order” with respect to\nwhich he sought judicial review.  As a consequence, and as I will\nexplain, our court lacks jurisdiction to adjudicate Muir’s claims\nabout the Rehabilitation Act.  \nRule 15(a)(2)(C) of the Federal Rules of Appellate\nProcedure states: a petition for direct review of an agency\ndecision “must . . . specify the order or part thereof to be\nreviewed.”  Note the “must.”  Muir, although representing\n1 That is, “a person disclosing a substantial interest in an order” of the\nTransportation Security Administration. 49 U.S.C. § 46110(a).\n2 These are non-public directions to staff regarding screening\nprocedures. See Roberts v. Napolitano , 798 F. Supp. 2d 7, 9 (D.D.C.\n2011), aff’d, 463 F. App’x 4 (D.C. Cir. 2012). USCA Case #22-1318      Document #2127237            Filed: 07/25/2025      Page 22 of 262\nhimself, cannot claim ignorance of this rule—he cited Rule 15\nin his petition for judicial review.  To repeat, Muir’s petition\nnever mentioned any SOPs.3\nThe law of our circuit is that a petitioner’s failure to specify\nan “order” in compliance with Rule 15(a)(2)(C) deprives our\ncourt of jurisdiction to review that order.  See City of Benton v.\nNuclear Regul. Comm’n , 136 F.3d 824, 826 (D.C. Cir. 1998)\n(per curiam); John D. Copanos & Sons, Inc. v. FDA , 854 F.2d\n510, 527 (D.C. Cir.1988); Small Bus. in Telecomms.  v. FCC, 251\nF.3d 1015, 1022 (D.C. Cir. 2001).  Our opinion in City of Benton\nadded that the “jurisdictional requirements of Rule 15(a) may\nnot be waived.”  136 F.3d at 826 (citing Gottesman v. INS , 33\nF.3d 383, 388 (4th Cir. 1994)).\n3 Muir’s “contemporaneous filings” also failed to notify the\ngovernment of the order being challenged.  See Small Bus. in\nTelecomm. v. FCC , 251 F.3d 1015, 1019 (D.C. Cir. 2001). Muir filed\nhis petition on December 14, 2022. Fifteen days later, on December\n29, he filed the Docketing Statement, Statement of Issues, and\nUnderlying Decision from which Petition Arises. None of these filings\nmentioned the SOPs. The filings merely reiterated Muir’s objection\nto TSA’s promulgation of 49 C.F.R. § 1540.107(d) and DHS’s order\ncertifying the AIT devices.\nThe majority excuses Muir as a “pro se litigant” unable to\nidentify the “nonpublic” SOPs.  Majority Op. at 15. But Muir knew of\nthe SOPs when he filed his petition in this court in December 2022.\nIn January 2021, the District Court for the Central District of Illinois\ndismissed one of Muir’s suits because “TSA’s screenings are\nconducted pursuant to [the SOP] . . . and challenges to the SOP . . . lie\nwithin the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of appeals.” Muir v.\nTSA, 2021 WL 231733, at *11 (C.D. Ill. Jan. 22, 2021). Muir then\ndiscussed the SOPs in his Seventh Circuit brief in 2021. See Brief for\nthe Appellant at 13, Muir v. TSA , 857 F. App’x 251 (7th Cir. 2021)\n(No. 21-1312), ECF No. 15. USCA Case #22-1318      Document #2127237            Filed: 07/25/2025      Page 23 of 263\nThe next problem with part III.C of the opinion is this. \nSection 46110(a)—the provision Muir invoked to establish our\njurisdiction—requires a petition for review to be filed within 60\ndays of issuance of the “order.”  Our court has held that\n“simpl[e] ignorance of the order” will not excuse\nnoncompliance.  Matar v. TSA , 910 F.3d 538, 542 (D.C. Cir.\n2018) (quoting Avia Dynamics, Inc. v. FAA , 641 F.3d 515, 521\n(D.C. Cir. 2011)).  It is one thing if a person files his petition\nchallenging an order after the 60-day deadline expired.  Section\n46110(a) has an escape valve for those who have “reasonable\ngrounds” for delay.  The built-in assumption of § 46110(a) is\nthat the person, at some time after the 60 days had run, filed a\npetition for review of the “order.”  Muir was not late in filing. \nThe problem for him—and the majority—is not with delay.  It is\nthat he did not, and still has not, filed any § 46110(a) petition\nobjecting to an SOP.\nThe third jurisdictional defect in the majority’s analysis is\nas follows.  The majority excuses Muir from his failure to\nexhaust administrative remedies because “Muir’s prior attempts\nat procuring an accommodation . . . were exercises in futility.”\nMajority Op. at 16.  What “prior attempts”? The majority has\nonly one “attempt” in mind.  That is the single complaint Muir\nlodged with the DHS Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties\non December 15, 2019, three years before the events at the\nFlorida airport described in his petition for judicial review in this\ncase. Majority Op. at 8.  This Office—CRCL—responded to\nMuir’s complaint in a January 2020 letter.  The letter stated that\nafter reviewing the information Muir “provided, CRCL has\nrecorded it in our database.” Muir Reply Br. Addendum at 42. \nCRCL took no further action and Muir considered his complaint\nas having been “denied.” Muir Reply Br. at 17.\nThe DHS regulation governing complaints like Muir’s—6 USCA Case #22-1318      Document #2127237            Filed: 07/25/2025      Page 24 of 264\nC.F.R. § 15.70(d)—requires claims of disability discrimination\nto be filed within 180 days of the discriminatory conduct. \nMuir’s complaint alleged discrimination at two airports in\nAugust 2018.  He did not file  his complaint with CRCL until\nNovember 1, 2019, many months out of time.  \nMore important, CRCL’s letter was not “final agency\naction” subject to judicial review.  See Bennett v. Spear , 520\nU.S. 154, 177–78 (1997); Magassa v. Mayorkas , 52 F.4th 1156,\n1165 (9th Cir. 2022).  It was only an intermediate determination. \nIf Muir was dissatisfied with CRCL’s response, he had a right to\ntake an administrative appeal within 60 days.4  In such an appeal,\nit is “the Officer for Civil Rights  and Civil Liberties, or\ndesignee thereof, who will issue the final agency decision which\nmay include appropriate corrective action to be taken by the\nDepartment.”  6 C.F.R. § 15.70(i) (emphasis added).\nBut Muir never filed an administrative appeal regarding his\nNovember 2019 complaint.  In other words, he did not then\nexhaust his administrative remedies.5  And so the majority\nopinion is clearly mistaken in excusing Muir from having to\npresent any administrative complaint whatsoever before\n4 “Appeals of the findings of fact and conclusions of law or remedies\nmust be filed by the complainant not later than 60 days after receipt\nfrom the Department of the letter” denying the complaint. 6 C.F.R.\n§ 15.70(h).\n5 See, e.g., Smith v. Blue Cross & Blue Shield , 959 F.2d 655, 659 (7th\nCir. 1992) (requiring litigants challenging agency action to “show that\nit is certain that their claim will be denied on [administrative] appeal,\nnot merely that they doubt an appeal will result in a different\ndecision”).  Our court cited this portion of Smith with approval in\nTesoro Refin. & Mktg. Co. v. FERC , 552 F.3d 868, 874 (D.C. Cir.\n2009). USCA Case #22-1318      Document #2127237            Filed: 07/25/2025      Page 25 of 265\npursuing his Rehabilitation Act claim in this court.6  There is no\ntelling how the CRCL Officer would have ruled in 2020 had\nMuir appealed, and still less is there any way to know how he\nwould have been treated if he had filed an administrative\ncomplaint in 2022.  The majority therefore erred in applying the\nfutility exception of exhaustion.  That exception is “quite\nrestricted,” Comm. of Blind Vendors of D.C. v. District of\nColumbia , 28 F.3d 130, 133 n.5 (D.C. Cir. 1994), and is\nconfined to situations when resort to administrative remedies\nwould be “‘clearly useless,’” Randolph-Sheppard Vendors of\nAm. v. Weinberger , 795 F.2d 90, 105 (D.C. Cir. 1986) (quoting\nBaxter v. Claytor , 652 F.2d 181, 185 (D.C. Cir. 1981)); see also\nTesoro Refin. & Mktg. Co. v. FERC , 552 F.3d 868, 874 (D.C.\nCir. 2009).\n6 49 U.S.C. § 46110(d) itself required Muir to exhaust his\nadministrative remedies.  That section, and comparable provisions in\nthe judicial review statute of many agencies, cannot be waived.  See\nEEOC v. FLRA , 476 U.S. 19, 23 (1986).

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: The case involves K.P., a minor with disabilities, who sought to use a hand-held calculator during a computerized MAP test, a measure devised by the Northwest Evaluation Association (NWEA), arguing that her rights under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) were violated. Although the AI or automated system aspect is not explicitly discussed, the computerized MAP test, which features an on-screen calculator for specific questions only, establishes the context for the requested accommodation. The court upheld the defendant's decision, denying a preliminary injunction for the use of the hand-held calculator, partly reasoning that such accommodation could potentially skew test validity and results.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the refusal to allow K.P. to use a hand-held calculator during a standardized test violated her rights under the IDEA and ADA.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court denied the plaintiff's motion for a preliminary injunction, agreeing with the magistrate judge's recommendation. The court held that the refusal likely did not violate the IDEA because the lack of written notice did not cause substantive harm due to the parents' awareness of the testing conditions. Moreover, the court found the ADA claim unlikely to succeed, reasoning that allowing K.P. to use a hand-held calculator was not a reasonable accommodation as it would interfere with the integrity of the test designed to measure actual math computation skills.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: A student named K.P. needed special help because she learns differently from other kids. Her school wouldn't let her use a regular calculator on a test because they thought it would make her scores unfair compared to other students. The test already had a digital calculator for some math questions. Her mom disagreed and took the school to court. The court sided with the school, saying that using the regular calculator would give her an unfair advantage because the test wanted to see how she solves math problems on her own.",

Guzmán\n)\nCITY OF CHICAGO SD #299, )\n)\nDefendant. )\nMEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER\nPlaintiff alleges that defendant violated the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act\n(“IDEA”) and the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”) by refusing to let her use a hand-heldcalculator while taking the Northwest Evaluation Association Measure of Academic Progress(“MAP”) test.  Plaintiff filed a motion for a preliminary injunction, which the Court referred toMagistrate Judge Cole for a Report and Recommendation (“R&R”).  After briefing and argument,Judge Cole issued an R&R recommending that the motion be denied.  The case is before the Courton plaintiff’s objections to the R&R.  For the reasons set forth below, the Court overrules theobjections, adopts the R&R in its entirety, and denies plaintiff’s motion for preliminary injunction. \nFacts\nK.P. is an eighth grader who is eligible for special education services.  (Compl. ¶ 3.)  In\nJanuary 2013, the parties created an Individualized Education Plan (“IEP”) for K.P. that includes “useof a calculator” as a classroom mathematics accommodation, and states that K.P. will “participate inthe district [and state] assessments WITH ALLOWABLE accommodations/modifications that areCase: 1:14-cv-07296 Document #: 33 Filed: 02/25/15 Page 1 of 9 PageID #:<pageID>necessary to measure academic achievement and functional performance.”  (R&R at 3; see City\nMem. Opp’n Pl.’s Mot. Prelim. Inj., Ex. 10, 1/29/ 13 IEP at 7, 9.)  The 2013 IEP does not list a hand-\nheld calculator as an accommodation.  ( See generally  City Mem. Opp’n Pl.’s Mot. Prelim. Inj., Ex.\n10, 1/29/13 IEP.)\nSometime between January 2013 and July 2014, de fendant started requiring students to obtain\na threshold MAP score to qualify to take the en trance exams for selective enrollment high schools\nand using the test score as one-third of the 900 point selection rubric for those schools.  (R&R at 4.) The MAP test is taken on a computer, and for a portion of the math questions, an on-screen calculatorpops up for the student to use.  ( Id. at 3.)  For the rest of the ma th questions, however, the calculator\ndisappears, and the students must perform computations on their own.  ( Id.)\nThe Northwest Evaluation Association (“NWEA”), which created the MAP test, recognizes\ntwo kinds of accommodations:  (1) standard (also called allowable) accommodations; and (2) non-standard accommodations.  ( Id. at 4; see Def.’s Mem. Opp’n Pl.’s Mot. Prelim. Inj., Ex. 6, NWEA\nAccommodations for MAP® Assessments at 1-2.)  Standard accommodations are those that “will beirrelevant to, or only minimally affect the validity of the student’s test score.”  (R&R at 4; see Def.’s\nMem. Opp’n Pl.’s Mot. Prelim. Inj., Ex. 6, NWEA Accommodations for MAP® Assessments at 1.) Non-standard accommodations are those that “have the potential  to bias the students’ test score,” and\ninclude “[u]sing a calculator for questions that do not have an on-screen calculator.”  (R&R at 4; see\nDef.’s Mem. Opp’n Pl.’s Mot. Prelim. Inj., Ex. 6, NWEA Accommodations for MAP® Assessmentsat 2) (emphasis original).  The NWEA does not preclude schools from making non-standardaccommodations during MAP tests if, for example, an IEP requires it.  ( See Def.’s Mem. Opp’n Pl.’s\nMot. Prelim. Inj., Ex. 6, NWEA Accommodations for MAP® Assessments at 2.)  “However, [the\n2Case: 1:14-cv-07296 Document #: 33 Filed: 02/25/15 Page 2 of 9 PageID #:<pageID>school] leadership has the responsibility for . . . interp ret[ing] . . . the test results” and “track[ing] non-\nstandard accommodations so they can be factored in interpretations.”  ( Id.)  Further, the NWEA states\nthat “[t]he greater the use of non-standard accommodations . . . , the weaker the validity of theinference that can be drawn from the student’s score,” which “should be considered when interpretingtest scores or using them to make important educational decisions.”  ( Id.)\nIn May 2014, after discovering that the use of hand-held calculators was generally not\npermitted during the MAP test, K.P.’s mother wrote a letter to defendant asking whether K.P. would\nbe allowed to use one pursuant to her IEP.   (R&R at 5.)  Defendant did not respond to her letter,  butshe was contacted shortly thereafter about updating K.P.’s IEP.  ( Id.)  The parties met in July and\ncreated a new IEP that lists both “use of a calculator” and “[u]se [of a] hand held calculator” asclassroom mathematics accommodations, but also states that K.P. will take district and stateassessments “WITH ALLOWABLE accommodations/modifications.”  ( Id. at 3-4; see City Mem.\nOpp’n Pl.’s Mot. Prelim. Inj., Ex. 11, 7/16/14 IEP at 6-9.)\nIn September 2014, K.P.’s mother asked defendant to confirm that K.P. would be allowed to\nuse a hand-held calculator during the math portion of  the MAP test, which K.P. was scheduled to take\non October 4, 2014.\n1  (R&R at 6.)  Defendant told her that  K.P. would not be allowed to do so, and\nthis suit followed.\n1Defendant agreed to postpone the test until after this Court’s ruling on the objections to\nthe R&R.  ( See id. at 9 n.5.) \n3Case: 1:14-cv-07296 Document #: 33 Filed: 02/25/15 Page 3 of 9 PageID #:<pageID>Discussion\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 72(a) instructs the Court to make a de novo determination\nof those portions of the R&R to which plaintiff objects.  Id.  The Court may “accept, reject, or\nmodify” the R&R, “receive further evidence or recommit the matter to the magistrate judge withinstructions.”  28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1).\nPlaintiff objects to the Magistrate Judge’s conclusion that she is unlikely to succeed on her\nclaim that defendant violated the IDEA by failing to give her parents prior notice of the removal ofthe hand-held calculator accommodation from her IEP.  ( See Compl., Count I); 20 U.S.C. §\n1415(b)(3)(A) (requiring a school to give “[w]ritten prior notice to the parents of the child, . . .whenever [it] . . . propose[s] to in itiate or change” an IEP).  As an initial matter, the Magistrate Judge\nsaid it was not clear that there had actually been a change in plaintiff’s IEP, “given [its] wording . .\n. [,] its explicit limitation to ‘ALLOWABLE’ accommodations, [and] the NWEA guidelines onnon-standard accommodations.”  (R&R at 8.)  Even if there had been one, however, Judge Cole saidK.P.’s parents had actual notice of the alleged change, and thus the lack of written notice neitherprejudiced them nor violated the IDEA:\n. . . .  As far as the notice requirement, there is no harm, no foul because, as is clear\nfrom the plaintiffs’ submissions, they were well aware that K.P. would not be allowedthe hand-held calculator accommodation on portions of the Test where there is noon-screen calculator.  They have identified no prejudice resulting from lack of written\nnotice.  Nor have they cited any case law in support of injunctive relief for the failureto provide written notice.  They’ve filed suit, have had the testing schedule altered toallow for adjudication of their Americans With Disabilities Act (“ADA”) claim, andwill have their day in court without harm to K.P. \n(Id. at 9) (emphasis original). \nPlaintiff contends that this conclusion is erroneous because even a  non-prejudicial  violation\nof the notice provision is actionable.  The Court disagrees.  The purpose of the IDEA’s notice\n4Case: 1:14-cv-07296 Document #: 33 Filed: 02/25/15 Page 4 of 9 PageID #:<pageID>provision is “to ensure that the parents of a child with a disability are both notified of decisions\naffecting their child and given an opportunity to object to these decisions.”   C.H. v. Cape Henlopen\nSch. Dist. , 606 F.3d 59, 70 (3d Cir. 2010).  “Thus in cases where a violation of a notification\nrequirement does not actually impair the parents’ knowledge of, or participation in, educationaldecisions, the violation is not a substantive harm under the IDEA.”  Id.; see K.A. ex rel. F.A. v. Fulton\nCnty. Sch. Dist. , 741 F.3d 1195, 1204-05 (11th Cir. 2013) (dismissing IDEA claim, though school\nhad not provided required notice, because the violation did not prejudice the parents); Thomas v.\nCincinnati Bd. of Educ. , 918 F.2d 618, 625 (6th Cir. 1990) (“Although we are not called upon to\ndecide whether all violations of [IDEA’s] procedural requirements are to be assessed according toa separate test of prejudice, we are of the opinion that inquiry is proper [in the notice context], since\nthe only error was one of technical noncompliance which did not result in any substantivedeprivation.”),  superseded in part on other grounds by regulation as recognized in , N.W. ex. re. J.W.\nv. Boone Cnty. Bd. of Educ. , 763 F.3d 611 (6th Cir. 2014); see also Hjortness ex rel. Hjortness v.\nNeenah Jt. Sch. Dist. , 507 F.3d 1060, 1065 (7th Cir. 2007) (stating,  in the context of a school’s failure\nto hold a second IEP meeting, that “this procedural violation does not rise to the level of a denial of\na free appropriate public education . . . . [because the] parents’ rights were [not] in any meaningfulway infringed”).  Such is the case here.  Therefore,  the Court agrees with Magistrate Judge Cole that\nplaintiff does not have a likelihood of success on the merits of her IDEA claim.\nJudge Cole also concluded that plaintiff is not likely to succeed on her ADA claim because\nshe did not show that the accommodation she seeks is reasonable:\nAllowing K.P. to use a calculator to answer questions that are designed to assess her\nability to perform math calculations is not an accommodation that in the plaintiffs’words “level the playing field.”  Quite the contrary.  It would permit K.P. to replaceher allegedly limited computational skills with a mechanical tool of infinite capacity\n5Case: 1:14-cv-07296 Document #: 33 Filed: 02/25/15 Page 5 of 9 PageID #:<pageID>(at least in the context of this case) that likely exceeds the computational capabilities\nof perhaps all – and certainly most – non-disa bled students.  That is not a reasonable\naccommodation but a substitution of artificial intelligence for the very skill the Testseeks to measure.\nPlaintiffs allow that K.P.’s use of a hand-held calculator throughout the entire math\ntest will lead CPS to invalidat e the results, but insist that should . . . that occur that\nwill raise an issue that may be “ultimately be decided in this forum or elsewhere.”(Dkt. # 7-1, at 6). Implicit in this argument is a recognition that the Test will beinvalidated, thereby ensuring future litigation over the permissibility of thatinvalidation. But, an accommodation that serves to scrap the results of a three hourtest – and prompts additional litigation – does not qualify as “reasonable.”Accommodations are not reasonable if they impose undue financial andadministrative burdens.\n(R&R at 10-11) (footnotes and citations omitted). \nPlaintiff contends that she offered evidence, the declarations of her mother, J.P., and her\nlearning disabilities specialist, Katherine Siavelis, to show that her use of a hand-held calculatorwould not render her test results invalid, but Judge Cole erroneously refused to consider them.  ( See\nPl.’s Objs. at 4; R&R at 6-7 n.4 (stating that he disregarded the declarations because plaintiff\nsubmitted them for the first time on reply and the relevant portion of J.P.’s declaration wasinadmissible).)  Even if Judge Cole had considered the declarations, however, it would not havehelped plaintiff’s case.  Siavelis’ declaration does not address the validity issue at all, and J.P.’sdeclaration only addresses it through inadmissible hearsay.  ( See Pl.’s Reply, Ex. 4, J.P. Decl. ¶¶ 34-\n35 (quoting a passage from an article published by an education consortium); see generally id. , Ex.\n5, Siavelis Decl.).)  Because the declarations would not have bolstered plaintiff’s proof even if JudgeCole had considered them, his refusal to do so was not erroneous.  \nPlaintiff also argues that there is no basis for the finding that K.P.’s use of a hand-held\ncalculator would, in fact, render the test results i nvalid.  (Pl.’s Objs. at 7.)  Once again, the Court\ndisagrees.  The record shows that the MAP test’s cr eator:  (1) deems the use of a hand-held calculator\n6Case: 1:14-cv-07296 Document #: 33 Filed: 02/25/15 Page 6 of 9 PageID #:<pageID>to be a non-standard accommodation, i.e., one that has the potential to bias the score; (2) cautions\nschools that “the greater the use of non-standard acco mmodations . . . , the weaker the validity of the\ninference that can be drawn from the student’s score,” and discourages them from relying on suchinferences “to make important educational decisions”; and (3) makes schools responsible forinterpreting MAP test results and factoring the use of non-standard accommodations into thoseinterpretations.  (R&R at 4; see Def.’s Mem. Opp’n Pl.’s Mot. Prelim. Inj., Ex. 6, NWEA\nAccommodations for MAP® Assessments).  It further shows that defendant, the party vested withthe authority to and responsibility for interpreting the test results, deems MAP scores obtained by astudent who uses a hand-held calculator throughout the test to be invalid.  (Def.’s Mem. Opp’n Pl.’sMot. Prelim. Inj., Ex. 4, Barker Decl. ¶¶ 1, 13-14 (testimony of defendant’s Chief AccountabilityOfficer that, based on the NWEA guidance,“[i]f defe ndant learn[s] that a student used a non-standard\naccommodation, his/her score will be invalidated” and will not be used for determining eligibility forselective enrollment high school testing or admissions). )  In short, Judge Cole’s conclusion that the\naccommodation plaintiff seeks is unreasonable because  it would invalidate he r MAP test results is\nfully supported by the record.\nFinally, plaintiff objects to Judge Cole’s determination that the public interest disfavors\ninjunctive relief because K.P.’s use of a hand-held  calculator would give her more time to complete\nthe test than other students.  (Pl.’s Objs. at 3; see R&R at 16.)  Plaintiff asserts that the MAP test is\nnot timed, and thus the “advantage” identified by the Magistrate Judge is illusory.  Even if plaintiff’s\nassertion about the test is true, and she cites no evidence to support it, that fact would not changeJudge Cole’s conclusion about the public interest factor.  Rather, as the R&R makes clear, Judge\n7Case: 1:14-cv-07296 Document #: 33 Filed: 02/25/15 Page 7 of 9 PageID #:<pageID>Cole’s conclusion was based on the overall advantage over other students that the requested\naccommodation would give K.P.:\n[I]f plaintiffs’ contention is accepted, while other students are working through\nmathematical calculations in their head as best as their capabilities will permit, withinevitable mistakes, K.P. need only turn to her calculator to achieve likely perfectresults.  Moreover, because of the increased speed with which the calculator willenable her to go through the problems, K.P. will have more time than other studentsto answer the more difficult questions as she progresses through the phases of theTest, thereby effectively multiplying K.P.’s extra time accommodation as well.\nThe only sticking point might be if the plaintiffs’ contention – which is unsupported\nby any evidence – that incorrect answers on the calculation questions will rob K.P.of her opportunity to answer questions about mathematical concepts is correct.  Evenif it is, though, there is an inequity when the other students are considered.  Supposethere is an “adaptive” basketball skills competition that includes a dunk portion andthree-point shooting portion.  For every successful dunk, a player gets 5 three-pointshot attempts. One player – who has no problem shooting long range – has a handicapthat prevents him from jumping and he demands and receives a ten-foot ladder for thedunk portion of the Test.  The accommodated player is guaranteed not only a perfect\nscore on the dunk contest, but far more three-point attempts that the other players.That’s not a “level playing field,” and the public interest in fairness to the otherplayers – the other students here – is compromised.     \n(R&R at 16-17.)  Because the time element was not determinative of the public interest inquiry,\nJudge Cole’s alleged error is not a basis for rejecting his conclusion.\n8Case: 1:14-cv-07296 Document #: 33 Filed: 02/25/15 Page 8 of 9 PageID #:<pageID>Conclusion\nFor the reasons set forth above, the Court overrules plaintiff’s objections to Magistrate Judge\nCole’s R&R, adopts the R&R [21] in its entirety, and denies plaintiff’s motion for a preliminaryinjunction [4].\nSO ORDERED.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: The court recommends dismissing Kimberly Hancock's complaint against the United States because it fails to state a claim. Hancock alleged that a government contractor, Crest Security, used her for an AI program, but she did not sufficiently establish any wrongdoing by the United States or any actionable claim. Additionally, her claim is barred by the statute of limitations since the alleged conduct occurred over 50 years ago.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the plaintiff's complaint sufficiently alleges a claim upon which relief can be granted against the United States.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court recommends dismissing the complaint because it fails to allege specific actions by the United States that could establish liability, fails to demonstrate any constitutional or statutory violations, and is barred by the statute of limitations.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine someone tells you they were wronged by a big company many years ago, but when they try to explain what happened, they can't really say how the company was involved or what rules were broken. The court needs a clear story before it can help. Here, Kimberly said a scary AI program did something wrong, but she didn't explain well enough how the big \"boss\" (like the government) is in trouble for it. Plus, she's bringing it up way too late, way longer than the rules usually allow. So, the court is saying, \"Sorry, we can't help with this one.\"",
    "full_text": "1 \n UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \n FOR THE DISTRICT OF KANSAS  \nKIMBERLY D. HANCOCK,        Plaintiff,      v.     UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,      Defendant.    \n               Case No. 25-1045-JWB-BGS \n \nREPORT AND RECOMMENDATION \nFOR DISMISSAL OF COMPLAINT \nPlaintiff Kimberly Hancock filed this action pro se1.  In conjunction with her federal court \ncomplaint (Doc. 1), Plaintiff filed a motion to proceed without prepayment of fees, which is a motion requesting leave for Plaintiff to proceed in forma pauperis  (“IFP”).  Doc. 3.  After review of \nPlaintiff’s complaint, however, the Court recommends  to the District Court that Plaintiff’s claims \nagainst Defendant be dismissed  for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. \nI. Standard of Review for IFP Complaints  \nWhen a Plaintiff proceeds IFP, the court may screen the Complaint under 28 U.S.C. § \n1915(e)(2).  The court “shall dismiss” an in forma pa uperis case “at any time if the court determines \nthat … the action or appeal – (i) is frivolous or malicious; (ii) fails to state a claim on which relief \nmay be granted; or (iii) seeks monetary relief agai nst a defendant who is immune from such relief.”  \n28 U.S.C. § 1915(e)(2).  “When a plaintiff is pr oceeding in forma pauperis, a court has a duty to \nreview the complaint to ensure a proper bala nce between these comp eting interests.”  Mitchell v.  \nDeseret Health Care Facility , No. 13-1360-RDR-KGG, 2013 WL 5797609, at *1 (D. Kan. Sept. 30, \n \n1Plaintiff proceeds pro se.  The Court construes her filings liberally and holds her to a less stringent standard \nthan trained lawyers.  See Haines v. Kerner , 404 U.S. 519, 520-21 (1972); Hall v. Bellmon , 935 F.2d 1106, 1110 \n(10th Cir. 1991).  But the Court does not assume th e role of advocate for the pro se litigant.  Hall, 935 F.2d at \n1110. Case 6:25-cv-01045-JWB     Document 8     Filed 04/29/25     Page 1 of 72 \n 2013).  The purpose of § 1915(e) is “the prev ention of abusive or capricious litigation.”  Harris v.  \nCampbell , 804 F. Supp. 153, 155 (D. Kan. 1992) (in ternal citation omitted) (discussing similar \nlanguage contained in § 1915(d), prior to the 1996 amendment).  Sua sponte  dismissal under § 1915(d) \nmay be appropriate when “on the face of the complain t it clearly appears that the action is frivolous \nor malicious.”  Hall v. Bellmon , 935 F.2d 1106, 1108 (10th Cir. 1991) (citing Henriksen v. Bentley , 644 \nF.2d 852, 854 (10th Cir.1981)). \nIn determining whether dismissal is appropriate under 28 U.S.C. § 1915(e)(2)(B), a plaintiff’s \ncomplaint will be analyzed by the Court under the same sufficiency standard as a Fed. R. Civ. P. \n12(b)(6) motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim.  Kay v. Bemis , 500 F.3d 1214, 1217 (10th Cir. \n2007).  In conducting this analysis, the Court w ill accept as true all well-pleaded facts and draw all \nreasonable inferences from those fa cts in favor of a plaintiff.  See Moore v. Guthrie , 438 F.3d 1036, \n1039 (10th Cir. 2006). \nWhile a complaint generally need not plead detailed facts, it must give the defendant \nsufficient notice of the claims asserted by the pl aintiff so they may provide an appropriate answer.  \nFed. R. Civ. P. 8(a); Monroe v. Owens , 38 Fed. App’x. 510, 515 (10t h Cir. 2002) (citation omitted).  \nThis requires that a complaint contain three mini mal pieces of information: (1) a short and plain \nstatement of the claim showing that the pleader is en titled to relief, (2) a short and plain statement of \nthe grounds upon which the court’s jurisdiction depend s, and (3) the relief requested.  Fed. R. Civ. \nP. 8(a). \nBecause the court will liberally c onstrue the pleadings of a pro se  plaintiff, the court should \n“reasonably read the pleadings to state a valid cl aim on which the plaintiff could prevail … despite \nthe plaintiff’s failure to cite proper legal authori ty, his confusion of various legal theories, his poor \nsyntax and sentence construction, or his unfamiliarity with pleading requirements.”  Hall, 935 F.2d at \n1110.  The court cannot, however, become an advocate for the pro se  plaintiff.  Id. Case 6:25-cv-01045-JWB     Document 8     Filed 04/29/25     Page 2 of 73 \n A pro se  plaintiff’s complaint must still “set forth the grounds of plaintiff’s entitlement to \nrelief through more than labels, conclusions, and a fo rmulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of \naction.”  Fisher v. Lynch , 531 F.Supp.2d 1253, 1260 (D. Kan. 2008) (citing Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly , \n550 U.S. 544, 555, 127 S. Ct. 1955,  1964–65, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007), and Hall, 935 F.2d at 1110 \n(holding that a plaintiff need not precisely sta te each element, but must plead minimal factual \nallegations on those material elements that must be proven)).  “In other words, plaintiff must allege \nsufficient facts to state a claim which is plausible – rather than merely conceivable – on its face.”  Id. \n(citing Twombly , 550 U.S. at 570, 127 S. Ct. at 1974).  See also  Bemis , 500 F.3d at 1218 (stating that \nfactual allegations in the complaint must establish “above the speculative level” that plaintiff is entitled to relief). \nThe Court’s relaxed scrutiny of the pro se plai ntiff’s pleadings “does not relieve [him] of the \nburden of alleging sufficient facts on which a recognized legal claim could be based.”  Hall, 935 F.2d \nat 1110.  A pro se  plaintiff’s pleading conclusory statements  is insufficient to state a claim because \nno special legal training is required to “recount the facts surrounding his alleged injury[.]”  Id.  See \nalso Olson v. Carmack , 641 Fed. App’x. 822, 825 (10th Cir. 2016).  If this Court finds, after construing \nthe allegations in Plaintiff’s complaint liberally, th at Plaintiff has failed to state a claim upon which \nrelief may be granted, the court is compelled to recommend that the action be dismissed. \nII. Plaintiff’s Claims and Factual Allegations \nPlaintiff’s complaint does not contain much d etail, but from what the Court can ascertain, \nher allegations pertain to an artificial intelligence (“AI”) program run by a government contractor.  \nHancock alleges that Crest Security, who she identifi es as a defense contractor, left her inside of a \ncentral intelligence agency (“CIA”) container for pur poses of AI research.  She goes on to state that \nshe wants out of Crest’s AI program. \nHancock claims 1 billion dollars’ worth of damage s.  In support thereof, she states that was Case 6:25-cv-01045-JWB     Document 8     Filed 04/29/25     Page 3 of 74 \n put into custody by Crest Security on October 4, 1973 , at the time of her birth.  Allegedly, she was \nforcefully held in custody her entire life.  In addition to monetary damages, she seeks a “re-entry \nteam” for her future.  Doc. 1. \nIII. Analysis \nPlaintiff does not identify any specific claims .  However, in the form complaint, she checks \nthe box which indicates “[t]his cases arises because  of a violation of the civil or equal rights, \nprivileges, or immunities accorded to citizens of, or persons within the jurisdiction, of the United \nStates (28 U.S.C. § 1343)”.  As a pro se plaintiff, Ms. Hancock is held to a less stringent standard.  \nNonetheless, the Court will not supply additional facts  or guess what claims Plaintiff is trying to \nassert.  See Whitney v. State of N.M. , 113 F.3d 1170, 1173-74 (10th Cir.  1997).  With that in mind, \nPlaintiff’s complaint fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted and the undersigned \nrecommends  that Plaintiff’s complaint be dismissed  for the reasons stated below. \nA. Failure to State a Claim \n1. No allegations against the United States \n \nPlaintiff’s complaint names one Defendant: The United States of America.  She alleges no \naction or conduct on the part of the United States.  Her complaint is void of any mention of the United States and how it may have taken part in the underlying allegations.  In other words, the \ncomplaint presents no legal theory on how the United States is liable for the events described in the \ncomplaint.   Because Hancock's complaint does not allege facts implicating the United States, it \nwould be impossible for her to prevail on any claim asserted against it.  Brantley v. Radar , No. 25-\n2046-EFM-ADM, 2025 WL 388654, at *2  (D. Kan. Feb. 4, 2025).  This alone is fatal to Plaintiff’s \nclaims.2 \n \n2Often, a plaintiff is required to exhaust administrative remedies prior to bringing a lawsuit against the United \nStates.  See, e.g. , Lopez v. United States , 823 F.3d 970, 976 (10th Cir. 2016).   In many instances, the exhaustion of \nadministrative remedies is a jurisdictional requirement.  Compare Rowland v. Matevousian , 121 F.4th 1237, 1246 Case 6:25-cv-01045-JWB     Document 8     Filed 04/29/25     Page 4 of 75 \n 2. No Colorable Cause of Action \nPlaintiff indicates in her complaint that this Court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § \n1343.  Doc. 1, at 3.  “Section 1343 grants federal di strict courts jurisdiction to hear civil rights cases, \nbut this statute does not specifically provide a cause of action.”  See Smith v. G&W Foods , No. 20-\nCV-2517, 2021 WL 1546222, at *4 (D . Kan. Apr. 20, 2021).  Under this Title, a federal district court \nhas original jurisdiction over actions to “redress [ ] deprivation, under color of any State law, statute, \nordinance, regulation, custom or usage, of any” Cons titutional or statutory right of a United States \ncitizen.  28 U.S.C. § 1343(a)(3). \nHere, Plaintiff’s complaint does not specify what constitutional, or statutory rights have been \nviolated by the United States or any other potential  defendant.  As already mentioned, the Court will \nnot guess what claims Plaintiff is attempting to a ssert.  Plaintiff makes va gue references to Crest \nSecurity and being subject to an “AI program.”  Arguably, the complaint could be construed as an attempt to bring a § 1983 civil rights claim.  However, the Plaintiff points to no constitutional violation which would be prosecuted under § 1983.   Simply put, Plaintiff does not supply any \nallegations supporting any actionable claim.  See Brantley , 2025 WL 388654, at *2 (recommending \ndismissal of complaint because plaintiff failed to make “factual allegations against any named \ndefendant that would support a claim”).  Therefore, the Court recommends  dismissal because \nPlaintiff has failed to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. \n \n(10th Cir. 2024) (holding that the admini strative exhaustion requirement unde r the FTCA is jurisdictional and \ncannot be waived), with Lincoln v. BNSF Ry. Co. , 900 F.3d 1166, 1185-86 (10th Cir. 2018) (holding that failure \nto exhaust administrative remedies under the ADA is not jurisdictional).  Either way, the failure to exhaust \nadministrative remedies is often fatal to a lawsuit.  Kansas by & through Kansas Dep't for Child. & Fams. v. \nSourceAmerica , 874 F.3d 1226, 1250 (10th Cir. 2017).  To the extent  Hancock intended to bring a claim under \nthe Federal Tort Claims Act, the Court would lack subject-matter jurisdiction.  See Rowland , 121 F.4th at 1246 \n(10th Cir. 2024).  If there are other claims Hancock is att empting to bring, her failu re to exhaust could also \nprove fatal to her claims.   See, e.g. , Lincoln , 900 F.3d at 1185-86 (10th Cir. 2018).  The Court declines to \nrecommend dismissal on this basis because it is unclea r what claims Plaintiff is attempting to assert.  \nHowever, the Court notes that Hancock’s failure to ex haust any administrative remedies likely presents \nproblems if she wants to maintain a claim against the United States.  Case 6:25-cv-01045-JWB     Document 8     Filed 04/29/25     Page 5 of 76 \n B. Statute of Limitations has Expired \nThe Court also has concerns regarding the statu te of limitations.  Assuming that Plaintiff is \nattempting to bring a § 1983 claim, the statute of  limitations is determined by the relevant state \nstatute of limitations and tolling principles.  See Hardin v. Straub , 490 U.S. 536, 539 (1989).  “The \nforum state’s statute of limitations for personal injury actions governs civil rights claims under both 42 U.S.C. § 1981 and § 1983.  In Kansas, that is  the two-year statute of limitations in K.S.A. § 60-\n513(a).”  Brown v. Unified School Dist. 501, Topeka Public Schools , 465 F .3d 1184, 1188 (10th Cir. 2006) \n(citations omitted).  While state law governs the le ngth of the limitations period and tolling issues, \n“the accrual date of a § 1983 cause of action is a question of federal law.”  Wallace v. Kato , 549 U.S. \n384, 388 (2007).  Under federal law, the claim accrues “when the plaintiff has ‘a complete and \npresent cause of action.’”  Id. at 388.  In other words, “[a] § 1983 action ‘accrues when facts that \nwould support a cause of action ar e or should be apparent.’”  Fogle v. Pierson , 435 F.3d 1252, 1258 \n(10th Cir. 2006).  The Court may determine that pr oposed amendments are futile if it is clear from \nthe allegations that the action is barred by the statute of limitations.  See Fogle , 435 F.3d at 11 1258-\n59. \nHere, it is unclear when the statute exactly began to run, but the complained of conduct \noccurred more than 50-years ago.  Her complaint st ates that she was held by Crest Security in 1973 \nbut gives no other details other than to say it was pa rt of an “AI program.”  In Plaintiff’s motion for \nappointment of counsel, she indicates that she ha s been contacting attorn eys since at least 2018 \nwhich shows that she was on notice of the claims in  this suit and capable of advancing a lawsuit.  See \nDoc. 4.  At minimum, 6 years have passed since she was contacting attorneys regarding the underlying suit.  More than 50-years since the comp lained of conduct.  This is significantly more \ntime than any applicable statute of limitations.  Accordingly, the Court also recommends  dismissal \nbecause the statute of limitations has run. Case 6:25-cv-01045-JWB     Document 8     Filed 04/29/25     Page 6 of 77 \n IV. Conclusion \nFor the reasons explained above, the Magistrate Judge recommends  that the District Judge \ndismiss  Plaintiff's complaint under 28 U.S.C. § 1915 (e)(2)(B)(ii) because Plaintiff's complaint does \nnot state a claim upon which relief may be gran ted and the statute of limitations has run . \nIT IS THEREFORE RECOMMENDED  to the District Court that Plaintiff’s complaint \n(Doc. 1) be DISMISSED  for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. \nIT IS ORDERED  that a copy of the recommendation shall be sent to Plaintiff via certified \nmail.  Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1), Fed R. Civ. P. 72, and D. Kan. Rule 72.1.4, Plaintiff shall \nhave fourteen (14) days after service of a copy of these proposed findings and recommendations to \nserve and file with the U.S. District Judge assigned to the case, any written objections to the findings \nof fact, conclusions of law, or recommendations of the undersigned Magistrate Judge.  Plaintiff’s \nfailure to file such written, specific objections with in the 14-day period will bar appellate review of \nthe proposed findings of fact, conclusions of law, and the recommended disposition.  See Moore v. \nUnited States , 950 F.2d 656 (10th Cir. 1991). \nIT IS SO RECOMMENDED. Dated April 29, 2025, at Wichita, Kansas. \n \n/s/\n BROOKS SEVERSON   \nBrooks G.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: The court dismissed William Lorenzo Coleman's § 1983 complaint against the City and Borough of Juneau, along with individual defendants, including police officers, for failing to meet the necessary pleading requirements. Coleman, representing himself, alleged violations of his constitutional rights stemming from an unlawful arrest and events that transpired in September 2020, but did not effectively articulate these claims or establish connections between the defendants' actions and the alleged violations. No AI, ML, or automated systems are referenced in this case.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the plaintiff’s complaint adequately states a claim under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 by sufficiently alleging facts that demonstrate a violation of constitutional rights by defendants acting under the color of state law.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court held that Coleman's complaint failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted because it lacked necessary detail, logical structure, and clarity. The court dismissed the complaint without prejudice, granting Coleman leave to amend his complaint to address the deficiencies.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine you're trying to tell a story about why someone did something wrong to you, but your story is super messy and hard to follow. You also don't explain clearly who did what or why it's a problem. The judge told Coleman that his story (complaint) about how the police and the city wronged him wasn't clear enough and gave him a chance to rewrite it in a clearer, more organized way.",

Procedural History \nOn April 11, 2023, William Lorenzo Coleman, a self-represented prisoner \n(hereinafter “Plaintiff”), filed a Prisoner’s Complaint under the Civil Rights Act, 42 \nU.S.C. § 1983 (hereinafter “Complaint”), a Civil Cover Sheet, a Prisoner’s Application \nto Waive Prepayment of the Filing Fee, an Unissued Summons, a General Affidavit, \nand a Certification/Proof of Service.2  Subsequently, Plaintiff filed Exhibit A, a copy \n \n1 See Local Rule 7.5.  \n2 Docs. 1-6. \nCase 1:23-cv-00002-SLG-KFR   Document 10   Filed 08/25/23   Page 1 of 351 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n Screening Order  \nColeman v.

In this screening, a court shall dismiss the case \nat any time if the court determines that the action:  \n(i) is frivolous or malicious; \n(ii) fails to state a claim on which relief may be granted; or \n(iii) seeks monetary relief against a defendant who is immune from such \nrelief.4 \nTo determine whether a complaint states a valid claim for relief, courts \nconsider whether the complaint contains sufficient factual matter that, if accepted \nas true, “state[s] a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.”5  In conducting its \nreview, a court must liberally construe a self-represented plaintiff’s pleading and \ngive the plaintiff the benefit of the doubt.6   \n \n3 Doc. 8.   Exhibit A documents a Misdemeanor Criminal Complaint related to Plaintiff’s \nComplaint. Plaintiff states his charges were dismissed on July 15, 2021; however, the Docket \navailable to the Court suggests his charges were dismissed June 1, 2021.  The Court also \nnotes that Plaintiff had a non-criminal case involving a “Pedestrian Signal Infraction,” which \nappears related to Plaintiff’s Complaint.

Complaint  \nPlaintiff’s Complaint alleges that Defendants, the City and Borough of Juneau \n(“Juneau”), Juneau Police Officer Tyler Reid, and John Does 1-10, violated his rights \nunder 42 U.S.C. § 1983, as well as his First, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, Eighth, and \nFourteenth Amendment rights under the United States Constitution.9 Plaintiff \nseparates his Complaint into four claims which stem from what he alleges was a \n“vindictive prosecution and battery that occurred with an unlawful arrest on \nSeptember 25, 2020 in the City and Borough of Juneau Alaska.”10  Plaintiff alleges \nthat Defendant Reid unlawfully restrained and detained Plaintiff against his will, \nplanted and fabricated evidence, retaliated against him, and engaged in unlawful \ndiscrimination by refusing to render medical assistance to him.11 Plaintiff identifies \nhimself as an African American.12 \nPlaintiff identifies Defendant Juneau as a government entity and a municipal \ncorporation that is responsible for the Juneau Police Department (“JPD”).

Claim One is made against \nall defendants and alleges that Defendant Reid subjected Plaintiff to excessive force \nand violated his Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable search and \nseizure. Specifically, Plaintiff asserts that Defendant Reid stopped and frisked him \nwithout legal justification, and planted incriminating evidence on Plaintiff.22  \nPlaintiff also appears to assert Defendant Reid invaded his right to privacy as well.23 \nWithout greater explanation, Plaintiff merely states that Defendant Reid “knew or \nshould have known his actions were violative of rights guaranteed to the plaintiff \nbeing in a protect[ed] class group as an African American.”24 Plaintiff further claims \nthat Defendants acted in both their individual and official capacities in violating \nPlaintiff’s rights.25 \n In Claim Two, Plaintiff alleges that Defendant Juneau violated Plaintiff’s \nFourth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendment rights by failing “to train, supervise, and \ndiscipline police officers from committing the unwarranted batteries and using \nexcessive force, or allowing such activities, against civilian[] citizens such as \nplaintiff.”26 Plaintiff concedes that “the actions of Defendants were done under state \nlaw.”27 \n Plaintiff asserts a claim of battery under Alaska law against all Defendants for \nClaim Three.28 Plaintiff faults Defendants for placing him in a court holding cell \n \n21 Id.  \n22 Id. at 10.  \n23 Id.  \n24 Id.  \n25 Id. at 11.

After Claim Three, but before Claim Four, Plaintiff includes a section called \n“Newly Discovered Impeachment Evidence of the State Witness [Defendant] Reid.”  Plaintiff \nmaintains that Defendant Juneau fired Defendant Reid and “placed him under police \nprotection based on the wrongful death complaint of Mr. [] Spring …. Stemming from an \nincident that occurred on or about September 26, 2020.”  Doc. 1 at 16.  Plaintiff also asserts \n“Defendants are liable to the Estate of Cody Eyre for common law torts under Alaska law, \nincluding ass[a]ult and battery.”  Id.  The Court is unclear who these parties are and their \nrelationship to Plaintiff’s allegations.  Plaintiff does references in this portion of his \nComplaint a policy, practice and custom by Defendants of failing “to investigate, discipline, \nreprimand or instruct their officers in any way”  and claims “Defendant Officers’ actions \nwere a direct and proximate cause of the injuries suffered by the plaintiff.”  Id.   The Court \nassumes that Plaintiff included the information about Mr. Spring and the Estate of Eyre to \ndemonstrate that Defendant Reid has a pattern of “malicious and unconstitutional” \nbehavior.    \n31 Id. at 17.  \n32 Id.  \n33 Id. at 9.  \nCase 1:23-cv-00002-SLG-KFR   Document 10   Filed 08/25/23   Page 6 of 351 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n Screening Order  \nColeman v.

Civil Rights Claims Under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 \nSection 1983 is a federal statute that “is not itself a source of substantive \nrights,” but provides “a method for vindicating rights [found] elsewhere.”34  \nConstitutional rights are those conferred by the United States Constitution to \nindividual citizens.  Section 1983 can be used as a mechanism for enforcing the rights \nguaranteed by a particular federal statute only if (1) the statute creates enforceable \nrights and (2) Congress has not foreclosed the possibility of a § 1983 remedy for \nviolations of the statute in question.35  Section 1983 does not provide a cause of \naction for violations of state law.36  In order to plead a proper § 1983 claim, a plaintiff \nmust allege plausible facts that if proven would establish each of the required \nelements of:  “(1) a violation of rights protected by the Constitution or created by \nfederal statute, (2) proximately caused (3) by conduct of a ‘person’ (4) acting under \ncolor of state law.”37   \nSection 1983 also requires that a defendant must be “acting under the color of \nstate law.”38  The question of whether a person who has allegedly caused a \nconstitutional injury was acting under the color of state law is a factual \ndetermination.39  A defendant has acted under color of state law where he or she has \n“exercised power ‘possessed by the virtue of state law and made possible only \nbecause the wrongdoer is clothed with the authority of state law.’”40   \n \n34 Graham v. Connor , 490 U.S. 386, 393-94 (1989) (quoting  Baker v. McCollan , 443 U.S. 137, \n144 n.3 (1979)). \n35 Blessing v. Freestone , 520 U.S. 329, 340-41 (1997); Dittman v.

City and Borough of Juneau, et al.  \n1:23-cv-00002-SLG-KFR  8  \n This essential element of the statute limits who may be a proper defendant \nunder § 1983.  For instance, private citizens, state governmental agencies, and states \nare generally not proper defendants in a § 1983 action.41 States have sovereign \nimmunity due to the Eleventh Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which makes \nthem immune from suit unless that immunity is waived.42 “States or governmental \nentities that are considered ‘arms of the State’ for Eleventh Amendment purposes \nare not ‘persons’ under § 1983.”43   \nIV. Pleading Requirements for Causes of Action Raised by Plaintiff  \nPlaintiff does not meet the basic pleading requirements to sufficiently state a \nclaim under § 1983, therefore the Court dismisses Plaintiff’s Complaint.  However, \nthe Court grants Plaintiff leave to amend to bring his complaint into compliance with \nthe applicable law and rules. The Court also provides guidance for claims made \nunder § 1983 and specifically for any First, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth \nAmendment claims that Plaintiff may be attempting to allege.44  \na. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8 \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 8 directs that a complaint shall include “a short \nand plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief[.]”  \nPlaintiff’s Complaint fails to meet this basic standard.   Plaintiff’s allegations are \nnon-linear and rambling, include irrelevant narrative, are conclusory, and leave the \nCourt with either no way of determining who Plaintiff is attempting to sue, or how \n \n41 See 42 U.S.C. § 1983; Flint v. Dennison ,488 F.3d 816, 824-25 (9th Cir. 2007); Hale v. \nArizona, 993 F.2d 1387, 1398 (9th Cir. 1993) (en banc).  \n42 In re New York , 256 U.S. 490, 497 (1921) (holding federal courts may not hear suits against \na state brought by their own citizens, “because of the fundamental rule of which the \n[Eleventh] Amendment is but an exemplification.”); see also Hans v. Louisiana , 134 U.S. 1, \n15 (1890). \n43 Doe v. Lawrence Livermore Nat’l Lab ., 131 F.3d 836, 839 (9th Cir. 1997); quoting Will v. \nMich. Dep’t of State Police , 491 U.S. 58, 70 (1989)). \n44 The Court is not providing guidance on potential Eighth Amendment claims.  It appears \nas if Plaintiff was a pre-trial detainee at the time of the events in his Complaint.  Accordingly, \nthe Fourteenth Amendment applies, not the Eighth Amendment, which may be raised only \nby convicted criminals. \nCase 1:23-cv-00002-SLG-KFR   Document 10   Filed 08/25/23   Page 8 of 351 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n Screening Order  \nColeman v. City and Borough of Juneau, et al.  \n1:23-cv-00002-SLG-KFR  9  \n any individuals Plaintiff does identify violated his constitutional rights.  As a result, \nthe Court orders dismissal of Plaintiff’s Complaint with leave to amend.  \nRather than identifying each claim clearly and separately and stating the \nunderlying facts that support each claim, Plaintiff’s Complaint lists statutes and \nConstitutional Amendments at the beginning of his Complaint and then proceeds \nwith 20 pages of occasionally repetitive narrative and conclusory allegations.45  For \nexample, Plaintiff states generally that Defendants violated his First, Fifth and Sixth \nAmendment rights.46   However, in none of the specific claims made by Plaintiff is \nthere mention of any such violations or conduct that could reasonably be interpreted \nto include such violations.  In addition, as detailed below, Plaintiff names unknown \ndefendants in his complaint, but fails to provide any information describing what \nthose unknown defendants did.  Plaintiff’s Complaint also alleges dates that are \ninconsistent or contrary to the public record and speaks on at least two occasions of \n“Artificial Intelligence” relating to his right hand.47 \nFinally, Plaintiff’s Complaint makes multiple inconsistent demands for \ndamages.  In his general claims Plaintiff seeks $50,000 to $250,000 in compensatory \ndamages, and the same amount in punitive damages.48  However, after specific \nClaims One and Two, Plaintiff request those amounts for each violation, and \nincreases the punitive request for Claim Two to $1,000,000.49  Claims Three and \nFour are similarly inconsistent with Plaintiff’s original request, as his Prayer for \nRelief, which seeks compensatory damages “in excess of $100,000” and punitive \ndamages in an amount “to be proven at trial.”50       \n \n45 See Pettit v. State of New Mexico , 375 F. Supp. 2d 1140, 1150 (D. N.M. 2004) (listing dozens \nof statutes is insufficient to state a claim). \n46 Doc. 1 at 4. \n47 Id. at 4, 9.

Defendants \nAs detailed in his Complaint, Plaintiff alleges acts against him and identifies \n12 potential defendants.  However, Plaintiff does not sufficiently articulate the \nconnection between those defendants and the harms he claims to have suffered. \nRather, Plaintiff’s Complaint, as best the Court can understand it, fails to provide the \nnecessary detail required for claims under § 1983 to connect the defendants accused \nwith the harms alleged and relief requested.54 \ni. The City and Borough of Juneau  \nPlaintiff lists The City and Borough of Juneau as a defendant.  A local \ngovernmental entity, such as a city or county, may be a proper defendant in a § 1983 \naction.55  However, a local government entity is not liable under § 1983 simply \nbecause its employees violated the plaintiff's constitutional rights.56   \n \n51 McHenry v.

City and Borough of Juneau, et al.  \n1:23-cv-00002-SLG-KFR  11  \n To prevail on a § 1983 claim against a city or county, a plaintiff must show \nboth a deprivation of a constitutional right and a departmental policy, custom or \npractice that was the “moving force” behind the constitutional violation.57  To \nimpose § 1983 liability on a municipality, a plaintiff must premise their claim on one \nof three distinct theories: “(1) that a [municipal] employee was acting pursuant to \nan expressly adopted official policy; (2) that a [municipal] employee was acting \npursuant to a longstanding practice or custom; or (3) that a [municipal] employee \nwas acting as a ‘final policymaker.’”58  Proof of a single incident of unconstitutional \nactivity, or even a series of “isolated or sporadic incidents,” is insufficient to impose \nliability under § 1983.59  Rather, liability must be “founded upon practices of \nsufficient duration, frequency and consistency that the conduct has become a \ntraditional method of carrying out policy.”60   \nAs currently pled, Plaintiff fails to identify and describe the policy that he \nclaims a municipal employee violated. Instead, Plaintiff makes naked assertions that \nDefendant Reid and other unknown John Doe defendants acted pursuant to “normal \npractice and procedure,” and that Defendant Juneau failed to train, supervise, and \ndiscipline police officers.61  Such naked assertions do not make Defendant Juneau a \nproper defendant in this case. \nPlaintiff’s Complaint may be asserting either the existence of a policy of \ninadequate training or supervision or the existence of a custom of tolerance or \n \n57 Villegas v.

To the \nextent that Plaintiff includes this information to establish a pattern of conduct by \nDefendant Reid or a custom and practice within the City and Borough of Juneau, \nPlaintiff must allege facts that Defendant Reid acted pursuant to either (1) an \nexpressly adopted official policy, or (2) a longstanding practice or custom. Plaintiff \nmust articulate specifically what that policy or custom is and how Defendant Reid’s \nactions constitute sufficient duration, frequency and consistency such that the \nconduct has become a traditional method of carrying out policy”63 as opposed to a \nsingle incident of unconstitutional activity, or even a series of “isolated or sporadic \nincidents,” which are insufficient to impose liability under § 1983.64   \nPlaintiff does not do that in his Complaint. Instead, Plaintiff merely takes issue \nwith how an officer or officers acted during his arrest without specifying any specific \npolicy or custom of training that was inadequate.

The Court is unable to \ndiscern who the “John Does” are that Plaintiff is seeking to sue.

Accordingly, \nthe claims against “John Does 1-10” are deficient and are dismissed. However, the \nCourt grants Plaintiff leave to amend his Complaint as to these “John Does” with \nspecificity. \niii. Juneau Police Officer Reid \nGenerally, police officers are considered state actors for purposes of § 1983. \nPlaintiff broadly faults Defendants, including Defendant Reid for violating his rights \nunder 42 U.S.C. § 1983, as well as his First, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, Eighth, and \nFourteenth Amendment rights under the United States Constitution.71 To the best of \nthe Court’s interpretation, Plaintiff faults Defendant Reid in a variety of claims \nstemming from a “vindictive prosecution and battery that occurred with an unlawful \narrest on September 25, 2020 in the City and Borough of Juneau Alaska.”72  In \naddition, Plaintiff alleges Defendant Reid planted fabricated evidence and refused \nhim medical assistance in a retaliatory and discriminatory manner.73 \nWhile Plaintiff raises many different claims against Defendant Reid, he does \nnot meet the required elements for those claims. Each claim has different pleading \nrequirements.  The Court attempts below to identify each of the deficiencies in \nPlaintiff’s Complaint as they relate to Defendant Reid.  \nAdditionally, Plaintiff must more clearly indicate whether he wishes to sue \nDefendant Reid in his individual or official capacity and seek the corresponding form \nof relief.  In a § 1983 action, a defendant may be sued in either an individual or an \nofficial capacity.  For a defendant to be individually liable under § 1983, that \n \n71 Doc. 1 at 4.  \n72 Id. at 2.  \n73 Id. \nCase 1:23-cv-00002-SLG-KFR   Document 10   Filed 08/25/23   Page 14 of 351 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n Screening Order  \nColeman v. City and Borough of Juneau, et al.  \n1:23-cv-00002-SLG-KFR  15  \n defendant must personally participate in an alleged rights deprivation.74  “In a \n§ 1983 action, the plaintiff must also demonstrate that the defendant’s conduct was \nthe actionable cause of the claimed injury.”75  A defendant sued in their individual \ncapacity may be held liable for money damages.76    \nAlternatively, in a § 1983 action, a plaintiff may sue a defendant in an official \ncapacity as an alternate way of pleading a claim against the governmental entity for \nwhich that individual is an officer or employee.77  A plaintiff suing a defendant in \ntheir official capacity is not required to allege the “named official’s personal \ninvolvement in the acts or omissions constituting the alleged constitutional \nviolation.”78  Instead, a plaintiff must only (1) “identify the law or policy challenged” \nand (2) “name the official within the entity who can appropriately respond to \ninjunctive relief.”79  However, a defendant sued in their official capacity may not be \nsued for damages, only for injunctive relief.80 \nIt should be noted that some of Plaintiff’s claims against Defendant Reid \nappear to be outside the applicable statute of limitations.  Section 1983 does not \ncontain its own statute of limitations. Rather, federal courts “apply the forum state’s \nstatute of limitations for personal injury actions, ... except to the extent any of these \nlaws is inconsistent with federal law.”81  In Alaska, the statute of limitations for a \ntort action against a peace officer is two years.82 \nHowever, the statute of limitations can be tolled while claims challenging an \nunconstitutional conviction or sentence are challenged in state court.

City and Borough of Juneau, et al.  \n1:23-cv-00002-SLG-KFR  16  \n opens two main avenues to relief on complaints related to imprisonment:  a petition \nfor habeas corpus and a civil rights complaint.83 Claims challenging “the fact or \nduration of the conviction or sentence” are within the core of habeas, while claims \nchallenging “any other aspect of prison life” are properly brought as civil rights \nactions.84 “[H]abeas is the exclusive vehicle for claims brought by state prisoners \nthat fall within the core of habeas corpus, and such claims may not be brought in a \n§ 1983 [civil rights] action.”85  \nIn Heck v. Humphrey , the Supreme Court held that “in order to recover \ndamages for [an] allegedly unconstitutional conviction or imprisonment, or for \nother harm caused by actions whose unlawfulness would render a conviction or \nsentence invalid, a § 1983 plaintiff must prove that the conviction or sentence has \nbeen reversed on direct appeal, expunged by executive order, declared invalid by a \nstate tribunal authorized to make such determination, or called into question by a \nfederal court's issuance of a writ of habeas corpus, 28 U.S.C. § 2254.”86  “A claim for \ndamages bearing that relationship to a conviction or sentence that has not been ... \ninvalidated is not cognizable under § 1983.”87  “Thus, when a state prisoner seeks \ndamages in a § 1983 suit, the district court must consider whether a judgment in \nfavor of the plaintiff would necessarily imply the invalidity of his conviction or \nsentence; if it would, the complaint must be dismissed unless the plaintiff can \ndemonstrate that the conviction or sentence has already been invalidated.”88 \nIn Roberts v. City of Fairbanks ,  the Ninth Circuit, pointing to the Supreme \nCourt's holding in Heck, held that “a § 1983 action challenging a conviction or \nsentence does not ‘exist[ ]’ until the conviction or sentence is \n \n83 See Muhammad v.

Plaintiff did not file the present Complaint until April 11, 2023, more than two \nand half years later.  Any claims by Plaintiff regarding his short detention in jail, and \nany other claims that would not necessarily have invalidated his pending charges  \nshould have been brought within the two-year statute of limitations and are now \ntime barred.   \nHowever, Plaintiff’s claims regarding unconstitutional seizure, wrongful \narrest, and vindictive prosecution could not have been brought under § 1983 while \nhis criminal case was pending.91  Therefore, the stature of limitations was tolled as \nto those claims and did not start running until his charges were dismissed on June 1, \n2021.92   Accordingly, because Plaintiff filed this action on April 11, 2023,  his claims \nthat could have invalidated his charges do not appear to be time barred. \nc. First Amendment Claims \nNone of Plaintiff’s specific claims allege a violation of his First Amendment \nrights.  Nonetheless, Plaintiff does make a general claim of such a violation.  Viewing \nhis complaint liberally, Plaintiff may be asserting that that Defendant engaged in \nunlawful retaliation against him in violation of his First Amendment rights.  The \nCourt has identified in Plaintiff’s Complaint only two allegations in support of this \npossible claim. First, that Defendants refused to render medical assistance to him;93 \n \n89 Roberts v.

Discrimination \nTo prove discrimination in violation of § 1983 under the Fourteenth \nAmendment’s Equal Protection Clause, a plaintiff must demonstrate that the \nindividual  defendant acted with the intent to discriminate,154 and allege facts \nshowing how those defendants caused or personally participated in causing the \nharm alleged in the complaint.155  For such claims, proof of invidious discriminatory \npurpose is required for a claim of racial discrimination.156  \nLike Plaintiff’s First Amendment retaliation claim, Plaintiff offers sparce facts \nrelated to his discrimination claim. As the Court reads Plaintiff’s Complaint, he \nmakes three assertions.  First, Plaintiff alleges that Defendants profiled and harassed \nPlaintiff “on a number of occasions over a period of time stemming to the present.”157 \nSecond, Plaintiff states that Defendants refused to render medical assistance to him \nas a form of discrimination.158 Finally, Plaintiff alleges that Defendants knowingly, \nwillingly, and intentionally covered up a pedestrian car accident in a road \nconstruction zone as a form of discrimination, thereby causing Plaintiff’s soft tissue \nright knee injury.159 \nPlaintiff’s Complaint in its current form is insufficient.  This is so because \nPlaintiff’s Complaint merely offers “naked assertions [about his discriminatory \ntreatment that are] devoid of further factual enhancement.”160  Plaintiff must plead \nfacts supporting the required elements and indicate what type of discrimination he \nfaced to sufficiently plead his Fourteenth Amendment Equal Protection \n \n154 Daniels v.

Supplemental Jurisdiction and State Law Claims \nIn his Third and Fourth Claims, Plaintiff raises claims under Alaska State Law. \nSpecifically, in Claim Three, Plaintiff raises a battery claim against all Defendants \nstemming from his underlying criminal charges. Plaintiff claims that Defendants \nacted “violently, forcefully and without consent by placing plaintiff in a Court \nholding cell” with a pre-existing soft-tissue injury without providing medical \nattention first after a pedestrian-car accident.161 Battery claims are not found in the \nConstitution, nor as federal statutory rights. Instead, these claims are tort claims \nground in state law and most typically addressed in Alaska state court. \nSimilarly, Plaintiff’s Fourth Claim of Intentional Infliction of Emotional \nDistress against all Defendants is also ground in state law and most typically \naddressed in Alaska state court. Plaintiff claims he feared for his life after “being \nhandcuffed in the back seat of a police car with no identifiable voice” on September \n25, 2020.162  Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress claims are not found in the \nConstitution, nor as federal statutory rights.  Although AS 09.10.070(a) does not \nexplicitly include claims for intentional infliction of emotional distress, it includes \n“libel, slander, assault, battery, ... personal injury,” and other torts like intentional \ninfliction of emotional distress. \nIn civil actions in which federal district courts have original jurisdiction, “the \ndistrict courts shall have supplemental jurisdiction over all other claims that are so \nrelated to claims in the action within such original jurisdiction that they form part \nof the same case or controversy.”163 But a district court may decline to exercise \nsupplemental jurisdiction over a claim if “the district court has dismissed all claims \n \n161 Id. at 14.   \n162 Id. at 17.  \n163 28 U.S.C. § 1367(a). \nCase 1:23-cv-00002-SLG-KFR   Document 10   Filed 08/25/23   Page 32 of 351 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n Screening Order  \nColeman v.

Plaintiff’s Complaint fails to sufficiently \narticulate the necessary facts for the Court to conclude that there is a claim against \nthe named defendants upon which relief can be granted.  Therefore, Plaintiff’s \nComplaint is DIMISSED .  However, the Court grants leave to amend consistent with \nthe guidance contained in this order.165 \nIT IS THEREFORE ORDERED:  \n1. The Complaint at Docket 1 is DISMISSED WITH LEAVE TO AMEND  for \nfailing to state a claim upon which relief may be granted.   \n2. The Prisoner’s Application to Waive Prepayment of the Filing Fee at Docket \n3 is DENIED .  Plaintiff does not appear to be a prisoner. Plaintiff must file \na non-prisoner application via the attached form if he chooses to amend \nhis Complaint.  \n3. Plaintiff has until October 24, 2023, to file one of the following: \na.

As discussed above, an amended \ncomplaint will replace the prior complaint in its entirety.167  Plaintiff must \ninclude all of the claims he seeks to bring in an amended complaint.  Any \nclaims not included in the amended complaint will be considered waived.  \n5. If Plaintiff does not file either an Amended Complaint or Notice of \nVoluntary Dismissal on the Court form by October 24, 2023,  this case could \nbe DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE under 28 U.S.C. § 1915(e)(2)(B).  A \ndismissal in this manner will count as a “strike” against Plaintiff under \n§ 1915(g).168  \n6. At all times, Plaintiff must keep the Court informed of any change of \naddress.  Such notice shall be titled “NOTICE OF CHANGE OF ADDRESS.”  \nThis notice must not include any requests for any other relief, and it must \nbe served on all Defendants or Defendant’s attorney who make an \nappearance in this case.

    "summary": "1. **Summary:** Thomas Goddard, residing in a property managed by SARES-REGIS GROUP, Inc., sued for various claims including disability and religious discrimination after repeatedly failing to pay rent. The court dismissed Goddard's lawsuit with prejudice due to his failure to oppose the motion to dismiss, after having been warned and given several extensions to respond. It was also noted that Goddard's amended complaints contained irrelevant and unsupported claims, potentially generated via AI, and failed to demonstrate any legal merit.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue:** The key legal issue was whether the defendants unlawfully discriminated against Goddard by not accommodating his disabilities and financial circumstances as per the Fair Housing Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act, among other claims.\n\n3. **Court’s Holding:** The court dismissed the case with prejudice due to Goddard's failure to respond to the defendants' motion to dismiss and because the claims lacked legal merit. The decision was based on Goddard's inability to show any viable cause of action against the defendants, coupled with irrelevant and excessive filings.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation:** Thomas Goddard took his landlords to court, claiming they didn't treat him fairly because of his disabilities and asked for unreasonable rent reductions. However, he didn't pay his rent and didn't respond to important court requests on time. The court found his demands and claims to be unfounded and legally useless, so they decided he couldn't try again with a new case. The judge even hinted that Goddard might have used a computer program to create some of his confusing and lengthy documents without adding any real support to his case.",

Dkt. \nNo. 38.  For the reasons discussed below, Defendant s’ Motion to Dismiss is GRANTED WITH \nPREJUDICE .  \n \nI. FACTUAL BACKGROUND  \nPlaintiff currently resides at 1910 N. Main St, Unit 627, Walnut  Creek, CA 94596  in an \napartment owned by Defendant APARTMENTS CAPITAL LLC, A D  and managed by Defendant \nSARES REGIS GROUP RESIDENTIAL, INC.   In early March  of 2025, Plaintiff requested extra \ntime for his rental payment grace period as a disability accommodation.  Dkt. No. 24 -1 at 7.  On \nMarch 13, Defendants granted this accommodation, allowing Plaintiff to pay rent by the seventh \nof the month without being charged a late fee or pay -or-quit notice.   Id.  Defendants noted that if \nrent was not pa id by the seventh of the month, the late fee would be applied and a 3-day notice \nserved.  Id.  Shortly after being granted this accommodation, Plaintiff failed to pay rent within the \nextended grace period.  Dkt. No. 24 at 3.  After Plaintiff continued to fail to pay rent, Defendant \nserved him with a pay -or-quit notice on July 10.  Id.  The same day, Plaintiff requested a new \naccommodation: that Defendant reduce his monthly rent from $2,850 to $400.  Id. at 4.

PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND  \nOn July 14, Plaintiff filed the instant suit, seeking an ex parte temporary restraining order \nagainst his eviction.  Dkt. Nos. 1 -2.  After a hearing, the Court granted the TRO in limited part, \nrestraining Defendants from initiating an unlawful detainer action against Plaintiff for 28 days, and \nset a preliminary injunction hearing.  Dkt. No. 21.  After hearing the parties’ oral argum ent, the \nCourt denied Plaintiff’s motion for preliminary injunction because Plaintiff had not shown \nlikelihood of irreparable h arm, Plaintiff had not shown the balance of hardships tipped sharply in \nhis favor, and Plaintiff had not shown a likelihood of success on the merits.  Dkt. No. 29.   \nPlaintiff filed a motion for reconsideration, which the Court denied.  Dkt.  No. 33.  On September \n3, 2025, Plaintiff filed a FAC  stating the following causes of action: 1) Fair Housing Act – \ndisability discrimination; 2) Fair Housing Act – religious discrimination;  3) Fair Housing Act – \nRetaliation; 4) Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA), T itle II ; 5)  Rehabilitation Act – Section \n504; 6) Conspiracy to Interfere with Civil Rights; 7) Negligent  Infliction of Emotional Distress; 8) \nIntentional Infliction of Emotional Distress; 9) Fair Housing  Act – Breach of Agreed Reasonable \nAccommodation; 10) Discrimination.   Dkt. No. 3 6.  \nOn September 18, Defendants filed the instant Motion to Dismiss.  Plaintiff’s deadline to \nfile a response to the Motion to Dismiss was October 2, 2025.  Dkt. No. 38 .  Plaintiff failed to file \na response to the Motion to Dismiss by October 2, and did not seek any extension of time or \notherwise provide an explanation for this failure to respond, although on October 6 Plaintiff \nrequested leave to file a Second Amended Co mplaint.  Dkt. No. 45.  On October 8, Defendants \nfiled a Notice of Plaintiff’s Non -Oppositi on to the Motion to Dismiss.  Dkt. No. 4 7.   \nOn October 10, the Court denied Plaintiff’s motion for leave to amend.  Dkt. No. 49.  Due \nto Plaintiff’s pro se status, the Court granted Plaintiff a sua sponte extension to respond to the \nMotion to Dismiss until October 16, two weeks after the response wa s originally due.  Id.  The \nCourt warned Plaintiff that if Plaintiff failed to file a response to Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss, \nthe Court would grant the motion as unopposed.  Id.  Plaintiff did not file a response by October Case 3:25-cv-05882-EMC     Document 57     Filed 10/21/25     Page 2 of 6 \n3 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  16, and as of the entry of this Order, has still not filed a response.  \nPlaintiff has made other filings , however .  In violation of  the Court’s October 10 Order \nthat, due to Plaintiff’s unprompted and voluminous filings, Plaintiff must seek leave of Court \nbefore making further filings (other than the late motion to dismiss response) Plaintiff has \ncontinued in this conduct, making f ive additional filings with a combined page -count of over 700 \npages  over the span of ten days .  Dkt. Nos. 50, 51 , 53, 54 , 56.  On October 14, Plaintiff also failed \nto appear at the scheduled 1:30 pm Case Management Conference  hearing .  Instead of appearing, \nPlaintiff filed a same -day motion for an “emergency hearing” for 3:30 pm that afternoon, in \nviolation of Local Rule  7-2(a).  Dkt. No. 53.  \nOn October 20, Defendant filed a notice noting Plaintiff’s continued failure to oppose its \nmotion, despite the Court’s October 16 deadline.  Dkt. No. 56.  Less than an hour later, Plaintiff \nfiled a 192 -page “Emergency Response to Defendants’ Notice of Non -Opposition,” in which he \nargued that his Motion for Leave to File Second Amended Complaint and proposed Second \nAmended Complaint constituted his opposition.  Dkt. No. 56.  \n \nIII. DISCUSSION  \nA motion may be granted when a party fails to oppose it.  Local Rule 7 -3(a-b); Rider v. \nJPMorgan Chase Bank N.A. , No. 20 -CV-06888 -LHK, 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12486, at *4 (N.D. \nCal. Jan. 22, 2021) (“[A]  district court may properly grant a motion for failure to file an \nopposition. ”; accord, e.g. , Gwaduri v. INS , 362 F.3d 1144, 1146 -47, n.3 (9th Cir. 2004) (holding \nthat it “is beyond question ” that courts may grant unopposed motions) .  Plaintiff has not filed an \nopposition despite multiple warnings from Defendants and this Court.  To the extent that Plaintiff \nrelies on Rule 15, Rule 15 makes clear that a party may amend its pleadings “once as a matter of \ncourse” and in “all other cases” may amend only with leave of court or consent of the opposing \nparty.  Fed. R. Civ. Pr. 15(1) -(2).  Here, the Court denied Plainti ff leave to file a Second Amended \nComplaint.  Dkt. No. 49.  The Court grants the unopposed motion to dismiss.  \nBeyond Plaintiffs’ failure to oppose , the merits also support dismissal.  Plaintiffs’ 100 -\npage First Amended Complaint states ten causes of action under various federal civil rights laws, Case 3:25-cv-05882-EMC     Document 57     Filed 10/21/25     Page 3 of 6 \n4 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  including the Fair Housing Act and the Americans with Disability Act, alleging disability -based  \nand religious discrimination.  The FAC, like Plaintiff ’s other filings, devotes countless  pages to \nextraneous issues, including actions taken by non -parties  such as his former employer  and \n“statistical analysis.”   See e.g . Dkt. No. 36 at 3 (“A dditional evidence of systematic discrimination \nincludes the unprecedented mass  recusal of all thirty -nine Contra Costa Superior Court judges on \nJuly 24, 2025 (Ex. DD),  ongoing seizure of essential assistive technology devices preventing \ncompliance with  court -ordered treatment (Ex. EE), and cross -jurisdictional retaliation documented \nin federal  proceedings in New Jersey (Ex. FF) and employment discrimination proceedings in this  \nDistrict (Ex. GG). The mathematical probability of these coordinated events occurring  randomly is \nless than 10−36, equivalent to selecting a specific grain of sand from all beaches  on Earth. ”); id. at \n9 (“The mathematical precision of these events —termination exactly 365 days before  eviction \nproceedings on July 15, 2025 —demonstrates coordination exceeding random  probability. \nAnniversary timing analysis  yields a Z -score of 10.66 standard deviations  (p < 10−26), \nestablishing presumptive evidence of conspiracy under 42 U.S.C. § 1985(3). ”); id. at 15 (“The \nprobability of repossession occurring five days before anniversary of previous  vehicle theft is less \nthan 1 in 73 (p = 5/365 = 0.0137) ”); id. at 18 (“Following Plaintiff’s purchase of Israeli stickers on \nAmazon, systematic service  discrimination began across multiple platforms. ”).  The complaint \ndoes not comply with Rule 8’s requirement that a claim must be “short and plain.”  Fed. R. Civ. \nPro. 8(a)(2).  This alone is another ground for dismissal.  See e.g, McHenry v. Renne , 84 F.3d \n1172, 1174 (9th Cir. 1996) . \nThe core of Plaintiff’s complaint, as the Court understands it , is that Defendants  refused to \naccommodate Plaintiffs’ disability and medical issues.  Although Defendants granted Plaintiffs’ \nrequest for a grace period to pay rent until the seventh day of the month, Plaintiff claims in the \nFAC that Defendants violated this accommodation by serving a pay -or-quit notice.  The complaint \ndoes not address the undisputed fact that shortly after receiving this accommodation, Plaintiff \nfailed to pay rent and has not paid rent since.  See Dkt. No. 29 ( as of this  August, Plaintiff ’s \narrearage was over $7,000) .  The FAC also omits the fact, conceded by Plaintiff at his hearing for \npreliminary injunction, that the accommodation Defendants have failed to grant him is a rent Case 3:25-cv-05882-EMC     Document 57     Filed 10/21/25     Page 4 of 6 \n5 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  decrease from $ 2,850 to $400  until Plaintiff  receives money from his other pending lawsuits and \ndisability claims .  See id.   As the Court explained in its Order denying a preliminary injunction, a \ndenial of “meaningful access” to a program due to  a person’s inability to “satisfy a condition of \neligibility because of his financial circumstances” is  not a violation of the ADA.  See Weinreich v. \nLos Angeles Cnty. Metro. Transp. Auth. , 114 F.3d  976, 979 (9th Cir. 1997) ; Dkt. No. 29 .  Plaintiff \nalso argues that Defendants’ filing of a pay-or-quit notice was retaliation, but this notice followed \nPlaintiffs’ failure to pay rent for two months, a clear non-retaliatory basis.  Dkt. No. 29.  Finally, \nall of Plaintiffs’ claims of religious discrimination relate to actions by individuals that are \nunaffiliated with Defendants, including Plaintiff’s  former employer Slickdeals, other employees at \nSlickdeals, and his former girlfriend.  While Plaintiff claims his former girlfriend is affiliated with \nDefendants, the exhibits he points to do not support this .  See e.g., Dkt. No. 36 at 12 (citing \nExhibit Q at Dkt. No. 10 -1 at 212) ; see also  Dkt. No. 38 at 8. \nDefendants seek dismissal with prejudice.  A court may deny leave to amend after \nconsidering factors such as “bad faith, undue delay, prejudice to the opposing party, futility of the \namendment, and whether the party has previously amended his pleadings.”   Bonin v. Calderon , 59 \nF.3d 815, 845 (9th Cir.1995).   Here, the factors support dismissal with prejudice.  Plaintiff has \nalready amended his complaint in September with the benefit of the Court’s ruling denying his \npreliminary injunction.  Rather than providing new facts, the FAC  provided additional irrelevant \nincidents, argument, and statistics, and omitted  relevant facts that Plaintiff had already admitted to \nbefore the Court .  \nPlaintiff’s Motion for Leave to File a Second Amended Complaint further confirms that \namendment would be futile.  Plaintiff sought amendment to address “new developments” \nincluding (1) that Defendants served another pay -or-quit notice (2) that Defendants e xpressed \nwillingness to participate in settlement discussions (3) that the California Civil Rights Department \nresumed mediation proceedings in Plaintiffs’ separate case there (4) that Defendants filed a joint \ncase management statements providing their posi tions on discovery, trial, and settlement.  Dkt. \nNo. 49.  As the Court explained in its order denying leave to amend, the state of settlements \ndiscussions, the status of mediation in other proceedings, and Defendants’ “ positions on discovery, Case 3:25-cv-05882-EMC     Document 57     Filed 10/21/25     Page 5 of 6 \n6 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  trial, and settlement”  are not relevant to Plaintiff’s pleadings.  Id.  The Court found that \nDefendants’ service of an additional pay -or-quit notice would not alter Plaintiffs’ pleadings, since \nDefendants’ basis for serving the pay -or-quit remains Plaintiff’s failure to pay rent.  Id.  The SAC \nthat Plaintiff sought to file was over 150 -pages, heightening rather than curing Plaintiff’s Rule 8 \nproblem.  Plaintiff’s prior amendment and his proposed second amendment demonstrate that leave \nto amend is futile in this case.   Plaintiff’s case is legally meritless.  \nThe factors of bad faith and prejudice to the opposing party also strongly support dismissal \nwith prejudice.  As noted, Plaintiff’s filings in this action have been excessive, almost wholly \nirrelevant to the claims alleged, and have made factual statements unsupported or contradicted by \nthe attached exhibits.  Defendant s have already reviewed over a thousand pages of confused and \nlegally irrelevant filings for claims that the Court had found to lack merit even after amendment.  \nThere is no cause to require Defendant s to undergo further time and litigation expense, particularly \nas amendment would be futile.  \nFinally, the Court notes that Plaintiffs’ filing have contained repeated misrepresentations \nof Plaintiff’s prior statements  and actions , Defendants’ actions, and the Court’s own actions.  This \nmay stem from the fact that Plaintiffs’ filings have likely been generated in whole or in part \nthrough Generative Artificial Intelligence.  Given Plaintiff’s pro se and in forma pauperis status , \nthe Court will not issue a show cause order under Rule 11 at this time.  \nAccordingly, for all the reasons stated above, Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss is \nGRANTED  WITH PREJUDICE .  The Clerk of Court is directed to enter a final judgment.  \n \n \nIT IS SO ORDERED . \n \nDated:  October 2 1, 2025  \n \n______________________________________  \nEDWARD M.

The court reviews her complaint for sufficiency under 28 U.S.C. § 1915(e)(2)(B), particularly failing to establish federal jurisdiction, as she did not show that the defendants acted under color of state law as required for a 42 U.S.C. § 1983 claim.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether federal jurisdiction exists under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for Plaintiff's claims of constitutional violations when she alleges cybercrimes involving AI by parties she describes as government officials but subsequently refers to them as employees of a private company.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court finds that Erika Nicole Cofer has not established a basis for federal jurisdiction, as she did not adequately demonstrate that the defendants acted under color of state law or that any state actor requirement is fulfilled. The court orders her to show cause why the case should not be dismissed.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine your neighbor accuses their family and some big tech companies of using \"computer magic\" to spy on them during a child custody fight. They went to court without a lawyer to say this violates their privacy, but they didn't clearly show that these people were acting like \"officials\" when they did it. The court told them they could fix their paperwork—like clarifying who did what and why it matters—otherwise, the court can't really handle their case.",

INTRODUCTION  \nPlaintiff Erica Cofer , pro se, applied to proceed in forma pauperis  and the Court granted \nher application .  See Docket No. 7.  The Court now reviews the sufficiency of Plaintiff’s  \ncomplaint to determine whether it satisfies 28 U.S.C. §  1915(e)(2)(B).  Because the complaint \ndoes not appear to allege federal jurisdiction, Plaintiff is ORDERED TO SHOW CAUSE why the \ncomplaint should not be dismissed.   Plaintiff  may f ile either an amended complaint  or a response \nto this order addressing  why her complaint is sufficient, no later than December 10,  2025 .  The \nCase Management Conference set for December 3, 2025  is vacated.  \nII. ALLEGATIONS OF THE COMPLAINT1 \nThis case appears to be related to a custody dispute concerning Plaintiff’s son that was or \nis pending in state court. Plaintiff has named as defendants Brenda Gayle Martin (Plaintiff’s \nmother ), Edward Vergel Astorga, Sr. (the father of the child ), Adrian Leandre McDani els (Brenda \nMartin’s “step -nephew”) and his wife Sarah Elizabeth Lange McDaniels , SecurityBricks, Inc., \n \n1 Because the factual allegations of a plaintiff’s complaint are generally taken as true in the context \nof determining whether the complaint states a claim, this section summarizes Plaintiff’s  \nallegations as if true.  Nothing in this order should be construed as resolving any issue of fact that \nmight be disputed at a later stage of the case  Case 3:25-cv-07239-JCS     Document 9     Filed 11/11/25     Page 1 of 6 \n2 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  “Corp -Partner Google[,]” and Micr osoft.  Compl. at 1 -4. According to Plaintiff, the child custody \ndispute is “fabricated” and has “turned into a[n] inside cyberbullying scheme job , with artificial \nintelligence and aviation, which [makes] this case difficult to understand and it’s beyond the scope  \nof one’s intellect. ”  Id.  at 5-6.  Plaintiff  asserts federal jurisdiction based on alleged violation of \nher Fourth Amendment rights .  Id.  at 2. \nPlaintiff’s allegations related to the defendants’ “coercion, perjury and intentional false \nstatements” in the custody case are lengthy and detailed , as are the allegations related to \ndefendants’ alleged “cybersecurity attacks”  on her computer and cell phone.  The Court does not \nattempt to summarize these allegations but instead describes only the allegations that are relevant \nto the existence of federal jurisdiction.   \nPlaintiff alleges that her mother and Edward Vergel Astorga, Sr. “teamed up” to deprive \nher of custody of her son.  Id.  at 6.  Plaintiff alleges that when she told her mother that she was \ngoing to inform the judge in the state court case about her mother’s perjury in that case, her \nmother “orchestrated the McDaniels to destroy all of the digital evidence [and] put tainted \nevidence in [her] computer and [her] cel l phone systems, that appears to makes [her] appear to be \na pedophile.”  Id. Plaintiff further alleges that the “McDaniels deprived [her] of using [her] emails, \nblocked [her] from paying [her] bills” and she “now [ha s] bad credit.”  Id. Plaintiff alleges that she \nis ”constantly under surveillance with hacking and tracking”  and that she is being tracked “by \nairplane.”   Id.  at 7. \nPlaintiff alleges  that “[s]ince [she is]  being tracked by aviation this has given reason to \nbelieve the McDaniels couple who are government officials has fabricated and fraudulently given \nthe federal police officials a tainted false report against [her]  to intentionally get [her]  arrested, this \nalso gives [her] reason they are all jointly working together to build a fraudulent case against \n[her].” Id.  at 7-8.  Plaintiff later alleges that the McDaniels are employed by Defendant \nSecurityBrick, Inc. , where S arah McDaniels is a “Cybersecurity Strategic Advisor” and Adrian \nMcDaniels is a “Project Management GRC Analyst.”  Id.  at 20.   Plaintiff alleges that the \nMcDaniels attended a re straining order hearing  to listen to Plaintiff’s testimony and “destroy \nevidence pertaining to the fraud and fabrication of [her] child custody case[,]” and  destroyed Case 3:25-cv-07239-JCS     Document 9     Filed 11/11/25     Page 2 of 6 \n3 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  evidence in Plaintiff’s computer so that Brenda Martin could avoid prosecution .  Id.  at 19 -20.  \nAccording to Plaintiff, Brenda Martin also stated at the restraining order hearing that the \nMcDaniels were “helping her with phone call logs and other things related to evidence.”  Id. at 20. \nPlaintiff alleges that the McDaniels committed a cybercrime against her.  Id.  \nPlaintiff asserts three claims  in her complaint.  First, she asserts a claim under the Fourth \nand Fourteenth Amendments against Defendants Brenda Martin, Sara McDaniels and Adrian \nMcDaniels.  Id.at 21.  In this claim, Plaintiff alleges that Martin conspired with Sara and Adrian \nMcDaniels, “who are officials acting in a government capacity,” to deprive her of her right to \nprivacy under the Fourth Amendment by hacking into her electronic devices.  Id.  As part of this \nclaim, Plaintiff alleges that the McDanie ls defendants “abused their power while they [were] \nemployed as Cybersecurity Strategic Advisors and Project Management.”  Id.  at 22.  She also \nalleges in this claim that the McDaniels defendants acted “under color of law.”  Id. \nSecond, Plaintiff  asserts a claim for violation of her Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments \nagainst Microsoft Corporation and Google Corporation.  Id.  at 23.  According to Plaintiff, \nMicrosoft and Google “assisted the McDaniels” defendants with respect to their alleged \ncybercrimes against her.  Id. \nThird, Plaintiff asserts a claim for perjury and defamation against defendants Brenda \nMartin and Eward Astorga.  Id.  at 24.  \nIn her demand for relief, Plaintiff asks the Court for “civil liability under Sec. 1983 ” and \nboth monetary and injunctive relief.  \nIII. ANALYSIS  \nA. Legal Standards Under 28 U.S.C. § 1915 and Rule 12(b)(6)  \nWhere a plaintiff is found to be indigent under 28 U.S.C. § 1915(a)(1) and is granted leave \nto proceed in forma pauperis, courts must engage in screening and dismiss any claims which: \n(1) are frivolous or malicious; (2) fail to state a claim on which relie f may be granted; or (3) seek \nmonetary relief from a defendant who is immune from such relief.  28 U.S.C. § 1915(e)(2)(B); see \nMarks v. Solcum , 98 F.3d 494, 495 (9th Cir. 1996).   In addition, the Court must dismiss a \ncomplaint where no basis for federal j urisdiction is apparent from the allegations.  Cato v. United Case 3:25-cv-07239-JCS     Document 9     Filed 11/11/25     Page 3 of 6 \n4 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  States, 70 F.3d 1103, 1106 (9th Cir. 1995).    \nTo state a claim for relief, a plaintiff must make “a short and plain statement of the claim \nshowing that the pleader is entitled to relief.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2).   Further, a claim may be \ndismissed for “failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6);  \nsee also Diaz v. Int’l Longshore and Warehouse Union, Local  13, 474 F.3d 1202, 1205 (9th Cir. \n2007).  In determining whether a plaintiff fails to state a claim, the court takes “all allegations of \nmaterial fact in t he complaint as true and construe[s] them in the light most favorable to the non -\nmoving party.”  Cedars -Sinai Med. Ctr. v. Nat’l League of Postmasters of U.S ., 497 F.3d 972, 975 \n(9th Cir. 2007).  However, “the tenet that a court must accept a complaint’s allegations as true is \ninapplicable to legal conclusions [and] mere conclusory statements,” Ashcroft v. Iqbal , 556 U.S. \n662, 678 (2009) (citing Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly , 550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007)), and courts “do not \nnecessarily assume the truth of legal c onclusions merely because they are cast in the form of \nfactual allegations.” Coto Settlement v. Eisenberg , 593 F.3d 1031, 1034 (9th Cir. 2010) (internal \nquotation marks omitted).  The complaint need not contain “detailed factual allegations,” but must \nallege facts sufficient to “state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.”  Id. at 678 (citing \nTwombly , 550 U.S. at 570).  \nWhere the complaint has been filed by a pro se plaintiff, courts must “construe the \npleadings liberally . . . to afford the petitioner the benefit of any doubt.”  Hebbe v. Pliler , 627 F.3d \n338, 342 (9th Cir. 2010).  “A pro se litigant must be given leave to amend his or her complaint \nunless it is absolutely clear that the deficiencies in the complaint could not be cured by \namendment.”  Noll v. Carlson , 809 F.2d 1446, 1448 (9th Cir. 1987), superseded on other grounds \nby statute, as recognized in Lopez v. Smi th, 203 F.3d 1122 (9th Cir. 2000) (en banc).  Further, \nwhen it dismisses the complaint of a pro se litigant with leave to amend, “the district court must \nprovide the litigant with notice of the deficiencies in his complaint in order to ensure that the \nlitiga nt uses the opportunity to amend effectively.”  Id. (quoting Ferdik v. Bonzelet , 963 F.2d \n1258, 1261 (9th Cir. 1992)).  “Without the benefit of a statement of deficiencies, the pro se litigant \nwill likely repeat previous errors.”  Karim -Panahi v. L.A. Po lice Dep’t , 839 F.2d 621, 624 (9th \nCir. 1988) (quoting Noll v. Carlson , 809 F.2d 1446, 1448 (9th Cir. 1987)).  Case 3:25-cv-07239-JCS     Document 9     Filed 11/11/25     Page 4 of 6 \n5 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  B. Discussion  \nAs a preliminary matter, the Court must address whether there is federal jurisdiction over  \nPlaintiff's complaint. See B.C. v. Plumas Unified Sch. Dist ., 192 F.3d 1260, 1264 (9th Cir. 1999).  \nFederal courts have limited subject matter jurisdiction and may only hear cases falling within their  \njurisdiction. The two most common forms of federal subject matter jurisdiction are federal  \nquestion jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1331 and diversity jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1332.  \nHere, Plaintiff invokes federal question jurisdiction based on violation of her rights under 42 \nU.S.C. § 1983 and the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment s of the U.S. Constitution.  She has not, \nhowever, state a claim under Section 1983  and therefore, she has not established the existence of \nfederal jurisdiction in this case.  \n Under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 , a claim for violation of constitutional rights may be brought  \nagainst a “person who, under color of any [state law], subjects, or causes to be subjected, any \n[person] to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and \nlaws.” 42 U.S.C. § 1983.  Plaintiff attempts to meet the state actor requirement by alleging that the \nMcDaniels defendants are “government official” who acted under “color of law” and that the y \nworked together with the other named defendants to deprive  her of her constitutional rights.  \nHowever, she has not identified any specific government position held by the McDaniels \ndefendants and contradicts her allegations that they are government officials by alleging that they \nwork for a private company, SecurityBrick, Inc., as a “Cybersecurity Strategic Advisor” (Sara \nMcDaniels) and a “Project Management GRC Analyst”  (Adrian McDaniels ).    \n Because Plaintiff does not allege facts showing that the state actor requirement  under 42 \nU.S.C. § 1983  is met, she fails to state a federal claim in her complaint.  \nIV. CONCLUSION  \nFor the reasons discussed above, Plaintiff is ORDERED TO SHOW CAUSE why this case \nshould not be dismissed because there is no federal jurisdiction over her complaint.    Plaintiff may \nrespond by filing either an amended complaint that addresses the deficiencies discussed above or a \nresponse that addresses why her current complaint is sufficient.  Plaintiff’s response shall be filed \nby December 10, 2025 .   If Plaintiff does not file a response by that date, the case will be Case 3:25-cv-07239-JCS     Document 9     Filed 11/11/25     Page 5 of 6 \n6 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  reassigned to a United States district judge with a recommendation that it be  dismissed pursuant to \n28 U.S.C. § 1915(e)(2)(B).  \nAny amended complaint must include the caption and civil case number used in this order \n(25-cv-7239)  and the words FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT on the first page.  Because an \namended complaint completely replaces the previous complaint, any amended complaint may not \nincorporate claims or allegations of Plaintiff ’s original complaint by reference, but instead must \ninclude all of the facts and claims Plaintiff  wishes to present and all of the defendants he wishes to \nsue.   \nPlaintiff , who is not represented by counsel, is encouraged to consult with the Federal Pro \nBono Project’s Legal Help Center in either of the Oakland or San Francisco federal courthouses \nfor assistance.

    "summary": "1. **Summary:** The case involves Aaron Ogletree, a student at Cleveland State University, who challenged the university's practice of conducting virtual room scans before remote exams, filing a suit alleging that these scans violated his Fourth Amendment rights. The court held that such room scans constituted searches under the Fourth Amendment, and that they were unreasonable, thus siding with Ogletree and granting him declaratory and injunctive relief. The case touches on the use of AI/automation in the sense that Cleveland State utilized AI proctoring tools, but the room scan itself was not AI-driven.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue:** The key legal issue is whether the virtual room scans conducted by Cleveland State University as part of its remote exam proctoring process constitute unreasonable searches in violation of the Fourth Amendment.\n\n3. **Court's Holding:** The court held that the room scans conducted by Cleveland State University are searches under the Fourth Amendment and are unreasonable, thus violating the Fourth Amendment. The court granted declaratory judgment and a permanent injunction favoring Aaron Ogletree, preventing the university from conducting such room scans without consent or a reasonable alternative.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation:** Imagine if your school wanted to check your room over a video call before an online test to see if you're cheating, but you don't want them to do that because it's private.

Philip Calabrese  \n  \nAMENDED OPINION AND ORDER  \n Even before the Covid -19 pandemic, Cleveland State University offered \ncourses online and used various methods to ensure the integrity of remote tests.  One \nmethod involves using a student’s camera briefly to scan the test taker’s surroundings \nfor potential  impermissible study aids or notes.  Plaintiff Aaron Ogletree, a student \nat Cleveland State University, filed suit alleging that this practice or policy violated \nhis rights when a proctor asked him to conduct a room scan of his bedroom before \nstarting a re mote test.   \nPlaintiff and Defendant each move for summary judgment.  For the following \nreasons, the Court DENIES  Defendant’s motion for summary judgment  (ECF No. 29)  \nand GRANTS  Plaintiff’s motion  (ECF No. 30) .  In this Amended Opinion and Order, \nthe Court also  addresses Plaintiff’s m otion for a permanent injunction ( ECF No. 41)  \nand incorporates the clarifications referenced in its Opinion and Order ( see ECF \nNo. 49) on Defendant’s motion for reconsideration  (ECF No. 42) .   Case: 1:21-cv-00500-JPC  Doc #: 50  Filed:  12/20/22  1 of 31.  PageID #: <pageID>2 STATEMENT OF FACTS  \n This case arises out of a scan Cleveland State University conducted of a \nstudent’s bedroom in connection with a remote test Mr. Ogletree  took for one of his \nclasses.   The record contains the following facts, which are largely undisputed.   \nA. Cleveland State’s Remote  Testing Policies \nCleveland State University offers some classes remotely.  ( ECF No. 17 , ¶ 11, \nPageID #146; ECF No. 19 , ¶ 11, PageID #160.)  In May 2016, Cleveland State  \npublished campus -wide guidelines for online classes in a document titled “ Required  \nProcedures & Recommended  Practices to Address Security and Quality of eLearning \nCourses.”   ( ECF No. 25 -2, PageID #330.)   One of the purposes of t he document was \nto ensure the integrity of remote tests.  ( ECF No. 25 -1, PageID #268.)  \nA required procedure mandates that students taking online classes have a \nphotograph in Cleveland State’s database  at the time of registration  so as “to \neliminate impersonation and to ensure that the same student enrolled in the course \nis attending the online lectures and taking the exams.”  ( ECF No. 25 -1, PageID \n#273– 74; ECF No.  25-2, PageID #330 .)  However, Cleveland State does not enforce \nthis procedure , and some students taking online classes do not have a photograph in \nthe database.  ( ECF No. 25 -1, PageID #272 –74.) \nIn addition to requir ed procedures, the University’s recommended practices \nleave testing “to the faculty member’s discretion to implement.”  ( ECF No. 25 -2, \nPageID #331.)   Some recommended practices include randomiz ing the order of Case: 1:21-cv-00500-JPC  Doc #: 50  Filed:  12/20/22  2 of 31.  PageID #: <pageID>3 questions, us ing timed tests, and using  remote proctoring tools.  ( Id., PageID \n#331– 32.)   \nAs remote pro ctoring tools, Cleveland State  offers several programs  designed \nto enhance  “online test security and proctoring.”  ( Id., PageID #332.)  For instance, \nCleveland State’s  learning management system , Blackboard , offers a plagiarism \ndetection system  and generat es reports “that faculty can use to see more information \nabout student activity, including  the IP address from where they logged in, how much \ntime they spent in the exam .”  (ECF No. 25 -1, Page ID #262– 63 & 312 .)  Cleveland \nState also uses the proctoring tools R espondus  and Honorlock.  ( Id., PageID # 291.)  \nFor Respondus, Respondus LockDown Browser prevents students from accessing the \ninternet or using other computer programs during a remote test, w hile R espondus \nMonitor records the student taking the exam  and uses artificial intelligence to flag \nsuspicious activity .  (Id., PageID # 305–06 & 321 .)  Similarly, Honorlock uses a \nstudent’s camera  and artificial intelligence monitoring.   (Id., PageID #299.)   Among \nthese remote proctoring tools, faculty members have discretion to choose which tool \nor combination of tools, if any, a re necessary to preserve the integrity of the remote \nexam.  ( Id., PageID #275 –76 & 295 .) \nB. Cleveland State ’s Use of Room Scans  \nCleveland State neither requires nor  recommends the use of a room scan  \npursuant to any written policy .  (ECF No. 25 -1, PageID #277.)   In a non- proctored \nexam, there is no room scan.  ( Id., PageID #283.)   However, each of the online \nproctoring tools that Cleveland State  uses, Respondus and Honorlock, requires a Case: 1:21-cv-00500-JPC  Doc #: 50  Filed:  12/20/22  3 of 31.  PageID #: <pageID>4 room scan as part of its prerecorded instructions.  ( Id., PageID #291– 93.)  For in-\nperson proctored exams , the test coordinator at Cleveland State University  Testing \nServices informed Mr. Ogletree  by email that it has a process of performing a “cursory \nreview of [the student’s] immediate testing space,” and “[a]ll students, regardless of \nthe course or instructor, are asked to do this as part of the check -in process.”   (ECF \nNo. 26 -7, PageID #413.)    \nWhen a student takes an o nline exam , it proceeds as follows.  First, at the \noutset of a  proctored online exam, whether proctored through an electronic \napplication or an actual person , students must “show thei r ID next to their face so \nyou can clearly see and read the ID and be able to tell that that person is the same \nperson that is on the ID.”  (ECF No.  25-1, PageID #282 ; ECF No. 24 -1, PageID #202.)   \nSecond , either the proctoring application or the proctor prompt s the student to \nconduct a room scan of his  environment.  ( ECF No. 25 -1, PageID #282 ; ECF No. 24 -1, \nPageID #211 .)  Other students taking the remote test can see the room scans of other \nstudents.  (ECF No. 24 -1, PageID #212.)  \nThe proctor who performed the room scan at issue in this case testified that \nher supervisor, the Cleveland State Testing Services ’ test coordinator,  instructed her \nto perform the room scan.  ( ECF No. 24 -1, PageID #214.)  Further, the proctor \npresumed that a room scan was required unless the professor in the class instructed otherwise.  ( Id., PageID #215.)  As to whether students may re fuse to conduct the \nroom scan, the proctor testified that she never had a student refuse , and she was not \naware of a Cleveland State policy addressing how to handle a student’s refusal.  ( Id., Case: 1:21-cv-00500-JPC  Doc #: 50  Filed:  12/20/22  4 of 31.  PageID #: <pageID>5 PageID #213.)   The proctor testified that in the event of a refusal, she would allow \nthe student to take the test but notify the professor that the student refused to \nperform the room scan.  ( Id.) \nC. Mr. Ogletree’s Enrollment at Cleveland State  \n At the time of the events relevant to this action, Mr. Ogletree studied \nchemistry at Cleveland State University.  ( ECF No. 26 -1, PageID #352.)  For the \nspring 2021 semester , Mr. Ogletree enrolled in five classes .  (ECF No. 17 , ¶ 39,  \nPageID #1 49–50.)  Due to the Covi d-19 pandemic, most Cleveland State classes \nduring the spring 2021 semester were conducted remotely.  ( ECF No. 1 , ¶ 40, PageID \n#150; ECF No.  19, ¶ 40, PageID #163.)    \nIn the complaint, Plaintiff alleges that during the spring 2021 semester, \nCleveland State required students to complete and pass a “Daily Health Assessment” \nto attend a class in -person  on campus .  (ECF No. 17 , ¶ 42,  PageID #150.)   Attending \nclasses in person was not an option for him, Plai ntiff says, because of “various health \nissues that impact his immune system and put him at particular risk to the COVID \npandemic.”  ( Id., ¶ 45, PageID #150.)   Further, “[b]ecause of his health issues, \nOgletree does not pass the Daily Health Assessment” ; therefore , according to the \ncomplaint, Cleveland State would not permit him to take his tests in -person on \ncampus .  (Id., ¶¶ 46 & 47 , PageID #150.)   Plaintiff also alleged he has “family \nmembers who are at high -risk to the pandemic.”  ( Id., ¶ 48, PageID #150.)

The Room Scan  \nIn January 2021, Mr. Ogletree disputed a policy contained in the syllabus for \nhis General Chemistry II class.  (ECF No. 17 , ¶ 49, PageID #151; ECF No. 19 , ¶ 49, \nPageID #164.)   The policy stated:   “The proctors and I reserve the right to ask any \nstudent, before, during, or after an exam to show their surroundings, screen, and/or \nwork area.  We will  send you a private chat to ask you to do this.  If you do not see \nthe chat message, I will use the microphone to ask you to check the chat.”  ( Id.)  Three \ndays later, the Professor removed the policy  from the syllabus.  ( ECF No. 17 , ¶ 50, \nPageID #151; ECF No. 19 , ¶ 50, PageID #164.)   \n On February 17, 2021, Mr. Ogletree had a General Chemistry II re mote test \nscheduled for 12:30 pm.  ( ECF No. 17 , ¶ 51, PageID #151; ECF No. 19 , ¶ 51, PageID \n#164.)  At the time, Mr. Ogletree li ved with his mother and two siblings, who were all \nhome when Mr. Ogletree took the chemistry exam.  ( ECF No. 26 -1, PageID #354 –55.)  \nCleveland State requires students to take remote tests in a  location where they will \nbe alone and uninterrupted.  ( ECF No. 17 , PageID #151; ECF No. 19 , PageID #165.)  \nMr. Ogletree testifi ed that his bedroom was the only suitable testing environment.  \n(ECF No. 26 -1, PageID #366.)   \nThat morning, at 10:25 am, almost two hours before the scheduled exam, \nCleveland State Testing Services emailed Mr. Ogletree to inform him  that the proctor \nwould be “checking your ID, your surroundings and your materials.”  ( ECF No. 26 -5, \nPageID #4 09.)  At 10:40 am, Mr. Ogletree replied to the email.  ( Id.)  Mr. Ogletree \nexplained that he “currently [had] confidential settlement documents in the form of Case: 1:21-cv-00500-JPC  Doc #: 50  Filed:  12/20/22  6 of 31.  PageID #: <pageID>7 late arriving 1099s scattered about [his] work area and there is not enough time to \nsecure them.”  ( Id.)  \n At the start of the exam, the proctor asked Mr. Ogletree to perform a room scan \nof his bedroom , and Mr. Ogletree complied.  ( ECF No. 24 -1, PageID #226.)  The scan \nlasted less than a minute , and as little as ten to twenty seconds .  (Id., PageID #227 ; \nECF No. 26 -1, PageID #368 .)  The proctor testified that she did not see any tax \ndocuments or medications.   (ECF No.  24-1, PageID #239 –40.) \n The room scan and the test were recorded,  and the video recording was \nretained by Cleveland State’s third- party  vendor.  ( ECF No. 25 -1, PageID #301.)  \nCleveland State is not aware of any dat a breaches related to remote exam  recordings , \nand access to the video is strictly controlled.   (ECF No. 25 -1, PageID #301; ECF No. \n24-1, PageID #236 –37.) \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE  \n Based on these facts, Plaintiff  alleges  that Defendant violated his rights under \nthe Fourth Amendment and seeks injunctive and declaratory relief.  ( ECF No. 17 , \nPageID #152 –53.)  Both Plaintiff and Defendant move  for summary judgment.   (ECF \nNos. 29 & 30.)  \nANALYSIS  \nPurs uant to Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, summary \njudgment is appropriate “if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to \nany material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.”  Fed.

Ultimately, the \nCourt must determine whether “ one party must prevail as a matter of law.”  Anderson \nv. Liberty Lobby, Inc ., 477 U.S. 242, 251 (1986) .   \nI. Fourth Amendment  Searches  \nThe Fourth Amendment protects “[t]he right of the people to be secure in their \npersons, houses, papers, and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures.”  \nU.S. Const. amend. IV; United States v. Jones, 565 U.S. 400, 404 (2012).  Plaintiff \ncontends t hat Cleveland State’s policy of conducting warrantless room scans of \nstudents’ homes violates the Fourth Amendment’s prohibition against unreasonable \nsearches as it applies to the State of Ohio through the Fourteenth Amendment.  ( ECF \nNo. 17 , PageID #153.)   \n At the outset, the parties contest whether the remote virtual room scans at \nissue qualify as searches within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment.  Specifically, \nthey debate whether the Four th Amendment applies under Wyman v. James, 400 \nU.S. 309 (1971), and its progeny.   \nI.A. General  Principles \n A Fourth Amendment search “occurs when the government violates a \nsubjective expectation of privacy that society recognizes as reasonable.”  Kyllo v.  \nUnited States, 533 U.S. 27, 33 (2001) (citing Katz v. United States, 389 U.S. 347, 361 \n(1967) ).  Even in the expressly  protected location of a house, which receives Case: 1:21-cv-00500-JPC  Doc #: 50  Filed:  12/20/22  8 of 31.  PageID #: <pageID>9 heightened protection under the Fourth Amendment , a search within the meaning of \nthe Const itution does not occur unless “the individual manifested a subjective \nexpectation of privacy in the object of the challenged search,” and society is “willing \nto recognize that expectation as reasonable.”  Id.  (citing California v. Ciraolo , 47 U.S. \n207, 211 (1986)).  \nPlaintiff contends  that the  remote room  scans at issue are Fourth Amendment \nsearches because students have a subjective expectation of privacy in their houses , \nand especially in their bedrooms, and society recognizes that expectation as \nreasonable.  ( ECF No. 33 , PageID #499.)  In response , Defendant maintains  that \nPlaintiff’s subjective expectation of privacy was not objectively reasonable.   (ECF \nNo. 34, PageID #512.)   Defendant points  to evidence showing that room  scans are \n“standard industry wide practice” and that students frequently acquiesce in  their use.  \n(ECF No. 34 , PageID #512– 14.)   \nAlthough the record shows that no student, other than Mr. Ogletree, ever \nobjected to the scans ( ECF No. 24 -1, PageID #213), the facts  also implicate the core \nplaces where society, to the exten t it can agree on much  these days , recognizes \nreasonable and legitimate privacy interests —namely, the home.  Though schools may \nroutinely employ remote technology to peer into houses without objection from some, \nmost, or nearly  all students, it does not follow that others might not object to the \nvirtual intrusion into their homes or that the routine use of a practice such as room scans does not violate a privacy interest that society recognize s as reasonable, both \nfactually and legally.  Therefore, the Court determines that Mr. Ogletree’s subjective Case: 1:21-cv-00500-JPC  Doc #: 50  Filed:  12/20/22  9 of 31.  PageID #: <pageID>10 expectation of privacy at issue is one that society views as reasonable and that lies at \nthe core of the Fourth Amendment’s protections against governmental intrusion.  \nTo support the argument that the expectation of privacy Plaintiff claims is \nobjectively unreasonable, Defendant relies on several  cases.  First , Defendant argues \nthat the room  scans are  not searches because they are routine .  For this proposition, \nDefendant cites Califor nia v. Ciraolo , 476 U.S. 207, 215 (1986) , in which the Supreme \nCourt held that it was unreasonable to expect that marijuana plants were \nconstitutionally protected from being observed from an altitude of 1,000 feet “in an \nage where private and commercial  flight in the public airways is routine.”   See also \nFlorida v. Riley , 488 U.S. 445, 449 –50 (1989) (same).   In Ciraolo and Riley , due to  \nmodern  flight  technology and its routine use, the marijuana plants were  openly  \nobservable.   These cases build on the traditional notion that governmental officials, \nlawfully in a public place, do not conduct unlawful searches simply by  observ ing \nthings  in plain view.  But the room scans peer behind walls and make visible places \noutside the ambit of cases such as Ciraolo and Riley .  Rooms scans go where people \notherwise would not, at least not without a warrant or an invitation.  \nNor does it follow that room  scans are not searches because the technolog y is \n“in general public use.”  Defendant cites Kyllo, 533 U.S. at 34– 40, in which the \nSupreme Court held that law enforcement’s use of thermal imaging technology  not \n“in general public use” to explore the interior of the home constituted  a Fourth \nAmendment search .  But t he Supreme Court did not  hold the inverse —that the use \nof a technology “in general public use”  could not be a Fourth Amendment search.   To Case: 1:21-cv-00500-JPC  Doc #: 50  Filed:  12/20/22  10 of 31.  PageID #: <pageID>11 the contrary, Katz  held, as relevant here, that the procedural antecedents to a search \nthat the Constitution requires apply even where new technologies make accessible \nplaces and information not otherwise obtainable without a physical intrusion.   389 \nU.S. at 359.   While cameras  might  be generally a vailable  and now commonly used , \nmembers of the public cannot use  them  to see into a n office , house, or other place not \npublicly visible  without the owner’s consent.   \nFinally, Defendant cites  City of Ontario, California v. Quon , 560 U.S. 746  \n(2010), in whic h the Supreme Court considered the privacy  expectations of \ngovernmental employees in communications made on electronic equipment  that the \nemployer  owns .  T here, t he Court observed that rapid changes related to \ncommunications were evident in both the techno logy and “what society accepts as \nproper behavior” and noted that the “operational realities of the workplace” might \nbear on the reasonableness of an employee ’s expectation of privacy.   Id. at 756 –59.  \nBut Quon arose within the  particular context of the employment relationship .  \nAlthough the truism that technological change affects the degree of privacy that society accepts as reasonable has broader application, Quon and the cases that \nfollowed it have not extended this principle beyond th e employment context.  Any \ndecision to do so properly lies with another court , particularly if doing so pares back \nconstitutional protections across different areas of the law .   \nFollowing Katz , Fourth Amendment jurisprudence examines an individual’s \nexpec tation of privacy in a particular place .  The ubiquity  of a particular technolog y \nor its application s does not directly bear on that analysis .  Here, the room  scan Case: 1:21-cv-00500-JPC  Doc #: 50  Filed:  12/20/22  11 of 31.  PageID #: <pageID>12 occurred in Plaintiff’s house —in his bedroom, in fact .  At the Fourth Amendment’s \n“very core ” lies “the right of a man to retreat into his own home and there be free from \nunreasonable governmental intrusion.”  Florida v. Jardines, 569 U.S. 1, 6 (2013) \n(citing Silverman v. United States, 365 U.S. 505, 511 (1961) ).  Consistent with \nestablished precedent, the Court determines that Plaintiff  had an objectively \nreasonable expectation of privacy in his home —and one that society recognizes as \nreasonable .  \nI.B. Searches Under Wyman  v. James  \nAdditionally , Defendant  contends that the room scans are not “searches” \nbecause they are limited in scope, conducted for a regulatory or administrative \npurpose, and not coerced.   (ECF No. 29 , PageID #46 2–66.)  In support of the \nproposition that these attributes remove the room  scans from the ambit of the Fourth \nAmendment, Defendant relies on Wyman v. James, 400 U.S. 309  (1971) , and its \nprogeny.  \n In Wyman , the Supreme C ourt considered whether a welfare beneficiary may \nrefuse a home visit by her  caseworker without risking the termination of benefits.  \n400 U.S. at 310.   The Wyman Court specifically considered the heightened  protection \nthe Fourth Amendment affords to the privacy of the home and noted that “one’s  \nFourth Amendment protection subsists apart from his being suspected of criminal \nbehavior .”  Id. at 316  (citing Camara v. Municipal Ct ., 387 U.S. 523, 528 –30 (1967)) .  \nNonetheless, t he Court held  that this “protective attitude” in the law was not a factor \nin the case because the home visit was not a search in the Fourth Amendment sense .  Case: 1:21-cv-00500-JPC  Doc #: 50  Filed:  12/20/22  12 of 31.  PageID #: <pageID>13 Id. at 318.  Though State law made the visit mandatory for continu ing benefits  and \nthe visit served both rehabilitative and investigative purposes , the Court concluded  \nthat the visit could not be equated with a search in the traditional criminal law \ncontext.  Id.   Indeed , the visit wa s not forced or compelled, the beneficiary’s denial of \npermission was not a criminal act, and if the beneficiary did not consent then the \nvisitation did not occur and the aid “merely cease[d] .”  Id. \n The other cases Defendant cites stem from Wyman .  In S.L. v. Whitburn , 67 \nF.3d 1299 , 1307 (7th Cir. 1995) , and Sanchez v. C ity of San Diego , 464 F.3d 916, \n920–23 (9th Cir. 2006) , the Seventh and Ninth Circuit s noted  that they were bound \nby Wyman  and held  that home visits made pursuant to the administration of welfare \nbenefits  were not searches under the Fourt h Amendment.   See also  Schmid v. City of \nSonoma , No. 19 -cv-00883, 2021 WL 1118077, at *4 (N.D. Cal. Mar. 24, 2021)  \n(upholding denial of an exemption for refusal to consent to a permit -related inspection \non the grounds that the inspections were not Fourth Amendment searches under \nWyman ).  Similarly, i n Marcavage v. Borough of Lansdowne, P ennsylvania, 493 F. \nApp’x 301 (3d Cir. 2012) , the court  upheld an ordinance  authorizing denial of a rental \nlicense if the property owner refused to consent to an inspection .  The Third Circuit \nreasoned that the ordinance “requires a limited search by the city official for the specific purpose of receiving a benefit under the law,”  which is constitutional under \nWyman .  Id.  at 306.  \n Based on Wyman ’s differentiation between investigations and Fourth \nAmendment searches, Defendant advances several reasons why its room  scans of Case: 1:21-cv-00500-JPC  Doc #: 50  Filed:  12/20/22  13 of 31.  PageID #: <pageID>14 students’ homes  are not searches.  First, Defendant conducted the scan for the \nregulatory purpose of protecting exam integrity, not for any purpose related to \ncriminality.  ( ECF No. 29 , PageID #463.)  Second, the scan was not coerced because \nPlaintiff was free to object to the scan or refuse to perform it.  ( Id.)  A student who \nrefused to conduct the exam could stil l take the test  and, even if failure to conduct \nthe scan resulted in not getting credit for the exam, that consequence is  less severe \nthan the loss of welfare benefits in Wyman .  (Id., PageID #464 –65.)  Third, the scan \nwas limited in scope because it was brief , only revealed items in plain view , and the \nstudent controlled the inspection to the extent that the student chose where in the \nhouse to take the exam and where in the room to direct the camera  during the scan.  \n(Id., PageID #463 –64.)  Defendant argue s that the room  scan was less intrusive  than \nthe home visits in Wyman  because no State officer physically entered Plaintiff’s home , \nDefendant told Plaintiff of the scan two hours in advance, and Plaintiff could choose \nthe part of the home  to be inspected and remove any  private matters from plain view.  \n(Id., PageID #464 .)   \n Plaintiff responds that Defendant overreads Wyman .  (ECF No. 33 , PageID \n#500.)   Plaintiff points to the Sixth Circuit’s holding in Andrews v. Hickman County, \nTenn essee, 700 F.3d 845 (6th Cir. 2012).  There, the court considered whether social \nworkers who conducted a warrantless home visit in a child abuse investigation were \nentitled to qualified immunity.  The Sixth Circuit noted that the Fourth Amendment’s \nrestrictions on unreasonable searches extended to the “activities of civil as well as criminal a uthorities.”  Id. at 858– 59 (citing New Jersey v. T.L.O ., 469 U.S. 325, 335 Case: 1:21-cv-00500-JPC  Doc #: 50  Filed:  12/20/22  14 of 31.  PageID #: <pageID>15 (1985) ).  Describing case law from other circuits , the c ourt referenced a case in which \nthe Ninth Circuit declined to exempt social workers investigating allegations of child \nabuse  from the Fourth Amendment by distinguishing Wyman as mak ing “receipt of \na requested welfare benefit contingent on the grant of entry for a search intended to \nconfirm that the monies were being used in the recipient child ’s interest, where the \nentry under the state program was of a limited and consensual nature, and the \nrequirement applied to all recipients .”  Id.  at 859 (citing Calabretta v. Floyd , 189 F.3d \n808, 816 (9th Cir. 1999) ).  “Given the presumption that state actors are governed by \nthe Fourt h Amendment and the sanctity of the home under the Fourth Amendment,” \nthe Sixth Circuit held  that social workers were governed by the Fourth Amendment’s \nwarrant requirement.   700 F.3d at 859.  \n Plaintiff argues that Andrews shows that Wyman did not create a Fourth \nAmendment exception for civil authorities.  ( ECF No. 33 , PageID #501.)   Rather, \nlongstanding  precedent establishes that the Fourth Amendment applies to searches \nconducted for noncrimi nal purposes , especially in the home .  (ECF No. 33 , PageID \n#501– 02.)  Further, Plaintiff maintains that it is well establishe d that the Fourth \nAmendment applies to all intrusions into a privat e home, however limited.  ( Id., \nPageID #50 2–03.)  Defendant does not dispute that the Fourth Amendment  gives \nheightened protection to  the home or that the Fourth Amendment applies in \nnoncriminal matters.  ( ECF No. 35 , PageID #533.)   However, Defendant argues  that \nthe Wyman Court considered both of those points and , nonethel ess, determined that \nno Fourth Amendment search occurred.  ( Id.) Case: 1:21-cv-00500-JPC  Doc #: 50  Filed:  12/20/22  15 of 31.  PageID #: <pageID>16  Wyman  dates to 1971,  more than fifty years ago .  Since then, society, \ntechnology, and Fourth Amendment jurisprudence have changed markedly.  In the \ncases applying Wyman on which Defendant re lies, courts applied Wyman in the \ncontext of upholding termination or denial of a benefit following the beneficiary’s \nrefusal to consent to an inspection, where refusal triggered no penalties except the \ntermination or denial of benefits.  In this respect, the Sixth Circuit’s decision in \nAndrews, quoting Calabretta from the Ninth Circuit, accurately reads this line of \ncases as applying to a fairly distinct set of circumstances materially different from  \nthose at issue here:  making welfare benefits contingent , for all recipients, on a \nlimited and consensual search to confirm expenditure of the funds for the interest of a child.  In contrast , unlike Wyman  and its progeny, this case involves the privilege \nof college admission and attendance and does not involve a benefit made available to \nall citizens as of right.  Additionally, the record here shows a variable policy —\nenforced, unevenl y, in the discretion of a combination of proctors and professors —of \nusing remote scans that make a student’s home visible , including to other students , \nwith uncertain consequences .   \n Finally, the Court addresses Plaintiff ’s argument that New Jersey v. T.L.O. , \n469 U.S. 325 (1985), provides the proper standard for  the constitutionality of searches \nthat school officials  conduct .  (ECF No. 33 , PageID #503.)  In  T.L.O., the Supreme \nCourt  held that the Fourth Amendment applies to searches by school officials , with \nsome accommodation to respond to the needs of the educ ational environment and \nassess the legality of those searches .  Id.  at 341 –42.  But T.L.O. does not speak to the Case: 1:21-cv-00500-JPC  Doc #: 50  Filed:  12/20/22  16 of 31.  PageID #: <pageID>17 threshold question of when a school official’s actions constitute a search within the \nmeaning of the Fourth Amendment.   Accordingly, the Court need  not address T.L.O.  \non this question.    \n* * * \n For these reasons, the Court concludes that the Fourth Amendment applies to \nthe virtual room scans Cleveland State uses.  Holding otherwise, as Defendant \nargues, raises even more difficult questions about what legal standard, if any, governs \nthe scans and the potential consequences of such a ruling in other areas of life  and \nthe law  that technology touches.  \nII.  Fourth Amendment Reasonableness  \n The Fourth Amendment proscribes only those sear ches that are unreasonable.  \nHaving held  that the room  scans are searches for purposes of  the Fourth Amendment, \nthe Court turns to whether the scans a re reasonable.   Whether a particular search \nmeets the reasonableness standard “is judged by balancing its intrusion on the \nindividual's Fourth Amendment interests against its promotion of legitimate \ngovernmental interests.”  Skinner v. Railway Labor Exec s.’ Ass’n , 489 U.S. 602, 619 \n(1989) (quoting Delaware v. Prouse, 440 U.S. 648,  654 (1979) ).  Although the Fo urth \nAmendment mandates that no warrant may issue except on a showing of probable \ncause, that requirement is not absolute.   A warrant is not required in every case.   \nNational Treasury Emps. Union v. Von Raab , 489 U.S. 656, 665  (1989) .  As the text \nof the F ourth Amendment makes clear, the Constitution protects against \nunreasonable searches and seizures, making reasonableness the ultimate touchstone Case: 1:21-cv-00500-JPC  Doc #: 50  Filed:  12/20/22  17 of 31.  PageID #: <pageID>27 Moreover, the record contains no evidence that other students have not consented to \nroom scans or have circu mstances like Mr. Ogletree’s.  Indeed, in the record before \nthe Court, Mr. Ogletree made the only complaint or objection to the room scans.  \nAccordingly, t his case does not  raise a  concern of serial litigation that might \noverwhelm the courts.   \n For these reasons, the Court determines that a remedy that extends to other \nstudents would be overly broad and is unnecessary to provide Mr. Ogletree the relief \nto which he is entitled.  See Sharpe, 319 F.3d at 273.  To be sure, the relief requested \n“will benefit not only the claimant but all other persons subject to the practice or the \nrule under attack.”  7A Wright & Miller,  Federal Practice and Procedure § 1771 (4th \ned. 2008) .  Other students might well avail themselves of the Court’s ruling, but \nadjudicating any such claims preemptively by extending the remedy would be \npremature.   \nIII.B. Remedies  \n Against that background, the Court considers  each of the remedies Plaintiff \nseeks.  \nIII.B.1. Declaratory Judgment  \n“[I]n a case of actual controversy within its jurisdiction,” except for certain \ncircumstances not relevant here, the Court “ may declare the rights and other legal \nrelations of any interested party seeking such declaration, w hether or not further \nrelief is or could be sought .”  28 U.S.C. §  2201(a); see also Abbott Labs. v. Gardner, \n387 U.S. 136, 142 (1967).   Accordingly, Plaintiff is entitled to a declaratory judgment.  Case: 1:21-cv-00500-JPC  Doc #: 50  Filed:  12/20/22  27 of 31.  PageID #: <pageID>28 Based on its prior Opinion and Order, as amended, the Court declares that \nPlaintiff Aaron Ogletree has rights under the Fourth Amendment, which appl y to the \nroom scans Cleveland State uses in the administration of remote exams and other \nassessments, and that Mr. Ogletree’s privacy interest in his home outweighs \nCleveland State’s interest s in scanning his room.  Accordingly, the Court grants \ndeclaratory relief to Plaintiff.  As discussed, this ruling might incidentally benefit \nother students as well.  As a formal matter, however, the Court limits this declaration \nto Mr. Ogletree as the party -in-interest who brought suit against Cleveland State.   \nIII.B. 2. Injunction  \nGenerally,  before a court  may issue  a permanent  injunction,  a plaintiff  must  \ndemonstrate:   (1) he has suffered an irreparable injury; (2) the remedies available at \nlaw, such as monetary damages, are inadequate to compensate for that injury; \n(3) considering the balance of hardships between the plaintiff and defendant, a \nremedy in equity is warranted; a nd (4) a permanent injunction serve s the public \ninterest.  eBay  Inc. v. MercExchange,  L.L.C., 547 U.S. 388, 391 (2006) (citations \nomitted).  Essentially, this standard mirrors the considerations governing the \nissuance of a preliminary injunction, except th at the plaintiff must also show actual  \nsuccess on the merits.  Amoco  Prod.  Co. v. Village  of Gambell , 480 U.S. 531, 546 n.12 \n(1987).  While a court balances these fact ors, it must consider each of them, and “ even  \nthe strongest  showing  on the other  three  factors  cannot  eliminate  the irreparable  \nharm  requirement.”   D.T. v. Sumner  Cnty. Sch., 942 F.3d 324, 326– 27 (6th Cir. 2019) \n(quotation omitted).   Case: 1:21-cv-00500-JPC  Doc #: 50  Filed:  12/20/22  28 of 31.  PageID #: <pageID>29 For the reasons discussed, Plaintiff proved his claim of a Fourth Amendment \nviolation and established actual success on the merits.  W here a plaintiff establishes \nthe merits of his  claim, he need only show (1) a continuing irreparable injury if the \ncourt fails to issue the injunction and (2) the lack of an adequate remedy at law.  \nKallstrom  v. City of Columbus , 136 F.3d 1055, 1067 (6th Cir. 1998).  Mr. Ogletree \nproved an irreparable injury from th e governmental intrusion into his \nconstitutionally protected home, however briefly .  See Overstreet v. Lexington -Fayette \nUrb. Cnty. Gov ’t, 305 F.3d 566, 578 (6th Cir. 2002)  (citing , among other authorities,  \nCovino v. Patrissi , 967 F.2d 73, 77 (2d Cir.  1992) (holding that plaintiffs may establish \nirreparable harm based on violation of their Fourth Amendment  rights) ).  Defendant \nobjects that Mr. Ogletree should not receive an injunction because he lacks an ongoing need.  ( ECF No. 47 , PageID #613.)  In Defendant’s view, it is enough that \nCleveland State has  exempted him from all room scans “until this case is resolved.”  \n(Id., PageID #615.)  But Mr. Ogletree’s constitutional rights do not depend on the \ngrace of Cleveland State.  The Court sees no reason not to make this voluntary interim measure permanent.  So long as Mr.  Ogletree remains enrolled at Cleveland \nState, he remains subject to future room scans that threaten his rights.   \nAs for a remedy at law, the Eleventh Amendment bars an award of damages.  \nSee Platte v. Thomas Twp. , 504 F. Supp. 2d 227, 247 (E.D. Mich. 2007) .  Even if it did \nnot, the Court is hard -pressed  to quantify the damages flowing from the \nconstitutional violatio n at issue.  The remaining factors also favor the issuance of a \npermanent injunction.  In the  balance of hardships, the Court finds that the risk of Case: 1:21-cv-00500-JPC  Doc #: 50  Filed:  12/20/22  29 of 31.  PageID #: <pageID>30 continuing constitutional violations  from the use of room scans that intrude into \nMr. Ogletree’s home outweighs any burden on Cleveland State from using alternative \nmethods to advance its legitimate interests in ensuring the integrity of tests, securing \nconsent, or otherwise implementing room scans that do not violate the Fourth \nAmendment .  See Cole v. City of Memphis , Tenn. , 108 F. Supp. 3d 593, 607 (W.D. \nTenn. 2015) .  Finally , “it is always in the public interest to prevent the violation of a \nparty’s constitutional rights. ”  G & V Lounge, I nc. v. Michigan Liquor Control \nComm’n , 23 F.3d 1071, 1079 (6th Cir. 1994) (citations omitted) .  \n* * * \n Balancing the equities, the Court permanently enjoins Cleveland State, in \nconnection with any exam, test, or other assessment, from subjecting Mr. Ogletr ee to \na room scan that  is administered without offering a reasonable alternative or, \nalternatively, without his express consent.   \nCONCLUSION  \nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court DENIES  Defendant’s motion for \nsummary judgment and GRANTS  Plaintiff’s motion .  Further, the Court  ISSUES A \nDECLARATORY JUDGMENT and PERMANENTLY ENJOINS Cleveland State \nfrom violating Mr. Ogletree’s Fourth Amendment rights as stated in this Amended \nOpinion and Or der.   \n SO ORDERED.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**:\n   In *RGIS, LLC v. Keith Gerdes*, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the district court’s grant of a preliminary injunction against Keith Gerdes for breaching his employment agreement with RGIS and misappropriating trade secrets. Gerdes resigned from RGIS to work for a competitor, in violation of his non-compete clause, and failed to respond timely to RGIS's preliminary injunction motion. The court found Gerdes showed a lack of trustworthiness and supported RGIS's claim of threatened misappropriation. The case mentions plans for future use of artificial intelligence as part of RGIS's strategic business information, highlighting its involvement in trade secret claims.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**:\n   Whether the district court correctly issued a preliminary injunction against Gerdes based on claims of breach of a non-compete clause and misappropriation of trade secrets.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**:\n   The court upheld the preliminary injunction, affirming that RGIS demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits of its trade secret misappropriation claim and that Gerdes's employment agreement waiver provided strong grounds against his personal jurisdiction defense.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**:\n   Imagine if you worked at a secret candy factory that used robots to make special candies and you promised not to tell anyone how they do it when you leave. Instead, you go to work at another candy company and take a company laptop with you. The factory sues you because you could accidentally spill their secrets, and a judge says you can't work for the new company for a year, must return the laptop, and must keep the secrets safe. The appeals court agreed, saying you can't complain you weren't heard in court because you didn't respond in time.",

RGIS, LLC, a company  headquartered in Michigan , offers a \nvariety of inventory -related  services to business customers  around  the world .  Keith Gerdes \nworked for RGIS  from California  for 30 years , eventually  becom ing a regional vice president  on \nthe operations side of the company .  Gerdes left RGIS in May 2019 .  An RGIS official said that \nGerdes  told the company that he was resigning  to allow for more “personal time .”  But Gerdes  \nimmediately accepted the position of  Vice President of U.S. Operations with one of RGIS’s main  \ncompetitors.  RGIS did not take kindly to this development because Gerdes’s employment \nagreement barred him  from  accept ing a job  with a competitor for one year after leaving RGIS  and \nrequired him t o keep confidential certain RGIS business information.  RGIS also believed that \nGerdes failed to return a company laptop.        Case: 19-2051     Document: 28-2     Filed: 06/12/2020     Page: 1No. 19-2051,  RGIS, LLC v. Keith Gerdes  \n2 \n In June 2019, RGIS sued Gerdes in a Michigan district court  for breaching the employment \nagreement  and misappropriating trade secrets .  RGIS also filed a motion for a preliminary \ninjunction; Gerdes responded with a motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction and a \nmotion to delay the injunction proceedings until after a decision on th e motion to dismiss.  Gerdes \nnever formally  respon ded to the motion for a preliminary injunction.  At a hearing the court denied \nGerdes’s requested  delay, and Gerdes  then characterized  his motion to dismiss as an opposition to \nthe preliminary -injunction motion.  The court granted the preliminary injunction .  The injunction \nbarred Gerdes from working at the competitor until a year after he left RGIS , required Gerdes to \nreturn any property that belonged to RGIS , and prohibited Gerdes from disclosing any RGIS trade \nsecrets.  RGIS, LLC v.  Gerdes , 2019 WL 3958392, at * 8 (E.D. Mich. Aug. 21, 2019).  \nGerdes  now raises three arguments  on appeal.  Each argument fails, so we affirm.  \nCourts consider four familiar factors when deciding whether to grant a preliminary \ninjunction : (1) whether the plai ntiff is likely to succeed on the merits; (2)  whether the plaintiff will \nsuffer irreparable harm; (3)  whether the balance of the equities tips in the plaintiff’s favor; and \n(4) whether an injunction is in the public interest.  See Winter v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc. , 555 \nU.S. 7, 20 (2008).  On appeal, we review de novo the district court’s conclusion on  the first factor, \nbut we review  under the abuse -of-discretion standard the district court’s ultimate decision  about \nwhether the preliminary -injunction factors favor granting or denying an injunction.  Babler v. \nFuthey , 618 F.3d 514, 519 –20 (6th Cir. 2010) ; see D.T. v. Sumner Cty. Schs. , 942 F.3d 324, 327 \n(6th Cir. 2019) ; York Risk Servs. Grp., Inc. v . Couture , 787 F.  App’x 301, 305 (6th Cir. 2019).  \n1.  Motion Procedure .  Gerdes argues that the district court  abused its discretion by ruling \non RGIS’s  preliminary -injunction motion without giving him an opportunity to respond.  We see \nno error , let alone an abuse of discret ion.  To begin with, Gerdes did have  an opportunity to       Case: 19-2051     Document: 28-2     Filed: 06/12/2020     Page: 2No. 19-2051,  RGIS, LLC v. Keith Gerdes  \n3 \n respond; he simply failed to take it .  RGIS filed its motion on July 1, 2019 , and the court quickly \nset a hearing for August 14.  Local rules gave Gerdes 21 days to respond.  E. Dist. of Mich. L.R. \n7.1(e)(1)(B).   Gerdes filed nothing until July 29, the date on which he moved to dismiss for lack \nof personal jurisdiction.  And he did not file his motion to delay ruling on the preliminary -\ninjunction motion until August 8.  In addition, t he district court could look at Gerdes’s requested \ndelay with a skeptical eye .  He was simultaneously  working for RGIS’s competitor in what RGIS \nbelieved to be a clear breach of contract  and so had every incentive to avoid an injunction ruling .  \nNot only that , Gerdes told the district court at the hearing that his motion to dismiss was “actually” \nan opposition to the motion for a preliminary injunction.  All told,  the court gave Gerdes enough  \ntime to respond, had good reason not to delay things further, and went out of its way to allow  \nGerdes to use  his motion -to-dismiss argument s to oppose the injunction.  It committed  no \nprocedural error.  See Blue v. Hartford Life & Acc ident  Ins. Co. , 698 F.3d 587, 593 –95 (7th Cir. \n2012);  cf. Prime Rate Premium Fin. Corp., Inc. v. Larson , 930 F.3d 759, 766–67 (6th Cir. 2019).  \n2.  Personal Jurisdiction .  Gerdes , a Californian, next argues that the Michigan district \ncourt should have denied the injunction for one overarching reason —that RGIS does not have a \nlikelihood o f success because  the district court lacks personal jurisdiction over  him.  Yet RGIS \nshowed that it would  likely rebut  this personal -jurisdiction defense  based on a waiver in the parties’ \nemployment agreement .  Cf. Ins. Corp. of Ireland Ltd. v. Compagnie des Bauxites de Guinee , 456 \nU.S. 694, 703 –04 (1982).   Although  Gerdes does not live in  Michigan, he signed an agreement \nwith a forum -selection clause stating that any dispute  arising from that agreement  “shall and must \nbe filed in” a state or fed eral court in Michigan .  RGIS , 2019 WL 3958392, at *3.  By signing this \nagreement, Gerdes consented to litigating  in the district court and likely waived his right to \nchallenge the district court’s personal jurisdiction over him.  See Stone Surgical, LLC v . Stryker       Case: 19-2051     Document: 28-2     Filed: 06/12/2020     Page: 3No. 19-2051,  RGIS, LLC v. Keith Gerdes  \n4 \n Corp. , 858 F.3d 383, 388 –89 (6th Cir. 2017); Preferred Capital, Inc. v. Assocs. in Urology , \n453 F.3d 718, 721 (6th Cir. 2006).  Gerdes’s  personal -jurisdiction defense thus provides no basis \nfor overturning the preliminary injunction.  \n3.  RGIS’s  Substantive Claims .  Gerdes lastly  argues that the district court wrongly grant ed \nan injunction based on  RGIS’s  breach -of-contract and misappropriation -of-trade -secrets claims.  \nWe disagree on both fronts.  \nGerdes initially asserts  that Michigan cour ts would not enforce his employment \nagreement’s noncompete provision because it is overbroad.  But the passage of time  has made  it \nunnecessary for us to resolve  this state-law contract question.  The part of t he preliminary \ninjunction  enforcing Gerdes’s on e-year noncompete  expired by its own terms in May 2020, one \nyear after Gerdes  left RGIS .  Because that part of the injunction no longer applies , we “have no \nway to grant [the requested] relief [.]”  Radiant Glob . Logistics, Inc. v. Furstenau , 951 F.3d 393, \n395–96 (6th Cir. 2020)  (per curiam).  Gerdes ’s challenge to this part of the injunction is thus moot.  \nId.; see also Hodges v. Schlinkert Sports Assocs., Inc. , 89 F.3d 310, 312 (6th Cir. 1996).  \nGerdes next asser ts that the district court  mistakenly grant ed an injunction prohibiting him \nfrom misappropriatin g RGIS’s trade  secrets.  The district court did not abuse its discretion in \ngranting this part of the injunction.  We s tart with the “ all-important likelihood -of-success ” factor , \na factor that we review de novo .  S. Glazer’s Distribs. of Ohio, LLC v. Great Lakes Brewing Co. , \n860 F.3d 844, 849, 854 (6th Cir. 2017).  \nRGIS brought claims under both federal  and state law.  The Michigan Uniform Trade \nSecret s Act  permits courts to enjoin the “[a]ctual or threatened misappropriation” of a trade secret.  \nMich. Comp. Laws §  445.1903 (1).  The Act  defines “misappropriation” to include the \n“[d]isclosure or use of a trade secret of another without express or implied  consent by a person       Case: 19-2051     Document: 28-2     Filed: 06/12/2020     Page: 4No. 19-2051,  RGIS, LLC v. Keith Gerdes  \n5 \n who” “knew or had reason to know that his or her knowledge of the trade secret was . . . acquired \nunder circumstances giving rise to a duty to maintain its secrecy or limit its use [.]”  Id. \n§ 445.1902(b) (ii)(B).  And the Act  defines “t rade secret” to mean “information” that derives \neconomic value from being kept secret and that is subject to reasonable efforts to keep it secret.  \nId. § 445.1902(d).  In the Defend Trade Secrets Act of 2016, Pub. L. No. 114 -153, 130 Stat. 376, \nCongress also authorized trade -secret owners  to seek injunctions against  actual or threatened \nmisappropriation of trade secrets for products or services in interst ate commerce.  18 U.S.C. \n§ 1836 (b)(1), (3)(A) .  This federal law  define s “misappropriation” and “trade secret” in similar \nways.  Id. § 1839 (3), (5)(B)(ii)(III).  \nHere, t he district court viewed “the elements of misappropriation under” federal law as \n“substantially similar” to the elements of misappropriation under state law , so it “addresse[d] them \ntogether.”  RGIS , 2019 WL 3958392, at *5 n.3.  Likewise, the parties o n appeal treat the federal \nclaim as adopting legal standards that are coextensive with the standards that Michigan courts have \nadopted for the state claim .  For purposes of this appeal,  therefore,  we will follow the  parties’  lead \nand simply assume (without dec iding) that the federal law follows the same standards as the state  \nlaw.  Cf. Compulife Software Inc. v. Newman , __ F.3d __, 2020 WL 2549505, at *13 n.13 (11th \nCir. May 20, 2020).  \nRGIS showed  a likelihood of success that it could  satisfy both the “trade secret” and the \n“misappropriation” elements  of these claims.   Courts have found that these elements raise fact \nquestions reviewed  under the clear -error standard .  See, e.g. , Par Pharm., Inc. v.  QuVa Pharma, \nInc., 764 F.  App’x 273, 278 –79 (3d Cir. 2019) ; Brake Parts, Inc. v. Lewis , 443 F.  App’x 27, 30 –\n31 (6th Cir. 2011) .       Case: 19-2051     Document: 28-2     Filed: 06/12/2020     Page: 5No. 19-2051,  RGIS, LLC v. Keith Gerdes  \n6 \n Gerdes does not appear to dispute the “trade secret” element .  Declarations from senior \nRGIS  officials  explained  that Gerdes knew much  of the company’s  confidential “ business \ninformation,” see 18 U.S.C. §  1839(3); Mich. Comp. Laws §  445.1902(d), including its “strategic \nfuture planning, [its] plans for future use of software and [artificial intelligence] , [its] customer \nservice levels, [its] recruitment strategy, [its] business development strategy, its regional pricing \nstrategy, and its margins.”  The declarations added that RGIS had taken reasonable measures to \nkeep this  business information secret ( such as  by requiring  its employees , including  Gerdes , to \nsign confidentiality agreement s) and that this information derived independent value from not \nbeing generally known.  See 18 U.S.C. §  1839(3); Mich. Comp. Laws §  445.1902(d).  With no \ncontrary evidence  from Ger des, t he district court did not  clearly  err in finding that th is information  \nlikely qualifies as a “trade secret” under the broad legal definitions  in federal and Michigan  law.  \nRGIS , 2019 WL 3958392, at * 6; see also, e.g. , Par Pharm. , 764 F.  App’x at 278–79. \nThe district court also did not  clearly err when it found  that RGIS had shown  that Gerdes \nlikely would “misappropriate ” RGIS’s trade secrets.  See Brake Parts , 443 F.  App’x at 30–31; Par \nPharm. , 764 F.  App’x at 279 .  Under Michiga n law—which , again,  we treat as coextensive with \nfederal  law for this case —a party seeking an injunction based on  a former employee’s  “threatened \nmisappropriation” of trade secrets “must establish more than the existence of generalized trade \nsecrets and a competitor’s employment of the party’s former employee who has knowledge of \ntrade secrets.”  Actuator Specialties, Inc. v. Chinavare , 2011 WL 6004068, at *3 (Mich. Ct. App. \nDec. 1, 2011) (per curiam) (quoting CMI Int’l, Inc. v. Intermet Int’l Corp. , 649 N.W.2d 808, 813 \n(Mich. Ct. App. 2002)  (per curiam) ).  Yet additional proof  that the former employee  showed  a \n“lack of trustworthiness b eyond his decision to work for a competitor ,” including  his deception of  \nthe former employer  about accepting a position with the competitor,  can support a conclusion  that       Case: 19-2051     Document: 28-2     Filed: 06/12/2020     Page: 6No. 19-2051,  RGIS, LLC v. Keith Gerdes  \n7 \n the employee cannot be “trusted” to keep trade secrets confidential.  Actuator Specia lties, 2011 \nWL 6004068, at *3 (quoting CMI Int’ l, 649 N.W.2d at 813; PepsiCo, Inc. v. Redmond , 54 F.3d \n1262, 1270 (7th Cir. 1995) ). \nHere, RGIS identified specific  pieces of business information that qualify as trade secrets, \nand presented enough evidence to support a finding that Gerdes showed  a “lack of trustworthiness \nbeyond” merely deciding to work for a competitor .  Actuator Specialties , 2011 WL 6004068, at \n*4.  To begin with, the district court could conclude that Gerdes was deceptive  about his reasons \nfor leaving RGIS .  According to a declaration from an RGIS official, Gerdes  told the company  that \nhe needed more “personal time and that he was not sure what he was going to do next .”  Yet he \nimmediately went to work for a  “direct competitor.”  In addition,  Gerdes allegedly failed to return \n“at least a Surface Pro laptop device that was provided to him by RGIS, ” as he was required to do \nby his employment agreement  after resigning his position .  And, as the district court also noted, \nGerdes did not present any arguments  to counter  these points.  RGIS , 2019 WL 3958392, at * 6.  \nThe district court  thus did not clearly err when finding that RGIS would likely be able to prove \nthat Gerdes would misappropriate RGIS’s trade secrets u nder federal and Michigan law.  \nLastly, the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding that the remaining \npreliminary -injunction factors weighed in favor of the injunction.  On irreparable harm, the district \ncourt noted that a harm may qualify a s irreparable —that is, “not fully compensable by money \ndamages ”—“if the nature of the plaintiff’s loss would make damages difficult to calculate. ”  RGIS , \n2019 WL 3958392, at *7  (citing Basicomputer Corp. v. Scott , 973 F.2d 507, 511 (6th Cir. 1991)).  \nMost relevant to this p art of the injunction, the court found that any disclosure of RGIS’s trade \nsecrets  would harm its “ability to compete with its competitors.”  Id.  We have previously  upheld \nsimilar  findings of i rreparable harm.  See, e .g., Brake Parts , 443 F.  App’x at 32; Basicomputer       Case: 19-2051     Document: 28-2     Filed: 06/12/2020     Page: 7No. 19-2051,  RGIS, LLC v. Keith Gerdes  \n8 \n Corp. , 973 F.2d at 512.   Gerdes also does not dispute  the district court’s findings about  the other \ntwo preliminary -injunction factors , so he has forfeited any challenge  to them .  See, e.g. , Indeck \nEnergy Servs., Inc. v. Consumers Energy Co. , 250 F.3d 972, 979 (6th Cir. 2000).  \nIn sum, t he district court did not abuse its discretion by granting a preliminary injunction  \non this record .  We affirm.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: In the case of Fox v. Makin et al., the plaintiffs, Gregory Fox and Rita Fox, challenged a vaccination policy implemented by the Maine School Administrative District 51, alleging it violated constitutional rights. The court addressed several motions to seal sensitive documents, balancing public access with privacy, ultimately allowing for redactions and unsealing some deposition exhibits. Notably, the concern of artificial intelligence misuse was raised, highlighting worries about AI potentially manipulating or misusing sensitive deposition footage, though AI itself was not directly involved in the claims or holding.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: The primary legal issue in this decision was how to balance the public's right of access to judicial records with the privacy interests of the involved parties, particularly when documents contain sensitive information about minors and private family details.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court granted, in part, the motions to seal certain documents and required the unsealing of others with redactions. While upholding the need for transparency in judicial records, especially in public interest cases, the court permitted some privacy protection for the plaintiff's deposition transcripts and other sensitive documents.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine your parents are in a court case because they disagree with the school's vaccination rules. They want to keep some personal information about your family and personal life private, even though they have to share it in court. The judge decided which pieces of this information could stay secret and which needed to be shared with the public. Though they tried to keep some things private, the judge emphasized that the public generally has the right to see what's happening in court, especially in cases that people care a lot about. They also worried about people using computer programs to mess with the information if it was shared too widely.",

BACKGROUND  \nOn July 22, 2022, Dr. Gregory Fox, individually and as parent of C.F.,1 and \nRita Fox, individually and as parent of C.F. (jointly, the Plaintiffs), filed a lawsuit in \nthe Cumberland County Superior Court for the state of Maine against the state of \nMaine, the Maine Department of Education, Maine School Administrative District 51 \n(MSAD 51), and various state and local officials (collectively, the Defendants), \nalleging the Defendants violated the United States Constitution in promulgating and  \nimplementing a vaccination policy at MSAD 51.  Notice of Removal , Attach. 1, Compl. \n(ECF No. 1).  The Defendants initially identified themselves as forming two groups: \n \n1  The Court refers to Dr. Fox’s minor son by his initials, C.F., in accordance with the Federal \nRule of Civil Procedure 5.2.  See FED. R. CIV. P. 5.2(a)(3).   Case 2:22-cv-00251-JAW     Document 252     Filed 10/16/25     Page 1 of 9    PageID #:\n<pageID>2 \n the State Defendants (the state of Maine, the Maine Department of Education, and \nMaine Department of Education Commissioner Pender Makin) and the School \nDefendants (MSAD 51, MSAD 51 Superintendent Jeffrey Porter, Mabel I. Wilson \nElementary School Principal  Sally Loughlin, and Mabel I. Wilson Elementary School \nVice Principal Corey Munsey).  Id . at 1, 3.  On August 17, 2022, the case was removed \nto this Court.  Id . at 1-3.    \nWith the Court’s permission, the Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on \nDecember 14, 2022, that did not name either the state of Maine or the Maine \nDepartment of Education as defendants and thus left Commissioner Makin and the \nSchool Defendants as the on ly defendants.  Pls.’ Mot. to Am. Compl. (ECF No. 32); \nOrder (ECF No. 41); Pls.’ Am. Compl. (ECF No. 45).   \nNext, on August 16, 2023, ruling on motions to dismiss from Commissioner \nMakin and the School Defendants, respectively, the Court dismissed all claims \nagainst MSAD 51 and Principal Loughlin, who had retired, and further dismissed all \nclaims for money damages against Commissio ner Makin, Superintendent Porter, and \nMr. Munsey.2   Order on Defs.’ Mots. to Dismiss (ECF No. 81).  After the Court’s order, \nthe only surviving claims were against Commissioner Makin and the School \nDefendants (Superintendent Jeffrey Porter and Principal Corey Munsey) in their \nofficial capacities for declaratory and injunctive relief.3  Id.  On February 12, 2025, \n \n2  After Principal Loughlin retired, Mr. Munsey was promoted to principal of Mabel I. Wilson \nElementary School.  Order on Defs.’ Mots. to Dismiss at 5, n.7.   \n3  On November 20, 2023, the Plaintiffs moved to amend the amended complaint, seeking to \nmodify their prayer for relief based on C.F. aging out of Mabel I. Wilson Elementary School and to add \na claim for equitable reimbursement of the expenses paid to educate  C.F.  Pls.’ Second Mot. to Am. \nCompl. (ECF No. 90).  On February 22, 2024, a United States Magistrate Judge issued an order and Case 2:22-cv-00251-JAW     Document 252     Filed 10/16/25     Page 2 of 9    PageID #:\n<pageID>3 \n the parties filed a stipulation of dismissal, dismissing all claims brought by Rita Fox, \non her own behalf or on behalf of C.F., with prejudice and without fees or costs to any \nparty, Stip. of Dismissal (ECF No. 203), leaving Dr. Fox, individually and as parent \nof C.F., the sole plaintiff.     \n On June 6, 2025, following a period of discovery and motion practice,  \nCommissioner Makin, the School Defendants, and Dr. Fox each filed respective \nmotions for summary judgment.  Comm’r Makin’s Mot. for Summ. J. (ECF No. 214); \nSchool Defs.’ Mot. for Summ. J. (ECF No. 215); Pl.’s Mot. for Summ. J. (ECF No. 216).  \nIn support of their respective motions, the Defendants  filed a joint statement of \nmaterial facts.  Defs.’ Joint Supporting Statement of Material Facts (ECF No. 212).  \nBecause of the purported sensit ive nature of some supporting documents in the \nDefendants’ Joint Statement of Material of Facts, they also filed a joint motion to seal, wholly and indefinitely, those documents.  Defs.’ Joint Mot. to Seal . (ECF No. \n213) ( Defs.’ Joint Mot. ).   \nOn August 23, 2025, Dr. Fox filed oppositions to Commissioner Makin’s and \nthe School Defendants’ summary judgment motions.  Pl. Dr. Fox’s Opp’n to Comm., Makin’s Mot. for Summ. J.  (ECF No. 228); Pl. Dr. Fox’s Opp’n to School Defs.’ Mot. \n \nrecommended decision on the second motion to amend complaint, recommending the Court grant the \nmotion to amend the complaint insofar as it requests placement in the relevant school for the age of the Plaintiffs’ child at the time of the judgment but deny t he motion insofar as it requests equitable \nreimbursement .  Order and Recommended Decision on Mot. to Am. Compl. at 13 (ECF No. 96).  On \nJuly 11, 2024, over the objection of Dr. Fox, the Court affirmed the Magistrate Judge’s recommended decision.  Order on Obj. to Recommended Decision (ECF No. 118).  Ms. Fox filed her second amended complaint on July 14, 2024, and Dr. Fox filed his second amended complaint on August 1, 2024, each of which incorporated the contents of the first amended complaint with revisions to the prayers for relief.  Pl. Rita Fox’s Second Am. Compl. (ECF No. 119); Pl. Gregory Fox’s Second Am. Compl. (ECF \nNo. 127).   Case 2:22-cv-00251-JAW     Document 252     Filed 10/16/25     Page 3 of 9    PageID #:\n<pageID>4 \n Summ. J. (ECF No. 229).   A few days later, on August 25, Dr. Fox moved to seal \ncertain deposition transcripts cited in his recently filed oppositions.  Pl. Dr. Fox’s \nMotion to Seal  (ECF No. 231) (Dr. Fox’s Mot. ).  Similar to the Defendants’ Joint \nMotion to Seal, Dr. Fox requested sealing certain deposition transcripts on the \ngrounds they “contain[] confidential or sensitive information.”  Id . at 1.   \nOn August 27, 2025, the Court issued an order requiring the parties to respond \nto its concerns about the overbreadth of their motions to seal.  Order to Resp. (ECF \nNo. 235).  On September 8, 2025, Commissioner Makin responded to the order to \nrespond.  Comm’r Makin’s Resp. to Ct.’s Order to Resp. (ECF No. 237) ( Makin Resp. ).  \nOn September 9, 2025, the School Defendants filed their response to the order to \nrespond.  Sch. Defs.’ Resp. to Ct.’s Order to Resp. (ECF No. 241) ( Sch. Defs.’ Resp. ).  \nOn September 11, 2025, Dr. Fox filed his response.  Pl.’s Mem. Responding in Support of Redaction and Sealing of Dep. Trs. (ECF 235) (ECF No. 247) (Dr. Fox Resp. ).  \nII. THE PARTIES’ RESPONSES\n \nA.  Commissioner Makin’s Response  \nIn the Commissioner’s response, she conceded that she took a “conservative \napproach” in moving t o seal the summary judgment record.  Makin Resp. at 1.   Upon \nreview of the Court order, the Commissioner agreed that the exhibits to Jessica \nShiminski ’s declaration could be unsealed.  Id.  The Commissioner took no position \nregarding the School Defendants’ response and wrote that she would not object to the redaction of the deposition transcripts of Gregory and Rita Fox  in accordance with Case 2:22-cv-00251-JAW     Document 252     Filed 10/16/25     Page 4 of 9    PageID #:\n<pageID>5 \n Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 5.2 and the consent -to confidentiality order .  Id. at 1-\n2; Consent -to Confidentiality Order (ECF No. 87) .   \nB.  The School Defendants’ Response  \nIn the School Defendants’ response, they addressed each filing separately.  Sch. \nDefs.’ Resp. at 1-4.  First, they agreed that exhibits to Superintendent Porter’s \ndeposition could be unsealed and made public since C.F.’s full name and date of birth \nwould be redacted.  Id. at 2-3.  Next, they took no position on the sealing of the \nShiminski exhibits.  Id. at 1.  They also agreed with Commissioner Makin and did \nnot object to redacting the Fox deposition transcripts in accordance with Rule 5.2 and \nthe confidentiality order.  Id. at 1 -2.  Regarding the deposition transcripts of \nSuperintendent Porter and Principal Munsey , the School Defendants proposed \nredactions as opposed to wholesale sealing.  Id. at 3-4.   \nC.  Dr. Fox’s Response  \nFirst, Dr. Fox observes that the deposition transcripts of both his wife and \nhimself contain “extensive medical information regarding minor children, as well as \nprivate details about family affairs, religious beliefs, and personal history.”  Dr. Fox \nResp. at 2.  Dr. Fox seeks “targeted redaction and, where necessary, sealing of clusters \nof medical information.”  Id.  In addition to the privacy concerns about publi shing  \nhealth, vaccination status, and medical care of minor children, Dr. Fox points to \n“docume nted harassment, social isolation, and exclusion directed at Plaintiff’s \nchildren and family.”  Id.  Also, Dr. Fox says his proposed redactions protect “only Case 2:22-cv-00251-JAW     Document 252     Filed 10/16/25     Page 5 of 9    PageID #:\n<pageID>6 \n non-public, non -essential information.”  Id.  Dr. Fox points out that the Court will \nhave access to all information for its analysis and decision -making.  Id.   \nDr. Fox notes that pursuant to a court order, the videotape of Dr. Blaisdell’s \ndeposition was sealed to  minimize the risk of harassment and the potential for \ntechnological misuse.  Id. at 3.  Dr. Fox worries that the availability of a transcript \nwill create “a real risk of misuse, including selective editing, out -of-context \npublication, and manipulation by artificial intelligence.”  Id.  Dr. Fox urges the Court \nto “apply the same protective rationale as in the Blaisdell order, and permit targeted \nredaction and partial sealing of clusters of medical information in the Fox deposition.”  \nId. at 4.  Dr. Fox observes that the issues in this case – involving state government \nauthority, individual medical autonomy, and religious liberty – “are inherently \npolarizing and likely to provoke strong responses from activists and the public.”  Id. \nat 5.  Dr. Fox reviews the extensive coverage of this controversy by the Bangor Daily \nNews.  Id. at 6-7; id., Attach. 1 at 2- 3. \nIII. DISCUSSION  \n In their motions to seal, the parties requested that the Court seal the following:  \n(1) The exhibi ts to the Declaration of Jeffrey Porter;  \n(2) The exhibits to the Declaration of Jessica Shiminski;  \n(3) The deposition transcripts of Corey Munsey and Jeffrey Porter; and  \n(4) The deposition transcripts of Dr. and Ms. Fox;  \nFirst, the Court agrees that the exhibits to the declarations of Jeffrey Porter and \nJessica Shiminski may be unsealed since the se documents as resubmitted contain Case 2:22-cv-00251-JAW     Document 252     Filed 10/16/25     Page 6 of 9    PageID #:\n<pageID>7 \n redactions of C.F.’s full name and date of birth.  Second, t he Court agrees with the  \nSchool Defendants ’ proposed redactions of the deposition transcripts of Corey Munsey \nand Jeffrey Porter.   \n Third, although the Court respects Dr. Fox’s efforts to maintain his and his \nfamily’s privacy, he has elected to file a lawsuit in federal court, where there is a right \nof public access to judicial records, and his proposed redactions to his wife’s and his \ndepositions are too extensive to comply with the First Circuit’s teaching in United \nStates v. Kravetz , 706 F.3d 47 (1st Cir. 2013) , that mandates a presumption of public \naccess to judicial records .  Compare Additional Attachs. Attach. 1, Dr. Fox Redacted \nDep. Tr. (ECF No. 248) (Dr. Fox Redacted Tr. ), with Pl. Gregory Fox’s Mot. to Seal , \nAttach. 1 , Dr. Fox Sealed and Unredacted Dep. Tr. (ECF No. 231) (Dr. Fox Unredacted \nDep. Tr. ).  For example, in his redacted version, Dr. Fox redacts the list of exhibits to \nhis deposition. See Dr. Fox Redacted Dep. Tr. at 3.  The Court does not know why \nmerely a list of exhibits implicates any privacy concerns.  Dr. Fox also redacts \nreferences to his post -secondary education.  See Dr. Fox Redacted Tr. at 13 :10-16:20.  \nAgain, especially as Dr. Fox is being referred to by his professional title in this litigation, the Court does not understand why his education, which is generally a \nmatter of public record, should be redacted from the docketed transcript.  The Court \ncould go on .   \nIn brief, the Court  concludes that Dr. Fox has been much too aggressive in \nprotecting his and his family’s privacy in his proposed redactions to comply with the \nright of public access described in Kravetz.  Even so , the Court will allow Dr. Fox’s Case 2:22-cv-00251-JAW     Document 252     Filed 10/16/25     Page 7 of 9    PageID #:\n<pageID>8 \n redactions to stand for the moment.  The parties filed the complete transcripts of each \nwitness at the Court’s request.  The Court has discovered that when the parties file \nsnippets of deposition transcripts in support of their statements of material fact,  it is \noften difficult to understand the full context by the abridged versions alone.  Thus,  \nthe entire  transcript is not being submitted as a judicial record, and therefore falls \non the edge of Kravetz .  Instead, as the Court works through the facts submi tted by \nthe parties in support of the dispositive motions, if it is necessary to cite a portion of \nDr. Fox’s redactions, the Court will order that portion unredacted.   \n As a final caution , if this case goes to trial, the Court will enforce rigorously \nthe right of public access, particularly as this case involves matters of public concern.  This does not mean that evidence revealing the name and other details of the minor \nwill be made publi c, but it does mean that the parties, including Dr. Fox, should \nanticipate that broad redactions similar to those contained in Dr. Fox’s submissions \nwill not remain confidential in a public trial.   \nIV. CONCLUSION\n \n The Court GRANTS in part and DENIES in part Def endants’  Joint Mot ion to \nSeal.  (ECF No. 213).  The Court UNSEALS the deposition exhibits to the Declarations \nof Jeffrey Porter and Jessica Shiminski and UNSEALS as redacted the deposition transcripts of Corey Munsey and Jeffrey Porter.  \nThe Court GRANTS in part and DENIES in part Plaintiff Dr. Fox’s Motion to \nSeal (ECF No. 231).  The Court UNSEALS as redacted the deposition transcripts of \nDr. Gregory Fox and Rita Fox.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: Plaintiff Michael Anthony Allen filed a pro se civil rights lawsuit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 against social media companies alleging exposure to harmful AI emissions leading to thoughts of suicide and other harms. The court identified deficiencies in the complaint, notably that defendants are not state actors under § 1983 and that Plaintiff's claims lack an arguable legal and factual basis, suggesting they are frivolous.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the Plaintiff’s complaint under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 plausibly alleges harm caused by state actors or those acting under color of state law.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court provisionally granted Plaintiff leave to proceed in forma pauperis, required Plaintiff to correct deficiencies in his financial documentation, and ordered him to show cause why his complaint should not be dismissed for naming no state actors and for being legally frivolous.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: A man in jail claims big companies like Facebook hurt him using bad technology that made him think crazy thoughts. He tries to sue them claiming they acted like government officials, but since they're private companies, the court says his case doesn't work under the law he used. The court tells him he needs to better explain his claims or risk having his case thrown out.\n",
    "full_text": "1 \n IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF KANSAS \n \nMICHAEL ANTHONY ALLEN, \n         \n  Plaintiff,    \n \nv.        CASE NO. 24-3057-JWL  \nFACEBOOK.,  et al.,    Defendants.    \nMEMORANDUM AND ORDER TO SHOW CAUSE \n \n Plaintiff Michael Anthony Alle n is hereby required to show good cause, in writing to the \nundersigned, why this action should not be dismis sed due to the deficien cies in Plaintiff’s \nComplaint that are di scussed herein.   \n1.  Nature of the Matter before the Court   \n Plaintiff brings this pro se civil right s action under 42 U.S.C.  § 1983. Plaintiff is \nincarcerated at the El Dorado Corr ectional Facility in El Dorado, Ka nsas.  Plaintiff filed a motion \nfor leave to proceed in forma pa uperis, but failed to provide th e financial information required by \n28 U.S.C. § 1915(a)(2).  Therefore, the Court is sued a Notice of Deficiency (Doc. 4) (“NOD”) \ngranting Plaintiff until May 17, 2024, to supply the missing information.  Th e Court provisionally \ngrants Plaintiff leave to proceed in forma pauperis.  Plaintiff must still supply the missing financial \ninformation by the deadline in the NOD.  Plaintiff’s Complaint is largely incomprehe nsible and appears to bring claims against \nvarious social media companies.  Plaintiff seems to allege that he  was exposed to “illegal A.I.” \nemissions when he started hearing voices in 2019.  (Doc. 1, at 2.)  He sugges ts that  social media \nplatforms used “human induced psychosis in 2021 that cause thought of  suicide in 2021.”  Id.  \nPlaintiff claims that “emitter technology can be  linked to human freque ncy that cause human Case 5:24-cv-03057-JWL   Document 5   Filed 04/25/24   Page 1 of 82 \n induced psychosis a wifi techno logy little black box t echnology ultra sound beam air technology \nthat has side effect of thought of suicide self harm if not suic ide the illegal A.I. can lead to human \ndeath.”  Id. at 4.  Plaintiff alleges that  this has led to stalking and bullying through the company \nwifi and frequency targeting with illegal A.I.  Id. at 5. \n Plaintiff names as defendants:  Facebook; Me ta; Instagram; Twitter; Mark Zuckerberg; and \nMichael Zuckerberg.  For relief, Plaintiff seeks:  compensation; an apology;  to have the FBI stop \nsocial media from using illegal artificial intelligence;  to be taken out of the Kansas Department of \nCorrections’ “wifi and frequency and so cial media wifi and frequency.”  Id. at 6.   \nII.  Statutory Screening of Prisoner Complaints    The Court is required to screen complaints brought by prisoners seek ing relief against a \ngovernmental entity or an officer or an employee  of a governmental entity. 28 U.S.C. § 1915A(a).  \nThe Court must dismiss a complaint or portion ther eof if a plaintiff has raised claims that are \nlegally frivolous or malicious, that fail to state a claim upon which relief ma y be granted, or that \nseek monetary relief from a defe ndant who is immune from such relief. 28 U.S.C. § 1915A(b)(1)–\n(2).    “To state a claim under § 1983, a plaintiff must allege the vi olation of a right secured by \nthe Constitution and laws of the United States, and must show that the alleged deprivation was \ncommitted by a person  acting under color of state law.”  West v. Atkins, 487 U.S. 42, 48 \n(1988)(citations omitted); Northington v. Jackson , 973 F.2d 1518, 1523 (10th Cir. 1992).  A court \nliberally construes a pro se complaint and applies “less stringent standards than formal pleadings \ndrafted by lawyers.”  Erickson v. Pardus , 551 U.S. 89, 94 (2007).  In addition, the court accepts \nall well-pleaded allegations in the complaint as true.  Anderson v. Blake , 469 F.3d 910, 913 (10th \nCir. 2006).  On the other hand, “when the allegations  in a complaint, howeve r true, could not raise Case 5:24-cv-03057-JWL   Document 5   Filed 04/25/24   Page 2 of 83 \n a claim of entitlement to relief,” dismissal is appropriate.  Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly , 550 \nU.S. 544, 558 (2007).   \nA pro se litigant’s “conclusory allegations  without supporting fa ctual averments are \ninsufficient to state a claim upon which relief can be based.”  Hall v. Bellmon , 935 F.2d 1106, \n1110 (10th Cir. 1991).  “[A] plaintiff’s obligatio n to provide the ‘grounds’ of  his ‘entitle[ment] to \nrelief’ requires more than labels and conclusions, and a formulaic recitation of the elements of a \ncause of action.”  Twombly , 550 U.S. at 555 (citations omitte d).  The compla int’s “factual \nallegations must be enough to ra ise a right to relief above the sp eculative level” and “to state a \nclaim to relief that is plausible on its face.”  Id. at 555, 570.   \nThe Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals has explained “that, to state a claim in federal court, a \ncomplaint must explain what each defendant did to [the pro se plaintiff]; when the defendant did \nit; how the defendant’s action harmed  [the plaintiff]; and, what specific legal right the plaintiff \nbelieves the defendant violated.”  Nasious v. Two Unknown B.I.C.E. Agents , 492 F.3d 1158, 1163 \n(10th Cir. 2007).  The court “will not  supply additional factual allega tions to round out a plaintiff’s \ncomplaint or construct a legal theory on a plaintiff’s behalf.”  Whitney v. New Mexico , 113 F.3d \n1170, 1173-74 (10th Cir. 1997) (citation omitted). \nThe Tenth Circuit has pointed out that  the Supreme Court’s decisions in Twombly  and \nErickson  gave rise to a new standard of revi ew for § 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) dismissals.  See Kay v. \nBemis , 500 F.3d 1214, 1218 (10th Cir. 2007)(citations omitted); see also  Smith v. United States , \n561 F.3d 1090, 1098 (10th Cir. 2009).  As a result, courts “look to th e specific allegations in the \ncomplaint to determin e whether they plausibly support a legal claim fo r relief.”  Kay, 500 F.3d at \n1218 (citation omitted).  Under this new standard, “a plaintiff must ‘nudge his claims across the \nline from conceivable to plausible.’”  Smith , 561 F.3d at 1098 (citation omitted).  “Plausible” in Case 5:24-cv-03057-JWL   Document 5   Filed 04/25/24   Page 3 of 84 \n this context does not mean “likely to be true,” but rather refers “to the scope of the allegations in \na complaint: if they are so ge neral that they encompass a wide  swath of conduct, much of it \ninnocent,” then the plaintiff has not “nudged [his ] claims across the line  from conceivable to \nplausible.”  Robbins v. Oklahoma , 519 F.3d 1242, 1247 (10th Cir. 2008) (citing Twombly , 127 S. \nCt. at 1974).   III.  DISCUSSION  Plaintiff states that he is bringing his cl aims under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.  “To state a claim \nunder § 1983, a plaintiff must allege the violation of a right secured by the Constitution and laws \nof the United States, and must show that the alleged deprivation was committed by a person acting \nunder color of state law.”  West v. Atkins , 487 U.S. 42, 48 (1988) (citatio ns omitted).  A defendant \nacts “under color of state law” when he “exercise [s] power ‘possessed by vi rtue of state law and \nmade possible only because the wrongdoer is clothed with the authority of state law.’”  Id. at 49 \n(citations omitted).   \n Plaintiff fails to plausibly claim that any of the Defendants are state actors.  See Bethune v. \nFacebook Inc. , 2021 WL 5182246, at *2 (D. Minn. Oct. 15, 2021) (“Neither Facebook nor \nZuckerberg is alleged, or can pl ausibly be alleged, to be a ‘sta te actor’ within the meaning of \n§ 1983.”) (citing see Prager Univ. v. Google LLC , 951 F.3d 991, 997 n.3 (9th Ci r. 2020) (c ollecting \ncases for proposition that private social-media companies such as and including Facebook are not \nstate actors for purposes of § 1983).   “Federal courts have uniformly rejected attemp ts to treat  . . .  social media companies as \nstate actors under Section 1983.”  Rutenburg v. Twitter, Inc. , 2021 WL 1338958, at *2 (N.D.

Not only has Plaintiff failed to na me a state actor, but his claims also appear to be frivolous.  \n“A complaint . . . is frivolous when it ‘lacks an  arguable basis either in  law or in fact.’”  Manco v.

The Tenth Circuit in Manco held that: \nThe district court also did not ab use its discretion when it held \nManco’s claims related to the alleged tracking device were \nfrivolous. Manco’s theory that nume rous state officials monitor his \nthoughts and send him inaudible, prof ane messages is not supported \nby any evidence. Manco provides c itations to various patents and \nsecondary literature that describe tracking devices. Even if, for the \nsake of argument, this court assumes that such  devices exist, Manco \nfails to provide evidence that officials implanted a device in his body, nor does he give a plausible motive for stat e officials to \nembark on such an endeavor. We agree with the district court that Manco’s tracking device cl aims are frivolous. See Denton v. \nHernandez,  504 U.S. 25, 33, 112 S.Ct. 1728, 118 L.Ed.2d 340 \n(1992) (describing frivolous claims as “fanciful,” “fantastic,” and \n“delusional,” and holding “a findi ng of factual frivolousness is \nappropriate when the facts alleged rise to the level of the irrational or the wholly incredible, whether or not there are judicially noticeable facts available to contradict them”). \n  \n Id.   \n Plaintiff should show good cause why his Comp laint should not be dismissed as frivolous \nand for failure to name a state actor. \nIV.  Motion for Appointment of Counsel  \n Plaintiff has filed a motion for appointmen t of counsel, arguing that he has no family \nsupport, no job, and no access to information on lawyers or thei r phone numbers.  (Doc. 3, at 3–\n4.)     \nThe Court has considered Plai ntiff’s motion for appointment of counsel.  There is no \nconstitutional right to  appointment of counsel  in a civil case.  Durre v. Dempsey , 869 F.2d 543, \n547 (10th Cir. 1989); Carper v. DeLand , 54 F.3d 613, 616 (10th Cir. 1995).  The decision whether \nto appoint counsel in a civi l matter lies in the discreti on of the district court.  Williams v. Meese , \n926 F.2d 994, 996 (10th Cir. 1991).  “The burden is on the applicant to c onvince the court that Case 5:24-cv-03057-JWL   Document 5   Filed 04/25/24   Page 6 of 87 \n there is sufficient merit to  his claim to warrant the appointment of counsel.”  Steffey v. Orman , 461 \nF.3d 1218, 1223 (10th Cir. 2006) (quoting Hill v. SmithKline Beecham Corp. , 393 F.3d 1111, 1115 \n(10th Cir. 2004)).  It is not enough “that havi ng counsel appointed would have assisted [the \nprisoner] in presenting his strongest  possible case, [as] the same c ould be said in any case.”  Steffey , \n461 F.3d at 1223 (quoting Rucks v. Boergermann , 57 F.3d 978, 979 (10th Cir. 1995)).   \nIn deciding whether to appoint counsel, courts must evaluate “the merits of a prisoner’s \nclaims, the nature and complexity of the factual and legal issues, and the prisoner’s ability to \ninvestigate the facts and present his claims.”  Hill, 393 F.3d at 1115 (citing Rucks , 57 F.3d at 979).  \nThe Court concludes in this case that  (1) it is not clear at this junctu re that Plaintiff has asserted a \ncolorable claim against a named defendant; (2) the i ssues are not complex; and (3) Plaintiff appears \ncapable of adequately presenting facts and argumen ts.  The Court has found that the Complaint is \nsubject to dismissal as frivolous and for failure to  name a state actor.  The Court therefore denies \nthe motion for appointment of counsel.   \nV.  Response Required \nPlaintiff is required to show  good cause why his Complaint sh ould not be dismissed for the \nreasons stated herein.  Failure to respond by the deadline may result in dism issal of this action \nwithout further notice for fail ure to state a claim.   \n IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED  THAT  Plaintiff’s motion for leave to proceed in forma \npauperis (Doc. 2) is provisionally granted .

    "summary": "1. **Summary:**\n   Shira Perlmutter, the former Register of Copyrights of the U.S. Copyright Office, sought a preliminary injunction following what she argued was her unlawful removal by President Trump. The court denied her request, ruling that Perlmutter did not demonstrate she would suffer irreparable harm from the removal. Notably, while the case involves an ongoing report on copyright and artificial intelligence, the applicability of AI in the decision is limited to the procedural context and does not directly influence the court's ruling.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue:**\n   Whether Shira Perlmutter’s removal from her position as Register of Copyrights constitutes irreparable harm that warrants a preliminary injunction.\n\n3. **Court's Holding:**\n   The court held that Perlmutter did not sufficiently demonstrate irreparable harm resulting from her temporary removal, failing to satisfy the requirements for a preliminary injunction in government personnel matters.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation:**\n   Imagine you were suddenly told you couldn't be the class president anymore, and someone else took over. You go to the teacher (the court) and say, \"Hey, it's not fair! I should still be president because I was never properly removed.\" You argue that not being the class president right now is causing you big, un-fixable problems. The teacher looks at your request and decides, \"Sorry, but I don't see that you're experiencing the kind of serious issues that can't be undone later if we find out you were right.\" In this case, the teacher (the judge) is saying, \"Being temporarily out of your position isn't the kind of harm that makes me step in with an urgent fix.\"",
    "full_text": "UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT  \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA  \n  \nCivil Action No.  25-1659  (TJK)  SHIRA PERLMUTTER , \nPlaintif f, \nv. \nTODD BLANCHE et al. , \nDefendant s. \n \nMEMORANDUM OPINION  \nOn May 10, 2025, Shira Perlmutter was purportedly fired by President Trump from her \nposition as Register of Copyrights and Director of the U.S. Copyright Office  at the Library of \nCongress.  A rguing that this attempt to terminate her was unlawful, she sued a few weeks later and \nthen moved for a preliminary injunction, seeking to prevent her removal .  The Court will deny her \nmotion because she has not shown that she will be irreparably harmed without this relief.  \nI. Background  \nA. Factual Background  \nOn May 8, 2025, President Trump removed Carla D. Hayden  as Librarian of Congress.  \nECF No. 24 -3 ¶ 5.  Two days later, acting through another official , he similarly purported to re-\nmove Perlmutter as head of the Copyright Office via an email that terminate d her “ effective im-\nmediately.”  Id. ¶ 9.  And the next day, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche —whom President \nTrump had “directed to perform the duties of the office of the Librarian of Congress” following \nthe former Librarian’s removal, ECF No. 24 -5 at 3 —“designate [d] Paul Perkins” to replace Perl-\nmutter “as the Acting Register of Copyrights and Acting Director of the U.S. Copyright Office,” \nid. at 2.  For her part, Perlmutter maintains that she “remain[ s] Register of Copyrights” and that Case 1:25-cv-01659-TJK     Document 40     Filed 07/30/25     Page 1 of 15 2 she has “not received any communication from Library of Congress leadership that purports to \nterminate [her] employment as Register of Copyrights.”  Id. ¶¶ 12–13. \nB. Procedural History  \nPerlmutter claims that “the purported appointments of ” Blanche and Perkins “ have caused \nconsiderable confusion among Library staff, copyright stakeholders, and the public” and will “im-\npede the Copyright Office’s ability to perform its work.”  ECF No. 24 -3 ¶¶ 11, 15.  So o n May 22, \n2025, she sued, bringing two counts challenging her purported removal and the President’s ap-\npointment of Blanche as the Acting Librarian of Congress.  ECF No. 1 ¶¶ 26–36.  She also moved \nfor a temporary restraining order .  ECF No.  2.  On May 28, t he Court denied  her motion , conclud-\ning that she had  not shown  that she would suffer irreparable harm  without that relief .  ECF No. 15  \nat 36 –52.  Then,  on June 10, Perlmutter moved for a preliminary injunction , ECF No. 24, and the \nCourt held a hearing on the motion on July 23.  \nII. Legal Standard  \n“A preliminary injunction is an extraordinary remedy never awarded as of right.”  Winter \nv. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc. , 555 U.S. 7, 24 (2008).  “A plaintiff seeking a preliminary injunction \nmust establish that he is likely to succeed on the merits, that he is likely to suffer irreparable harm \nin the absence of preliminary relief, that the balance of equities tips in his f avor, and that an in-\njunction is in the public interest.”  Id. at 20.  “[P]laintiffs bear the burden of persuasion on all four \npreliminar y injunction factors.”  Open Top Sightseeing USA v. Mr. Sightseeing, LLC , 48 F. Supp. \n3d 87, 90 (D.D.C. 2014).   Thus, “failure to show a likelihood of irreparable harm” is, “standing \nalone, sufficient to defeat the motion.”  Brennan Ctr. for Just. at NYU Sch. of L. v. Dep ’t of Com. , \n498 F. Supp. 3d 87, 96 (D.D.C. 2020) (quoting Navajo Nation v. Azar , 292 F. Supp. 3d 508, 512 \n(D.D.C. 2018)).  \nThe D.C. Circuit “ has set a high standard for irreparable injury. ”  Chaplaincy of Full Gospel Case 1:25-cv-01659-TJK     Document 40     Filed 07/30/25     Page 2 of 15 3 Churches v. England , 454 F.3d 290 , 297  (D.C. Cir. 2006) .  “[T] he injury must be both certain and \ngreat; it must be actual and not theoretical. ”  Wis. Gas Co. v. FERC , 758 F.2d 669, 674 (D.C. Cir. \n1985)  (per curiam).  “T he party seeking injunctive relief must show that the injury complained of \nis of such imminence  that there is a clear and present need for equitable relief to prevent irreparable \nharm.” Id. (cleaned up).  In other words, “[t] he movant must provide proof that the harm has oc-\ncurred in the past and is likely to occur again, or proof  indicating that the harm is certain to occur \nin the near future. ”  Id.  Furthermore, “ the movant must show that the alleged harm will directly \nresult  from the action which the movant seeks to enjoin. ”  Id. (emphasis added) .  Finally, the injury \nmust be truly “irreparable” —i.e., “beyond remediation.” Chaplaincy of Full Gospel Churches , 454 \nF.3d at 297.  \nIII. Analysis  \nThe Court ’s analysis begins and ends with irreparable harm .  Perlmutter argues that her \nremoval from office —even if only temporary —is irreparable harm that can only be prevented by \na preliminary injunct ion.  T he Court is unconvinced , so it will deny her motion.  \nThe Supreme Court has instructed  that the loss of a job and the harms that go along with it \ngenerally “ will not support a finding of irreparable injury, however severely they may affect a \nparticular individual. ”  Sampson v. Murray , 415 U.S. 61, 92 n.68 (1974) .  “That is particularly true \nin cases involving government employment. ”  English v. Trump , 279 F. Supp. 3d 307, 334 (D.D.C. \n2018 ).  Indeed, the Sampson Court emphasized “ that the Government has traditionally been \ngranted the widest latitude in the ‘dispatch of its own internal affairs .’”  415 U.S.  at 83 (quoting \nCafeteria & Restaurant Workers Union, Local 473, A.F.L.—C.I.O. v. McElroy , 367 U.S. 886, 896 \n(1961) ).  And it noted that, even outside the government context, courts of equity are “tradi-\ntional [ly] unwilling []” “to enforce contracts for personal service either at the behest of the em-\nployer or of the employee .”  Id.  The Court also relied on “the historical denial of all equitable Case 1:25-cv-01659-TJK     Document 40     Filed 07/30/25     Page 3 of 15 4 relief by the federal courts ” when  a plaintiff sought, “by injunction, [to] restrain an executive of-\nficer from making a wrongful removal of a subordinate appointee.”  Id. at 71, 83 (quoting White \nv. Berry , 171 U.S. 366, 377 (1898) ).  For these reasons,  preliminary equitable intervention in gov-\nernment -personnel cases is disfavored, and the plaintiff must at least demonstrate that her case \ninvolves a  “genuinely extraordinary situation ” to obtain  interim relief.   Id. at 92  n.68.  Such a \nshowing must establish that  “the circumstances surroundin g [her] discharge, together with the re-\nsultant effect on [her], . . . so far depart from the normal situation that irreparable injury might be \nfound. ”  Id.  Only then will she have shown “ irreparable injury sufficient in kind and degree to \noverride these factors cutting against the general availability of preliminary injunctions in Gov-\nernment personnel cases. ”  Id. at 84.1 \nPerlmutter argues that this case presents a “genuinely extraordinary situation” for three \nreasons:  (1) she has been deprived of her “‘statutory right to function ’ as Register of Copyrights,” \nECF No. 24 -2 at 34; (2) she “ remains Register of Copyrights and is therefore required to fulfill her \nstatutory duties ,” id. at 37; and (3) “[i]rreparable harm to the Library of Congress and Copyright \nOffice will frustrate [her]  ability to resume her duties,” id. at 39.   As explained below, each of \nthese arguments fail s. \nA. Perlmutter’s Temporary Loss of Her “Statutory  Right to Function”  While the \nCourt Resolves the Merits of Her Case  Is Not an Irreparable Harm  \nPerlmutter  first argues that this case warrants preliminary injunctive relief b ecause her \n \n1 At times , Perlmutter appears to suggest that the importance of her position  should play a \nrole in the Court’s analysis of whether this situation is  “genuinely extraordinary .”  E.g., ECF No. \n24-2 at 32.   Perhaps this is a response to  the Sampson  plaintiff ’s status as  a “probationary em-\nployee.”  415 U.S. at 62.   The reasoning in Sampson , though, did not appear to turn on the seniority \nof the employee .  Thus, the Court assigns little weight to this factor .  To be sure, such a consider-\nation is not irrelevant.  But it does little to show that “the circumstances surrounding [her]  dis-\ncharge, together with the resultant effect on [her],  . . . so far depart from the normal situation that \nirreparable injury might be found. ”  Sampson , 415 U.S. at 92 n.6 8. Case 1:25-cv-01659-TJK     Document 40     Filed 07/30/25     Page 4 of 15 5 removal  depriv es her  of her “statutory right to function” as the Register of Copyrights.  ECF No. \n24-2 at 32, 34 (quotation omitted).   Not so.   In the first case purport ing to recognize such a right , \nthe court found that the plaintiffs had shown irreparable harm because , without a preliminary in-\njunction , the court could not reinstate the m to their positions later on—because the positions would \nno longer exist.  See Berry v. Reagan , No. 83 -3182, 1983 WL 538  (D.D.C. Nov. 14, 1983) .  Noth-\ning similarly irremedi able is at stake here.  \nIn Berry , President Carter had appointed the plaintiffs, with the advice and consent of the \nSenate, to the Commission on Civil Rights.   Id. at *1.   That body did not have a fixed term for \nmembers; by statute, it expired 60 days after the date established for submission of its final report, \nSeptember 30, 1983 .  Id. at *1  n.1.  The Commission ap parently did not meet  this deadline , leaving \nit racing to finish the report before it dissolved on November 29.   Id. at *5.  But President Reagan \nfired the plaintiffs before the Commission submitted its report, so they sued.  Id. at *1 .  After \nconcluding  that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on the merits, the court found that they had \nestablished irreparable injury to “their statutory right to function as Commissioners .”  Id. at *5 .  \nAccording to that court, “[t]he irreparable nature of this injury is evident by the obviously disrup-\ntive effect the denial  of preliminary relief will likely have on the Commission ’s final activities .”  \nId.  Because the plaintiffs’ removal deprived the Commission of a quorum, it lost its “ ability to \nfulfill its mandate ” to issue a final report  before it expired .  Id.  These circumstances, the court  \nheld, satisfied the Sampson  test.  Id. \nEven putting aside that Berry  is not binding on this Court,  it does not provide Perlmutter a  \nwinning argument that she will likely suffer irreparable harm here for several reasons .  First, as \nnoted above, the harm to the plaintiff Commissioners was irreparable because , with out a prelimi-\nnary injunction, the Commission itself would have expir ed and the Court could not have reinstated Case 1:25-cv-01659-TJK     Document 40     Filed 07/30/25     Page 5 of 15 6 them to their positions .  Here, to the extent that Perlmutter argues that she suffers harm solely from \nnot functioning as the Register of Copyrights , she provides no reason to think that any such harm \ncannot be remediated in the ordinary course by returning her to her position if she prevails on the \nmerits.   She argues that later reinstatement is insufficient because she is being sidelined now and \ncan never  reclaim this lost time .  ECF No. 24 -2 at 34 –35.  And t o demonstrate, s he notes that the \nCopyright Office is in the middle of producing a multi -volume report on c opyright and artificial \nintelligence  for Congress and other stakeholders  and that her ability to “complete” that report “will \nbe forfeited during t he months -long pendency of this lawsuit.”   Id. at 35.  The Berry  court, how-\never, did not rely on this type of reasoning.  And more fundamentally,  this “lost time” argument \nproves too much because it would establish irreparable harm in every  wrongful -termination case . \nPerlmutter  also gestures at a related argument when she asserts that her removal and Per-\nkins’s appointment will have an irreparable effect on her because they will prevent her from “re-\nturn[ing] to her position as it currently exists.”  ECF No. 24 -2 at 39.  But she does n ot show  that \nDefendants’ actions, if not enjoined, will likely irreparably alter her position.  So those fears are \nvague and speculative, not “certain and great .”  Chaplaincy of Full Gospel Churches , 454 F.3d at \n297 (quotation omitted) . \nSecond, although the court  in Berry  appears to have assumed that alleged injury to the \nCommission was identical  to alleged injury to the plaintiff Commissioner s—an assumption with \nwhich the Court disagrees for reasons explained later —the situation  in Berry  was very different \nthan the one  here.  In Berry , denying  the requested injunction would have shut down the Commis-\nsion before  it fulfilled its mandate.   So the Commission  itself could not have continued to func-\ntion—and indeed, could never function again —absent preliminary relief .  Here, on the other hand,  \nwhile Perlmutter claims that Defendants’ actions “impede[]” her from carrying out the Case 1:25-cv-01659-TJK     Document 40     Filed 07/30/25     Page 6 of 15 7 responsibilities of the Copyright Office, ECF No. 24 -3 ¶ 14, she does not explain why the Copy-\nright Office cannot continue to operate under Perkins’s temporary leadership.  Cf. English , 279 F. \nSupp. 3d at 355 (finding that a  removed officer had not shown irreparable harm where the agency \nwould “not be shuttered” because it could “continue[] to operate” under the leadership of the of-\nficer’s purported replacement).   For example, though  Perlmutter  claims  that she will be temporar-\nily unable to complete the report on copyright and artificial intelligence absent an injunction, she \ndoes not explain why  the Copyright Office  could not do so without her at the helm.  See ECF No. \n24-3 ¶ 14(g).   So even if the Court could  consider some harms to the agency in considering irrep-\narable harm to Perlmutter, she has not shown that the type of harm the Berry  court addressed is \npresent here.  \nStill, moving past Berry  itself, Perlmutter identifies six more recent decisions from  this \ndistrict in which judges have conclud ed, at least in part based on Berry , that even the “temporary” \n“deprivation of a senior government official’s ‘statutory right to function’ .  . . is both significant \nand irreparable .”  ECF No. 24 -2 at 34; id. at 32 –33 (collecting  cases).   These cases get her no \nfurther . \nOne of them —Aviel v. Gor  (Aviel I ), No. 25 -cv-778, 2025 WL 1009035 (D.D.C. Apr. 4, \n2025) —is inapposite  for substantially the same reasons as Berry .  In that case, the district court \nfound irreparable harm because  “the very survival of [the removed officer’s]  organization [was] \nat stake.”  Id. at *10.  So  without an injunction , there would be no agency for the officer to return \nto after the case was resolved.   But to repeat, Perlmutter has not shown that the existence of the \nCopyright Office is at stake , or that her position will likely be irreparably changed without an \ninjunction .  In another —LeBlanc v. United States Privacy & Civil  Liberties Oversight Board —the \nagency, like the Commission i n Berry , would have been deprived of a quorum, preventing it from Case 1:25-cv-01659-TJK     Document 40     Filed 07/30/25     Page 7 of 15 8 carrying out many of its responsibilities.  No. 25 -cv-542, 2025 WL 1454010 , at *31  (D.D.C. May \n21, 2025) .  Yet again, Perlmutter has not shown  that the Copyright Office will grind to a halt \nwithout her.2  True, in the other four cases Perlmutter cites , judges found irreparable harm even \nthough  the plaintiff did not make a showing  similar to  Berry , Aviel I , or LeBlanc .  But r espectfully, \nfor that reason, the Court does not find their reasoning  persuasive .  See Brehm , 2025 U.S. Dist. \nLEXIS 71326 , at *7 –10 (declining to follow some cases cited  by Perlmutter since “the viability of \na ‘statutory right to function’ claim is uncertain” and, “[t]o the extent courts have accepted such a \nclaim, it has been on different facts”).  \nOn top of all that, what is striking about these four cases —and also about  LeBlanc —is \nwhat happened next:  either t he D.C. Circuit or the Supreme Court stayed the injunctions entered \nby the district court s.  In three, either the Circuit or the Supreme Court stayed a preliminary in-\njunction directly.3  In the other two, the  decision cited by Perlmutter was an unappealable tempo-\nrary restraining order , but a subsequent permanent injunction entered by the same court was \nstayed .4  And while Perlmutter disputes the meaning of these developments  in the appellate courts , \n \n2 Similarly , in LeBlanc , the court  noted that the removed officer was “ appointed by the \nPresident, with the advice and consent of the Senate, to a nonpartisan, multimember board of ex-\nperts .”  2025 WL 1454010 , at *30.  Here, by contrast, Perlmutter was appointed by the Librarian, \nnot the President with the advice and consent of the Senate.  17 U.S.C. §  701(a ).  At least one court \nin this district has held  that such a distinction minimizes the officer’s injury.  Brehm v. Marocco , \nNo. 25 -cv-660, 2025 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 71326 , at *8  (D.D.C. Mar. 11, 2025)  (finding no irreparable  \nharm from an officer’s removal  in part  because the officer “was not appointed by the U.S. President \nor confirmed by the Senate”).  \n3 LeBlanc v. U.S. Priv. & C.L. Oversight Bd. , No. 25 -cv-542, 2025 WL 1454010 (D.D.C. \nMay 21, 2025) , stayed , No. 25 -5197, 2025 WL 1840591 (D.C. Cir. July 1, 2025) (per curiam); \nGrundmann v. Trump , 770 F. Supp. 3d 166 (D.D.C. 2025) , stayed , No. 25 -5165, 2025 WL \n1840641 (D.C. Cir. July 3, 2025) (per curiam); Wilcox v. Trump , 775 F. Supp. 3d 215  (D.D.C.  \n2025) , stayed  sub nom.  Trump v. Wilcox , 145 S. Ct. 1415 (2025) . \n4 Harris v. Bessent , 775 F. Supp. 3d 164  (D.D.C. 2025) , stayed sub nom. Wilcox , 145 S. \nCt. 1415; Dellinger v. Bessent  (Dellinger I ), 768 F. Supp. 3d 33 (D.D.C. 2025) , stayed by Dellinger \n Case 1:25-cv-01659-TJK     Document 40     Filed 07/30/25     Page 8 of 15 9 this Court would have to blind itself to them to assign the weight to these cases that she urges .  In \nthe end, none of the injunctions stuck.   And no precedent of the Supreme Court or the D.C. Circuit \nhas recognize d that an official’s temporary loss of a “statutory right to function” is an irreparable \nharm in a situation like Perlmutter’s.  \nThe reasoning behind the orders staying the injunctions , even if not conclusive here, is \ninstructive as to whether Perlmutter is suffering the kind of harm warranting preliminary injunctive \nrelief,  especially in light of the balance of the equities .  For example, in considering the allegedly \nunlawful removal of members of the National Labor Relations Board and the Merit Systems Pro-\ntection Board, t he Supreme Court  held “that the Government faces greater risk of harm from an \norder allowing a removed officer to continue exercising the executive power than a wrongfully \nremoved o fficer faces from being unable to perform her statutory duty. ”5  Trump v. Wilcox , 145 S. \nCt. 1415 , 1415  (2025) .  In other words, the Court concluded that an officer’s temporarily “ being \nunable to perform her statutory duty ” was not an irreparable harm —or at least, not a harm that \noutweigh ed the corresponding risk of harm to the Executive  such that an injunction was warranted .  \nId.  This makes sense in light of Sampson ’s holding that a plaintiff  “at the very least must make a \nshowing of irreparable injury sufficient in kind and degree to override the[]  factors cutting against \nthe general availability of preliminary injunctions in Government personnel cases. ”  415 U.S. at \n84.  And the D.C. Circuit has taken this approach as well .  In a recent case about  the alleged \nunlawful removal of the Special Counsel, it held  that “circumstances cut” against an injunction \n \nv. Bessent (Dellinger II ), No. 25 -5052, 2025 WL 887518 (D.C. Cir. Mar. 10, 2025) (per curiam) , \nvacated and remanded , No. 25 -5052, 2025 WL 935211 (D.C. Cir. Mar. 27, 2025) (per curiam).    \n5 As discussed later in this opinion, the D.C. Circuit has held that, as a matter of constitu-\ntional interpretation, the Library, at least in its role related to copyright matters, is part of the Ex-\necutive, not the Legislative, Branch.  Intercollegiate Broad. Sys., Inc. v. Copyright Royalty Bd. , \n684 F.3d 1332, 1342 (D.C. Cir. 2012) . Case 1:25-cv-01659-TJK     Document 40     Filed 07/30/25     Page 9 of 15 10 when, “[a]t worst,” the officer “would remain out of office for a short period of time” yet “the \npotential injury to the government of both having its designated [officer]  sidelined and unable to \nact while also having to try and unravel [the removed officer]’ s actions is substantial .”  Dellinger \nII, 2025 WL 887518 , at *4 . \nSo even assuming Perlmutter is right that her removal was unlawful, this reasoning sug-\ngests that  an injunction is not warranted  here.  “At worst, [she] would remain out of office for a \nshort period of time” while the Court resolves the merits.  Dellinger II , 2025 WL 887518 , at *4.   \nAnd as the Supreme Court suggested , even if Perlmutter has been “ wrongfully  removed,” tempo-\nrarily “being unable to perform her statutory duty,” without more, is not a harm that justifies a \npreliminary injunction , given the simila r balance of the equitie s here.  Wilcox , 145 S. Ct. at 1415; \ncf. Sampson , 415 U.S. at 84.  \nPerlmutter disputes the application of these appellate decisions and argues that they are \nlimited to circumstances where the Government is likely to succeed on the merits.6  Not so.  In \nWilcox , for example, the Supreme Court addressed the harm that “a wrongfully removed  officer \nfaces from being unable to perform her statutory duty. ”  145 S. Ct. at 1415  (emphasis added) .  \n \n6 Perlmutter also argues that Wilcox  is “non -precedential.”  ECF No. 34 at 26; see also \nAviel I , 2025 WL 1009035, at *10 (describing Dellinger II  as “non -precedential”).   In their oppo-\nsition , Defendants do not suggest otherwise.   Still, s ince briefing on Perlmutter’s motion and the \nhearing concluded , the Supreme Court  has clarified that its stay decisions, though “not conclusive \nas to the merits .  . . inform how a court should exercise its equitable discretion in like cases.” \nTrump v. Boyle , No. 25A11, 2025 WL 2056889 , slip op. at 1  (U.S. July 23, 2025) .  As noted above, \nthe Court’s decision here is informed by the reasoning in Wilcox .  And Boyle  itself only adds to \nthe pile  of similar authority.  In Boyle , the Court granted a stay pending appeal of a district court’s \npermanent injunction preventing the removal of members of the Consumer Product Safety Com-\nmission.  Id.  The Court explained that “[t]he application is squarely controlled by” Wilcox  and \nconcluded that a stay was warranted because, as there, “‘the Government faces greater risk of harm \nfrom an order allowing a removed officer to continue exercising the executive power than a wrong-\nfully removed officer faces from being unable to perform  her statutory duty.’”   Id. (quoting Wilcox , \n145 S. Ct. at 1415).  Case 1:25-cv-01659-TJK     Document 40     Filed 07/30/25     Page 10 of 15 11 Although the Court also suggested that the Government was likely to prevail on one aspect of the \nmerits, n othing about its brief consideration of irreparable harm and the balance of the equities \nappeared to turn  on its assessment of the merits .  See id.   But even if it did, Dellinger II ’s discussion \ndid not.  There,  in a more developed analysis, the Circuit explicitly “assume[d]” that the officer’s \n“removal [was] statutorily ultra vires” and that such “removal constitute[d] a cognizable injury.”  \n2025 WL 887518 , at *4.  But it still determined that “that does not mean such injury is irreparable \nand weighs in [the officer’s] favor.”  Id.  Instead, when the injury is “remain[ing] out of office for \na short period of time,” “circumstances cut” against an injunction, even if the officer’s removal \n“deprive [s] [her] of the statutory right to function in office. ”  Id. (quotation omitted).7  So too here.  \nPerlmutter also argues that the D.C. Circuit’s handling of Aviel  “confirm[s]” that Wilcox  \ndoes not apply here because she—rather than Defendants —is likely to succeed on the merits.  ECF \nNo. 24 -2 at 35.   More than that, she appears to read  the Circuit to suggest tha t, as long as she shows \nsuch a likelihood, she is entitled to a preliminary injunction .  Id. at 36.   She points out that Judge \nKatsas, in a concurring statement joined by Judge Pillard, noted that the Supreme Court’s “merits \nruling” in Wilcox  “rested on the proposition that the removals at issue . . . were likely lawful ” and \nthat the Court did not disturb a prior D. C. Circuit decision suggesting that “reinstatement” is “an \nappropriate remedy” when an officer is unlawfully removed .  Aviel v. Gor  (Aviel II ), No. 25 -5105, \n2025 WL 1600446 , at *2 n.2  (D.C. Cir. June 5, 2025)  (Katsas, J., concurring) .   Based on these \nsnippets, Perlmutter seems  to argue  that, for purposes of preliminary relief , “reinstatement is an \nappropriate remedy if the removals at issued were likely unlawful ,” full stop —somehow skipping \nover (or implicitly satisfying ) her burden to show irreparable harm.  ECF No. 35 at 4.  \n \n7 Perlmutter suggests that Dellinger II  is limited to cases in which an appeal has been ex-\npedited.  ECF No. 24 -2 at 36.  But nothing in the opinion implies such a limitation.  Case 1:25-cv-01659-TJK     Document 40     Filed 07/30/25     Page 11 of 15 12 Perlmutter reads far to o much into Aviel II .  First, Judge Katsas’s point about the availabil-\nity of reinstatement as a remedy in officer -removal cases generally says nothing about Perlmutter’s  \nentitlement to that specific remedy now, other than  that it remains available if she satisfies the \nrequirements for a preliminary injunction.  Second,  nothing about Judge Katsas’s statement —\nwhich did not even address irreparable harm8—or Aviel II  purports to upend those requirements or \nthe longstanding precedent in this jurisdiction that “[a] movant’s failure to show any irreparable \nharm is .  . . grounds for refusing to issue a preliminary injunction, even if the other three factors \nentering the calculus merit such relief.”  Chaplaincy of Full Gospel Churches , 454 F.3d at 297 .  \nThus, even assuming Perlmutter ’s removal was unlawful, she must still separately show such harm  \nto obtain a preliminary injunction .  In fact, not long before Aviel II , the Circuit reaffirmed this \ncommonsense conclusion in Dellinger II , when it assumed that the Special Counsel’s removal was \nunlawful but still found that he did not show  sufficient harm on a statutory -right -to-function theory  \nto warrant a preliminary injunction reinstat ing him .  2025 WL 887 518, at *4.  \nFor these reasons, the Court concludes that Perlmutter’s asserted loss of her “statutory right \nto function ” is not  a genuinely extraordinary situation such that her temporary removal is irrepa-\nrable harm —or at least, harm that outweighs any corresponding risk of harm to th e Government  \nsuch that the balance of the equities tips in her favor.  \nB. Perlmutter’s Temporary Inability to Perform Her Statutory Duties Is Not an \nIrreparable Harm  \nNext, Perlmutter argues that this case presents a genuinely extraordinary situation because \n \n8 Indeed, the only judge to discuss irreparable harm was Judge Rao, who explicitly rejected \nPerlmutter’s statutory -right -to-function theory of harm because, in her view, an officer “possesses \nno private right in the powers of her office or the policy direction of the agency.”   Aviel II  at *6 \n(Rao, J., dissenting) (citing Raines v. Byrd , 521 U.S. 811, 821 (1997) ). \n Case 1:25-cv-01659-TJK     Document 40     Filed 07/30/25     Page 12 of 15 13 she “remains Register of Copyrights and is therefore required to fulfill her statutory duties.”  ECF \nNo. 24 -2 at 37.  There is little if any difference between this theory of harm and her first.  Perlmut-\nter distinguishes the two by arguing that the first addresses her right  to function and the second \naddresses her obligation  to do so.  But at bottom, both are ways of claiming that she is suffering  \nirreparabl e harm because she cannot perform the job of Register of Copyrights  and Director of the \nCopyright Office .  And a s the Court has already explained, Perlmutter’s asserted inability to do \nthat job temporarily while this lawsuit proceeds is not enough to show  irreparable harm.  \nC. To Meet Her Burden of Showing Irreparable Harm, Perlmutter Cannot Rely \non Harms to the Library of Congress o r the Copyright Office  \nFinally, Perlmutter claims that her removal is genuinely extraordinary because Defendants’ \nactions inflict “institutional harm to the Library of Congress and U.S. Copyright Office.”  ECF \nNo. 24 -2 at 39.  But i njuries to third parties are not a basis to find irreparable harm.   Cardinal \nHealth, Inc. v. Holder , 846 F. Supp. 2d 203 , 213 (D.D.C. 2012) ; Winter , 555 U.S. at 20 (noting \nthat a party seeking preliminary injunctive relief must show “that he is likely to suffer irreparable \nharm in the absence of preliminary relief ” (emphasis added)).  Indeed, in Sampson , the Court em-\nphasized that “irreparable injury” can be found only by considering “the  circumstances surround-\ning an employee’s  discharge, together with the resultant effect  on the employee .”  415 U.S. at 92 \nn.68 (emphasis added) .  So institutional harms to the Library or the Copyright Office, divorced \nfrom how those harms impact Perlmutter  personally , cannot help her meet her burden.  \nPerlmutter argues that institutional harms are relevant because, in cases like Wilcox , the \nSupreme Court considered harms to the office of the President, not just harms to President Trump \nindividually.  ECF No. 34 at 22.  But i n those  cases, the defendant officials were sued in their \nofficial capacities .  So when they moved to stay the injunctions issued by the lower courts, they \nhad the burden to show that they would be irreparably harmed in their official capacities  absent a Case 1:25-cv-01659-TJK     Document 40     Filed 07/30/25     Page 13 of 15 14 stay.  In such circumstances, it makes  sense to consider harm to their offices.  Here, on the other, \nPerlmutter  does not appear to dispute that she is suing in her personal capacity.  ECF No. 15 at \n48–49.  Thus, unlike a defendant sued in his official capacity, Perlmutter cannot rely on purported \ninstitutional harm s to the Library or Copyright Office  to show irreparable harm  to her . \nUndeterred , Perlmutter points to cases in which courts have considered harms to agencies \nin addressing whether a removed officer  has suffered irreparable harm.  See ECF No. 24 -2 at 39 –\n40.  But those cases do not stand for the general proposition that a removed officer can appropriate \nharm to an agency in asserting her own irreparable harm.  Instead, many  merely recognize , as \ndiscussed above, that an officer’s removal may threaten  irreparable harm to her when it is likely \nthe agency or office will no longer exist when the case is resolved .  See, e.g. , Aviel I , 2025 WL \n1009035 , at *10 –11; see also English , 279 F. Supp. 3d at 334–35 (discussing this theory of irrep-\narable harm ).  In those cases, courts concluded that s uch circumstances have an irreparable “re-\nsultant effect” on the removed officer because,  without an injunction , there will be no position for \nthe officer to return to should she win on the merits.  Sampson , U.S. at 92 n.68 ; Aviel I , 2025 WL \n1009035 , at *10 –11.  But as discussed , nothing in the record suggests that the existence of the \nCopyright Office  is threat ened  or that Perlmutter’s position will irreparably change in some way \nif it is temporarily held by Perkins .9 \nFinally, even putting aside  that these purported institutional  harms are not Perlmutter’s  to \ninvoke , they fail on their own terms.  She claim s that the Copyright Office will not be able to \n“perform its statutory role as a neutral advisor to Congress if an Executive Branch official controls \nthe Library of Congress’s operations.”  ECF No. 24 -2 at 40.   But this concern is  based on \n \n9 To the extent that some courts may have  permitted plaintiffs to establish irreparable harm \nby pointing to harms suffered solely by their agencies, the Court is not bound by those decisions \nand, for the reason explained above, respectfully disagrees with them.  Case 1:25-cv-01659-TJK     Document 40     Filed 07/30/25     Page 14 of 15 15 speculation  at this point , and no representative of Congress has sought to intervene in this case to \nprotect these interests that Perlmutter says are in peril.  Besides, for support, she mostly cites to \nprovisions of the U.S. Code governing the Congressional Research Service .  See ECF No. 24 -2 at \n40 (citing 2 U.S.C. §  166).   But that Service is “a separate department in the Library of Congress” \nuntethered to the Copyright Offi ce.  § 166(a).   Furthermore,  the D.C. Circuit has held that , as a \nmatter of consti tutional interpretation, the Library , at least in its role related to copyright matters, \nis part of the Executive , not the Legislative, Branch .  Intercollegiate Broad. Sys., Inc. v. Copyright \nRoyalty Bd. , 684 F.3d 1332 , 1342  (D.C. Cir. 2012).   And the Librarian —who appoints  the Register \nof Copyrights —is appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate, and she \nis removable by the President at will.   Id. at 1341.   So Executive influence over the Copyright \nOffice appears to be a feature , not a bug , of this atypical arrangement.   See Kennedy v. Braidwood \nMgmt., Inc. , 145 S. Ct. 2427 , 2443  (2025)  (“The prerogative of at-will removal of a subordinate, \nthen, often carries with it the power to supervise and direct that subordinate.”) .   \nIV. Conclusion  \nFor all the above reasons, the Court will deny  Perlmutter’s  Motion for  a Preliminary In-\njunction , ECF No.  24.  A separate order will issue.  \n/s/ Timothy J.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: Plaintiff Brendan Baker filed a class action lawsuit against CVS, alleging that during his job application process for a position in Massachusetts, he was unlawfully subjected to a lie detector test without the required notice of this statutory right under Massachusetts law. The case involves the use of a video-interview technology by HireVue, which utilizes artificial intelligence to analyze applicants' responses and provide employability scores, allegedly functioning as a lie detector test. The court denied CVS's motion to dismiss the claim that CVS violated the notice provision of Massachusetts' Lie Detector Statute.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether Massachusetts' Lie Detector Statute allows for a private right of action for its notice provision when allegedly violated and whether the use of HireVue technology constitutes a lie detector test within the meaning of the statute.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court held that the plaintiff had standing to pursue the claim regarding the failure to provide statutory notice, as he alleged that he participated in the HireVue interview without being informed of his rights. The court also held that the statute unambiguously authorizes a lawsuit for the violation of its notice provision and thus denied CVS's motions to dismiss.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine you wanted to get a job at a big store, and during the application, they asked you questions through a video while secretly trying to figure out if you're lying, using a fancy computer program. This computer program was supposed to be like a lie detector. There’s a local law that says stores can't do this without giving you a heads-up first, and if they do, you can take them to court. The court said you (and possibly others who had the same experience) have the right to complain to a judge because the store didn’t tell you about your rights and because a computer program might've been used to check if you were telling the truth without your knowledge.",

(collectively “CVS”)  under Mass. Gen. Laws ch.  149, § 19B \n(“Lie Detector Statute”) . Baker alleges that when he applied for \na job with CVS, CVS unlawfully subjected him to a lie detector \ntest and failed to provide him required notice of his  statutory  \nrights.  \nThe second amended complaint  contains  three counts. First, \nBaker seeks a declaratory judgment that CVS’s application process \nviolates Massachusetts law and an injunction on that process 2 \n (Count I). Second, Baker alleges that CVS violated Mass. Gen. Laws \nch. 149, § 19B(2) by subjecting him to a lie detector test \n(Count II). Third, Baker alleges that CVS violated Mass. Gen. Laws \nch. 149, § 19B(2)(b) by failing to provide him required noti ce of \nhis statutory rights (Count III).1 Baker seeks to represent a class \nof “[a]ll persons who applied for a Massachusetts CVS position” \nand a sub -class of all applicants who “participated in a CVS \nHireVue Interview ,” which Baker alleges constituted a li e detector \ntest. Dkt. 35 at 8.  \nDefendants do not challenge the sufficiency of the claims \nthat CVS violate d the Lie Detector Statute. CVS moves to dismiss \nonly the third count , arguing that the Lie Detector Statute  does \nnot create a private right of action to enforce its notice \nprovisions  (Dkt. 22), and alternatively,  that Baker lacks  Article \nIII standing to challenge the lack of notice  (Dkt. 42). After \nhearing,  the Court DENIES CVS’s motions to dismiss Count III \n(Dkts. 22 & 42). \nBACKGROUND  \nI.  Statutory Scheme  \n The Lie Detector Statute  prohibits employers in Massachusetts \nfrom subjecting employees or applicants to lie detector tests  as \n \n1 Baker’s second amended complaint contains two counts listed as \n“Count II.” See Dkt. 35 at 10 -11. The Court treats the second of \nthose -- Baker’s notice -violation claim -- as “Count III.”  3 \n a condition of employment or continued employment . Mass. Gen. Laws \nch. 149, § 19B(2) . Under the statute, a lie detector test is:  \n[A]ny test utilizing a polygraph or any other device, \nmechanism, instrument  or written examination, which is \noperated, or the results of which are used or interpreted \nby an examiner for the purpose of purporting to assist \nin or enable the detection of deception, the \nverification of truthfulness, or the rendering of a \ndiagnostic o pinion regarding the honesty of an \nindividual.  \n \nId. § 19B(1). Subsection (2) provides:  \nIt shall be unlawful for any employer or his agent, with \nrespect to any of his employees, or any person applying \nto him for employment  . . . to subject such person to, \nor request such person to take a lie detector test . . . \nor to discharge, not hire, demote or otherwise \ndiscriminate against such person for the assertion of \nrights arising hereunder . . . . \n \n(a) The fact that such lie detector test was to be, \nor was, admin istered outside the commonwealth for \nemployment within the commonwealth shall not be a valid \ndefense to an action brought under the provisions of \nsubsection (3) or (4).  \n \n(b) All applications for employment within the \ncommonwealth shall contain the followin g notice which \nshall be in clearly legible print:  \n \n“It is unlawful in Massachusetts to require or \nadminister a lie detector test as a condition of \nemployment or continued employment. An employer who \nviolates this law shall be subject to criminal penalties \nand civil liability. ” \n \nId. § 19B(2).  Finally, Subsection (4) states :  \n \nAny person aggrieved by a violation of subsection (2) \nmay institute within three years of such violation and \nprosecute in his own name and on his own behalf, or for \nhimself and for other similarly situated, a civil action \nfor injunctive relief and any dama ges thereby incurred, 4 \n including treble damages for any loss of wages or other \nbenefits.  \n \nId. § 19B(4).   \n \nII.  CVS’s Application  Process \nDrawing all inferences  in favor of Baker, the Court accepts \nthe following  factual allegations  from the second amended \ncomplaint  as true. Around January 2021, Baker applied for a supply \nchain position  in Massachusetts  with CVS. The application,  which \nCVS posted online, did not include the notice of rights mandated  \nby the Lie Detector  Statute.  \nTo screen applicants , CVS administers a video-interview  \ntechnology developed by a company called HireVue, Inc.  (“HireVue \nInterview ”). During the HireVue Interview, a n applicant answers a \nseries of questions while being video -recorded. These include \nquestions like “What does integrity mean to you?”, “What would you \ndo if you saw someone cheating on a test?”, and “Tell me about a \ntime that you acted with integrity.” Dkt. 35 at 5. HireVue then \nuploads recordings of applicants’  responses t o a third -party \nplatform  called Affectiva , which  analyzes candidates’ facial \nexpressions, eye contact, voice intonation, and inflection using \nartificial intelligence. Through Affectiva, HireVue  uses data from \nan applicant’s  interview recording to  “draw[] conclusions \nregarding [her] degree of cultural fit” with CVS . Id. at 6. HireVue \nconveys its findings to CVS with a numerical “employability score” 5 \n or “competency -level scoring report”  for each applicant.  Id. at 7 \n(cleaned up).  HireVue has stated that it  can detect  whether a n \napplicant “[h]as an innate sense of integrity and honor,” help \nwith “lie detection” and “screen[ing] out embellishers ,” and \norganize applicant  competencies including “reliability, honesty, \n[and] integrity.” Id. at 5, 7-8.  \nDuring Baker’s application process, CVS administered a \nHireVue Interview  on him. Dkt. 35 at 2 , 4. He was “unaware, at the \ntime, that the HireVue Interview was a lie detector t est,” and \nstates that if he had been, “he would not have participated in the \nHireVue Interview.” Id. at 3. \nDISCUSSION  \nI.  Standing   \n CVS argues that Baker lacks standing to bring his notice claim \nbecause he has plead ed only a bare procedural violation without \nshowing concrete harm. “To establish Article III standing, a \nplaintiff must show (1) an injury in fact, (2) a sufficient causal \nconnection between the injury and the conduct complained of, and \n(3) a likelihood that the injury will be redressed by a favorable \ndecision.”  Susan B. Anthony List v. Driehaus , 573 U.S. 149, 157-58 \n(2014) (cleaned up) . An “injury in fact” must be “both \nconcrete  and particularized”  and “actual or imminent,  not \nconjectural  or hypothetical.”  Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins, 578 U.S. 6 \n 330, 339 (2016) (quoting  Lujan v. Defs. of Wildlife , 504 U.S. 555, \n560 (1992)) .  \n“[T]he Supreme Court has repeatedly  said that denial of \ninformation  to which plaintiffs  have a legal right can be a \nconcrete  injury in fact.” Laufer v. Acheson Hotels, LLC, 50 F.4th \n259, 269 (1st Cir. 2022) (first citing Fed. Election  Comm’n v. \nAkins, 524 U.S. 11, 20-21 (1998); and then citing Pub. Citizen v. \nU.S. Dep’t of Just., 491 U.S. 440, 449-50 (1989)),  vacated as moot, \n601 U.S. 1 (2023). In some circumstances,  the Court has treated \nplaintiffs’  “asserted  uses for the information  they sought” as \nimmaterial  to the standing  analysis . Laufer v. Naranda Hotels, \nLLC, 60 F.4th 156, 170 (4th Cir. 2023); see, e.g., Havens Realty \nCorp. v. Coleman, 455 U.S. 363, 373-74 (1982) (“A tester who has \nbeen the object of a misrepresentation  made unlawful  under [the \nstatute]  . . . has standing  to maintain  a claim for damages under \nthe Act’s provisions.”);  Pub. Citizen, 491 U.S. at 449 (“Our \ndecisions  . . . have never suggested  that those requesting  \ninformation  . . . need show more than that they sought and were \ndenied specific  agency records.”) ; see also Akins, 524 U.S. at 21 \n(“{A] plaintiff  suffers an ‘injury in fact’ when the plaintiff  \nfails to obtain information  which must be publicly  disclosed  \npursuant  to a statute.”).   \nHowever,  the Supreme Court’s recent decision  in TransUnion  \nLLC v. Ramirez muddied the waters. 594 U.S. 413 (2021). There, the 7 \n named plaintiff  sued a credit-reporting  agency under the Fair \nCredit Reporting  Act, which requires  that agencies  “disclose  to \nthe consumer  all information  in the consumer’s  file” upon request \nand provide a “summary  of rights” with “each written disclosure.”  \nId. at 418-19 (cleaned  up). He alleged, among other things, that \nwhen he requested  a copy of his credit file, the defendant  \ninitially  sent an incomplete  file along with the required  summary \nof rights, and then a day later, sent him the rest of his file \nwithout another summary of rights. The Court held that because the \nplaintiff  had ”not allege[d] that [he] failed to receive any \nrequired  information ,” rather “only that [he] received  it in the \nwrong format,” Akins and Public Citizen were distinguishable.  Id. \nat 441 (emphasis  omitted) . “Moreover, ” the Court held, “the \nplaintiff [] ha[d] identified  no ‘downstream  consequences’  from \nfailing to receive the required  information.”  Id. at 442. Thus, \nthe plaintiff’s  alleged informational  injury did not support \nArticle III standing.  \nThe legal question  is how to apply TransUnion  in light of the \n“informational  injury” cases that preceded  it. Since TransUnion , \nsome circuits  have held that plaintiffs  asserting  informational  \ninjuries  must show “(1) the denial of information  and (2) some \nconsequence  caused by that omission”  that has “some relevance”  to \nan interest  that the statute was intended  to protect.  Kelly v. \nRealPage  Inc., 47 F.4th 202, 213 (3d Cir. 2022); Laufer v. Looper, 8 \n 22 F.4th 871, 881 & n.6 (10th Cir. 2022); accord Harty v. W. Point \nRealty, Inc., 28 F.4th 435, 444 (2d Cir. 2022). Other circuits  \nhave narrowly  construed  TransUnion ’s discussion  of “downstream  \nconsequences”  as applying  only to the type of informational  injury \nat issue there: receiving  required  information  in the wrong format. \nSee, e.g., Laufer, 60 F.4th at 170 (holding that because “Havens \nRealty squarely  rejected  [a] use requirement”  and TransUnion  did \nnot overrule  Havens Realty, “any use requirement  is limited to the \ntype of informational  injury at issue in TransUnion  and does not \nextend to the type of informational  injury presented  in Public \nCitizen and Akins”). \nEven under an expansive  interpretation  of TransUnion , Baker \nhas pleaded a concrete  informational  injury. Baker alleges that he \nwas denied the notice of his rights under the Lie Detector  Statute,  \nnot that he received  notice in the wrong format. Additionally,  he \nhas plausibly  alleged that as a downstream  consequence  of not \nreceiving  notice, he participated  in a HireVue Interview.  Although  \nthe notice would not have specifically  informed  Baker that the \nHireVue Interview  was a lie detector  test, it would have primed \nhim to view the interview  more critically . Baker’s injury is of \nthe kind the statute was designed  to protect.  Accordingly , CVS’s \nRule 12(b)(1)  motion (Dkt. 42) is DENIED.2 \n \n2 Applicants  who never took the HireVue Interview may well be in a \ndifferent boat on  the standing question . 9 \n II.  Statutory  Interpretation  \nCVS also argues that the Lie Detector Statute does not \nauthorize suits to enforce its notice provision. Statutory \ninterpretation starts with the plain language of the \nstatute.  See United States v. Lachman, 387 F.3d 42, 50 (1st Cir. \n2004). Here, the Lie Detector  Statute authorizes  suit by “[a]ny \nperson aggrieved  by a violation  of subsection  (2),” which includes  \nthe notice requirement.  Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 149, § 19B(4); see id. \n§ 19B(2)(b).  CVS’s appeals to the Lie Detector  Statute’s  \nlegislative  history are unavailing  because the statutory  language  \nis unambiguous.  See Gen. Motors Corp. v. Darling’s, 444 F.3d 98, \n108 (1st Cir. 2006). Accordingly, CVS’s Rule 12(b)(6) motion  \n(Dkt. 22) is DENIED. \nORDER \nThis Court DENIES CVS’s motion s to dismiss for failure to \nstate a claim (Dkt. 22) and for lack of standing (Dkt. 42) .  \n \nSO ORDERED.  \n       \n/s/ PATTI B.

    "summary": "1. **Summary:** The case involves Plaintiff Medicare Advantage customers suing UnitedHealth Group and others, alleging that UHC unreasonably denied their post-acute care claims using an AI program called nH Predict. The court partially grants UHC's motion to dismiss, allowing the claims for breach of contract and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing to proceed, but dismisses most other claims due to federal preemption and failure to exhaust administrative remedies.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue:** Whether Plaintiffs' claims, particularly relating to the denial of benefits using AI, must first be subjected to exhaustion of administrative remedies under the Medicare Act, and if those claims are preempted by federal law.\n\n3. **Court's Holding:** The court waived the exhaustion requirement due to futility and irreparable harm but found most of the Plaintiffs' claims preempted by federal law. Only the breach of contract and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing claims survive preemption.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation:** The people in this case are claiming that their health plan unfairly used a computer program instead of doctors to decide not to pay for their healthcare, making them suffer. Normally, they would have to go through a long process of asking for help before taking the issue to court, but the judge decided they didn't have to because it seemed like UHC was making it too hard by repeatedly denying claims. However, most of their claims can't be looked at by the court because there are federal rules that take priority over state rules when it comes to Medicare health plans. So, only a couple of their complaints can keep going—they have to do with whether or not UHC broke their promises in the insurance agreement.",

(collectively “UHC”).  Each Plaintiff \nsought coverage for post-acute care, and each was eventually denied that coverage.  \nThese denials resulted in worsening injuries and death in some cases.  Plaintiffs, on behalf \nof themselves and others similarly situated, bring seven causes of action under state law \ntheories alleging that UHC’s use of an artificial intelligence program, called nH Predict, to \ndeny coverage was unreasonable.   \nUHC filed a motion to dismiss Plaintiffs’ claims.  Because all of Plaintiffs’ claims are \ninexplicably intertwined with a claim for benefits, all of Plaintiffs’ claims are subject to the \nexhaustion of administrative remedies requirement.  The Court, however, will waive \nexhaustion on futility grounds.  Notwithstanding a waiver of the exhaustion requirement, \nthe broad preemption provision in the Medicare Act results in most of Plaintiffs’ claims \nbeing preempted.  Plaintiffs’ claims for breach of contract and breach of the implied \ncovenant of good faith and fair dealing, however, survive preemption because those \nclaims do not aim to regulate the same subject matter as the federal standards.  In other \nwords, the Court need only review insurance documents to resolve these claims.  The \nCourt will grant in part and deny in part UHC’s motion to dismiss, allowing the breach of \ncontract and breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing claims to proceed.  \nBACKGROUND \nI. FACTS \nPlaintiffs purchased Medicare Advantage (“MA”) health insurance coverage from \nUHC.  (Am. Compl. ¶¶ 30, 32, Apr. 5, 2024, Docket No. 34.)  UHC sold MA plans as an CASE 0:23-cv-03514-JRT-SGE     Doc. 91     Filed 02/13/25     Page 2 of 24-3- \n alternative to traditional Medicare.  ( Id. ¶¶ 30–31.)  When Plaintiffs purchased MA plans, \nUHC provided a written insurance contract which included a requirement to “provide \nbenefits for covered health services and [] pay all reasonable and medically necessary \nexpenses.”  ( Id. ¶ 32.)  UHC’s insurance agreements also state, “UnitedHealthcare’s \nClinical Services Staff and Physicians make decisions on the health care services you \nreceive based on the appropriateness of care and service and existence of coverage.”  ( Id. \n¶ 187.)   \nOne service that MA plans cover is “post-acute care” which is “medically necessary \ncare” following serious illness or injury.  ( Id. ¶¶ 33–34.)  Post-acute care is covered \nthrough a prospective payment system, meaning that patient claims are evaluated before \nor during treatment.  ( Id. ¶¶ 35–36.)  As such, claim denial can result in termination of \nactive post-acute services or refusal of services before they even commence.  ( Id. ¶¶ 36–\n37.)  When claims are denied, patients must choose to forgo treatment or pay out of \npocket for the services.  ( Id. ¶ 36.)    \nAfter a claim is denied, the Medicare Act outlines a four-level appeals process \nthrough which patients can challenge their coverage denial.  ( Id. ¶ 46.)  First, a patient \nmust appeal to Quality Improvement Organizations (“QIO”), which are independent third-\nparty organizations established to review claims determinations, per the Medicare Act.  \n(Id. ¶¶ 45–46.)  If the QIO affirms the denial, then, the patient may apply for \nreconsideration by the same QIO.  ( Id. ¶ 46.)  Then, if the QIO does not change its position, CASE 0:23-cv-03514-JRT-SGE     Doc. 91     Filed 02/13/25     Page 3 of 24-4- \n the patient may appear before an Administrative Law Judge.  ( Id.)  The final step includes \na hearing before the Medicare Appeals Council.  ( Id.) \nAll Plaintiffs submitted either a pre-authorization or a claim for benefits for post-\nacute care.  ( Id. ¶ 33.)  All claims were eventually denied.  ( Id. ¶¶ 36–37.)  Plaintiffs \nappealed their denials to differing points in the appeals process, but none completed the \nentire appeals procedure.  ( Id. ¶¶ 66–67, 77, 80, 83, 92, 106, 113, 122, 133, 136, 143, 146, \n156.)  Many Plaintiffs paid out of pocket for continuing care, while others went without \ncare.  (E.g. Id. ¶¶ 68, 86.)  The Amended Complaint alleges that Plaintiffs suffered \nworsening injury, illness, or death as a result of the denials.  ( Id. ¶¶ 109, 149.)  \nPlaintiffs claim that UHC used an artificial intelligence program, nH Predict AI \nModel (“nH Predict”), in lieu of physicians to make coverage determinations.  ( Id. ¶¶ 37–\n38.)  nH Predict compares the specific patient with similar patients and recommends an \nestimated amount of post-acute care needed.  ( Id. ¶ 39.)  Plaintiffs contend that UHC used \nthis model to determine the amount of coverage an individual patient needed, regardless \nof the recommendation made by their treating physician.  ( Id. ¶¶ 38–39.)  Plaintiffs \ndescribe the nH Predict as applying “rigid criteria” that UHC required its employees to \nfollow under the threat of termination.  ( Id. ¶ 42.)  Additionally, Plaintiffs allege that UHC \nknew of nH Predict’s inaccuracies because over 90% of claim denials are reversed on \nappeal and over 80% of preauthorization denials are reversed.  ( Id. ¶ 47.)  UHC denies any \nuse of nH Predict.  (Def.’s Reply at 10 n.1, July 15, 2024, Docket No. 65.)  CASE 0:23-cv-03514-JRT-SGE     Doc. 91     Filed 02/13/25     Page 4 of 24-5- \n Plaintiffs also allege that UHC has frustrated the appeals process.  (Am. Compl. ¶¶ \n48–49, 53.)   Plaintiffs claim that when a patient has a denial overturned, UHC \nimmediately issues another denial letter such that the patient is perpetually stuck in a \nloop of denial, appeal, denial until eventually they give up.  ( Id. ¶ 49.)  Additionally, \nPlaintiffs accuse UHC of approving any appeals that reach the late stages so that \nadministrative remedies are never exhausted.  ( Id. ¶ 53.) \nII. PROCEDURAL HISTORY  \nPlaintiffs filed their original class action complaint on November 14, 2023.  (Compl., \nDocket No. 1.)  Plaintiffs amended their class action complaint on April 5, 2024.  (Am. \nCompl.)  Plaintiffs Amended Complaint includes seven state law causes of action: breach \nof contract, breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, unjust \nenrichment, insurance bad faith, negligence per se, unfair and deceptive insurance \npractices, and unfair competition.  ( Id. ¶¶ 183–275.)  Plaintiffs seek damages as well as \ndeclaratory and injunctive relief.  ( Id. at 58.) UHC filed a motion to dismiss for lack of \njurisdiction for failure to exhaust administrative remedies and also for failure to state a \nclaim upon which relief can be granted based on a theory of preemption.  (Mot. Dismiss, \nMay 20, 2024, Docket No. 41.)   CASE 0:23-cv-03514-JRT-SGE     Doc. 91     Filed 02/13/25     Page 5 of 24-6- \n DISCUSSION \nI. STANDARD OF REVIEW \nArticle III of the Constitution requires that every matter before a court be a case or \ncontroversy.  U.S. C ONST. art. III, § 2.  This requirement must be met throughout all stages \nof the case, not just when the case is filed.  See Burke v. Barnes , 479 U.S. 361, 363 (1987). \nIn deciding a motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1), the \nCourt must first “distinguish between a ‘facial attack’ and a ‘factual attack.’”  Osborn v. \nUnited States , 918 F.2d 724, 729 n.6 (8th Cir. 1990) (quoting Menchaca v. Chrysler Credit \nCorp., 613 F.2d 507, 511 (5th Cir. 1980)).  A facial challenge requires the court to \n“determine whether the asserted jurisdictional basis is patently meritless by looking to \nthe face of the complaint . . . and drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the \nplaintiff.”  Biscanin v. Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc. , 407 F.3d 905, 907 (8th Cir. 2005) (citations \nomitted).  In a factual attack, the nonmoving party “does not have the benefit of 12(b)(6) \nsafeguards” and the court “inquires into and resolves factual disputes.”  Faibisch v. Univ. \nof Minn., 304 F.3d 797, 801 (8th Cir. 2002).1  \nIn reviewing a motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), the \nCourt considers all facts alleged in the complaint as true to determine if the complaint \nstates a “claim to relief that is plausible on its face.”  Braden v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. , 588 \n \n \n1 overruled in part on other grounds by Slayden v. Ctr. for Behav. Med. , 53 F.4th 464, 469 \nn.4 (8th Cir. 2022).  CASE 0:23-cv-03514-JRT-SGE     Doc. 91     Filed 02/13/25     Page 6 of 24-7- \n F.3d 585, 594 (8th Cir. 2009) (quoting Ashcroft v. Iqbal , 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009)).  “A claim \nhas facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to \ndraw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.”  \nIqbal, 556 U.S. at 678.  The Court construes the complaint in the light most favorable to \nthe plaintiff, drawing all inferences in the plaintiff’s favor.  Ashley Cnty., v. Pfizer, Inc. , 552 \nF.3d 659, 665 (8th Cir. 2009).  Although the Court accepts the complaint’s factual \nallegations as true and construes the complaint in a light most favorable to the plaintiff, \nit is “not bound to accept as true a legal conclusion couched as a factual allegation.”  \nPapasan v. Allain , 478 U.S. 265, 286 (1986).  In other words, a complaint “does not need \ndetailed factual allegations” but must include “more than labels and conclusions, and a \nformulaic recitation of the elements” to meet the plausibility standard.  Bell Atl. Corp. v. \nTwombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007).  \nII. ANALYSIS  \nPlaintiffs’ claims face two potential challenges: (1) failure to exhaust administrative \nremedies and (2) federal preemption.  Courts differ in how to evaluate these two issues, \noften blurring the requirements and language, but because failure to exhaust is a \njurisdictional issue, the Court will consider this issue first and then evaluate federal \npreemption.  See generally Yeomans v. Blue Shield of Cal. , 712 F. Supp. 3d 1336, 1343–46 \n(C.D. Cal. 2024).  Because UHC challenges only the allegations in the complaint, the Court \nconstrues the motion as a facial attack on subject matter jurisdiction.  BP Chems. Ltd. v. \nJiangsu Sopo Corp. , 285 F.3d 677, 680 (8th Cir. 2002). CASE 0:23-cv-03514-JRT-SGE     Doc. 91     Filed 02/13/25     Page 7 of 24-8- \n A. Exhaustion  \nThe Court must first determine if Plaintiffs’ claims are subject to the administrative \nexhaustion requirements and, if so, whether Plaintiffs met those requirements.  \n1. Applicability of Exhaustion Requirements \nAny claim arising out of the Medicare Act is subject to administrative exhaustion \ngoverned by Section 405(g) and (h) of the Social Security Act.  42 U.S.C. §§ 405(g)–(h), \n1395ff(b)(1)(A); Heckler v. Ringer , 466 U.S. 602, 605, 614–15 (1984); c.f. Weinberger v. \nSalfi, 422 U.S. 749, 760 (1975) (describing exhaustion of claims arising under the Social \nSecurity Act).  In other words, one must receive a “final decision” by the Secretary before \nbringing an action in federal court.2  42 U.S.C. § 405(g).   \nA claim arises under the Medicare Act when either (1) the “standing and \nsubstantive basis for the presentation” of the claims is the Medicare Act, or (2) it is \n“inextricably intertwined” with a Medicare benefits determination.  Ringer, 466 U.S. at \n614–15.  Claims are “inextricably intertwined” when, despite being brought under \ndifferent laws, they are nothing more than a challenge to a benefits decision.  Id. at 614; \nsee also Reuben v. Ziemer , No. 23-3423, 2024 WL 2477049, at *2–3 (D. Minn. May 1, 2024) \n(finding a claim was “inextricably intertwined” even when the complaint did not reference \n \n \n2 UHC argues that it is not the proper defendant and instead the claims should have been \nbrought against the Secretary.  However, private entities acting on behalf of the United States or \nthe Secretary as a Medicare Advantage Organization are subject to federal action.  Midland \nPsychiatric Assocs., Inc. v. United States , 145 F.3d 1000, 1003–04 (8th Cir. 1998);  Reuben v. Ziemer , \nNo. 23-3423, 2024 WL 2477049, at *3 (D. Minn. May 1, 2024). CASE 0:23-cv-03514-JRT-SGE     Doc. 91     Filed 02/13/25     Page 8 of 24-9- \n the Medicare Act).  In fact, even some claims that challenge Center for Medicare and \nMedicaid Services (“CMS”) regulations themselves arise under the Medicare Act because \nthey originate out of a denial of benefits.  Phillips v. Kaiser Found. Health Plan, Inc. , 953 F. \nSupp. 2d 1078, 1089 (N.D. Cal. 2011) (finding state law claims that challenged a Medicare \nAdvantage Organization’s conduct as violating the Medicare Act to constitute a claim for \nbenefits that must be exhausted).  \nAlthough Plaintiffs challenge the process of making the denial decision instead of \nthe denial itself, their claims clearly arise from a denial of benefits.  Plaintiffs ultimately \ntake issue with the fact that coverage was denied, and courts generally take an expansive \nview of “arising under” the Medicare Act.  See, e.g., Ringer, 466 U.S. at 614–15.  The \nPlaintiffs’ claims arise under the Medicare Act and are subject to the exhaustion \nrequirements.   \n2. Satisfaction of Exhaustion Requirements \nExhaustion requires two elements: (1) a nonwaivable presentment requirement, \nand (2) a waivable exhaustion requirement.  Bowen v. City of N.Y. , 476 U.S. 467, 483 \n(1986).   \nPresentment is satisfied where plaintiffs submitted a claim for benefits.  Ringer, \n466 U.S. at 617.  All Plaintiffs had claims denied, which means they submitted claims for \nbenefits and thus met the presentment requirement for exhaustion purposes.  However, \nno plaintiff has followed a claim through the entire appeals process and received a final \ndecision by the Medicare Appeals Council. CASE 0:23-cv-03514-JRT-SGE     Doc. 91     Filed 02/13/25     Page 9 of 24-10- \n Since Plaintiffs admit exhaustion has not been completed, the Court must \ndetermine whether exhaustion should be waived.  Waiver is appropriate when (1) the \nclaims are collateral, (2) irreparable injury would follow, and (3) exhaustion would be \nfutile.  Mathews v. Eldridge , 424 U.S. 319, 330–31 (1976); see also Bowen , 476 U.S. at 485. \nFirst, the Court finds it difficult to conceive of a situation where claims that arise \nunder the Medicare Act could also be “wholly collateral” to their overall claim for benefits \nunder the Act.  In re Heritage Sw. Med. Grp., P.A. , 309 B.R. 916, 920 (N.D. Tex. 2004); see \nalso Kaiser v. Blue Cross of Calif. , 347 F.3d 1107, 1115 (9th Cir. 2003).   So, while Plaintiffs \naccurately cite other precedent that presents similar factual circumstances where courts \nfound the claims were collateral, those cases did not first evaluate whether the claims \narose out of the underlying Act.  See Schoolcraft v. Sullivan , 971 F.2d 81, 86 (8th Cir. 1992) \n(evaluating a challenge to the appeals process of the Social Security Act); Bowen, 476 U.S. \nat 485 (same).  Because the claims arise out of the Medicare Act, the Court concludes that \nit cannot find the claims are “wholly collateral” to the Plaintiffs’ claims for benefits.    \nSecond, a finding that the claims are not wholly collateral is not dispositive, \nbecause the Plaintiffs allegedly suffered irreparable harm and showed the futility of \nexhausting administrative remedies.  Bowen, 476 U.S. at 484 (“The ultimate decision of \nwhether to waive exhaustion should not be made solely by mechanical application of the \nEldridge factors, but should also be guided by the policies underlying the exhaustion \nrequirement.”).  Further, the Eighth Circuit has not conclusively determined, and circuits CASE 0:23-cv-03514-JRT-SGE     Doc. 91     Filed 02/13/25     Page 10 of 24-11- \n differ, whether all three factors need to be met before waiver is appropriate.  Compare \nTitus v. Sullivan , 4 F.3d 590, 592 (8th Cir. 1993) (combining the waiver requirements with \n“and”) with In Home Health, Inc. v. Shalala , 272 F.3d 554, 560 (8th Cir. 2001) (combining \nthe waiver requirements with “ or”); see also Timmerman v. Thompson , No. 03-5221, 2004 \nWL 1765285, at *3–4 (D. Minn. Aug. 5, 2004) (explaining that the Eighth Circuit has not \nresolved this issue).   \nIrreparable harm is shown when a “deferment of judicial review until exhaustion \nof administrative remedies would cause [plaintiffs] injury that cannot be remedied by \nlater payment of the benefits requested.” Martin v. Shalala , 63 F.3d 497, 505 (7th Cir. \n1995); see also Manakee Pro. Med. Transfer Serv.,  Inc. v. Shalala , 71 F.3d 574, 581 (6th Cir. \n1995) (citing Eldridge, 424 U.S. at 331).  The Court has found no irreparable harm when \nbenefits continued during a pending appeal.  Timmerman , 2004 WL 1765285, at *5.  The \nfact that post-acute care claims require preauthorization or ongoing authorization makes \nthese claims unique because in order to continue receiving care, people often have to pay \nfor care themselves.  ( See, e.g., Am. Compl. ¶ 68.)  As evidenced in the Amended \nComplaint, many patients who had to decline treatment later suffered worsening injuries \nand even death.  Plaintiffs have therefore shown irreparable harm.   \nThird, UHC’s actions that make any attempt to fully exhaust the administrative \nremedies futile support a waiver determination.  The futility prong addresses whether \npursuit of relief through the administrative process will “serve the purposes of CASE 0:23-cv-03514-JRT-SGE     Doc. 91     Filed 02/13/25     Page 11 of 24-12- \n exhaustion, and not be futile in the context of the system.” Kaiser, 347 F.3d at 1115.  \nExhaustion serves to “prevent[] premature interference with agency processes, so that \nthe agency may function efficiently and so that it may have an opportunity to correct its \nown errors, to afford the parties and the courts the benefit of its experience and \nexpertise, and to compile a record . . . .” Id. at 1115 n.4 (quoting Salfi, 422 U.S. at 765).   \nTwo allegations, taken as true at the motion to dismiss stage, make the appeals \nprocess futile.  First, UHC allegedly issues repeated denials any time a patient is successful \non appeal.  As a result, any time a patient gets a denial overturned, another denial is on \nits way.  Second, for the very few appeals that reach the end of the appeals process, UHC \nallegedly pays the claims and terminates the process.  As alleged in the Complaint, this \npractice would make it virtually impossible for any claim to progress through the entire \nfour-step appeals process and be ripe for judicial review.  Thus, the irreparable injury and \nfutility of the appeals process suggests that waiver of administrative exhaustion is \nappropriate.  \nThe Medicare Act is clear in declaring that any claim “arising under” the Medicare \nAct must first progress through the administrative process before a district court can \nexercise jurisdiction.  While the exhaustion of administrative remedies is required in \nalmost every case, it is not absolute.  There are unique circumstances in which it is CASE 0:23-cv-03514-JRT-SGE     Doc. 91     Filed 02/13/25     Page 12 of 24-13- \n appropriate for the Court to waive that requirement.3  Here, the Court is presented with \nsuch a case.  These Plaintiffs allegedly suffered great harm, up to and including death, \nbecause of an allegedly defective procedure of denying claims compounded by efforts to \nobliterate any means of effective review through the administrative process.  As a result, \nthe Court will find that although Plaintiffs’ claims were subject to administrative review, \nwaiver is appropriate such that the Court can exercise jurisdiction.  \nB. Federal Preemption \nThe Court must next determine if any of the claims fail to state a claim upon which \nrelief can be granted because they are preempted by federal law.   \nUnder the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution, federal law “shall be the supreme \nLaw of the Land; and the Judges in every State shall be bound thereby any Thing in the \nConstitution or Laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding.”  U.S. Const. art. VI, cl. \n2.  In other words, “state laws that conflict with federal law are without effect.”  Altria \nGrp., Inc. v. Good , 555 U.S. 70, 76 (2008) (citation and quotation omitted).  “The purpose \nof Congress is the ultimate touchstone in every pre-emption case.”  Id. (cleaned up).  The \nCourt begins its “analysis with the assumption that the historic police powers of the States \nare not to be superseded by the Federal Act unless that was the clear and manifest \n \n \n3 UHC contends that waiver is only applicable for Constitutional claims relying on Califano \nv. Sanders , 430 U.S. 99, 109 (1977).  However, Califano merely indicates that when a \nconstitutional question is at issue, there is a presumed judicial review.  Id.  That proposition alone \ndoes not foreclose the potential for waiver under other circumstances. CASE 0:23-cv-03514-JRT-SGE     Doc. 91     Filed 02/13/25     Page 13 of 24-14- \n purpose of Congress.”  Id. at 77 (cleaned up).  When the statute includes an express \npreemption provision, the Court must first look to the statutory language to determine \nCongress’s purpose.  Pharm. Care Mgmt. Ass’n v. Wehbi , 18 F.4th 956, 971 (8th Cir. 2021).   \nThe Medicare Act, as amended in 2003, states, “The standards established under \n[Part C] shall supersede any State law or regulation (other than State licensing laws or \nState laws relating to plan solvency) with respect to MA plans which are offered by MA \norganizations under [Part C].”  42 U.S.C. § 1395w-26(b)(3) (effective Dec. 8, 2003); 42 \nC.F.R. § 422.402.  Prior to the 2003 amendment, the preemption clause included a \nrequirement that the state law or regulation be “inconsistent” with the federal standard.  \n42 U.S.C. § 1395w-26(b)(3)(A) (effective Dec. 21, 2000 to Dec. 7, 2003).  In conjunction \nwith the amendment, CMS has issued several statements indicating that the amendment \nintended to expand the scope of the preemption clause, including the common law to the \nextent it would “specifically regulate an MA plan.”  Do Sung Uhm v. Humana, Inc. , 620 \nF.3d 1134, 1156 (9th Cir. 2010) (citing 70 Fed. Reg. 4588-01, 4665 (Jan. 28, 2005)).  All \ncourts accept that “standard” means a “statutory provision or a regulation promulgated \nunder [the Medicare Act] published in the Code of Federal Regulations.”  Wehbi, 18 F.4th \nat 971. \n1. Common Law Claims \nA threshold issue requires the Court to evaluate whether the preemption clause \ncategorically excludes common law claims under Sprietsma v. Mercury Marine , 537 U.S. \n51 (2002).  Despite the similarities, the Court finds that Sprietsma  is distinguishable.   CASE 0:23-cv-03514-JRT-SGE     Doc. 91     Filed 02/13/25     Page 14 of 24-15- \n In Sprietsma , the Supreme Court determined that the phrase “a law or regulation” \nin the Federal Boat Safety Act (“FBSA”) most likely excluded common law claims and only \nencompassed positive legal enactments.  Id. at 63.  Sprietsma  excluded common law \nclaims because of the article “a” and the occurrence of law and regulation together.  Id.  \nThe Supreme Court further noted the FBSA’s saving clause excludes common law liability \nfrom the preemption clause.  Id.  \nThe preemption clause in the Medicare Act differs from that in the FBSA in two \nsignificant ways.  First, it states “ any law or regulation” instead of “ a law or regulation.”  \n42 U.S.C. § 1395w-26(b)(3) (emphasis added); 46 U.S.C. § 4306 (emphasis added).   \nSecond, the Medicare Act contains no such savings clause for common law claims, and \ninstead only explicitly excludes state licensing and claims related to plan solvency.  42 \nU.S.C. § 1395w-26(b)(3); Northwest, Inc. v. Ginsberg , 572 U.S. 273, 283 (2014) (describing \nSprietsma ’s substantial reliance on the FBSA savings clause).  \nTrue, the Medicare Act preemption language mirrors that of the FBSA in that it \nuses both the terms “law” and “regulation.”  As in Sprietsma , that would indicate an \nintention to reference only positive enactments to avoid surplusage.  537 U.S. at 63.  \nHowever, the Medicare Act’s language differs by the use of “any” and the lack of a savings \nclause for common law claims.  The difference between “a” and “any” is significant \nbecause “a” implies “discreteness,” while “any” implies a more expansive scope.  \nCompare id.  (analyzing “a”) with Ali v. Fed. Bureau of Prisons , 552 U.S. 214, 218–19 (2008) CASE 0:23-cv-03514-JRT-SGE     Doc. 91     Filed 02/13/25     Page 15 of 24-16- \n (analyzing “any”).  The use of “any” in the Medicare Act’s preemption clause thus \nbroadens the language.  Ali, 552 U.S. 219; Northwest , 572 U.S. at 283 (explaining that \nbroader wording in an express preemption clause is a critical difference from the clause \nin Sprietsma ).   \nIn addition to the differences in statutory language, the preemption clause in the \nMedicare Act is undisputedly broader than that in the FBSA.  The 2003 amendment \nspecifically removed any requirement that state laws must be inconsistent.  42 U.S.C. § \n1395w-26(b)(3)(A) (effective Dec. 21, 2000 to Dec. 7, 2003).  Further, CMS has clarified \nthat at least some common law claims are preempted.  70 Fed.Reg. at 4665.   \nTherefore, because the language is not limited by the article “a,” the preemption \nprovision includes no savings clause for common law claims, and CMS has indicated its \nintent to preempt at least some common law claims, the Court will apply the preemption \nclause to common law claims when appropriate, and not limit its application to positive \nenactments of state law. \n2. Scope of Express Preemption  \nWith the acknowledgement that preemption may apply to all of Plaintiffs’ claims, \nthe Court must now evaluate the scope of the express preemption clause.   \nThe Eighth Circuit addressed the scope of the Medicare Act’s preemption clause in \nWehbi, 18 F.4th at 970–72.  Wehbi held that state laws are preempted if they “(1) regulate \nthe same subject matter as federal Medicare [standards] (in which case they are expressly \npreempted), or (2) otherwise frustrate the purpose of a federal Medicare [standards] (in CASE 0:23-cv-03514-JRT-SGE     Doc. 91     Filed 02/13/25     Page 16 of 24-17- \n which case they are impliedly preempted).”  18 F.4th at 971.  Wehbi reached its \nconclusion by acknowledging the expansion but describing two remaining limitations: \nfirst, the language “with respect to [Medicare Parts C-D] plans” and second only when the \nfederal standard “supersedes” state law.  18 F.4th at 971.  The court further defined \n“supersede” to mean displace.  Id.  The court summarized its analysis of the preemption \nexpansion by noting it went from conflict to field preemption.4  Id. at 971–72.     \nUHC relies primarily on Ninth Circuit precedent, which the Plaintiffs claim takes a \nmore expansive view of the Medicare Act’s preemption clause than required.  However, \nit is not immediately clear to the Court how distinct the tests actually are.  The Ninth \nCircuit has described the preemption clause as applying to anything that is “directly \ngoverned by federal standards.”  Uhm, 620 F.3d at 1158.  Essentially, under this view \npreemption would cover any state law or regulation if a federal standard exists.  Morrison \nv. Health Plan of Nev. , 328 P.3d 1165, 1168–70 (Nev. 2014).  And the Tenth Circuit has \nfound that the Medicare Act’s expanded preemption clause is similar to field preemption.  \nPharm. Care Mgmt. Ass’n v. Mulready .  78 F.4th 1183, 1207–08 (10th Cir. 2023); see also \nMedicaid and Medicare Advantage Prods. Ass’n of P.R., Inc. v Emanuelli Hernandez , 58 \nF.4th 5, 12–13 (1st Cir. 2023).    \n \n \n4 Field preemption exists when “Congress has forbidden the State to take action in the \nfield that the federal statute pre-empts,” and conflict preemption exists where “compliance with \nboth state and federal law is impossible.”  Pharm. Rsch. & Mfrs. of Am. v. McClain , 95 F.4th 1136, \n1140 (8th Cir. 2024) (quotations omitted).   CASE 0:23-cv-03514-JRT-SGE     Doc. 91     Filed 02/13/25     Page 17 of 24-20- \n evaluation of the medical payments Plaintiffs allegedly should have received would \nregulate the covered serves already regulated by the Medicare Act.  As such, the unjust \nenrichment claim is expressly preempted. \nThe bad faith insurance claims fail for similar reasons.  Plaintiffs alleged that the \nstates in which they assert bad faith insurance claims “prohibit using bad faith or \nunreasonable means to make coverage determinations under an insurance policy.”  (Am. \nCompl. ¶ 214.)  Initially, the bad faith insurance laws seem to only require the Court to \ndetermine the motivation behind the coverage denials.  However, a finding of liability on \nthe bad faith insurance claims would force the Court to evaluate whether the denial of \ncoverage was reasonable and whether the use of nH Predict to make that denial decision \nwas reasonable.  The Medicare Act squarely regulates how coverage decisions are to be \nmade and what services are covered.  42 C.F.R. §§ 422.101, 422.566.  Thus, a \ndetermination on the reasonableness of denial or the reasonableness of how coverage \ndecisions are made would aim to regulate the same subject matter as the Medicare Act. \nBecause any evaluation of the bad faith insurance claims would require the Court to \nevaluate standards promulgated by the Medicare Act, as opposed to standards included \nonly in UHC’s own written documents, the Court finds the bad faith insurance claims to \nbe preempted.  CASE 0:23-cv-03514-JRT-SGE     Doc. 91     Filed 02/13/25     Page 20 of 24-21- \n In sum, the breach of contract and breach of implied covenant of good faith and \nfair dealing claims are not preempted, and thus may proceed.  But the unjust enrichment \nand bad faith insurance claims are preempted and will be dismissed. \nb. Statutory Claims \nPlaintiffs bring three statutory claims under Oregon’s Unfair Claims Settlements \nPractices Act, the Minnesota Unfair Claims Practices Act (“MUCPA”),5 and California’s \nUnfair Competition Law and Insurance Code.  All three statutes essentially require \ninsurers to use reasonable standards for prompt, individualized evaluation of insurance \nclaims.6  Because the Medicare Act describes how insurance claim decisions are to be \nmade and the time frame for such decisions, these statutes directly regulate the same \nsubject matter.  See 42 C.F.R. §§ 422.101, 422.566, 422.568.  \nThe only manner in which these claims could survive preemption then would be a \nfinding that the state standards supplement the federal standards as permitted under \nWehbi.  18 F.4th 973.  However, the Court cannot expand Wehbi’s supplemental standard  \nto this case.  First, Wehbi allowed states to supplement the federal regulations under a \n \n \n5 The parties dispute whether the Minnesota Unfair Claims Practices Act allows for a \nprivate right of action.  A private right of action seems likely based on Findling v. Grp. Health Plan, \nInc., 998 N.W.2d 1, 7 (Minn. 2023), but as the MUCPA claim is preempted, the Court need not \nresolve that issue here.  \n6 Plaintiffs’ claim under Oregon’s Unfair Claims Settlements Practices Act also raises the \nissue of prompt and sufficient notice of denial.  However, 42 C.F.R. § 422.568 heavily regulates \nthe timeframe and notice requirements of organization determinations.  So, the notice portion \nof the claim, while distinct, is also preempted. CASE 0:23-cv-03514-JRT-SGE     Doc. 91     Filed 02/13/25     Page 21 of 24-22- \n specific set of circumstances.  The issue in that case concerned pharmacy benefits, which \nWebhi noted is an area typically left to the states.  Id. at 972–73.  Here, the Plaintiffs have \nnot presented the Court with any basis to find that coverage decisions are typically left to \nthe states.   \nFurther, Wehbi allowed states to provide the specifics when the federal standards \nwere broad and generalized.  Id. at 973.  But the federal standards here are not as \ngeneralized as those discussed in Wehbi.  Compare 42 C.F.R. § 422.101 (requiring a \nmedical necessity determination based on whether the services are reasonable or \nnecessary and also the “enrollee’s medical history, . . . physician recommendations, and \nclinical notes”) with 42 C.F.R. § 423.505(b)(18) (mandating a “standard contract with \nreasonable and relevant terms and conditions”).   \nFinally, even if the Medicare standards were sufficiently general, it is unclear that \nthe state laws that Plaintiffs suggest supplement the Medicare standards would provide \nany additional specificity.  The state laws would only impose an additional requirement \nthat the insurers use “reasonable standards” in making coverage decisions.  Thus, while \nWehbi certainly suggests there are situations where states could provide supplemental, \ncomplementary standards to the federal Medicare Act standards, that is not the case \nhere.  As a result, the statutory claims are expressly preempted.   \n* * * CASE 0:23-cv-03514-JRT-SGE     Doc. 91     Filed 02/13/25     Page 22 of 24-23- \n The Court finds that although the Plaintiffs’ claims were subject to the \nadministrative exhaustion requirements, Plaintiffs presented sufficient information to \nsatisfy application of the waiver doctrine.  Yet even after surmounting the jurisdictional \nhurdle, most of the claims fail under preemption.  As a result, the only claims that survive \nboth exhaustion and preemption are the claims for breach of contract and for breach of \nthe implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.  The remaining claims will be \ndismissed.  \nCONCLUSION \nPlaintiffs bring a putative class action contesting UHC’s use of nH Predict, rather \nthan actual people, to make coverage decisions, contradicting UHC’s insurance policy \ndocuments.  Because all the Plaintiffs’ claims originate after a denial of benefits, the \nMedicare Act requires Plaintiffs to exhaust all administrative remedies before the Court \ncan exercise subject matter jurisdiction.  No plaintiff has met this requirement.  But \nbecause the Court finds that Plaintiffs suffered irreparable injury and that exhaustion \nwould be futile, the Court will waive this requirement.  Waiving the exhaustion \nrequirement does not save all of Plaintiffs’ claims, however; those claims must also \nwithstand the broad preemption clause.  Because the unjust enrichment, bad faith \ninsurance, and state statutory claims regulate the same subject matter as the Medicare \nAct, those claims are preempted.  The only claims that survive, then, are the claims for \nbreach of contract and for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing \nbecause the Court will only need to evaluate compliance with the insurance agreements.  CASE 0:23-cv-03514-JRT-SGE     Doc. 91     Filed 02/13/25     Page 23 of 24-24- \n Accordingly, the Court will grant in part and deny in part UHC’s motion to dismiss, allowing \nPlaintiffs’ breach of contract and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair \ndealing claims to proceed.  \nORDER \nBased on the foregoing, and all the files, records, and proceedings herein, IT IS \nHEREBY ORDERED that Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss [Docket No. 41] is GRANTED in \npart and DENIED in part as follows:  \n1.

The court addressed a joint motion to continue keeping certain documents under seal due to sensitive personal health information involved, and granted this motion to protect confidentiality.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue:** Whether documents containing sensitive and confidential personal health information related to a class action lawsuit should remain sealed, despite the common-law right of public access to judicial records.\n\n3. **Court's Holding:** The court granted the joint motion to continue sealing the documents, finding that the parties' interests in maintaining the confidentiality of sensitive personal health information outweighed the public's interest in accessing these documents.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation:** A group of people claimed their insurance company used a computer program to wrongly deny them coverage for necessary medical care. The court was asked to decide if documents with private health information should be kept secret. The judge agreed the documents should stay hidden to protect people's private health details, even though people usually have the right to see court records.",

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: The court case involved derivative litigation filed by Pinterest shareholders alleging race and sex discrimination within Pinterest, Inc. A settlement was reached, which included various reforms and a commitment from Pinterest to invest in diversity initiatives, including the use of artificial intelligence (AI) for ensuring diverse content representation. The court reviewed and approved an attorney's fee request of $2,500,000 based on Pinterest's compliance with the settlement terms and its improvements in workplace diversity and content inclusivity.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the settlement agreement between Pinterest and its shareholders, involving reforms and diversity initiatives, was adequately implemented and whether the plaintiffs' counsel was entitled to the attorney's fees for monitoring compliance.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court granted the motion for attorney's fees, concluding that Pinterest substantially complied with the settlement terms and made significant strides in diversity and inclusivity. It encouraged both parties to continue working towards fulfilling the settlement's objectives over the remaining period.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine a company was accused of unfair treatment of people based on their race and gender. They agreed to make changes to be more fair and inclusive, like using a smart computer program to show different types of people on their website. After a couple of years, a judge checked if they were doing what they promised. The judge saw they made good progress, like having more women in leadership roles, and agreed to pay the lawyers helping to make sure they did a good job.",

In early 2021, Pinterest began to implement the \nspecial committee’s reforms (Dkt. No. 107).  These lawsuits were consolidated in a series of \norders issued between December 2020 and July 2021 (Dkt. Nos. 28, 39, 49, 86).  The parties \nreached a settlement in November 2021 (Dkt. No. 99).  The settlement provided incremental \nreforms beyond those provided by the special committee.  Preliminary approval was given in \nFebruary 2022 (Dkt. No. 115).   Final approval of the settlement was granted in June 2022 (Dkt. \nNo. 134) along with an award of $2,500,000  in attorney’s fees.  That same order also stated \nthat a further amount may be awarded in two years based on future compliance and a showing \nof actual benefit that has flowed from the incremental re forms  (ibid.).

In the \nlatest reports, plaintiffs’ counsel expressed that Pinterest leadership has complied with, and in \nsome case, “exceeded our expectations” in meetin g the goals of the settlement (Dkt. 143).   For \nexample, by June 2023, there was an increase in women represented in leadership positions \nfrom 33% to 40% (Dkt. No. 141).  Pinterest has also maintained an Ombuds Office pilot \nprogram over the past two years which is tasked with  providing  advice to individual employees  \nand gathering information regarding potentially systemic problems that may inhibit diverse and \ninclusive and diverse environments (Dkt. No. 142).  Pinterest also implemented a program \ncalled the Inclusive Product Program, which uses artificial intelligence to ensure that \ninformation and content on its platform represent different  body types, shapes, and sizes \n(ibid.).  Out  of the $50 million that Pinterest is required to invest in inclusion and diversity \ninitiative over the next ten years, Pinterest has spent about $12.5 million over the past two \nyears (Dkt.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: The United States Court of Appeals affirmed the district court's dismissal of all claims brought by National Security Counselors (NSC) against the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the Department of Justice, under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). NSC's requests were denied on grounds that included the prohibition of FOIA to require record creation, the unreasonably burdensome nature of unspecific requests, and the non-waiver of attorney-client privilege. This case involved AI/automation systems as NSC attempted to obtain records on the IBM supercomputer “Watson,” which was denied due to the burdensome nature of the request.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the federal agencies’ refusals to fulfill NSC’s FOIA requests were lawful concerning the creation of new records, the burden of searches, and the withholding of categorized information under attorney-client privilege.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The Court held that the agencies acted within their rights to deny the requests as FOIA does not require the creation of new records, an unreasonably burdensome search is not obligatory, and OLC’s references to its opinions did not amount to a waiver of attorney-client privilege.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: In simple terms, imagine you asked a library to gather and organize all books based on a unique theme never categorized before; the librarian would say they can't—it's like creating a new set of shelves from scratch. Similarly, if you asked for everything related to a complex topic like \"AI supercomputers\" without specifics, the librarian might say it's too much work to find everything, everywhere. Also, if someone confided a secret and you told part of it, it doesn't mean you gave away the whole secret. In this case, the court decided the government agencies didn’t have to fulfill requests that either required excessive effort or effectively creating new records, or risked revealing protected secrets.",

USCA Case #18-5047      Document #1856002            Filed: 08/11/2020      Page 1 of 102 \n Opinion for the Court filed by Chief Judge  SRINIVASAN . \n \nSRINIVASAN , Chief Judge :  National Security Counselors \n(NSC) is a Virginia -based non -profit organization that \ndisseminates  national security materials  to the public.   NSC \nfrequently seeks  to obtain records from intelligence and \ndefense agencies  through the Freedom of Information Act .     \n \nNSC filed three lawsuits in federal district court on the \nsame day in 2011.  The lawsuits together raised  forty -five \nclaims against six federal agencies  arising out of numerous \nFOIA requests initiated by NSC.  The district court, in a series \nof decisions, eventually ruled in favor of the government on all \nof NSC’s  claims.  See Nat ’l Sec. Counselors v. CIA  (NSC I ), \n898 F. Supp. 2d 233 , 290 –91 (D.D .C. 2012); Nat’l Sec. \nCounselors v. CIA  (NSC II ), 960 F. Supp. 2d 10 1, 208 –10 \n(D.D.C. 2013); Nat’l Sec. Counselors v. CIA  (NSC III ), 206 F. \nSupp. 3d 241 , 288 –90 (D.D.C. 2016).   \n \nNSC now appeals , raising a number of challenges to the \ndistrict court’s decisions.  In this opinion, we individually \naddress  (and reject ) three of NSC’s claims:  two claims \nconcerning distinct  FOIA requests made to the Central \nIntelligence Agency and a third claim concerning the \nDepartment of Justice’s assertion of att orney -client privilege in \nresponse to a FOIA request.  While we do not separately \ndiscuss NSC’s remaining claims, we find that none has merit \nand thus affirm the district court in all respects.  \n \nI. \n \nFOIA allows agencies to assess varying fees against  \nrequesters depending on the purpose for which the information \nis sought, the identity of the requester, or both.  See 5 U.S.C. \n§ 552(a)(4) (A).  In August  2010 , NSC submitted FOIA USCA Case #18-5047      Document #1856002            Filed: 08/11/2020      Page 2 of 103 \n requests to the CIA  for a  listing of all FOIA requesters from \nfiscal year s 2008 to 2010 organized  under  each of four fee \ncategories  contemplated by FOIA :  “news media,” \n“educational or scientific,” “commercial,” or “all other .”  NSC \nFOIA Requests to CIA  (Aug. 8, 2010), 1 J.A. 103 –15; see 5 \nU.S.C.  § 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(I) –(III).   \n \nThe CIA declined to process the requests , explaining, \namong other things, that FOIA does not require an agency to \ncreate records not otherwise in existence .  NSC then brought \nan action under FOIA in the district court, challenging the \nagency’s refusal to process the requests.  The district court \ngranted summary judgment in favor of the CIA .  See NSC II , \n960 F. Supp. 2d at 161.  We review the district court’s grant of \nsummary judgment de novo , see Nat’l Sec. Counselors v. DOJ , \n848 F.3d 467, 470 (D.C. Cir. 2017), and agree with the court’s  \ndisposition .   \n \nFOIA provides for “disclosure of certain documents which \nthe law requires the agency to prepare or which the agency has \ndecided for its own reasons to create.”  NLRB v. Sears, Roebuck \n& Co. , 421 U.S. 132, 162 (1975).   But “FOIA imposes no duty \non the agency to create record s.”  Forsham v. Harris , 445 U.S. \n169, 186 (1980).  FOIA, that is, only requires disclosure of \ndocuments that already exist, not the creation of new records \nnot otherwise in the agency’s possession.  See Yeager v. Drug \nEnf’t Admin. , 678 F.2d 315, 321 (D.C. Cir. 1982); H.R. Rep. \nNo. 104 –795, at 22  (1996) . \n \nHere, NSC’s request for the CIA to produce listings \naccording to four fee categories of all FOIA requesters over a \ntwo-year period would require the agency to create new \nrecords, not to disclose existing on es.  The CIA’s Information \nReview Officer , whose responsibilities include final review of \ndocuments that are the subject of FOIA requests , submitted a USCA Case #18-5047      Document #1856002            Filed: 08/11/2020      Page 3 of 104 \n declaration in the district court that sets out the relevant \ncapabilities of the agency’s FOIA records sy stem.  Declaration \nof Martha Lutz  ¶ 11 (Dec. 13, 2011) (Lutz Decl.) , 1 J.A. 196.  \nAs she explained, “[f]ee category is not a mandatory field in \nCIA’s current electronic FOIA records system; therefore, this \ninformation is often not included in a FOIA reques t record.”  \nId.  To produce listings of FOIA requesters by fee category  per \nNSC’s request , then, “the CIA’s FOIA analys ts would be \nrequired to individually review each FOIA reque st submitted \nfrom 2008 to 2010 and manually sort thousands of request s \nbased on fee category.”  Id.  That process would \nquintessentially entail  the creation of new records, not the \ndisclosure of preexisting ones.  \n \nAccording to NSC, “sorting a database by field is not \ncreating records, and releasing the information which resu lted \nfrom that sorting action is also not creating records.”  NSC Br. \n16.  We have no occasion here, however, to consider  whether \nsorting a database by field would involve  the creation of new \nrecords.  As the CIA’s declaration establishes, the agency’s \nFOIA database does not contain  the relevant field (i.e. fee \ncategor y) as mandatory information in the first place.  Lutz \nDecl. ¶ 11 , 1 J.A. 196 . \n \nNSC suggests more broadly that “there are no ‘records’ to \nspeak of in an electronic database in which information  is \nentered into fields.”  NSC Br. 16.  FOIA makes clear , though,  \nthat a “record” within the meaning of the statute includes \ninformation “that would be an agency record . . . when \nmaintained by an agency in any format, including an electronic \nformat.”  5 U .S.C. § 552(f)(2)(A); see Yeager , 678 F.2d at 321.  \nBut regardless of whether a given record exists in an electronic \nor paper format (or both), the statute only calls for the \ndisclosure of existing records, not the generation of new ones.  \nAnd whatever que stions may arise in future cases about when USCA Case #18-5047      Document #1856002            Filed: 08/11/2020      Page 4 of 105 \n disclosing the results of an electronic search of records entails  \ncreation of a record, here, responding to NSC’s request would \nrequire manual review and sorting of numerous electronic \nrecords and  the ensuing  compilation of lists that do not \notherwise exist.  That exercise self -evidently amounts to \nrecords creation, which FOIA does not require.  \n \nII. \n \nWe next consider another FOIA request NSC made to the \nCIA, this one for “all Central Intelligence Agency (‘CIA’ ) \nrecords pertaining to the IBM supercomputer named \n‘Watson.’”  CIA Request Correspondence (Feb. 16, 2011), 1 \nJ.A. 275.  NSC added “that agencies have a duty to construe \nthe subject material of FOIA requests liberally to ensure \nresponsive records are not o verlooked.”  Id.  The CIA declined \nto process the request “in its current form because it would \nrequire the Agency to perform an unreasonably burdensome \nsearch.”  CIA Request Correspondence (Mar . 2, 2011),  1 J.A. \n280.  The CIA invited NSC “to refine the sc ope of [its] request \n(such as contracts, if they exist, which would explain records \npertaining to ‘Watson’) to enable [the agency] to conduct a \nreasonable search for responsive information.”  Id.   \n \n NSC did not narrow the scope of its request, but instead  \nfiled a lawsuit challenging the CIA’s response.  The district \ncourt granted summary judgment to the CIA.  NSC II , 960 F. \nSupp. 2d at 163.   We again agree with the district court’s \ndisposition.   \n \n FOIA imposes obligations on agencies to disclose records \nfor requests that “reasonably describe[] such records.”  5 \nU.S.C. § 552(a)(3)(A).  We have explained that agencies “need \nnot honor a request that requires ‘an unreasonably burdensome \nsearch.’”  Am. Fed’n of Gov’t Emps. Local 2782 v. U.S. Dep’t USCA Case #18-5047      Document #1856002            Filed: 08/11/2020      Page 5 of 106 \n of Commerce , 907 F.2d 203, 209 (D.C. Cir. 1990) (citing \nGoland v. CIA , 607 F.2d 339, 353 (D.C. Cir. 1978)).  We have \nalso established that agencies should read FOIA request s “as \ndrafted, not as either agency officials or [the requester] might \nwish it was drafted.”  Miller v. Casey , 730 F.2d 773, 777 (D.C. \nCir. 1984).  The upshot is that, when the request as drafted \nwould require an agency to undertake an unreasonably \nburdenso me search, the agency can decline to process the \nrequest.   \n \n That is what happened here.  As the CIA’s Information \nReview Officer explained in her declaration, “it is difficult to \ndetermine where responsive information would likely be \nlocated within the Agency because the request is so general.”  \nLutz.  Decl. ¶ 31 , 1 J.A. 204 .  “CIA’s records,” she advised, \n“are decentralized and compartmented.  Each directorate . . . \nmust determine which components and/or records systems \nwithin the directorate might reasonably be expected to possess \nrecords responsive to a particular request.”  Id. at ¶ 30.  As a \nresult, “the CIA would be required to search every office for \nany documents containing the word ‘Watson,’” which would \namount to a “massive undertaking.”  Id. at ¶ 31, 1 J.A. 205 . \n \n NSC does not dispute that a search for all documents \nanywhere in the CIA related to “Watson” would be unduly \nburdensome.  NSC instead submits that the CIA gave the \nrequest an “overbroad reading,” in that the request should have \nbeen understood to encompass only “records about how the \ndevelopment of Watson impacted the Intelligence Community, \nspecifically with respect to the application of comparable \nartificial intelligence systems to intelligence analysis.”  NSC \nBr. 27.  The request , though, does not say that .  Instead, it  is \nframed broadly to seek “all [CIA] records pertaining to the \nIBM supercomputer ‘Watson,’” with an added emphasis “to \nconstrue” it “ liberally .”  CIA Request Correspondence, 1 J.A. USCA Case #18-5047      Document #1856002            Filed: 08/11/2020      Page 6 of 107 \n 275.  To be sure, NSC, when askin g for a public -interest fee \nwaiver in its letter transmitting the request , said that responsive \nrecords would “serve as a case study for the CIA’s involvement \nin artificial intelligence research.”  Id. at 277.  But the request \nitself was not so confined, a nd NSC did not refine its request \nafter the CIA invited it to do so.  \n \nThe agency interpreted NSC’s request as drafted, as our \ndecisions direct.  Miller , 730 F.2d at 777.  And the agency and \nthe district court correctly concluded that, as drafted, the \nreque st called for an unreasonably burdensome search.  \n \nIII. \n \nWe next consider a FOIA request submitted by NSC to the \nOffice of Legal Counsel (OLC) in the Department of Justice.  \nThe request sought OLC opinions pertaining to  various statutes \nincluding FOIA itsel f, the Privacy Act, and the Federal Records \nAct.  See NSC II , 960 F. Supp. 2d at 119.  OLC  withheld a \nnumber of its responsive opinions under FOIA Exemption 5 \nbased on the attorney -client privilege.  See id. at 119 –20, 196.  \nFor two of the opinions, the district court determined that OLC, \nin other official settings, had referenced the opinions’ legal \nconclusions or conv eyed a summary of the opinions.  Id. at \n197–99.  The court thus ordered OLC to disclose those portions \nof the two opinions that corresponded with the disclosures in \nthe other settings, id. at 199 –200, which OLC did.   \n \nThe district court, in ordering discl osure of those parts of \nthe two opinions, relied on decisions holding that, when \ninformation has been officially acknowledged and voluntarily \ndisclosed in a public domain, “a FOIA plaintiff may compel \ndisclosure of that information even over an agency’s ot herwise \nvalid exemption claim.”  ACLU v. U.S. Dep’t of Def. , 628 F.3d \n612, 620  (D.C. Cir. 2011) (citing Wolf v. CIA , 473 F.3d 370, USCA Case #18-5047      Document #1856002            Filed: 08/11/2020      Page 7 of 108 \n 378 (D.C. Cir. 2007)) ; see NSC II , 960 F. Supp. 2d at 198 .  The \ndistrict court subsequently rejected NSC’s contention that it  \nwas entitled to the full contents of the two OLC opinions, not \njust the portions corresponding with the official \nacknowledgments.  NSC III , 206 F. Supp. 3d at 288.  NSC now \nrenews its argument that OLC should have been compelled to \nrelease the full conten ts of the two opinions.  We disagree.  \n \nNSC draws a distinction between two potential grounds \nfor compelling disclosure of the full OLC opinions \nnotwithstanding OLC’s assertion of the attorney -client \nprivilege:  (i) the above -referenced “official acknowledg ment” \ndoctrine, under which an agency cannot withhold information \npursuant to any FOIA exemption when there has previously \nbeen a voluntary, official acknowledgment of the information \nto the public, see, e.g. , Wolf , 473 F.3d at 378; and (ii) waiver \nof the attorney -client privilege itself as to the two opinions.  \nNSC does not dispute that, with regard to the first of those \npotential grounds (which it describes as “significantly \nnarrower”), it was entitled to disclosure only of the parts of the \nOLC opinions t hat the district court ordered be disclosed, not \nthe full opinions.  See NSC Br. 52 –53.  NSC’s argument instead \nis that it was entitled to the full OLC opinions because there \nhad been a waiver of the attorney -client privilege.  See id.  \nAccording to NSC, waiver of the attorney -client privilege \ngenerally effects a waiver as to all material relating to the same \nsubject matter, thus requiring disclosure of the full OLC \nopinions.  Id. \n \nWe conclude, though, that there was no waiver of the \nattorney-client privilege with regard to the two OLC opinions.  \nIn the case of  one of the opinions, the waiver ostensibly \noccurred when OLC cited a legal conclusion contained in it in \nthe course of another , publicly  disclosed  opinion.  See NSC II , \n960 F. Supp.  2d at 198.  In the case of  the second OLC opinion, USCA Case #18-5047      Document #1856002            Filed: 08/11/2020      Page 8 of 109 \n the waiver ostensibly occurred when an OLC attorney provided \na “summary of a summary” of the opinion in an interagency \ncommittee meeting.  See id. at 197.  Neither of those events \neffected a waiver of the  privilege with regard to the two \nreferenced opinions.  \n \nWe need not assess whether the nature of the references to \nthe two opinions sufficed to constitute a waiver of the attorney -\nclient privilege.  That is because, in any event, the references \nwere made b y the attorney (OLC), not the client (the agency to \nwhich OLC gave advice).  Disclosure “by the holder” of the \nprivilege can give rise to a waiver, In re Subpoenas Duces \nTecum , 738 F.2d 1367 , 1369  (D.C. Cir. 1984) , and as NSC \nrecognizes, it “is axiomatic t hat the attorney -client privilege is \nheld by the client ,” NSC Br. 53 n.7.  As a result, an “attorney \nis given the power to claim the privilege on behalf of the client \nbut his betrayal of the client’s secret is not treated as a waiver \nof the privilege.”  26A Charles Alan Wright et al., Federal \nPractice & Procedure  § 5724  (1st ed. 2020) ; see also  Hanson \nv. USAID, 372 F.3d 286, 29 4 (4th Cir. 2004) (“an attorney may \nnot unilaterally waive the privilege that his client enjoys”);  In \nre Sealed Case , 737 F.2d 94, 98 –99 (D.C. Cir. 1984) (the \nprivilege applies if “not waived by the client”) .  OLC’s own \ndisclosures concerning the two opinio ns at issue, then, did not \neffect a waiver of the attorney -client privilege , at least absent \nany indication (absent here) that OLC was acting on behalf of \nthe client when making the disclosures .  See Hanson , 372 F.3d \nat 294 . \n \nIt is true that the district court, in the course of explaining \nthat there had been an official acknowledgment of the two \nopinions so as to implicate the official -acknowledgment \ndoctrine, went on to say that there had also been a waiver of the \nattorney -client privilege.  See NSC II , 960 F. Supp. 2d at 198.  \nFor the reasons explained, however, we conclude that there was USCA Case #18-5047      Document #1856002            Filed: 08/11/2020      Page 9 of 1010 \n no such waiver in the circumstances.  We therefore have no \noccasion to address whether, if there had been a waiver of the \nprivilege in conne ction with the two opinions,  disclosure of the \nfull opinions would have been necessary as a matter of course .  \nSee In re Sealed Case , 121 F.3d 729, 741  (D.C. Cir. 1997) .  \nRather, because there was no waiver to begin with, we reject \nNSC’s argument that it w as entitled to disclosure of the full \nOLC opinions on a privilege -waiver theory.  \n \n*     *     *     *     *  \n \n NSC advances an array of additional arguments \nconcerning various aspects of district court’s decisions under \nreview.  We have given those arguments careful consideration \nand conclude that the district court did not err in its \ndispositions.  For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district \ncourt’s judgments.  \n \nIt is so ordered.  \n \n \n \n USCA Case #18-5047      Document #1856002            Filed: 08/11/2020      Page 10 of 10",

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit affirmed the district court’s dismissal of all claims by National Security Counselors (NSC) against the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the Department of Justice (DOJ). The appeals involved multiple FOIA requests where the CIA refused to create new records not already in existence and declined a burdensome search, and the DOJ invoked attorney-client privilege on certain legal opinions, which NSC argued were improperly withheld. The case did not involve artificial intelligence directly in the claims or holdings.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the CIA and DOJ properly denied FOIA requests by NSC on the grounds that they either sought the creation of new records, required an unreasonably burdensome search, or involved privileged attorney-client communications.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court held that FOIA does not require agencies to create new records or conduct unreasonably burdensome searches. Moreover, it found no waiver of attorney-client privilege with respect to legal opinions referenced externally by the DOJ.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine you ask a library for a list of people who borrowed books with certain categories in the past. The library says, \"We can't do that because we don’t keep records like that, and creating them from scratch would be a lot of extra work.\" You also ask them for advice documents lawyers wrote, but they're not giving them because, even though the ideas might be public, sharing the whole document could break lawyer-client confidentiality rules. The court agreed with the library (CIA/DOJ) saying they're following the rules correctly.",

USCA Case #18-5048      Document #1856002            Filed: 08/11/2020      Page 1 of 102 \n Opinion for the Court filed by Chief Judge  SRINIVASAN . \n \nSRINIVASAN , Chief Judge :  National Security Counselors \n(NSC) is a Virginia -based non -profit organization that \ndisseminates  national security materials  to the public.   NSC \nfrequently seeks  to obtain records from intelligence and \ndefense agencies  through the Freedom of Information Act .     \n \nNSC filed three lawsuits in federal district court on the \nsame day in 2011.  The lawsuits together raised  forty -five \nclaims against six federal agencies  arising out of numerous \nFOIA requests initiated by NSC.  The district court, in a series \nof decisions, eventually ruled in favor of the government on all \nof NSC’s  claims.  See Nat ’l Sec. Counselors v. CIA  (NSC I ), \n898 F. Supp. 2d 233 , 290 –91 (D.D .C. 2012); Nat’l Sec. \nCounselors v. CIA  (NSC II ), 960 F. Supp. 2d 10 1, 208 –10 \n(D.D.C. 2013); Nat’l Sec. Counselors v. CIA  (NSC III ), 206 F. \nSupp. 3d 241 , 288 –90 (D.D.C. 2016).   \n \nNSC now appeals , raising a number of challenges to the \ndistrict court’s decisions.  In this opinion, we individually \naddress  (and reject ) three of NSC’s claims:  two claims \nconcerning distinct  FOIA requests made to the Central \nIntelligence Agency and a third claim concerning the \nDepartment of Justice’s assertion of att orney -client privilege in \nresponse to a FOIA request.  While we do not separately \ndiscuss NSC’s remaining claims, we find that none has merit \nand thus affirm the district court in all respects.  \n \nI. \n \nFOIA allows agencies to assess varying fees against  \nrequesters depending on the purpose for which the information \nis sought, the identity of the requester, or both.  See 5 U.S.C. \n§ 552(a)(4) (A).  In August  2010 , NSC submitted FOIA USCA Case #18-5048      Document #1856002            Filed: 08/11/2020      Page 2 of 103 \n requests to the CIA  for a  listing of all FOIA requesters from \nfiscal year s 2008 to 2010 organized  under  each of four fee \ncategories  contemplated by FOIA :  “news media,” \n“educational or scientific,” “commercial,” or “all other .”  NSC \nFOIA Requests to CIA  (Aug. 8, 2010), 1 J.A. 103 –15; see 5 \nU.S.C.  § 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(I) –(III).   \n \nThe CIA declined to process the requests , explaining, \namong other things, that FOIA does not require an agency to \ncreate records not otherwise in existence .  NSC then brought \nan action under FOIA in the district court, challenging the \nagency’s refusal to process the requests.  The district court \ngranted summary judgment in favor of the CIA .  See NSC II , \n960 F. Supp. 2d at 161.  We review the district court’s grant of \nsummary judgment de novo , see Nat’l Sec. Counselors v. DOJ , \n848 F.3d 467, 470 (D.C. Cir. 2017), and agree with the court’s  \ndisposition .   \n \nFOIA provides for “disclosure of certain documents which \nthe law requires the agency to prepare or which the agency has \ndecided for its own reasons to create.”  NLRB v. Sears, Roebuck \n& Co. , 421 U.S. 132, 162 (1975).   But “FOIA imposes no duty \non the agency to create record s.”  Forsham v. Harris , 445 U.S. \n169, 186 (1980).  FOIA, that is, only requires disclosure of \ndocuments that already exist, not the creation of new records \nnot otherwise in the agency’s possession.  See Yeager v. Drug \nEnf’t Admin. , 678 F.2d 315, 321 (D.C. Cir. 1982); H.R. Rep. \nNo. 104 –795, at 22  (1996) . \n \nHere, NSC’s request for the CIA to produce listings \naccording to four fee categories of all FOIA requesters over a \ntwo-year period would require the agency to create new \nrecords, not to disclose existing on es.  The CIA’s Information \nReview Officer , whose responsibilities include final review of \ndocuments that are the subject of FOIA requests , submitted a USCA Case #18-5048      Document #1856002            Filed: 08/11/2020      Page 3 of 104 \n declaration in the district court that sets out the relevant \ncapabilities of the agency’s FOIA records sy stem.  Declaration \nof Martha Lutz  ¶ 11 (Dec. 13, 2011) (Lutz Decl.) , 1 J.A. 196.  \nAs she explained, “[f]ee category is not a mandatory field in \nCIA’s current electronic FOIA records system; therefore, this \ninformation is often not included in a FOIA reques t record.”  \nId.  To produce listings of FOIA requesters by fee category  per \nNSC’s request , then, “the CIA’s FOIA analys ts would be \nrequired to individually review each FOIA reque st submitted \nfrom 2008 to 2010 and manually sort thousands of request s \nbased on fee category.”  Id.  That process would \nquintessentially entail  the creation of new records, not the \ndisclosure of preexisting ones.  \n \nAccording to NSC, “sorting a database by field is not \ncreating records, and releasing the information which resu lted \nfrom that sorting action is also not creating records.”  NSC Br. \n16.  We have no occasion here, however, to consider  whether \nsorting a database by field would involve  the creation of new \nrecords.  As the CIA’s declaration establishes, the agency’s \nFOIA database does not contain  the relevant field (i.e. fee \ncategor y) as mandatory information in the first place.  Lutz \nDecl. ¶ 11 , 1 J.A. 196 . \n \nNSC suggests more broadly that “there are no ‘records’ to \nspeak of in an electronic database in which information  is \nentered into fields.”  NSC Br. 16.  FOIA makes clear , though,  \nthat a “record” within the meaning of the statute includes \ninformation “that would be an agency record . . . when \nmaintained by an agency in any format, including an electronic \nformat.”  5 U .S.C. § 552(f)(2)(A); see Yeager , 678 F.2d at 321.  \nBut regardless of whether a given record exists in an electronic \nor paper format (or both), the statute only calls for the \ndisclosure of existing records, not the generation of new ones.  \nAnd whatever que stions may arise in future cases about when USCA Case #18-5048      Document #1856002            Filed: 08/11/2020      Page 4 of 105 \n disclosing the results of an electronic search of records entails  \ncreation of a record, here, responding to NSC’s request would \nrequire manual review and sorting of numerous electronic \nrecords and  the ensuing  compilation of lists that do not \notherwise exist.  That exercise self -evidently amounts to \nrecords creation, which FOIA does not require.  \n \nII. \n \nWe next consider another FOIA request NSC made to the \nCIA, this one for “all Central Intelligence Agency (‘CIA’ ) \nrecords pertaining to the IBM supercomputer named \n‘Watson.’”  CIA Request Correspondence (Feb. 16, 2011), 1 \nJ.A. 275.  NSC added “that agencies have a duty to construe \nthe subject material of FOIA requests liberally to ensure \nresponsive records are not o verlooked.”  Id.  The CIA declined \nto process the request “in its current form because it would \nrequire the Agency to perform an unreasonably burdensome \nsearch.”  CIA Request Correspondence (Mar . 2, 2011),  1 J.A. \n280.  The CIA invited NSC “to refine the sc ope of [its] request \n(such as contracts, if they exist, which would explain records \npertaining to ‘Watson’) to enable [the agency] to conduct a \nreasonable search for responsive information.”  Id.   \n \n NSC did not narrow the scope of its request, but instead  \nfiled a lawsuit challenging the CIA’s response.  The district \ncourt granted summary judgment to the CIA.  NSC II , 960 F. \nSupp. 2d at 163.   We again agree with the district court’s \ndisposition.   \n \n FOIA imposes obligations on agencies to disclose records \nfor requests that “reasonably describe[] such records.”  5 \nU.S.C. § 552(a)(3)(A).  We have explained that agencies “need \nnot honor a request that requires ‘an unreasonably burdensome \nsearch.’”  Am. Fed’n of Gov’t Emps. Local 2782 v. U.S. Dep’t USCA Case #18-5048      Document #1856002            Filed: 08/11/2020      Page 5 of 106 \n of Commerce , 907 F.2d 203, 209 (D.C. Cir. 1990) (citing \nGoland v. CIA , 607 F.2d 339, 353 (D.C. Cir. 1978)).  We have \nalso established that agencies should read FOIA request s “as \ndrafted, not as either agency officials or [the requester] might \nwish it was drafted.”  Miller v. Casey , 730 F.2d 773, 777 (D.C. \nCir. 1984).  The upshot is that, when the request as drafted \nwould require an agency to undertake an unreasonably \nburdenso me search, the agency can decline to process the \nrequest.   \n \n That is what happened here.  As the CIA’s Information \nReview Officer explained in her declaration, “it is difficult to \ndetermine where responsive information would likely be \nlocated within the Agency because the request is so general.”  \nLutz.  Decl. ¶ 31 , 1 J.A. 204 .  “CIA’s records,” she advised, \n“are decentralized and compartmented.  Each directorate . . . \nmust determine which components and/or records systems \nwithin the directorate might reasonably be expected to possess \nrecords responsive to a particular request.”  Id. at ¶ 30.  As a \nresult, “the CIA would be required to search every office for \nany documents containing the word ‘Watson,’” which would \namount to a “massive undertaking.”  Id. at ¶ 31, 1 J.A. 205 . \n \n NSC does not dispute that a search for all documents \nanywhere in the CIA related to “Watson” would be unduly \nburdensome.  NSC instead submits that the CIA gave the \nrequest an “overbroad reading,” in that the request should have \nbeen understood to encompass only “records about how the \ndevelopment of Watson impacted the Intelligence Community, \nspecifically with respect to the application of comparable \nartificial intelligence systems to intelligence analysis.”  NSC \nBr. 27.  The request , though, does not say that .  Instead, it  is \nframed broadly to seek “all [CIA] records pertaining to the \nIBM supercomputer ‘Watson,’” with an added emphasis “to \nconstrue” it “ liberally .”  CIA Request Correspondence, 1 J.A. USCA Case #18-5048      Document #1856002            Filed: 08/11/2020      Page 6 of 107 \n 275.  To be sure, NSC, when askin g for a public -interest fee \nwaiver in its letter transmitting the request , said that responsive \nrecords would “serve as a case study for the CIA’s involvement \nin artificial intelligence research.”  Id. at 277.  But the request \nitself was not so confined, a nd NSC did not refine its request \nafter the CIA invited it to do so.  \n \nThe agency interpreted NSC’s request as drafted, as our \ndecisions direct.  Miller , 730 F.2d at 777.  And the agency and \nthe district court correctly concluded that, as drafted, the \nreque st called for an unreasonably burdensome search.  \n \nIII. \n \nWe next consider a FOIA request submitted by NSC to the \nOffice of Legal Counsel (OLC) in the Department of Justice.  \nThe request sought OLC opinions pertaining to  various statutes \nincluding FOIA itsel f, the Privacy Act, and the Federal Records \nAct.  See NSC II , 960 F. Supp. 2d at 119.  OLC  withheld a \nnumber of its responsive opinions under FOIA Exemption 5 \nbased on the attorney -client privilege.  See id. at 119 –20, 196.  \nFor two of the opinions, the district court determined that OLC, \nin other official settings, had referenced the opinions’ legal \nconclusions or conv eyed a summary of the opinions.  Id. at \n197–99.  The court thus ordered OLC to disclose those portions \nof the two opinions that corresponded with the disclosures in \nthe other settings, id. at 199 –200, which OLC did.   \n \nThe district court, in ordering discl osure of those parts of \nthe two opinions, relied on decisions holding that, when \ninformation has been officially acknowledged and voluntarily \ndisclosed in a public domain, “a FOIA plaintiff may compel \ndisclosure of that information even over an agency’s ot herwise \nvalid exemption claim.”  ACLU v. U.S. Dep’t of Def. , 628 F.3d \n612, 620  (D.C. Cir. 2011) (citing Wolf v. CIA , 473 F.3d 370, USCA Case #18-5048      Document #1856002            Filed: 08/11/2020      Page 7 of 108 \n 378 (D.C. Cir. 2007)) ; see NSC II , 960 F. Supp. 2d at 198 .  The \ndistrict court subsequently rejected NSC’s contention that it  \nwas entitled to the full contents of the two OLC opinions, not \njust the portions corresponding with the official \nacknowledgments.  NSC III , 206 F. Supp. 3d at 288.  NSC now \nrenews its argument that OLC should have been compelled to \nrelease the full conten ts of the two opinions.  We disagree.  \n \nNSC draws a distinction between two potential grounds \nfor compelling disclosure of the full OLC opinions \nnotwithstanding OLC’s assertion of the attorney -client \nprivilege:  (i) the above -referenced “official acknowledg ment” \ndoctrine, under which an agency cannot withhold information \npursuant to any FOIA exemption when there has previously \nbeen a voluntary, official acknowledgment of the information \nto the public, see, e.g. , Wolf , 473 F.3d at 378; and (ii) waiver \nof the attorney -client privilege itself as to the two opinions.  \nNSC does not dispute that, with regard to the first of those \npotential grounds (which it describes as “significantly \nnarrower”), it was entitled to disclosure only of the parts of the \nOLC opinions t hat the district court ordered be disclosed, not \nthe full opinions.  See NSC Br. 52 –53.  NSC’s argument instead \nis that it was entitled to the full OLC opinions because there \nhad been a waiver of the attorney -client privilege.  See id.  \nAccording to NSC, waiver of the attorney -client privilege \ngenerally effects a waiver as to all material relating to the same \nsubject matter, thus requiring disclosure of the full OLC \nopinions.  Id. \n \nWe conclude, though, that there was no waiver of the \nattorney-client privilege with regard to the two OLC opinions.  \nIn the case of  one of the opinions, the waiver ostensibly \noccurred when OLC cited a legal conclusion contained in it in \nthe course of another , publicly  disclosed  opinion.  See NSC II , \n960 F. Supp.  2d at 198.  In the case of  the second OLC opinion, USCA Case #18-5048      Document #1856002            Filed: 08/11/2020      Page 8 of 109 \n the waiver ostensibly occurred when an OLC attorney provided \na “summary of a summary” of the opinion in an interagency \ncommittee meeting.  See id. at 197.  Neither of those events \neffected a waiver of the  privilege with regard to the two \nreferenced opinions.  \n \nWe need not assess whether the nature of the references to \nthe two opinions sufficed to constitute a waiver of the attorney -\nclient privilege.  That is because, in any event, the references \nwere made b y the attorney (OLC), not the client (the agency to \nwhich OLC gave advice).  Disclosure “by the holder” of the \nprivilege can give rise to a waiver, In re Subpoenas Duces \nTecum , 738 F.2d 1367 , 1369  (D.C. Cir. 1984) , and as NSC \nrecognizes, it “is axiomatic t hat the attorney -client privilege is \nheld by the client ,” NSC Br. 53 n.7.  As a result, an “attorney \nis given the power to claim the privilege on behalf of the client \nbut his betrayal of the client’s secret is not treated as a waiver \nof the privilege.”  26A Charles Alan Wright et al., Federal \nPractice & Procedure  § 5724  (1st ed. 2020) ; see also  Hanson \nv. USAID, 372 F.3d 286, 29 4 (4th Cir. 2004) (“an attorney may \nnot unilaterally waive the privilege that his client enjoys”);  In \nre Sealed Case , 737 F.2d 94, 98 –99 (D.C. Cir. 1984) (the \nprivilege applies if “not waived by the client”) .  OLC’s own \ndisclosures concerning the two opinio ns at issue, then, did not \neffect a waiver of the attorney -client privilege , at least absent \nany indication (absent here) that OLC was acting on behalf of \nthe client when making the disclosures .  See Hanson , 372 F.3d \nat 294 . \n \nIt is true that the district court, in the course of explaining \nthat there had been an official acknowledgment of the two \nopinions so as to implicate the official -acknowledgment \ndoctrine, went on to say that there had also been a waiver of the \nattorney -client privilege.  See NSC II , 960 F.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: The Estate of Gene B. Lokken and others filed a class-action lawsuit against UnitedHealth Group, Inc., and naviHealth, Inc., alleging the misuse of an AI program, nH Predict, to deny medical coverage in breach of insurance agreements. The United States District Court for the District of Minnesota addressed a motion by the defendants to bifurcate the discovery process, which would separately handle the merits of the named plaintiffs before addressing broader class certification, but the court denied this motion. The involvement of AI centers on whether nH Predict was used improperly instead of human medical directors to make coverage decisions violating contractual obligations.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the discovery process should be bifurcated to first address the specific claims of the named plaintiffs regarding their coverage denials allegedly made by AI, before moving to class-wide discovery and potential class certification.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court denied the motion to bifurcate the discovery process, finding that bifurcation would not promote judicial efficiency and could lead to additional legal disputes over the separation of merits and class discovery, possibly delaying the case unnecessarily.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine you and many others were told by an insurance company that doctors would always handle your case, but instead, they used a computer program to decide if they'd pay for your healthcare. You took them to court because you think that's not fair. The company wanted the court to first only look at how this affected you and a few others before thinking about everybody else. The court said no to this idea because splitting up the investigation in this way would make things more complicated and take longer for everyone involved.",
    "full_text": "  \n \n  \n UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nDISTRICT OF MINNESOTA \n \n \nThe Estate of Gene B. Lokken, et al., \n \n Plaintiffs, \n \nv. \n \nUnitedHealth Group, Inc., et al., \n \n Defendants.   \nCase No. 23-cv-3514 (JRT/SGE) \n \n \n \n \n                     ORDER  \n  \n \nThis matter is before the Court on Defendants’ Motion to Amend the Pretrial \nScheduling Order (Dkt. 115). The Court heard oral argument on the motion September 4, \n2025. (See Dkt. 125.) For the reasons stated during the hearing, United States Magistrate \nJudge Shannon G. Elkins, denied Defendants’ motion on the record. This Order \nmemorializes the Court’s ruling. \nBACKGROUND \nThis is a putative class action alleging that UnitedHealth Group, Inc., and \nnaviHealth, Inc., used an artificial intelligence program called nH Predict to deny medical \ncare coverage in violation of the terms of the Plaintiffs’ insurance agreements. Defendants \nmoved to dismiss the Complaint, and United States District Judge John R. Tunheim \ngranted-in-part and denied-in-part the Motion. (Dkt. 91.) Judge Tunheim determined that \nseveral of Plaintiffs’ state claims were preempted by federal statute, but he allowed \nPlaintiffs’ claims for breach of contract and breach of the implied covenant of good faith \nand fair dealing to proceed. He wrote that these claims “effectively arise out of CASE 0:23-cv-03514-JRT-SGE     Doc. 130     Filed 09/08/25     Page 1 of 7  \n \n2 \n [Defendants’] evidence of coverage documents because the question [is] whether UHC \ncomplied with its statement that claim decisions would be made by ‘clinical services staff’ \nand ‘physicians’ when it allegedly used artificial intelligence.” (Dkt. 91 at 19.)  \nAfter receiving this partially adverse ruling, Defendants requested Judge Tunheim \nallow them to file a motion to reconsider the Order. (Dkt. 95.) Judge Tunheim denied the \nrequest but clarified his previous order stating, \n. . . UHC requests clarification from the Court on the scope of the \ncontract claims and damages. The contract claims survived \npreemption due to their independence from the Medicare Act, which \nlimited the Court’s analysis to the Evidence of Coverage (“EOC”) \ndocuments provided by UHC. Accordingly, the contract claims are \nlimited to breaches of EOC terms. \n(Dkt. 104 at 2.)  \nDefendants then filed the instant motion on August 21, 2025, asking this Court to \namend the pretrial scheduling order to bifurcate discovery into two stages. Defendants \npropose the first stage would allow discovery only for the “threshold factual question of \nwhether Defendants used nH Predict in place of physician medical directors to make \nadverse coverage determinations related to the named Plaintiffs’ care in skilled nursing \nfacilities.” (Dkt. 117 at 7.) After the first stage of discovery, Defendants state, the case \nwould be ripe for summary judgment to determine whether a genuine issue of material fact \nexists with respect to the named Plaintiffs. Under Defendants’ proposal, stage two \ndiscovery, which would include expert and class-based discovery, would take place only \nif the court determines that the named Plaintiffs have demonstrated genuine issues of \nmaterial fact. CASE 0:23-cv-03514-JRT-SGE     Doc. 130     Filed 09/08/25     Page 2 of 7  \n \n3 \n DISCUSSION \nI. Legal Standard \nThe federal rules provide that the Pretrial Scheduling Order “may be modified only \nfor good cause . . . .” Fed. R. Civ. P. 16(b)(4). Rule 42 allows courts to “issue any . . . orders \nto avoid unnecessary cost or delay.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 42(a)(3). Furthermore, and much more \ngenerally, Rule 1 mandates that the Rules “be construed, administered, and employed by \nthe court and the parties to secure the just, speedy, and inexpensive determination of every \naction and proceeding.” \nThe federal rules also provide, “[a]t an early practicable time after a person sues or \nis sued as a class representative, the court must determine by order whether to certify the \naction as a class action.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(1)(A). Whether to bifurcate discovery is \nwithin the discretion of the Court. See, e.g., Adam v. CHW Grp., Inc. , Case No. 21-cv-\n0091-LRR-MAR, 2021 WL 7285904, at *1-2 (N.D. Iowa June 29, 2021). The party \nseeking bifurcation bears the burden of showing that it will be prejudiced if the discovery \nis not bifurcated, and the party must allege undue burden, expense, or prejudice associated \nwith discovery. See, e.g., Ameritas Life Ins. Corp. v. Fed. Ins. Co. , Case No. 16-cv-3006, \n2017 WL 432693, at *2 (D. Neb. Jan. 31, 2017), and United States v. Thompson , Case no. \n13-cv-180, 2014 WL 2624927, at *4 (D. Neb. June 12, 2014).  Although the Eighth Circuit \nhas not directly addressed the issue, the Court has noted that “[b]road discovery should \nusually be permitted prior to class certification.” Johnson v. Nekoosa-Edwards Paper Co. , \n558 F.2d 841, 845 n.5 (8th Cir. 1977), cited in Cosgrove v. OS Restaurant Servs., Inc. , \n2010 WL 11575055, at *3 (D. Minn. Aug. 31, 2010). CASE 0:23-cv-03514-JRT-SGE     Doc. 130     Filed 09/08/25     Page 3 of 7  \n \n4 \n There are occasions where bifurcation is appropriate where resolving a “narrow, \npotentially dispositive issue” could obviate the need for costly class discovery. Physicians \nHealthsource, Inc. v. Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. , Civ. No. 12-2132, 2014 WL 413534, \nat *4 (D.N.J. Feb. 4, 2014) (TCPA case). “Notwithstanding the general difficulty and \npotential drain on judicial resources in managing bifurcated discovery in class action \nlitigation, determining whether the advantages of bifurcation outweigh its disadvantages is \na factual inquiry assessed on a case-by-case basis.” Hanover 3201 Realty, LLC v. Village \nSupermarkets, Inc. , Civ. No. 14-1327, 2016 WL 4541870, at *2 (D.N.J. Aug. 31, 2016). \nII. Bifurcating discovery is inappropriate in this case.   \n \nDefendants argue that good cause exists to bifurcate discovery because it would \npromote efficient resolution of the dispute and preserve judicial economy. Defendants \npropose that the Court order the parties to conduct discovery into the merits of the named \nclass representatives first and require Plaintiffs to survive summary judgment before \nallowing any expert or class-based discovery. Plaintiffs argue that bifurcation would lead \nto additional, avoidable motion practice and that Defendants’ failure to seek bifurcation \nearlier in the litigation demonstrates a lack of diligence that undercuts their argument for \ngood cause. \nThe Court does not find Defendants’ arguments about efficiency persuasive. \nDefendants’ argument that bifurcation will save the parties the time and the expense of \nclass discovery assumes their success on a motion for summary judgment. However, if \ntheir motion for summary judgment fails, bifurcating discovery will only delay the case CASE 0:23-cv-03514-JRT-SGE     Doc. 130     Filed 09/08/25     Page 4 of 7  \n \n5 \n and prejudice the Plaintiffs by requiring them to litigate discovery and summary judgment \ntwice. \nReviewing how this case has proceeded thus far, the Court also disagrees that \nbifurcation would promote judicial economy. Defendants resisted proceeding with \ndiscovery at the initial Rule 26(f) Report stage, at the Rule 16 scheduling conference, and \nagain by successfully moving to stay discovery last August. (See Dkt. 56, 69.) Then, when \nDefendants received a partially adverse ruling from Judge Tunheim, they decided not to \nanswer many of Plaintiffs’ discovery requests and instead moved, for the first time since \nthis case was filed in 2023, to bifurcate discovery so that they would only have to produce \ndiscovery relevant to the eight named Plaintiffs.  \nDefendants do not propose to conduct discovery on a narrow legal issue that might \nresolve a lurking dispositive issue. Rather, they propose to litigate the entire case as to the \nnamed plaintiffs and proceed to litigate with respect to the class only if the named Plaintiffs \nsurvive summary judgment. Defendants submit that they want summary judgment to \nprecede class certification to resolve one “straightforward” and “limited” question—\nwhether or not Defendants breached the terms of the insurance contracts by allegedly \nmaking coverage care determinations based on their use of nH Predict instead of relying \non individualized decisions by physician medical directors. But bifurcating discovery \ncreates tension between what is “class-related” discovery and what is “merits” discovery.  \nThe Supreme Court has stated that class certification analysis under Rule 23 \n“generally involves considerations that are enmeshed in the factual and legal issues \ncomprising the plaintiff’s cause of action.” Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes , 564 U.S. 338, CASE 0:23-cv-03514-JRT-SGE     Doc. 130     Filed 09/08/25     Page 5 of 7  \n \n6 \n 351 (2011) (cleaned up). This inherent overlap, as well as the potentially thorny question \nof whether certain discovery would classify as class or merits discovery, has left courts \n“reluctant to bifurcate class-related discovery from discovery on the merits.” Ahmed v. \nHSBC Bank USA, Nat’l Ass’n , Civ. No. 15-2057, 2018 WL 501413, at *3 (C.D. Cal. Jan. \n5, 2018) (cleaned up).  \nA good example of this tension between class discovery and merits discovery played \nout in Plaintiffs’ contemporaneously filed Motion to Compel. ( See Dkt. 109.) Many of the \ndiscovery requests made by Plaintiffs went unanswered because Defendants perceived the \nrequests to relate to class discovery.  But many of the discovery responses Plaintiffs moved \nto compel would be relevant to both the “merits” of the case and the “class certification” \nissues.  \nThe Court finds that bifurcating discovery in this case would lead to avoidable \ndisputes over whether a particular discovery request relates to the merits or to class \ncertification. This would not economize the judicial involvement in this case and could \npotentially compound it, frustrating rather than furthering judicial economy. \nAdditionally, this Court does not read Judge Tunheim’s Order as narrowing the \nscope of the dispute in the way Defendants argue. This Court does not believe Judge \nTunheim intended the parties to litigate only the claims as they relate to the named \nPlaintiffs first. Rather Judge Tunheim’s task in ruling on the Motion to Dismiss was to \ndetermine whether the claims were preempted by the Medicare Act. As his subsequent \nOrder clarifies, the contract-based claims survived preemption due to their independence \nfrom the Medicare Act and because the contract claims were limited to breach of the CASE 0:23-cv-03514-JRT-SGE     Doc. 130     Filed 09/08/25     Page 6 of 7  \n \n7 \n Evidence of Coverage terms. This Court cannot conceive of a reading of Judge Tunheim’s \nOrders that limited discovery to the named Plaintiffs. \nThe Court has considered the general difficulty and potential drain on judicial \nresources in managing bifurcated discovery in this litigation and determines that the \nadvantages of bifurcation are outweighed by its disadvantages to both the parties and the \nCourt. Simply put, this Court determines that bifurcation would create more problems than \nit would solve in this particular case. \nORDER \nAccordingly, based on the foregoing, and all the files, records, and proceedings \nherein, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED THAT Defendants’ Motion to Amend the Pretrial \nScheduling Order (Dkt. 115) is DENIED.   \n \nDated:  September 8, 2025  \n      s/Shannon G.

The Department withheld approximately 5,000 pages, citing FOIA Exemption 3 related to critical infrastructure security, but failed to provide a satisfactory affidavit to substantiate the exemption.

    "full_text": "UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT  \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA  \n  \nCivil Action No. 23-1380  (TJK)  SAM BIDDLE , \nPlaintif f, \nv. \nDEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE , \nDefendant . \n \nMEMORANDUM ORDER  \nPlaintiff Sam Biddle submitted a Freedom of Information Act request to the Department \nof Defense  seeking “ records pertaining to the Algorithmic Warfare Cross -Functional Team’s use \nof Google technology, software or hardware,” from  January 1, 2017 , to March 6, 2018 .  The De-\npartment  identified about 5,000  pages of responsive records , but it withheld th em all under  FOIA \nExemptions 3, 4, 5, and 6.   After several internal remands, the Department affirmed its decision \nto withhold the records .  Biddle sued, and the parties now cross -move for summary judgment.   See \nECF Nos.  14, 17.  \nThe Department argues that the information was properly withheld under Exemption 3, \nwhich exempts information that is specifically exempted from disclosure by statute .  In doing so, \nthe Department  relies on 10 U.S.C. §  130e, which allows  it to withhold “critical infrastructure \nsecurity information.”   The Department does not seek to justify its withholding s under any other \nexemption in its motion, but notes that  it “reserves the right to review and withhold all exempt \ninformation under other applicable exemptions including, but not limited to, FOIA Exemptions 4, \n5, and 6.”   ECF No.  14 at 3 n.2.  In response, Biddle argues that the Department has improperly \ninvoke d Exemption 3 because the relevant sta tute does not apply to the information it withheld, Case 1:23-cv-01380-TJK   Document 24   Filed 09/13/24   Page 1 of 8 \n 2 the Department’s affidavit is inadequate, and the Department’s segregability analysis is insuffi-\ncient.  He also asserts that he is entitled to summary judgment because the Department has waived \nits right to invoke  the other FOIA exemptions and  that, in any event, those exemptions provide no \nbasis for withholding the information.  \nFor the reasons discussed below, the Court finds that the affidavit  the Department has sup-\nplied does not provide enough information to determine whether it properly applied  Exemption 3 .  \nThus, the Court will deny both parties’ motions for summary judgment without prejudice  and per-\nmit them to file renewed motions  consistent with this Memorandum Order.   Moreover, in any such \nrenewed motion, in the interests of judicial economy, the Department will be required to assert , in \naddition to Exemption 3 , any other exemption that it relies on to withhold the records.  \nIn FOIA cases in which an agency invokes any FOIA exemption, t he “burden is on the \nagency to justify withholding the requested documents, and the FOIA directs district courts to \ndetermine de novo whether non -disclosure was permissible.”  EPIC v. D ep’t of Homeland Sec. , \n777 F.3d 518, 522 (D.C. Cir. 2015) .  When conducting its de novo review, a  court may grant \nsummary judgment based on the agency ’s declarations  if the “affidavit describes the justifications \nfor withholding the information with specific detail, demonstrates that the information withheld \nlogically falls within the claimed exemption, and is not contradicted by contrary evidence in the \nrecord or by evidence  of the agency's bad faith.”  Am. Civil Liberties Union v. Dep’t of Def. , 628 \nF.3d 612, 619 (D.C. Cir. 2011) .   That is, the agency must provide a “ logical” or “plausible” justi-\nfication for the exemption , Larson v. Dep’t of State , 565 F.3d 857, 862 (D.C. Cir. 2009) , and may \nnot rely on “conclusory and generalized allegations of exemptions ,” Morley v. CIA , 508 F.3d 1108, \n1114 –15 (D.C. Cir. 2007) . As the D.C. Circuit explained, agencies must submit  sufficiently de-\ntailed and specific affidavit s for at least three purposes: “ it forces the government to analyze Case 1:23-cv-01380-TJK   Document 24   Filed 09/13/24   Page 2 of 8 \n 3 carefully any material withheld, it enables the trial court to fulfill its duty of ruling on the applica-\nbility of the exemption, and it enables the adversary system to operate by giving the requester as \nmuch information as possible, on the basis of which h e can present his case to the trial court. ”  \nLykins v. Dep’t of Just. , 725 F.2d 1455, 1463 (D.C. Cir. 1984) .  The withholding agency  “must \ndescribe each document or portion thereof withheld, and for each withholding it must discuss the \nconsequences of disclosing the sought -after information. ”  King v. Dep’t of Just. , 830 F.2d 210, \n223–24 (D.C. Cir. 1987) .  That information “ is necessary to ensure meaningful review of an \nagency ’s claim to withhold information subject to a FOIA request. ”  Id. at 223 . \nThe Department invokes Exemption 3 , which applies to information that is exempted from \ndisclosure by statute .  Unlike other FOIA exemptions, Exemption 3 “ depends less on the detailed \nfactual contents of specific documents; the sole issue for decision is the existence of a relevant \nstatute and the inclusion of withheld material within the statute ’s coverage.”    Morley , 508 F.3d at \n1126 (citation omitted).  As noted, t he Department relies on 10 U.S.C. §  130e, which permits the \nwithholding of  “critical infrastructure security information .”  The statute defines that information \nas:  \nsensitive but unclassified information that, if disclosed, would reveal vulnerabilities \nin Department of Defense critical infrastructure  that, if exploited, would likely re-\nsult in the significant disruption, destruction, or damage of or to Department of \nDefense operations, property, or facilities, including information regarding the se-\ncuring and safeguarding of explosives, hazardous chemicals, or pipelines, related \nto critical infrastructure or protected systems owned or operated by or on behalf of \nthe Department  of Defense, including vulnerability assessments prepared by or on \nbehalf of the Department of Defense, explosives safety information (including stor-\nage and handling), and other site -specific information on or relating to installation \nsecurity.    \n10 U.S.C. § 130 e(f).  \nBut the Department’s affidavit  is not “ furnished with sufficient information ” for the Court \nto decide summary judgment “ in a meaningful fashion .”  King , 830 F.2d  at 223.  It has provided Case 1:23-cv-01380-TJK   Document 24   Filed 09/13/24   Page 3 of 8 \n 4 almost no specific information about  the 5,000 pages it seeks to withhold  for the Court to determine \nwhether they are in fact “critical infrastructure security information” and qualify for Exemption 3 \nwithholding.   Instead, it supplies a few short paragraphs that rely on generalizations and conclusory \nstatements.  \nOne specific shortcoming with the Department’s affidavit worth highlighting is that it does \nnot explain to what “critical infrastructure” the withheld records relate .  To qualify as “critical \ninfrastructure security information,” the information at issue must, “ if disclosed  . . . reveal vulner-\nabilities in Department of Defense critical infrastructure .”  10 U.S.C. §  130e(f).  The closest the \nDepartment comes is asserting that the information “ individually or in the aggregate, would enable \nan adversary to identify capabilities and vulnerabilities in the Department’s approach to artificial \nintelligence development and implementation .”  ECF No.  14-1 at 4.   The Court is left to wonder \nhow “ the Department’s approach to artificial intelligence development and implementation ” qual-\nifies as “critical infrastructure” under the statute.  Indeed, an “approach” is not usually considered \n“infrastructure.”  In addition, revealing “capabilities” —rather than “vulnerabilities” —does not ap-\npear to move the needle under the statute.  In any event, the Department offers no “specific infor-\nmation ” on this point “ sufficient to place the documents within th [is] exemption category .”  Hay-\nden v. Nat’l Sec. Agency/Cent. Sec. Serv. , 608 F.2d 1381 , 1387  (D.C. Cir. 1979) .  All it provides \nare “broad and vague descriptions” of the information that make it impossible for the Court to \nconduct its requisite de novo review over the Department’s decision to withhold this information \nas “critical infrastructure  security information .”  See Prop. of the People, Inc. v. Off. of Mgmt. & \nBudget , 330 F.  Supp.  3d 373, 388  (D.D.C. 2018) .  \nAside from whether the Department’s “ approach to artificial intelligence development and \nimplementation ” should be considered “critical infrastructure,” the Department’s affidavit  is Case 1:23-cv-01380-TJK   Document 24   Filed 09/13/24   Page 4 of 8 \n 5 deficient in showing that its withholdings qualify as “critical infrastructure security information” \nin other ways.  For example, the affidavit fails to explain how the disclosure of the withheld infor-\nmation would reveal any alleged “vulnerabilities ” in the critical infrastructure.  See 10 U.S.C. \n§ 130e(f) (requiring that the information must, “ if disclosed  . . . reveal vulnerabilities in Depart-\nment of Defense critical infrastructure .”).1  In many cases , such a connection would be self -evident \n—for example, the statute provides the case of a “ vulnerability assessment ” of a military base .  Id.  \nNot so here.  On this point  too then, the Court has insufficient information to decide whether the \nDepartment has “ demonstrate [d] that the information withheld logically falls within the claimed \nexemption .” Larson , 565 F.3d at 862.2  \nIn short, the overly brief, generalized, and technical (in part) affidavit supplied by the De-\npartment does not enable the Court to fulfill its duty and rule  on the applicability of the asserted \nFOIA exemption.  See Prop. of the People, Inc. , 330 F.  Supp.  3d at 377  (finding the agency’s \ndeclarations “ insufficiently detailed and conclusory, and thus, do not permit the Court to determine \n \n1 To be sure, the affidavit describes a  long list of the types of information in the Depart-\nment’s withholdings.  See ECF No.  14-1 at 4.  But those descriptions do not make up for the defi-\nciencies describe d above .  “Time and again, courts in this Circuit have stressed that the government \ncannot justify its withholdings on the basis of summary statements that merely reiterate legal stand-\nards or offer far -ranging category definitions for information.”  Am. Immigr. Council , 950 \nF. Supp.  2d 221, 235  (D.D.C. 2013)  (internal quotations and citation omitted).  Moreover, the \n“heavy use of technical jargon” in these paragraphs lacks  context that would help the Court eval-\nuate whether the information  meets the standard under the statute.  Elec. Priv. Info. Ctr. v. Fed. \nBureau of Investigation , 235 F.  Supp.  3d 207, 216  (D.D.C. 2017); see also King , 830 F.2d at 221 \n(explaining that agency affidavits must have “ adequate representation of context which, when \ncombined with descriptions of deletions, enables de novo review of the propriety of withholding”).  \n2 The Court could go on  to describe  additional deficiencies.  For example, the affidavit \ndoes not sufficiently explain how disclosure of the vulnerabilities at issue , if exploited,  “would \nlikely  result in the significant disruption, destruction, or damage of or to Department of Defense \noperations, property, or facilities .” 10 U.S.C. §  130e(f) (emphasis added).   A “[c]ategorical de-\nscription of redacted material coupled with categorical indication of anticipated consequences of \ndisclosure is clearly inadequate .”  King , 830 F.2d at 224.

See ECF No.  14 \nat 3 n.2.  While the Court appreciates the Department’s desire to avoid the administrative burden \nof reviewing documents for more exemptions , the piecemeal assertion of different exemptions \n“undermines FOIA ’s purpose to promote ef ficient,  prompt, and full disclosure of information and \nthe interest of judicial economy. ”  Woodward v. U.S. Marshals Serv. , No. 18 -cv-1249 (RC), 2022 \nWL 17961289 , at *8  (D.D.C. Dec. 27, 2022)  (internal quotations and citation omitted).  Indeed, \ndistrict courts retain the discretion to find a defendant’s invocation of FOIA exemptions forfeited  \nif they are not raised timely .  See Shapiro v. Dep ’t of Just ., No. 13 -cv-555 (RDM), 2016 WL \n3023980 , at *4  (D.D.C. May 25, 2016) .  The Court will not exercise  its discretion to do so here, \ngiven the potentially important national security  interests at stake .  Still, the Court advises the \n \n3 The Court also questions  whether the Department has sufficiently  shown that it conducted \nan adequate segregability analysis.  FOIA requires that “[a]ny reasonably segregable portion of a \nrecord shall be provided to any person requesting such record after deletion of the portions which \nare exempt.”  5 U.S.C. § 552(b).  And while the agency is “entitled to a presumption that [it] \ncomplied with the obligation to disclose reasonably segregable material,” it must still “identify the \nexempt material and provide descriptions of excerpts deemed to be non -segregable, with explana-\ntions as to these decisions.”  Greenpeace, Inc. v. Dep’t of Homeland Sec. , 311 F.  Supp.  3d 110, \n132 (D.D.C. 2018) (internal quotations and citations omitted).  “This rule of segregation applies \nto all FOIA exemptions.”  Sussman v. U.S. Marshals Serv ., 494 F.3d 1106, 1116 (D.C. Cir. 2007).  \nThe Department submitted only two sentences in support of its segregability analysis  in which it  \nsimply asserts that it “conducted a page -by-page, line -by-line review of each document and deter-\nmined that no segregation of meaningful  information in the withheld documents can be made.”   \nECF No.  14-1 at 6 .  Courts have found that such conclusory statements, especially with out any-\nthing more —for example, a Vaughn  index —are insufficient for the Department to meet its obli-\ngations.  See Am. Immigr. Council , 950 F.  Supp.  2d at 248 (holding that defendant’s “conclusory \nassertion” that it “reviewed each record line -by-line to identify information exempt from disclo-\nsure . . . will not suffice to discharge this burden”).  \n Case 1:23-cv-01380-TJK   Document 24   Filed 09/13/24   Page 6 of 8 \n 7 Department that when it files its renewed motion, it must address any additional FOIA  exemptions  \nit wishes to invoke .  Cf. Shapiro v. Dep ’t of Just ., 177 F.  Supp.  3d 467 (D.D.C. 2016)  (permitting \nthe FBI “ to assert untimely exemptions to the extent that it can show that the disclosure of such \nrecords  will compromis e national security or sensitive, personal, private information ” (cleaned \nup)).4  \nFor all the above reasons, t he Court finds that  the Department has failed to provide a suf-\nficient basis to justify it withholding s under FOIA’s Exemption 3.  Thus, it will deny the Depart-\nment’s motion without prejudice and permit it to file a renewed motion , which must include all \nexemptions it seeks to invoke, including Exemption 3.  See Jud. Watch, Inc. v.  Dep’t of Just ., 185 \nF. Supp.  2d 54 (D.D.C. 2002) ; see also Jud. Watch, Inc. v. Dep’t of Just ., No. 17 -cv-0832 (CKK), \n2019 WL 4644029 , at *9  (D.D.C.

See Prop. of the People, Inc. , 330 \nF.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: In the case of Heidi Saas v. Major, Lindsey & Africa, LLC, the court reviewed a motion by the defendants to strike or dismiss the plaintiff's complaint. The plaintiff alleged that the defendants engaged in discriminatory practices by employing algorithmic tools that exhibited bias against women with employment gaps. The court dismissed the complaint, concluding that the plaintiff failed to provide sufficient factual support for her claims, including those of algorithmic discrimination and fraudulent inducement.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the plaintiff sufficiently alleged claims of discrimination due to algorithmic bias, retaliation under Title VII and the ADEA, and fraudulent inducement against the defendants.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court dismissed the plaintiff’s complaint, holding that she did not provide adequate factual allegations to make her claims plausible, particularly regarding the existence and discriminatory impact of algorithmic tools, retaliatory conduct by the defendants, and fraudulent inducement.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Think of this case like someone complaining they didn't get a job because a robot didn't like their resume. The person believed the robot was biased against people who took a break from work to raise kids. The court said, \"You haven't shown us enough that this robot even exists or that it was unfair,\" so they couldn't move forward with her case.",

Civil No.: 1:23- cv-02102- JRR  \n MAJOR, LINDSEY & AFRICA, LLC,  \net al. ,  \n    \nDefendants . \n    \n \nMEMORANDUM OPINION \n Pending before the court is Defendants’ Motion to Strike Plaintiff’s Complaint, or, in the \nAlternative, Motion to Dismiss (ECF No. 6; the “Motion”).  The court has reviewed all papers , \nand no hearing is necessary.  Local Rule 105.6 (D. Md. 2023).  For the reasons that follow, by \naccompanying order, the Motion (ECF No. 6), construed as a motion to dismiss , will be granted.   \nI. BACKGROUND \n This action arises from Plaintiff’s contacts with a recruiter from Major, Lindsey & Africa, \nLLC ( “MLA ”).1  (ECF No. 1; the “Complaint.” )  In May of 2021, Plaintiff received a message \nfrom Riley  Catone , a recruiter with MLA, o n LinkedIn, requesting an interview.  (ECF No. 1-1 ¶ \n5.)  Thereafter ,2 Ms. Catone had a phone interview with Plaintiff in which she told Plaintiff  that \nMLA’s “system did not work,” that “women with gaps in their resumes were ‘getting left behind’ in the job market,” and that she had “difficulty ‘getting businesses past the m otherhood gap’ when \nreviewing candidates.”  Id. ¶ 6.  Ms. Catone told Plaintiff that she was a “rockstar” and “wanted \n \n1 For purposes of resolving the Motion, the court accepts as true all well -pled facts set forth in the Complaint.  (ECF \nNo. 3.)  Nemet  Chevrolet, Ltd. v. Consumeraffairs.com,  Inc., 591 F.3d 250, 255 (4th Cir. 2009).  \n2 Plaintiff states that this interview occurre d on May 12, 2021, but that date does not appear to be correct based on the \nother allegations of the Complaint and the attached exhibits.  (ECF No. 1- 1 at p. 3, 16, 19.)   Case 1:23-cv-02102-JRR   Document 17   Filed 05/10/24   Page 1 of 142 \n to sell [her] services to business es.”  Id.  Following that call, Plaintiff emailed her resume to Ms. \nCatone for a job posting at Uber.  I d. ¶ 7.  Ms. Catone shared the Uber job posting with Plaintiff.  \nId.  Plaintiff  then messaged  the Chief Privacy Officer at Uber  via LinkedIn  to let her know that  her \nresume would be submitted f or the position, and the Chief Privacy Officer responded that h er team \ndid not have any openings at that time.3  (ECF No. 1- 1 ¶ 8.)  Days later, Ms. Catone contacted \nPlaintiff about another position with Zendesk.  Id. at p. 19.  Plaintiff again provided her resume \nfor the position with Zendesk.  Id. ¶ 10.  Plaintiff then messaged the Chief Privacy Officer at \nZendesk via LinkedIn to inform her that her resume had been submitted, but the Chief Privacy \nOfficer r esponded that the position had been filled.  Id. ¶ 10.  Thereafter, Plaintiff asked  Ms. Catone \nfor an update on her applications and states Ms. Catone “did not confirm whether or not she sent \n[her] resume to either Uber or Zendesk.”  Id. ¶ 11.  On September 21, 2021, Ms. Catone emailed \nPlaintiff about a part -time position, which Plaintiff declined. Id. ¶ 12.  On May 4, 2022, another \nMLA employee emailed Plaintiff about another job, and  Plaintiff did not respond.  (ECF No. 1- 1 \n¶ 15.)  \n Plaintiff file d a charge of discrimination against MLA with the U.S. Equal Employment \nOpportunity Commission (“EEOC”)  on May 31, 2022, alleging that she  “think[s]” MLA “[is] \nusing s creening tools . . . to screen- out applicants ,” and that MLA “did not refer [her] for future \njobs and later disappeared.”   Id. at p. 21–22.  On May 8, 2023, EEOC issued a Right to Sue letter \nto Plaintiff .  Id. at p. 23.  Plaintiff filed the Complaint in this court on August 4, 2023 against MLA \nand Allegis Group, Inc. (“Allegis”).  (ECF No. 1.)  Plaintiff contends that  Allegis “owns MLA.”  \nId. ¶ 3.  Though at times inconsistent, Plaintiff asserts the follo wing claims : failure to refer  and \n \n3 The manner in which Plaintiff pleads  these allegations in her Complaint suggests  she found out that there was no \nopen position with Uber before  she sent her resume to Ms. Catone.  (ECF No. 1 -1 ¶¶ 6 –8.)  Because such a reading is \ninconsistent with her claims  and would certainly invalidate the claims  to that allegation , the court assumes  that dates \nidentified in the Complaint are typographical errors.  Case 1:23-cv-02102-JRR   Document 17   Filed 05/10/24   Page 2 of 143 \n “algorithmic bias” in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (“Title VII”) and the \nAge Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (“ADEA”); retaliation in violation of Title VII and the ADEA; and fraudulent i nducement in violation of Maryland law .  (ECF No. 1.)   \nPlaintiff alleges in her Complaint that Defendants use “algorithmic, machine learning, and \nother technical tools in the conduct of their business, and their use of such tools caused [her] to be unlawf ully discriminated against on the basis ” of her sex and age.  (ECF No. 1- 1 ¶ 19.)  Plaintiff \nadmits, however, Defendants asserted that they do not use artificial intelligence and that discovery is needed to ascertain the nature of the tools.\n4  Id.   She alleges that Defendants ’ artificial \nintelligence, “job progression” “tools” result in “automated discrimination ” and “result in negative \nresults and disparate impacts” against people who, like Plaintiff , have a “motherhood gap”  in their \nemployment.5  Id. ¶ 22.  As a result, Plaintiff believes that Defendants  unlawfully classified her in \na way that prevented her resume from being referred to businesses for employment.  Id. ¶ 23.  \nPlaintiff simultaneously argues that there were no available positions, an d that Defendants instead \nwanted her resume so they could be  “paid for [her] data .”  Id. ¶ 30.   \nPlaintiff also states that one of the Defendant s (but does not identify which one)  retaliated \nagainst her by “creating and furnishing . . . defamatory data” about her to others “in an effort to \ndisqualify [her] from being referred to employers because [she] filed” a charge of discrimination with EEOC.  (ECF No. 1- 1 at p. 1, ¶ 29.)   However, she admits  that discovery is needed to \ndetermine whether they actually did as alleged.  Id. ¶ 29.   \nFinally, Plaintiff alleges that one of the Defendant s, presumably MLA, knowingly induced \n \n4 Plaintiff’s response in opposition to the Motion further clarifies that her allegation is based on the assumption that \nbecause “Allegis made 14.8 Billion in 2022, brokering globally in rec ruitment and employment data,” that Defendants \ncannot process “all of [that] data” without artificial intelligence.  (ECF No. 10 at p. 7.)   \n5 Although Plaintiff does not define the phrase “motherhood gap,” it is apparent from context that it refers to the  period \nof time in her thirties when she was  raising her  children and  not actively  participating  in the workforce.  (ECF No. 1 -\n1 at p. 3 n.4.)   Case 1:23-cv-02102-JRR   Document 17   Filed 05/10/24   Page 3 of 144 \n her to email her personal data ( her resume ) to it “by making false representations and promising \nlucrative positions that did not exist. ”  Id. ¶ 30.  MLA  did so to “monetize [her] data,” with “no \nintention of getting [her] a job, or [with] a reckless disregard for their obligation to try and present \n[her] resume for consideration of employment.”   Id.    \nII. LEGAL STANDARD  \nA. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(f)  \nFederal pleading requirements require that a claim for relief contain “a short and plain \nstatement of the claim showing the pleader is entitled to relief.”  FED. R. CIV. P. 8(a)(2).  \nAccordingly, under Rule 12(f), the court may, on its own or on motion by a party, “strike from a \npleading . . . any redundant, immaterial, impertinent, or scandalous matter ” where it is insufficient.   \nFED. R. CIV. P. 12(f).  “ In determining whether to grant a motion  to strike , the court ‘enjoys wide \ndiscretion  . . . in order to minimize delay, prejudice and confusion by narrowing the issues for \ndiscovery and trial.’”  Baltimore  v. Baltimore  City L. Dep’t, No. CV ELH -22-1901, 2022 WL \n17812642, at *2 (D. Md. Dec. 16, 2022)  (quoting Haley Paint Co. v. E.I. du Pont de Nemours & \nCo., 279 F.R.D. 331, 336 (D. Md. 2012) ).  “Rule 12(f) motions are generally viewed with disfavor \nbecause striking a portion of a pleading is a drastic remedy and because it is often sought by the movant simply as a dilatory tactic .”  Waste  Mgmt.  Holdings, Inc. v. Gilmore , 252 F.3d 316, 347 \n(4th Cir. 2001) (citation omitted).  Accordingly, on a Rule 12(f) motion, the court “must view the pleading under attack in a light most favorable to the pleader.”   Haley Paint  Co., 279 F.R.D. at  \n336.  \nB. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6)  \nA motion asserted under Rule 12(b)(6) “test[s] the sufficiency of a complaint;” it does not \n“resolve contests surrounding the facts, the merits of a claim, or the applicability of defenses.”  Case 1:23-cv-02102-JRR   Document 17   Filed 05/10/24   Page 4 of 145 \n Presley v. City of Charlottesville , 464 F.3d 480, 483 (4th Cir. 2006) (quoting Edwards v. City of \nGoldsboro, 178 F.3d 231, 243 (4th Cir. 1999)).  Accordingly, a “Rule 12(b)(6) motion should only \nbe granted if, after accepting all well -pleaded allegations in the plaintiff’s complaint as true and \ndrawing all reasonable f actual inferences from those facts in the plaintiff’s favor, it appears certain \nthat the plaintiff cannot prove any set of facts in support of his claim entitling him to relief.” Edwards , 178 F.3d at 244.   \n“While legal conclusions can provide the framework of a complaint, they must be \nsupported by factual allegations.”  Ashcroft v. Iqbal , 556 U.S. 662, 679 (2009).  “Factual \nallegations must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level on the assumption that all the allegations in the complaint are true (even if doubtful in fact).”  Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly , 550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007) (citations and footnote omitted).  “[A] complaint that provides \nno more than ‘labels and conclusions,’ or ‘a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action,’ is insufficient.”  Bourgeois v. Live Nation Ent., Inc., 3 F. Supp. 3d 423, 434 (D. Md. 2014) \n(quoting Twombly , 550 U.S. at 555).  “The [c]ourt must be able to deduce ‘more than the mere \npossibility of misconduct’; the facts of the complaint, accepted as true, must demonstrate that the \nplaintiff is entitled to relief.”  Evans  v. 7520 Surratts  Rd. Operations, LLC, No. 8:21- CV-01637-\nPX, 2021 WL 5326463, at *2 (D. Md. Nov. 16, 2021) (quoting Ruff in v. Lockheed Martin Corp., \n126 F. Supp. 3d 521, 526 (D. Md. 2015)).  \nRelevant here, “ pro se  pleadings are liberally construed and held to a less stringent standard \nthan pleadings drafted by lawyers.”  Gray v. Wash. Metro Area Transit Auth., No. DKC -16-1792, \n2017 WL 511910, at *2 (D. Md. Feb. 8, 2017) (citing Erickson v. Paradus , 551 U.S. 89, 94 (2007)).  \n“Liberal construction means that the court will read the pleadings to state a valid claim to the extent Case 1:23-cv-02102-JRR   Document 17   Filed 05/10/24   Page 5 of 146 \n that it is possible to do so from the facts availa ble; it does not mean that the court should rewrite \nthe complaint to include claims never presented.”  Id.  (citations omitted).  \nIII. ANALYSIS  \nDefendants first ask this court to strike the complaint, as it constitutes a “shotgun pleading” \nthat fails to apprise Defendant s of the claims against them and the grounds in support  of the specific \nclaims.6  (ECF No. 6 -1 at p. 8–9.)  Alternatively, Defendants argue that Plaintiff’s Complaint \nshould be dismissed because it fails to state plausible claims under Title VII , the ADEA, and \nMaryland law .7  Id. at p. 10 –18.  Plaintiff opposes the Motion.  (ECF No. 10.)   \nA. Motion to Strike Plai ntiff’s Complaint  \nDefendants argue the Complaint as a whole should be struck as a “shotgun pleading.”   (ECF \nNo. 6- 1 at p. 7.)  “A ‘ shotgun pleading’ is one that ‘fails to articulate claims with sufficient clarity \nto allow the defendant to frame a responsive pleading . . . or [one in which] it is virtually impossible \nto know which allegations of fact are intended to support which claims for relief[.]”  Baxter  v. \nAmeriHome  Mortg. Co., LLC, 617 F. Supp. 3d 346, 351 (D. Md. 2022) (quoting Lee v. Meyers , \nNo. ELH -21-1589, 2022 WL 252960, at *11 (D. Md. Jan. 27, 2022)).  See Lampkin- Asam  v. \nVolusia Cnty.  Sch. Bd., 261 F. App’ x 274, 277 (11th Cir. 2008) (“A complaint that fails to articulate \nclaims with sufficient clarity to allow the defendant to frame a res ponsive pleading constitutes a \n‘shotgun pleading.’”).  However, here, Plaintiff has articulated at least some claims with sufficient \nclarity.  For example , Plaintiff sets forth her allegations with respect to her fraudulent inducement  \nclaim in Paragraphs 30 through 32.   As a result, Defendants ’ argument to strike  the whole \n \n6 Defendants also argue that Plaintiff’s pleadings should not be afforded the “special judicial solitude” afforded to pro \nse parties  because she is a lawyer.  (ECF No. 6 -1 at p. 6.)  However, w hile Plaintiff is an attorney, she is not barred in \nthis court, nor has  she claimed any litigation practice or experience.  Despite being a lawyer, Plaintiff is still a pro se  \nlitigant whose pleadings are subject to liberal construction.  See Erickson , 551 U.S. at 94, supra .    \n7 Defendants  also argue that all claims against Allegis should be dismissed because Allegis does n ot own MLA \ncontrary to Plaintiff’s allegations.  (ECF No. 6 -1 at p. 9– 10.)  At this stage, the court accept s the allegations of the \nComplaint as true.  The court is  thus not persuaded that Allegis should be dismissed solely based on a factual dispute.   Case 1:23-cv-02102-JRR   Document 17   Filed 05/10/24   Page 6 of 147 \n Complaint is unwarranted.  The court will therefore decline to exercise its discretion to strike the \nComplaint and will instead view the Motion as one seeking to dismiss Plaintiff’s Comp laint \npursuant to Rule 12(b)(6).  To the extent there are remaining allegations and claims that may constitute impermissible “ shotgun pleading,” the court will address them in the context of the \nmotion to dismiss.  See McCrea  v. Wells  Fargo, No. CV RDB -18-2490, 2019 WL 2513770, at *7 \n(D. Md. June 17, 2019), aff’d, 852 F. App’ x 112 (4th Cir. 2021)  (discussing dismissal for \nimpermissible “shotgun pleading” under Rule 12(b)(6)).  \nB. Title VII and the ADEA Claims  \nBoth Title VII and the ADEA prohibit employment agencies —meaning, \n“any person regularly undertaking with or without compensation to procure  employees for  an \nemployer or to procure for  employees  opportunities to work for an employer”—from unlawfully \ndiscriminating against applicants.8  42 U.S.C. § 2000e(c).  See 29 U.S.C. § 630(c) (“ The term \n‘employment agency ’ means any  person regularly undertaking with or without compensation to \nprocure employees  for an  employer.”) .  Specifically, it is unlawful for an em ployment agency “to \nfail or refuse to refer for employment, or otherwise to discriminate against, any individual because \nof,” relevant her e, her sex or age.  42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(b) ; 29 U.S.C. § 623(b).   \n“[T]here are few cases dealing with discrimination by employment agencies ,” specifically  \nwith respect  to discrimination  in failure  to refer  for employment.

Littelfuse  Inc., No. 12 CV 6845, \n2013 WL 1828926, at *7 (N.D. Ill. Apr. 29, 2013) (same).  Considering the plain language of the \n \n8 At leas t for the purposes  of their Motion, Defendants appear to concede they are an employment agency within the \nmeaning of Title VII and the ADEA.

Kelly  Servs.,  Inc., 598 F.3d 1022, 1030 \n(8th Cir. 2010) (citing Williams  v. Caruso, 966 F. Supp. 287, 297 (D. Del.  1997).  Similarly, both \nTitle VII and the ADEA also make it unlawful for an employment agency to discriminate against \nany individual because she has, relevant here, “ made a charge, tes tified, assisted, or participated \nin any manner in an investigation [or] proceeding” under the statute .  42 U.S.C. § 2000e -3(a); 29 \nU.S.C. § 623(d).  See Scaglione v. Chappaqua Cent.  Sch. Dist. , 209 F. Supp. 2d 311, 315 (S.D.N.Y. \n2002) (“Like employers, employment agencies  may not retaliate against those opposing illegal \npractices.”).  \n1. Failure to Refer  Claim / Algorithmic Bias Claim  \nAs state supra, employment agencies may not “fail or refuse to refer for employment” and \nindividual because of h er sex or age.  42 U.S.C. § 2000e -2(b); 29 U.S.C. § 623(b).  To demonstrate \nsuch a claim, a plaintiff “must allege that the employment agency  refused or failed to refer the \n[her]  to an available position with an employer on the basis of a discriminatory animus regarding \nthe protected factor .”  Syed , 2015 WL 1622094, at *6 n.9.  See Kelly  Servs.,  Inc., 598 F.3d at  1030 \n(“The plain language of § 2000e –2(b) states that an employment agency violates Title VII if it \n“fail[s] or refuse[s] to refer for employment .  . . any individual because of his  . . . [protected \nstatus].” ).    \nTo the extent Plaintiff’s claim is based on disparate treatment, she has failed to state a \nclaim.  First, Plaintiff  does not allege that Defendants refused, or failed, to refer her for an available \nposition based on her protected status.  S he instead contends that  they did so because they wanted \nto profit from the sale of her data.  (ECF No. 1- 1 ¶ 30.)  Moreover, Plaintiff  alleges that no available Case 1:23-cv-02102-JRR   Document 17   Filed 05/10/24   Page 8 of 149 \n positions actually existed and instead were merely a ruse to access and misuse her personal \ninformation.  Id.  \nPlaintiff’s allegation of “algorithmic bias”  is similarly insufficient.  Plaintiff alleges that \nDefendants use “job progression” “tools” that “generally disqualif[y] and exclude [] anyone with a \ngap in their resume,” hav ing a disparate impact on women with a “motherhood gap,” like Plaintiff.  \n(ECF No. 1-1 ¶ 22.)  Under 42 U.S.C. 2000e-2(k), Title VII provides:  \nAn unlawful employment practice based on disparate impact is \nestablished under this subchapter only if- \n \n(i) a  complaining party demonstrates that a respondent uses a \nparticular employment practice that causes a disparate impact on the \nbasis of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin and the \nrespondent fails to demonstrate that the challenged practice is jo b \nrelated for the position in question and consistent with business \nnecessity  . . . \n \n42 U.S.C. § 2000e -2( k)(1)(A)(i).  See Smith  v. City of Jackson,  Miss. , 544 U.S. 228, 232 (2005)  \n(holding “that the ADEA does authorize recovery in ‘ disparate- impact’ cases”).   “Thus, a plaintiff \nestablishes a prima facie disparate- impact  claim  by showing that the employer ‘ uses a particular \nemployment practice that causes a disparate impact’ on one of the prohibited bases.”  Lewis  v. City \nof Chicago, Ill. , 560 U.S. 205, 212 (2010) (quoting 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(k)).   \nPlaintiff’s claim fails here because it is entirely speculative.  Plaintiff has not identified a \nparticular employment practice  that exists.  Her a llegation  is based solely on supposition that \nDefendants use artificial intelligence tools because they are large businesses.  (ECF No. 10 at p. \n7.)  Plaintiff’s allegation , however, that MLA stated that it did not use artificial intelligence tools, \ndirect ly contradicts her supposition.  (ECF No. 1- 1 ¶¶ 19, 22, 28.)  Ms. Catone ’s comment that she \nhad trouble “getting businesses past the ‘ motherhood gap’ ” does not change the court’s analysis ,  \nas Plaintiff still doe s not allege a particular employment practice.  Ms. Catone’s  comment, while Case 1:23-cv-02102-JRR   Document 17   Filed 05/10/24   Page 9 of 1410 \n perhaps raising suspicion, does not relate to MLA’s artificial intelligence system.  Id. ¶ 6.  Finally, \nas a separate matter, Plaintiff makes no meaningful allegation that the so -called “tools” have a \ndispa rate impact on applicants based on age.  See ECF No. 1- 1 at ¶ 22.  She instead conclusorily \nalleges that Defendants “violated” the ADEA with their purported use of the artificial intelligence.  \nId.  E ven considered in the light most favorable to Plaintiff , Plaintiff’s allegations are  simply \ninsufficient to state a plausible claim for relief for failure to refer in violation of Title VII and the \nADEA.  \n2. Retaliation  \n As explained supra, plaintiff s may prove that the employment agency “retaliated against \nthem for engaging in protected activity through one of two ways: (1) by direct evidence of \nretaliatory animus; or (2) through the McDonnell  Douglas Corp. v. Green , 411 U.S. 792 (1973), \nburden- shifting framework.”   Walton v. Harker , 33 F.4th 165, 171 (4th Cir. 2022)  (citing Foster  \nv. Univ.  of Md.-E. Shore , 787 F.3d 243, 249 (4th Cir. 2015)).  As is the case here, where there is \nno direct evidence of a retaliatory animus , a plaintiff must first set forth the elements of a prima \nfacie case of retaliation  under Title VII and the ADEA, meaning: “ (1) she engaged in a protected \nactivity, (2) the employer acted adversely against her, and (3) there was a causal connection \nbetween the protected activity and the asserted adverse action.”   Walto n, 33 F.4th at  177 (quoting \nHoyle v.  Freightliner,  LLC , 650 F.3d 321, 337 (4th  Cir. 2011) ).   \n Wh ile f iling a charge of discrimination with the  EEOC is certainly protected activity, \nPlaintiff otherwise fails to state a claim of retaliation under the law.9  See 42 U.S.C. § 2000e -3(a); \n29 U.S.C. § 623(d), supra.  The alleged adverse action on which Plaintiff rests is that Defendants \n \n9 Plaintiff’s Complaint is inconsistent with respect to whether she intended to assert a retaliation claim.  See ECF No. \n1 at p. 5; ECF No. 1 -1 at p. 1, ¶ 29 (stating in one part that she is not complaining of retaliation and stating in another \nthat she was subject to retaliation in the form of “creating and furnishing . . . defamatory data” about her to others ).  \nGiven the liberal pleading standard and for the sake of completeness, the court considers the claims.  Case 1:23-cv-02102-JRR   Document 17   Filed 05/10/24   Page 10 of 1411 \n “unlawfully furnished data to others about [her] in an effort to disqualify [her] from being referred \nto employers.”  (ECF No. 1-1 ¶ 29.)   However, Plaintiff concedes that “[d]iscovery is needed to \nascertain if any defamatory or other inaccurate information” was used —thus admitting that she \nhas no factual basis  beyond speculation to support her claim that such data was furnished to others.  \nId.  This is further illustrated by Plaintiff’s  failure to identify the purported defamatory information  \ndisseminated.  Further , elsewhere in the Complaint, Plaintiff  identifies a different purported motive \nfor Defendants’ actions: unlawfully furnishing data about her for their own profit.  Id. ¶ 21.  S imply \nspeculating something is true with no supportive factual allegations is insufficient to support a \nclaim for relief.  See Twombly , 550 U.S. at  555 (“Factual allegations must be enough to raise a \nright to relief above the speculative level. ”); McCleary-Evans v. Maryland Dep’t of Transp., State  \nHighway Admi n., 780 F.3d 582, 588 (4th Cir. 2015) (noting that, where a complaint left “open to \nspeculation” the cause of defendant’s employment decision, the cause was not plausible in light of the “obvious alternative explanation”).  Finally, p erhaps most fatal to her claim, Plaintiff has not \nalleged any connection between the purported adverse action and her protected activity beyond the conclusory allegation that Defendants  did so “because” she filed the EEOC complaint.  (ECF No. \n1-1 ¶ 29.)   The court cannot accep t the conclusory allegation as true.  See Iqbal , 556 U.S. at 678 \n(“Threadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of action, supported by mere conclusory \nstatements, do not suffice.”).  The court thus  concludes  that, to the extent she intended to assert \none, Plaintiff has failed to state a claim of retaliation  in violation of Title VII or the ADEA.  \nC.

Case 1:23-cv-02102-JRR   Document 17   Filed 05/10/24   Page 11 of 1412 \n v. Sandler Sys, Inc., No. ELH -09-3102, 2017 WL 1862445, at *32 (D. Md. May 8, 2017) (quoting \nSass v.  Andrew , 152 Md. App. 406, 432 (2003)).  “In alleging fraud or mistake, a party must state \nwith particularity the circumstances constituting fraud or mistake.”  F ED. R. CIV. P. 9(b).   Plaintiff \n“must, at a minimum, describe the time, place, and contents of the false representations, as well as \nthe identity of the person making the misrepresentation and what he obtained thereby.”  Bourgeois \nv. Live Nation Entertainment  Inc., 3 F. Supp. 3d 423, 435 (D. Md. 2014) (quoting U.S. ex rel . \nOwens v. First Kuwaiti Gen’l Trading & Contracting Co., 612 F.3d 724, 731 (4th Cir. 2010)).  This is often “referred to as the ‘who, what, when, where, and how’ of the alleged fraud.”  U.S. ex \nrel. Wilson  v. Kellogg Brown  & Root, Inc. , 525 F.3d 370, 379 (4th Cir. 2008) (citation omitted).  \n“The tort of fraudulent inducement ‘means that one has been led by another ’s guile, \nsurreptitiousness or other form of deceit to enter into an agreement to his detriment.’” Rozen  v. \nGreenberg,  165 Md. App. 665, 674 (2005) (quoting Sec.  Constr. Co. v. Maietta, 25 Md. App. 303, \n307 (1975)).  To succeed on a claim of fraudulent inducement, Plaintiff must demonstrate :  \n(1) that the defendant made a false representation to the plaintiff,  \n(2) that its falsity was either k nown to the defendant or that the \nrepresentation was made with reckless indifference as to its truth,  (3) that the misrepresentation was made for the purpose of defrauding the plaintiff,  (4) that the plaintiff relied on the misrepresentation and had the right to rely on it, and  (5) that the plaintiff suffered compensable injury resulting from the misrepresentation.   \nCapitalSource Fin., LLC v. Delco  Oil, Inc., 608 F. Supp. 2d 655, 666 (D. Md. 2009)  (quoting Nails  \nv. S & R, Inc., 334 Md. 398, 415 (1994) ).  “Notably, ‘ fraud cannot be predicated on statements \nwhich are merely promissory in nature, or upon expressions as to what will happen in the future.’”  \nView  Point Med.  Sys., LLC v. Athena Health, Inc., 9 F. Supp. 3d 588, 612 (D. Md. 2014)  (quoting \nSass, 152 Md. App. at 438)).  “In fraudulent inducement cases, a defrauded party may elect Case 1:23-cv-02102-JRR   Document 17   Filed 05/10/24   Page 12 of 1413 \n between two remedies, which are exclusive [:] . . . to rescind the contract or to ratify the contract \nand seek damages, either affirmatively or by recoupment.”  Id.    \n Here,  Plaintiff’s allegations are , again , insufficient, especially considering the heightened \npleading standard under Rule 9(b).  Plaintiff has not alleged that she  was induced to enter any sort \nof agreement to her detriment.  See Rozen, 165 Md. App. at 674, supra.  She has instead alleged , \nat most,  that she was induc ed to send her resume to Ms. Catone.  (ECF No. 1- 1 ¶ 30; ECF No. 10 \nat p. 11.)  Neither of the “exclusive” remedies that exist to redress unlawful fraudulent inducement \nwould have any effect here.  See View  Point Med.  Sys., LLC, 9 F. Supp. 3d at  612, supra.  E ven \nassuming arguendo that an agreement exist s, Plaintiff still fails to plead the necessary elements of \na fraudulent inducement claim.  As best the court can tell, the alleged false representations she \nasserts were that Ms. Catone would provide Plaintiff’s  resume for consideration for two \nemployment positions and that “neither received [her] resume.”  (ECF No. 1 -1 ¶ 30. )  However, \nPlaintiff does not allege that Ms. Catone never provided her resume to Uber or Zendesk; she alleges \nthat the Chief Privacy Officers for each employer stated either that there was no opening (despite \nan online job posting) or, most notably, that the position had been filled.  Id. ¶¶ 7–10.  Simply \nbecause the employers stated that they did not have an opening or that a position had been filled \ndoes not raise a plausible inference that a recruiter sought out Plaintiff’s resume either falsely or \nwith reckless indifference to the truth and misrepresented the availability of positions for the \npurpose of defrauding her.  See McCleary-Evans , 780 F.3d at  588, supra.11  The court thus finds \nthat Plaintiff has failed  to state a claim for fraudulent inducement under Maryland law.  \nD. Remaining Allegatio ns \nThe court does not  discern any additional claims in Plaintiff’s Complaint.  To the extent \n \n11 Because Plaintiff’s claim is facially insufficient, the court  need not address Plaintiff’s assertion  of “intrusion upon \nprivacy” as her  compensable  injury, but does note that the assertion is again  based  entirely  on speculation .   Case 1:23-cv-02102-JRR   Document 17   Filed 05/10/24   Page 13 of 1414 \n Plaintiff intended to raise any additional claims or rely on any other allegations to  support her \nclaims addressed herein, such allegations fail as impermissible “shotgun pleading.”  See Baxter , \n617 F. Supp. 3d at  351, supra; Lampkin- Asam , 261 F. App’x at 277, supra.  See also Weller  v. \nDep’t of Soc.

    "summary": "1. **Summary:** The court case involves the Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) suing the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence (NSCAI) to comply with the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA) and the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). The court determined NSCAI must adhere to both FOIA and FACA, ensuring transparency in its operations, including meeting notifications and public access to records. The case highlights AI and automation's involvement, as NSCAI oversees advancements in AI for national security.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue:** Whether the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence qualifies as an \"advisory committee\" subject to the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA) and an \"agency\" under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA).\n\n3. **Court's Holding:** The court ruled that NSCAI is both an advisory committee, making it subject to FACA, and an agency under FOIA requirements, compelling it to adhere to transparency obligations, including publishing meeting notices and making records publicly accessible.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation:** Think of NSCAI as a government friend group advising on AI technology for national security. EPIC wanted them to stay open about their meetings, like posting events for public viewing. The court agreed, saying the group must follow rules to share what's discussed and decided, just like when a school club must announce meetings and post minutes so everyone knows what’s happening.",

One looks  backward, toward the past ; the \nother looks  forward, toward the future.  Mythologists understand his two- faced depiction as \ncomplementary, not contradictory.1  It means  that every beginning has an ending, every ending a \nbeginning.  Like a  doorway , Janus  looks both ways. \nSo, too, with our Nation’s open government laws.  In general, the Freedom of \nInformation Act (“FOIA”)  is backward  looking, requir ing agencies to disclose historical \ndocuments kept by the agency upon request from a private party .  Under the Federal Advisory \nCommittee Act (“FACA”) , certain federal advisory bodies are subject to forward -looking \npublication requirements, such as giving  notice of their meetings, open ing them to the public, \nand proactively mak ing their  records publicly available.  But can the same body  be subject to \nboth laws?  \n                                                 \n1  Donald L. Wasson, Janus , Ancient History Encyclopedia (Feb. 6, 2015), \nhttps://www.ancient.eu/Janus/. Case 1:19-cv-02906-TNM   Document 40   Filed 06/01/20   Page 1 of 362 The Court previously held that the National Security Commission  on Artificial \nIntelligence is an agency subject to  FOIA .  EPIC  v. Nat’l Sec. Comm’n on Artificial Intelligence  \n(“NSCAI ”), 419 F. Supp. 3d 82, 83 (D.D.C. 2019) .   Given  that holding, the Commission now \nargues that it cannot possibly also be subject to FACA’s forward- looking disclosure obligations.  \nToday, the Court holds that, like Janus, the Commission does  indeed have two faces, and that \nCongress obligated it to comply with FACA as well as FOIA.   \nThe Electronic Privacy Information Center (“EPIC”)  sued to enforce the Commission’s  \nobligations under both F OIA and FACA.  The Court denied  the Government’s motion to dismiss  \nthe FOIA claims .  Id.  The Government now moves to dismiss EPIC’s FACA claims and its \nrelated claims under the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”) .  EPIC moves for summary \njudgment on these counts.  While the Court will dismiss the APA claims for lack of  jurisdiction, \nit will grant summary judgment for EPIC on its FACA claims.         \nI. \n The Court’s previous opinion provides background on the Commission and EPIC’s suit .  \nSee NSCAI , 419 F. Supp. 3d at 83–85.  A quick refresher is in order.  \nTwo years ago, Congress “established in the executive branch an independent \nCommission to review advances in artificial intelligence, related machine learning developments, \nand associated technologies. ”  John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act for  Fiscal \nYear 2019 (“2019 NDAA”), Pub. L. No. 115- 232, § 1051(a)(1), 132 Stat. 1636, 1962 (2018).  \nThe Commission is “ a temporary organization” under 5 U.S.C. § 3161.  Id.  § 1051(a)(2).  Its 15 \nmembers are “appointed for the life of the Commission” and are “F ederal employees.”  Id.  \n§ 1051(a) (4)(A), (6)–(7).  Case 1:19-cv-02906-TNM   Document 40   Filed 06/01/20   Page 2 of 363 Congress instructed the Commission to “consider the methods and means necessary to \nadvance the development of artificial intelligence  . . . to comprehensively address the national \nsecurity and defens e needs of the United States.”  Id.  § 1051(b)(1).  The Commission must report \nits findings and recommendations to the President and Congress.  Id.  § 1051(c)(1).  \nThe Commission was originally set to end  this October , but Congress recently extended \nits life by a year .  See National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2020 (“2020 NDAA”), \nPub. L. No. 116- 92, § 1735(a), 133 Stat. 1198, 1819 (2019).  Its next interim report is due by this \nDecember and a final report  is due next March .  Id. § 1735(c)(2) –(3).  \nFrom its inception , the Commission “ has operated almost entirely in secret.”  Compl. \n¶ 59, ECF No. 1.  It has held several meetings  “behind closed doors” and “has failed to publish \nor disclose any notices, agendas , minutes, or materials for those meetings.”  Id.  ¶¶ 38, 59.  \nLast September, EPIC sent a request to the Commission, invoking FOIA and section 10 \nof FACA, 5 U.S.C. app. 2.  Pl.’s Mot. Exs. at 31,2 ECF No. 31- 4.  Under FACA, i t sought \n“[c]ontemporaneous access to, and advance Federal Register notice of, all meetings” of the \nCommission “and any subcomponent thereof.”  Id.  (citing 5 U.S.C. app. 2 § 10(a)).  It also asked \nfor “[c] opies of all ‘records, reports, transcripts, minutes, appendixes, working papers, drafts, \nstudies, agenda[s], or other documents which were made available to or prepared for or by’ ” the \nCommission “and/or any subcomponent thereof.”  Id.  (quoting 5 U.S.C. app. 2 § 10(b)).  The \nCommission acknowledged the request but  did not otherwise respond.  Id. at 34.    \nTwo weeks later, EPIC sued.  It brought claims under FACA (Counts I and IV), the APA \n(Count s II, III, and V), and FOIA (Counts VI, VII, and VIII).  Compl. ¶¶ 112–63.  It \nsimultaneously moved for a preliminary injunction on its FOIA claims.  Mot. for Prelim.

The Court rejected \nthat argument.  NSCAI , 419 F. Supp. 3d at 83.  The Commission has since begun producing \nrecor ds under FOIA .

These claims are linked, since  the APA claims hinge on alleged violations of \nFAC A.  Count s II and III assert that the Commission’s failure to  give notice of its meetings and \nto open them  to the public , see 5 U.S.C. app. 2 § 10(a) , violates the APA.  Compl. ¶ ¶ 122, 129.  \nCount V claims that the Commission’s failure to make its records publicly available , see 5 \nU.S.C. app. 2 § 10(b) , likewise violates the APA .  Compl. ¶  142.  All three counts seek \ninjunctive relief under the APA.  Id.  ¶¶ 125, 133, 145. \nIn Counts I and IV, EPIC invokes FACA and the Mandamus Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1361.  \nLike the APA claims, these counts focus on two sets of alleged FACA violations:  (1) the \nCommission’s  failure to give notice of its meetings and to open them to the public; and (2) the \nCommission’s failure to make its records publicly available.  Id.  ¶¶ 115, 136.  EPIC seeks writs \nof mandamus compelling the Commission to comply with FACA .

Both motions are ripe for disposition.       \nII. \nThe Government’s motion to dismiss invokes Federal Rules  of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) \nand 12(b)(6).  Defs.’  Mot. at 1.  To survive a Rule 12(b)(1) motion, a plaintiff must establish the Case 1:19-cv-02906-TNM   Document 40   Filed 06/01/20   Page 4 of 365 Court’s jurisdiction over its claims.  See Lujan v. Defs. of Wildlife , 504 U.S. 555, 561 (1992).  \nThe Court must  “assume the tr uth of all material factual allegations in the complaint and \nconstrue the complaint liberally, granting plaintiff the benefit of all inferences that can be \nderived from the facts alleged.”  Am. Nat’l Ins. Co. v. FDIC , 642 F.3d 1137, 1139 (D.C. Cir. \n2011) ( cleaned up).  \nTo defeat a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, a complaint must “state a claim to relief that is \nplausible on its face.”  Ashcroft v. Iqbal , 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009).  The Court must  “treat the \ncomplaint’s factual allegations as true and must grant the pla intiff[] the benefit of all inferences \nthat can be derived from the facts alleged.”  L. Xia v. Tillerson , 865 F.3d 643, 649 (D.C. Cir. \n2017) (cleaned up).  But the Court need not credit legal conclusions couched as factual \nallegations.  Iqbal , 556 U.S. at 678. \nSummary judgment for EPIC is appropriate if it shows that “ there is no genuine dispute \nas to any material fact and [it]  is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a).  \nA fact is “material” if it “might affect the outcome of the s uit under the governing law” and a \ndispute is “genuine” if “the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the \nnonmoving party.”  Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248 (1986).  The Court must  \nview the evidence “in the light most favorable to the non- moving party.”  Brubaker v. Metro. \nLife Ins.  Co., 482 F.3d 586, 588 (D.C. Cir. 2007).  \nIII. \nA. \n The heart of the dispute here is whether the Commission is an “advisory committee” \nsubject to FACA.  But before resolving that, the Court must  address some threshold issues. Case 1:19-cv-02906-TNM   Document 40   Filed 06/01/20   Page 5 of 366  To start, the Court will dismiss EPIC’s APA claims for lack of jurisdiction.   “Absent a \nwaiver of sovereign immunity, the Federal Government is immune from suit.”  Loeffler v. Frank , \n486 U.S. 549, 554 (1988) .  The APA waives  sovereign immunity when a party seeks relief \nagainst an “agency ,” as defined in 5 U.S.C. § 701(b)(1) .  See  5 U.S.C. § 702; Trudeau v. FTC , \n456 F.3d 178, 187 & n.13 (D.C. Cir. 2006) .  If an entity is not an “ agency” under § 701(b)(1), the \nwaiver does not apply and the Court lacks jurisdiction over any APA claims against that entity.  \nTrudeau, 456 F.3d at 187  & n.13;  see FDIC v. Meyer , 510 U.S. 471, 475 (1994) (“Sovereign \nimmunity is jurisdictional in nature.”) .  So the Court must  first determine  whether  the \nCommission is an “agency” under § 701(b)(1).   See  Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Env’t , 523 \nU.S. 83, 98 (1998) (affirming “the necessity of determining jurisdiction before proc eeding to the \nmerits”) . \n Both  parties assume  the Court’s previous opinion answered this question in the \naffirmative.  See Defs. ’ Mem. in Supp. of Mot. to Dismiss (“Defs.’ Mem.”) at 14 , 16 n.2, ECF \nNo. 28- 1; Pl. ’s Mem. in Supp. of Mot. for Summ. J. (“ Pl.’s Mem.”)  at 28, ECF No. 31- 1.  But \nthey are mistaken.   The opinion did not hold that the Commission is an “agency” under \n§ 701(b)(1) .  It held only that the Commission is an “agency” for purposes of  FOIA , 5 U.S.C. \n§ 552(f)(1).   The APA and FOIA define “agen cy” differently.  The APA defines  an agency as \n“each authority of the Government.”   5 U.S.C. §§ 551(1), 701(b)(1).  FOIA  incorporates this \ndefinition but also expands it:  “‘agency’ as defined in [5 U.S.C. § 551(1)] includes any \nexecutive department, military department, Government corporation, Government controlled \ncorporation, or other establishment in the executive branch of the Government (including the \nExecutive Office of the President), or any independent regulatory agency.”   Id. § 552(f)(1).  Case 1:19-cv-02906-TNM   Document 40   Filed 06/01/20   Page 6 of 367 The chronology behind these definitions is key.  Before 1974, “each authority of the \nGovernment” was the sole definition of “agency” for both the APA and FOIA.  Se e id. § 551(1) \n(stating that the APA’s definition of “agency” applies “[f]or the purpose of this subchapter,” \nwhich includes FOIA, 5 U.S.C. § 552); Energy Research Found. v. Def. Nuclear Facilities Safety \nBd., 917 F.2d 581, 583 (D.C. Cir. 1990) .  During this period, the D.C. Circuit interpreted the \nphrase “each authority of the Government” in § 551(1) to mean “any administrative unit with \nsubstantial independent authority in the exercise of specific functions.”  Soucie v. David , 448 \nF.2d 1067, 1073 (D.C. Cir. 1971).3  So for a few years , Soucie  supplied the sole test for “agency” \nstatus under FOIA.   See Energy Research , 917 F.2d at 584. \nThe landscape changed in 1 974, when Congress amended FOIA and expanded its \ndefinition of “agency.”  Pub. L. No. 93- 502, § 3, 88 Stat. 1561, 1564 (1974); Energy Research , \n917 F.2d at 583.  The 1974 amendment is c urrently codified at 5 U.S.C. § 552(f)(1).  \nThe definition of “agency”  in § 552(f)(1) applies only “[f]or purposes of this section,”  so \nit is exclusive to FOIA.  5 U.S.C. § 552(f)(1).  Indeed, with the language in § 552(f)(1), \n“Congress sought to encompass entities that might have eluded the APA’s definition in \n§ 551(1).”  Energy Research , 917 F.2d at 583.  The upshot is that if an entity fits one of the \ncategories in § 552(f)(1) —such as “establishment in the executive branch” —it will not \n                                                 \n3  Though Soucie  cited only §  551(1), see 448 F.2d at 1073 n.13, its interpretation applies equally \nto the identical phrase in § 701(b)(1).  See Ralpho v. Bell , 569 F.2d 607, 616 & n.54 (D.C. Cir. \n1977) (citing Soucie , among other authorities, in concluding that the Micronesian Claims \nCommission is an “agency” under §  701(b)(1)); Flaherty v. Ross , 373 F. Supp. 3d 97, 104 & n.2 \n(D.D.C. 2019); see also  Pl.’s Reply at 6 & n.1, ECF No. 35.  This accords with the canon that a \nphrase —here, “authority of the Government” —“is presumed to bear the same meani ng \nthroughout a text.”  Antonin Scalia & Bryan A. Garner, Reading Law: The Interpretation of \nLegal Texts  170 (2012).  Thus, under  Soucie , the touchstone of “agency” status under § 701(b)(1) \nis the exercise of “substantial independent authority.”  \n Case 1:19-cv-02906-TNM   Document 40   Filed 06/01/20   Page 7 of 368 necessarily qualify as an “authority of the Government” under §  551(1) and § 701(b)(1).  See id.  \nat 583–84.  Congress thus allowed for something to be an “agency” under §  552(f)(1) but  not an \n“agency” under §  551(1) or § 701(b)(1).   In other words, because of the 1974 amendment , all \nAPA agencies are FOIA agencies , but not vice -versa.  \nThe Commission is precisely this sort of  FOIA -only agency .  The Court’s previous \nopinion got us halfway to  this conclusion, since it held that the Commission is an “agency” under \n§ 552(f)(1).  Any impression conveyed that the Commission is  also an “agency” under §  551(1) \nand § 701(b)(1)  was dicta . \nEnergy Research  was the template for the Court’s opinion.  It held that the Defense \nNuclear Facilities Safety Board was an “agency” under FOIA  because the Board’s organic \nstatute called it an “establishment in the executive branch ,” one of the categories in §  552(f)(1).  \nId. at 58 2–83.  And there was “nothing to indicate that Congress intended to excuse the Board \nfrom complying with FOIA.”  Id.  at 583.  That was the end of the matter.  For entities that fit into \none of the § 552(f)(1)  categories , Soucie ’s functional test determines agency status only if the \nentity is  in the White House.  See id . at 584 (citing Crooker v. Office of the Pardon Attorney , 614 \nF.2d 825, 828 (2d Cir. 1980) ).  The Board was not in the White House , so the functional test was \nirrelevant to its  status as an “agency” under §  552(f)(1).  See id . at 582–84.   Then in dicta , the \ncourt  opined that the Board exercised  “substantial independent authority” and thus was  also a \nFOIA  “agency” under Soucie ’s functio nal test.  Id.  at 584–85. \nThis Court’s previous opinion followed Energy Research ’s analytical steps .  As with  the \nBoard, Congress made the Commission an “establishment in the executive branch,” one of the \ncategories in §  552(f)(1).  NSCAI , 419 F. Supp. 3d at 86.  Also like the Board, nothing in the \nCommission’s organic statute suggested that Congress intended to excuse it from FOIA.  Indeed, Case 1:19-cv-02906-TNM   Document 40   Filed 06/01/20   Page 8 of 369 the opposite was true, since the 2019 NDAA excused a different entity from FOIA but did \nexempt the Commission.  Id. at 86 –87.  And Soucie  did not apply because —again like the \nBoard —the Commission is not in the White House.  Id . at 89.  “The text of § 552(f)(1)” was \ntherefore “dispositive”  of the Commission’s status as a FOIA “ agency. ”  Id. \nThen, relying on the dicta  from Energy Research , the Court suggested  in passing that the \nCommission exercises “substantial independent authorit y” and thus could meet Soucie ’s \nfunctional test , too.  Id.  at 89–90.  Still, the Court made clear that this f unctional test was “not \nrelevant.”  Id. at 90.  So, just as in Energy Research , its application of  the functional test was \ndicta .  And because this discussion relied on the dicta  from Energy Research , this was dicta  \nupon dicta .  \n The Government is thus imprecise  when it asserts as the “law of the case” that the \nCommission is an “agency.”  Defs. ’ Mem. at 16 n.2.  This assertion—without reference to \nspecific statutory provisions —is only  half correct.  Under the law -of-the-case doctrine, “the same  \nissue presented a second time in the same  case should lead to the same  result .”  LaShawn A. v. \nBerry , 87 F.3d 1389, 1393 (D.C. Cir. 1996).  Dicta  is not part of the law of the case.  Nat’l \nSouvenir Ctr., Inc. v. Historic  Figures, Inc., 728 F.2d 503, 511 (D.C. Cir. 1984). \nBy these standards, the  law of th is case is that the Commission is an “agency” under \n§ 552(f)(1), because that was the dispositive point in the Court’s first  opinion.  But any  dicta —\nincluding that the Commission  also met Soucie ’s functional test —is not the law of th is case.  \nUnlike last time, it is n ow necessary to decide whether  the Commission is an “agency” \nunder § 701(b)(1) —as noted, the Court’s jurisdiction over EPIC’s APA claims turns on this.  The \nGovernment implicitly concedes that the Commiss ion is an agency under §  701(b)(1), since it \nmistake nly reads the Court’s previous opinion as having held this.  See Defs. ’ Mem. at 14, 16 Case 1:19-cv-02906-TNM   Document 40   Filed 06/01/20   Page 9 of 3610 n.2.  But the Court cannot simply adopt this concession.  “[S]ubject -matter jurisdiction, because \nit involves a court’s power to hear a case, can never be forfeited or waived. ”  United States v. \nCotton, 535 U.S. 625, 630 (2002) .  The Court thus has “ an independent obligation to determine \nwhether subject -matter jurisdiction exists.”  Arbaugh v. Y&H Corp., 546 U.S. 500, 514 (2006). \nAnd upon closer examination , the Court finds  that the Commission is not an agency \nunder § 551(1) or § 701(b)(1).  The D.C. Circuit’s cases highlight  two factors that are central to \nwhether an entity wields “substantial independent authority ”:  investigative power and authority \nto make final and binding decisions. \nConsider first  Soucie .  The Circuit held that the Office of Science and Technology  \n(“OST”)  was an agency because, beyond advising the President, it had the “independent function \nof evaluating federal programs.”  448 F.2d at 1075.  Critically,  in carrying out this “independent \nfunction,” the OST wielded “portions” of Congress’s own “investigatory power.”  Id. at 1075 & \nn.27.  In describing this power, the court cited McGrain v. Daugherty , 273 U.S. 135 (1927), \nwhich upheld the Senate’s authority to compel testim ony.  Id.  at 180.  \nThe next decision introduced another factor:  whether an entity has “formal decision-\nmaking power.”  Grumman Aircraft Eng’g Corp. v. Reneg. Bd. , 482 F.2d 710, 715 (D.C. Cir. \n1973), rev’d on other grounds , 421 U.S. 168 (1975).  In holding that “Regional Boards”  were \n“agencies” under § 551(1) , the c ourt emphasized that “in many cases” they were  “empowered to \nmake final decisions not even reviewable by the [Renegotiation] Board.”  Id. at 714–15. \n This “authority in law to make decisions” was the “important consideration”  when the  \ncourt held that “initial review groups” (“IRGs”)  were not  “agencies” under §  551(1) .  Wash . \nResearch Project , Inc. v. Dep’t  of Health, Educ . & Welfare , 504 F.2d 238, 246, 248 (D.C. Cir. \n1974).  The National Institute of Mental Health (“NIMH”) used IRGs to review grant Case 1:19-cv-02906-TNM   Document 40   Filed 06/01/20   Page 10 of 3611 applications , but the authority to make “final and binding” decisions rested with the NIMH, not \nthe IRGs .  Id. at 248 & n.15.  It did not matter that the NIMH “may be greatly influenced” by an \nIRG’s “expert view.”  Id.  at 248.  G iven the functions that IRGs were “empowered by law to \nperform,” they did not wield “substantial independent authority.”  Id.  at 24 7–48. \n Two months after Washington Resear ch Project , Congress enacted the 1974 amendment \nthat expanded FOIA’s definition of “agency.”  See  Pub. L. No. 93- 502, § 3 (codified at 5 U.S.C. \n§ 552(f)(1)).  The expanded definition encompasse s entities in “the Executive Office of the \nPresident.”  Id.   But a conference report suggests  that FOIA applies to these entities only if they \nwield  “substantial independent authority” under Soucie .  See NSCAI , 419 F. Supp. 3d at 88 \n(citing H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 93- 1380, at 15 (1974)).  This conference report has spawned  a series \nof cases analyzing whether units  in the White House exercise “substantial inde pendent \nauthority.”4  These cases  echo the importance of decision- making authori ty.  See, e.g., Rushforth \nv. Council of Econ. Advisers , 762 F.2d 1038, 1042 –43 (D.C. Cir. 1985)  (holding that the Council \non Economic Advisers, which ha s a duty “ to appraise federal programs relative to a particular \nstatutory policy and make recommendations to the President in that regard”  but ha s no authority \nto “issue regulations for procedures based on the appraisals,” i s not an agency  under Soucie ’s \nfunctional test ). \nTo be sure, “much of the focus” in these White House cases  “was on the in dependence \naspect” of “substantial independent authority.”  Dong v. Smithsonian Inst., 125 F.3d 877, 881 \n                                                 \n4  See CR EW v. Office of Admin. , 566 F.3d 219, 220 (D.C. Cir. 2009) ; Armstrong v. Exec. Office \nof the President , 90 F.3d 553, 558 (D.C. Cir. 1996) ; Sweetland v. Walters , 60 F.3d 852, 854 \n(D.C. Cir. 1995) ; Meyer v. Bush , 981 F.2d 1288, 1297 (D.C. Cir. 1993) ; Rushfor th v. Council of \nEcon. Advisers , 762 F.2d 1038, 1043 (D.C. Cir. 1985) ; Pac. Legal Found. v. Council on Envtl. \nQuality , 636 F.2d 1259, 1263 (D.C. Cir. 1980) ; Sierra Club v. Andrus , 581 F.2d 895, 901–02 \n(D.C. Cir. 1978) , rev’d on other grounds , 442 U.S. 347 (1979).  Case 1:19-cv-02906-TNM   Document 40   Filed 06/01/20   Page 11 of 3612 (D.C. Cir. 1997).  The goal was to identify the White House units closest to the President, for \nimposing FOIA  on them would be “a potentially serious c ongressional intrusion into the conduct \nof the President’s daily operations.”  Judicial Watch, Inc. v. U.S. Secret Serv., 726 F.3d 208, 226 \n(D.C. Cir. 2013); see NSCAI , 419 F. Supp. 3d at 90. \n But o f course, m any entities not  in the White House  are indepen dent of  the President, so \nfor them, the “authority” prong is  the sticking point.  See Dong, 125 F.3d at 881.  On this, Dong \nis particularly instructive.  Statutory delegation of “authority ” is key.  See id . at 882.  And “the \nrequisite type of authority” is the “final and binding” kind.  Id. at 881 (citing Wash . Research \nProject , 504 F.2d at 248 n.15). \nMore, the requirement of “substantial” authority suggests that the entity should be at the \n“center of gravity in the exercise of administrative power.”  Id.  at 882 (quoting Lombardo v. \nHandler , 397 F. Supp. 792, 796 (D.D.C. 1975), aff’d , 546 F.2d 1043 (D.C. Cir. 1976)).  On this \nbasis, the National Academy of Sciences was not an agency “despite the fact that it possessed the \napparent authority  . . . to veto the Environmental Protection Agency’s suspension of auto \nemission standards.”  Id.  (citing Lombar do, 397 F. Supp. at 794). \nApplying these principles, Dong held that the Smithsonian i s not an “agency” under \n§ 551(1) because it “does not make binding rules of general application or determine rights and \nduties through adjudication” and “issues no orders and performs no regulatory functions.”  Id.  \nSo too here.  The Commission’s statutory duties are to carry out a review and to report to \nthe President and Congress on its findings and recommendations.  Pub. L. No. 115- 232, \n§ 1051(b) –(c).  Congress thus did not give the Commission the sort of “final and binding” \ndecision -making authority that the case law contemplates .  See Dong, 125 F.3d at 881; Wash . Case 1:19-cv-02906-TNM   Document 40   Filed 06/01/20   Page 12 of 3613 Research Project , 504 F.2d at 248 & n.15.  Much less did Congress pl ace the Commission at the \n“center of grav ity in the exercise of administrative power.”  Dong, 125 F.3d at 882. \nTo be sure , the Commission’s “review” e ntails a degree of “investigation .”  It has \nreceived “more than 100 briefings” from agencies and M embers of Congress , covering topics \nlike “the status of the U.S. government’s artificial intelligence strategies .”  Compl. ¶¶ 38, 46, 64, \n68, 70.  But there is no suggestion—either in the statute  or in the record —that the Commission \nhas any subpoena or contempt authority, the sort of powers incident to Congress’s “broad power \nof inquiry.”  Soucie , 448 F.2d at 1075 & n.27; see McGrain , 273 U.S. at  168–69, 180. \nGiven these considerations, the Commis sion does not exercise “substantial independent \nauthority .”  Accord Flaherty v. Ross , 373 F. Supp. 3d 97, 106–10 (D.D.C. 2019) .5  The upshot is \nthat the Commission is an “agency” under § 552(f)(1) but not  an “agency” under § 551(1) or \n§ 701(b)(1) , exactly  the sort of entity Congress intended to capture when it expanded FOIA’s \ndefinition of “agency” in 1974.  See Energy Research , 917 F.2d at 583 (“Through [the] words \n[“establishment in the executive branch”], Congress sought to encompass entities that might \nhave eluded the APA’s definition in § 551(1) [.]”).  But because the Commission is not an \n“agency” under §  701(b)(1), the Court m ust dismiss EPIC’s APA claims (Counts II, III, and V) \nfor lack of jurisdiction.  See Trudeau, 456 F.3d at 187 & n.13.          \n \n \n                                                 \n5  Dicta in Energy Research  supports this conclusion.  Congress authorized the Nuclear Safety \nBoard to “conduct hearings,” “compel testimony,” and “require the production of documents.”  \n917 F.2d at 582.  It thus “ha[d] at its disposal the full panoply of investigative powers commonly \nheld by other agencies of government.”  Id.  at 584.  The Board also had “the additional authority \nto impose reporting requirements on the Secretary of Energy.”  Id. at 585.  The Commission has \nno analogous powe rs.   Case 1:19-cv-02906-TNM   Document 40   Filed 06/01/20   Page 13 of 3614 B. \n That leaves Counts I and IV ; EPIC labels both as “Violation of the FACA.”  Compl. at \n28, 31.  EPI C “does not assert that it has a cause of action under” FACA.  P l.’s Mem. at 30 n.2; \nsee, e.g., EPIC v. Drone Advisory Comm., 369 F. Supp. 3d 27, 36–38 (D.D.C. 2019)  (concluding \nthat FAC A does not confer a private right of action) .  Instead, it seeks mandamus relief based on \nalleged violations of FACA.  See Compl. ¶¶ 115, 118, 136, 139; Pl.’s Mem. at 28–30, 30 n.2. \n Even  though sovereign immunity bars EPIC’s claims under the APA, this immunity does \nnot bar mandamus relief.  See Swan v. Clinton, 100 F.3d 973, 981 & n.4 (D.C. Cir. 1996).  The \nmandamus statute provides that “district courts shall have original jurisdiction of any action in \nthe nature of mandamus to compel an officer or employ ee of the United States or any agency \nthereof to perform a duty owed to the plaintiff.”  28 U.S.C. § 1361.  It is settled that “ [i]f a \nplaintiff seeks a writ of mandamus to force a public official to perform a duty imposed upon him \nin his official capacity  . . . no separate waiver of sovereign immunity is needed.”  Wash. Legal \nFound. v. U.S. Sentencing Comm’n, 89 F.3d 897, 901 (D.C . Cir. 1996) .6 \n Whether this immunity exception  applies “depends upon whether the Government has a \nduty” to comply with the “open meetings” and “public records” requirements in FACA.  Id. ; see \nCompl. ¶¶ 115, 136 (citing 5 U.S.C. app. 2 § 10(a)(1) –(2), (b)).  So “the question of jurisdiction” \nunder the mandamus statute “merges with the question on the merits.”  Wash. Legal Found., 89 \nF.3d at 902.  And the merits question here is whether the Commission is an “advisory \ncommittee”  under 5 U.S.C. app. 2 § 3(2), because if it is, then it must comply with FACA’s \nrequirements.  See 5 U.S.C. app. 2 §§ 4(a), 10.  To this question t he Court now turns.         \n                                                 \n6  The Defendants listed for Counts I and IV are the Commission and two officials —Eric \nSchmidt, its Chairman, and Ylli Bajraktari, its Executive Director.  Compl. at 28, 31. Case 1:19-cv-02906-TNM   Document 40   Filed 06/01/20   Page 14 of 3615 Congress enacted FACA in 1972 to provide a framework for the many boards , councils, \nand commissions that advise the Executive Branch.  See Pub. Citizen v. DOJ , 491 U.S. 440, \n445–46 (1989).  It found that t hese bodies  are “a useful and beneficial means of fur nishing expert \nadvice, ideas, and diverse opinions to the Federal Government.”  5 U.S.C. app. 2 § 2(a).  And it \nsaw a need to keep the public “informed” about the ir “activities. ”  Id. § 2(b)(5).  \nTo that end, FACA calls for open meetings .  A committee’s meetings “ shall be open to \nthe public.”  Id.  § 10(a)(1).  “[T] imely notice” of these meetings “shall be published in the \nFederal Register.”  Id.  § 10(a)(2).   This  transparency extends to records , too.  “S ubject to [5 \nU.S.C. § 552 (FOIA)],” all  documents “ which were made available to or prepared for or by each \nadvisory committee shall be available for public inspection and copying  . . . until the advisory \ncommittee ceases to exist.”  Id.  § 10(b).  Unlike FOIA, this provision looks forward.  It r equires \ncommittees to take affirmative steps to make their records are public, even absent a request.  \nFACA’s definition of “advisory committee” has  four parts.  First , it includes “any \ncommittee, board, commission, council, conference , panel, task force, o r other similar group, or \nany subcommittee or other subgroup thereof.”  Id.  § 3(2).  Second, it must be “established by \nstatute or reorganization plan,” “established or utilized by the President,” or “established or \nutilized by one or more agencies.”  Id.  Third, it must be “established” or “utilized” “in the \ninterest of obtaining advice or recommendations for the President or one or more agencies or \nofficers of the Federal Government.”  Id.   Fourth, the definition  excludes  “any committee that is \ncomposed wholly of full -time, or permanent part -time, officers or employees of the Federal \nGovernment .”  Id.  The Court agrees with EPIC that the Commission meets this definition . \nStart with the text of the 2019 NDAA, the Commission’s organic statute.  Congress \nestablished a “Commission.”  Pub. L. No. 115 -232, § 1051(a)(1).  Its mandate is to “consider the Case 1:19-cv-02906-TNM   Document 40   Filed 06/01/20   Page 15 of 3616 methods and means necessary to advance the development of artificial intelligence . . . to \ncomprehensively address the national security and defense needs of the United States.”  Id.  \n§ 1051(b)(1).  And it must report “to the President and Congress” its “findings” and \n“recommendations  . . . for ac tion by the executive branch and Congress related to artificial \nintelligence.”   Id. § 1051(c); see also  2020 NDAA, Pub. L. No. 116- 92, § 1735(c ). \nThese words fit the definition of “advisory committee” like a glove.   From a purely \ncommonsens e standpoint, is the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence an \n“advisory” commission?  Of course  it is.  Congress created a “commission.”  5 U .S.C. app. 2 \n§ 3(2).  It is “established by statute” and “utilized by the President.”  Id.   And since it provides \n“findings” and “recommendations” to the President, it is “established” and “utilized” “in the \ninterest of obtaining advice or recommendations for the President.”  Id.  \nMore, Congress noticeably declined to exempt the Commission from FACA , even though \nit carved out  FACA exemptions elsewhere in the same law.  The 2019 NDAA creates  the \nCyberspace Solarium Commission but declare s that “[t]he provisions of the Federal Advisory \nCommittee Act . . . shall not apply to the activities of [this] Commission.”  Pub. L. No. 115- 232, \n§ 1652(m)(1).  The law also states that “[s]ubsections (a)(1) , (a)(3), and (b) of section 10 and \nsections 11, 13, and 14 of the Federal Advisory Committee Act  . . . shall not apply” to a body \ncalled “the Emerging Technology and Research Advisory Committee.”  Id. § 1758(f)(5).  \nThe Court likewise found the lack  of an exemption significant in concluding that the \nCommission is subject to FOIA.  See NSCAI , 419 F. Supp. 3d at 86–87.  The 2019 NDAA \nexcuses the Cyberspace Solarium Commission from FOIA, see  Pub. L. No. 115- 232, \n§ 1652(m )(2), but does not excuse the AI Commission from FOIA.  So too for FACA.    Case 1:19-cv-02906-TNM   Document 40   Filed 06/01/20   Page 16 of 3617 The Government protests  that “no canon of statutory construction provides that the Court \nshould assign weight to [the] absence” of an “explicit exemption.”  Defs.’  Reply at 17, ECF No. \n33.  But here, that is wrong, since Congress elsewhere carved out exemptions.  “Where Congress \nincludes particular language in on e section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same \nAct, it is generally presumed that Congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate \ninclusion or exclusion.”  Russello v. United States , 464 U.S. 16, 23 (1983) (cleaned up).  \nThe Government also points to  one example—from  a different law —in which Congress \nmade clear that FACA applies .  Defs. ’ Reply at 17 –18; see Pandemic and All -Hazards \nPreparedness and Advancing Innovation Act  of 2019 (“Pandemic Act”) , Pub. L. No. 116 -22, \n§ 505(d), 133 Stat. 905, 952 (“The Federal Advisory Committee Act  . . . shall apply to the \nactivities and duties of the [Presidential Advisory Council on Combating Antibiotic -Resistant \nBacteria].”).  Based on this example, the Government contends that “it is at leas t as telling that \nCongress also did not explicitly make the Commission an advisory committee.”  Defs.’ Reply  at \n17.  Not quite.  Congress formed  the Commission using language that tracks FACA’s definition \nof “advisory committee.”  That was enough to “make”  the Commission an advisory committee.  \nIt is a fair point that Congress did not declare in so many words that “FACA shall apply” \nto the Commission.  But a weak one.  T he one example the Government cites was in the \nPandemic Act , not the 2019 NDAA .  The 2019 NDAA itself contains no examples of Congress \nsaying that “FACA shall apply .”  It contains only examples of Congress saying that “FACA shall \nnot apply.”  Yet the NDAA does  not use this language for the Commission.  T his reinforces the \nconclusion that Congress made the Commission an “advisory committee.”  See Russello , 464 \nU.S. at 22–23. Case 1:19-cv-02906-TNM   Document 40   Filed 06/01/20   Page 17 of 3632 A second, independent reason why the Commission does not fall within  this exclusion is \nthat its  members are not “part -time” federal employees .  Instead, they are “intermittent” \nemployees.  EPIC points to a regulation stating that “[a]n intermittent work schedule is \nappropriate only when the nature of the work is sporadic and unpredictable so that a tour of duty \ncannot be regularly scheduled in advance.”  Pl.’s Mem. at 18 (quoting 5 C.F.R. § 340.403(a) ).  \nThis regulation explicitly distinguishes “intermittent” status from “part -time” status, as it says \nthat “[w]hen an agency is able to schedule work in advance  on a regular basis, it has an \nobligation to document the change in work schedule from intermittent to part -time or full- time to \nensure proper service credit.”  5 C.F.R. § 340.403( a). \nThe Court agrees with EPIC that “intermittent” accurately describes the employment \nstatus of the Commission’s members.  A ll the members have day jobs, the Commission “meets \nin plenary every other month,” and “each working group meets monthly .”  See Compl. ¶¶ 44, 48 \n(cleaned up) ; Answer ¶¶ 44, 48, ECF No. 29.  For example, the Commission met on March 11, \nMay 20, and July 11 of 2019.  See Compl. ¶¶ 63, 67, 69; Answer ¶¶  63, 67, 69.  This limited and \nirregular work schedule fits the bill as “sporadic and unpredictable. ”  5 C.F.R. § 340.403(a) . \nThe Government does not dispute that § 340.403 is relevant to the meaning of “part -\ntime” versus “intermittent.”  Indeed, it provide s no affirmative argument for why the \nCommission’s members are “part -time.”  See Defs. ’ Mem. at 21 –22; Defs.’ Reply at 1 6–17.11      \n                                                 \n11  EPIC claims the Government’s Answer conceded that “the members of the AI Commission \nare employed on an ‘intermittent’ basis.”  Compl. ¶  43 (quoting 5 C.F.R. § 340.403); see Pl.’s \nMem. at 18.  The Government disagrees.  Defs.’  Reply at 16 –17.  The Court need not resolve \nthis, as  it does not rely on this aspect of EPIC’s argument in concluding that the Commission’s \nmembers are “intermittent”  employees .  The Court also does not  rely on EPIC’s assertion —\nsupported by a declaration attached to its reply brief —that the Commission’s c hief of s taff stated  \nthat “the members of the Commission were employed in ‘excepted service appointments on an \nintermittent basis.’”  Pl.’s Reply at 15; see Davisson Decl. ¶  8, ECF No. 35 -1. Case 1:19-cv-02906-TNM   Document 40   Filed 06/01/20   Page 32 of 3633 One final point:  EPIC ’s position finds support in Associatio n of Am erican  Physicians & \nSurgeons, Inc. v. Clinton (“ AAPS ”), 997 F.2d 898 (D.C. Cir. 1993).  AAPS  considered the status \nthe President’s Task Force on National Health Care Reform and its working group.  Id. at 900.  \nThe court remanded for further proceedings on the status of the working group.  Id.   It was \ncomposed in part of  “40 ‘special government em ployees’ hired by  . . . agencies and the \nExecutive Office of the President for a limited duration .”  Id.  at 901.  \nThe court expressed skepticism that the working group—so composed—fell within \nFACA’s exclusion.  “FACA would be rather easy to avoid if an agency could simply appoint 10 \nprivate citizens as special government employees for two days, and then have the committee \nreceive the section 3(2) exemption as a body composed of full -time government employees.”  Id.  \nat 915.  Similar logic applies here.  FACA “would be rather easy to avoid” if the Government is \nright that private -citizen members of short -term advisory groups  are always “permanent part -\ntime” employees of the Federal Government.  Indeed, AAPS  genera lized that “a formal group of \na limited number of private citizens who are brought together to give publicized advice as a \ngroup . . . would seem covered by [FACA].”  Id.   The Commission fits this model.      \nC. \n Because the Commission is an “advisory committee” that must comply with FACA’s \nrequirements, EPIC’s entitlement to mandamus relief is straightforward.  The party seeking \nmandamus has the burden of showing “(1) a clear and indisputable right to relief, (2) that the \ngovernment agency or official is violating a clear duty to act, and (3) that no adequate alternative \nremedy exists. ”  Am. Hosp. Ass’n v. Burwell , 812 F.3d 183, 189 (D.C. Cir. 2016).12 \n                                                 \n12  “Even when [these three] legal requirements for mandamus jurisdiction have been satisfied, \nhowever, a court may grant relief only when it finds compelling equitable grounds.”   Am. Hosp. \nAss’n , 812 F.3d at 189.  Given the Commission’s clear duty to comply with FACA, the Court Case 1:19-cv-02906-TNM   Document 40   Filed 06/01/20   Page 33 of 3634  EPIC has shown all three .  Since relief under the APA is unavai lable, see supra  Section \nIII.A, “no adequate alternative remedy exists.”  And  the Government’s sole argument for why \nEPIC has not established “a clear and indisputable right to relief” or “a clear duty to act” is that \nthe Commission is not an “advisory com mittee” under FACA.   Defs. ’ Mem. at 20–24.13  This, of \ncourse, is the argument that the Court has rejected.  See supra Section III.B.  \n The Government’s only  remaining  argument against mandamus is that EPIC did not \n“adequately plead []” claims under the mandamus statute.  Defs. ’ Mem. at 18 –19.  “[I] t is \nimpossible to know ,” the Government complains, “what counts [EPIC] intended to pursue \nunder” this statute “or the specific allegations that would support claims under [it] .”  Id.   The \nCourt disagrees.  \nEPIC  style s its Complaint as one “ for Injunctive, Mandamus, and Declaratory Relief.”  \nCompl. at 1.  It cite s the mandamus statute, 28 U.S.C. § 1361, in the Complaint’s first paragraph \nand in its jurisdictional statement.  Id.  ¶¶ 1, 7.  Then, in Count I, it cla ims that the Commission’s \n“failure to timely notice and open [its] meetings violates 5 U.S.C. app. 2 §§ 10(a)(1) and (a)(2) \n                                                 \nfinds “compelling equitable grounds” for mandamus  relief .  Indeed, the Government makes no \nargument for why, if the Commission is subject to FACA, there would not be “compelling \nequitable gro unds” for relief .  Other than an argument that EPIC  has an adequate alternative \nremedy in the APA and an argument that EPIC  did not adequately plead mandamus claims, \nwhich the Court addresses infra , the Government’s arguments against mandamus focus \nexclusi vely on its belief that the Commission is just not subject to FACA in the first place.  See \nDefs.’ Mem. at 18 –24; Defs.’ Reply at 18–20, 18 n.6. \n \n13  For the first element of mandamu s, the Government invokes the doctrine of “judicial \nestoppel.”  Defs.’  Mem. at 22 –24.  This doctrine “generally prevents a party from prevailing in \none phase of a case on an argument and then relying on a contradictory argument to prevail in \nanother phase.”  Pegram v. Herdrich , 530 U.S. 211, 227 n.8 (2000).  The Government c ontends \nthat this doctrine bars mandamus relief because EPIC “prevailed on its earlier position that the \nCommission is an agency subject to FOIA” and “an entity cannot be both an agency and an \nadvisory committee.”  Defs.’ Mem. at 23.  So the Government’s i nvocation of “judicial estoppel” \njust boils down to its argument that the Commission is not an advisory committee.  Case 1:19-cv-02906-TNM   Document 40   Filed 06/01/20   Page 34 of 3635 and constitutes a failure to perform duties owed to EPIC within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. \n§ 1361.”  Id.  ¶ 115.  Count IV likewise ass erts that the Commission’s “failure to make [its] \nrecords available for inspection and copying is a violation of 5 U.S.C. app. 2 § 10(b) and \nconstitutes a failure to perform a duty owed to EPIC within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. § 1361.”  \nId. ¶ 136.  Both counts seek “a writ of mandamus” compelling the Commission and its officers to \ncomply with FACA.  Id.  ¶¶ 118, 139.  These counts ma ke clear that EPIC  seeks mandamus relief \nbased on the Commission’s refusal to comply with FACA.  \nAnd for the reasons explained, EPIC is correct that the Commission is subject to FACA.  \nEPIC is thus entitled to writs of mandamus compelling the Commission and its officers to \nprovide timely notice of its meetings, to open them to the public, and to make its  records \navailable for public inspection and copying .  Id. ¶¶ 115, 118, 136, 139; Compl. Requested Relief \n¶¶ A, D; see  5 U.S.C. app. 2 § 10(a)(1)–(2), (b).  \n EPIC also seeks relief under the Declaratory Judgment Act (“DJA”), 28 U.S.C. § 2201.  \nCompl. ¶  1; C ompl. Requested Relief ¶  H.  Under the DJA, the Court “may declare the rights \nand other legal relations of any interested party seeking such declaration.”   28 U.S.C. § 2201(a) .  \nThis statute “is not an independent source of federal jurisdiction” ; rather,  “the availability of \nsuch relief presupposes the existence of a judicially remediable right.”  Schilling v. Rogers , 363 \nU.S. 666, 677 (1960).  The Court independently has jurisdiction here under the mandamus \nstatute, 28 U.S.C. § 1361, and EPIC  has a judicially remediable  right to have the Commission \ncomply with its duties under FACA.  See Wash. Legal Found., 89 F.3d at 901–02; supra Section \nIII.B.  EPIC is thus entitled to a declaration that the Commission has a duty under FACA to \nprovide timely notic e of its meetings, to open them to the public, and to  make its records Case 1:19-cv-02906-TNM   Document 40   Filed 06/01/20   Page 35 of 3636 available for public inspection and copying .

T oday, the Court holds that Congress can and did impose Janus -like transparency \nobligations upon t he AI Commission .  No rule of law forced Congress to choose just one. \nThe Court will dismiss Counts II, III, and V, and it will grant  summary judgment for \nEPIC on Counts I and IV.

But \nthe Government’s own authorities show that EPIC was right not to plead it as an independent \ncause of action.  Id.  at 19.  It cites cases stating that the DJA does not itself provide “a cause of \naction,” Al i v. Rumsfeld , 649 F.3d 762, 778 (D.C. Cir. 2011), and that “a count for declaratory \njudgment  . . . is more properly included in the prayer for relief,” Drone Advisory Comm., 369 F. \nSupp. 3d at 38 (cleaned up).

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: The case involves the Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) suing the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the Department of Defense (DOD) for failing to comply with the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests made by EPIC. EPIC requested records related to the Commission's activities, which involve reviewing advances in AI and making recommendations to the U.S. government, but both entities were unresponsive. The court determined that the Commission is subject to FOIA and denied the government's motion to dismiss EPIC's claims, highlighting that transparency is critical given the significant implications of AI policy on privacy and human rights.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence qualifies as an “agency” subject to FOIA, requiring it to provide requested records to EPIC.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court held that the Commission is indeed an \"agency\" under FOIA, as it is an establishment in the executive branch, and therefore it must comply with EPIC’s FOIA requests. Consequently, the government's motion to dismiss was denied, allowing EPIC's FOIA claims to proceed.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: EPIC asked the government for documents about an AI commission's work, because they believe this work can highly influence how AI is used by the government. The government said they're not the type of organization that needs to share this information under the law. The court disagreed, saying the commission does need to share the information, like other government offices. So now EPIC can move forward in getting the information they need.",
    "full_text": "UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT  \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA  \n \nELECTRONIC PRIVACY INFORMATION \nCENTER , \n \nPlaintiff,    \n \nv.       \n \nNATIONAL SECURITY COMMISSION ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, et al. ,\n    Defendant s. \n         \n  \n   Case No.  1:19- cv-02906 (TNM ) \nMEMORANDUM OPINION  AND ORDER  \n Congress recently created the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence .  \nThe Electronic Privacy Information Center ( “EPIC ”) wants  to shed light on the Commission’s \nwork.  EPIC requested records from the Commission and the Department of Defense under the \nFreedom of Information Act ( “FOIA ”), 5 U.S.C. § 552.  Neither entity was forthcoming with \nrecords, so EPIC sued .  The Government moves to dismiss  some of  EPIC’s  claims.   Its primary \ncontention is that the Commission is not an “agency” subject to FOIA.  The Court finds  \notherwise.  For this and other reasons , the Court denies  the Government’s motion.  \nI. \nCongress gave the Commission its marching orders in the John S. McCain National \nDefense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019 (“NDAA”) .  See  Pub. L. No. 115- 232, § 1051, \n132 Stat. 1636, 1962–65 (2018).  Its mandate is “ to review advances in artificial intelligence, \nrelated machine learning developments, and associated technologies.”   Id. § 1051(a) (1).  In \ncarrying out that review, the Commission must consider many  factors, including the country’s \nnational security needs.  See id.  § 1051(b)(1) –(2).  This review is not academic.  The NDAA Case 1:19-cv-02906-TNM   Document 26   Filed 12/03/19   Page 1 of 232 requires the Commission to submit three reports to the President and Congress .  Id. § 1051(c).  \nThese reports  are to contain the Commission’s findings and any recommendations it has  “for \naction by the executive branch and Congress related to artificial intelligence . . . including \nrecommendations to more effectively organize the Federal Government.”  Id. § 1051(c )(1).  The \nreports “shall be made publicly available, but may include a classified annex.”  Id.  § 1051(c )(3). \n  The Commission was to submit an initial report within 180 days of its creation , id. \n§ 1051(c)(1 ), and an interim report was due in August 2019.  Id.  § 1051(c)(2).  Both reports \ncame late.   Compl. ¶¶ 75, 79, ECF No. 1.  The Commission will end  in October 2020.  Pub. L. \nNo. 115- 232, § 1051(e).1  Before then , the Commission must submit one final report to the \nPresident and Congress.  See id. § 1051(c)(2).  \nThe Commission consists of 15 members.  Id.  § 1051(a)(4)(A).  Most are congressional \nappointees.  The Secretary of Defense appoints two members and the Secretary of Commerce appoints one .  Id. § 1051(a)(4)(A)(i)–(ii).  But the  chairman or ranking m ember of six \ncongressional committees appoint the others .  Id. § 1051(a)(4)(A)(iii)–(xiv).   \nEPIC describes itself as “one of the leading organizations in the country with respect to \nthe privacy and human rights implications of AI use .”  Compl. ¶  10.  So it comes as little surprise \nthat EPIC has closely tracked the Commission .  Or at least it tries  to do so.  EPIC alleges that the \nCommission “has operated almost entirely in secret.”  Id.  ¶ 59.  When EPIC filed its Complaint, \nthe Commission had held at least 13 meetings  and had received “more than 100 briefings.”  Id.  \n¶ 38.  But the Commission ha d conducted these proceedings “behind closed doors ” and had \n“failed to publish or discl ose any notices, agendas, minutes, or materials for those meetings.”  Id.  \n                                                 \n1  The  NDAA for Fiscal Year 2020, not yet enacted, would extend the life of the Commission  \nthrough March 2021.  See  S. 1790, 116th Cong. § 1083 (2019).  Case 1:19-cv-02906-TNM   Document 26   Filed 12/03/19   Page 2 of 233 ¶ 59.  Meanwhile, the Commission is now working to prepare its final recommendations.   See \nCompl. Ex. H .  These recommendations, EPIC claims, “could have far -reaching i mplications fo r \nthe U.S. government, private companies, and the public at large.”  Compl. ¶ 5. \nEPIC has tried to  shine light on the  Commission .  In February, EPIC asked DOD for \nrecords related to the Commission’s work, invoking both FOIA and the Federal Advisory \nCommittee Act (“FACA”), 5 U.S.C. app. 2.  Compl. Ex. B at 1, 6.2  EPIC requested  expedited \nprocessing under FOIA .  Id. at 4–5; see 5 U.S.C. §  552(a)(6)(E).   EPIC gave two reasons why it s \nrequest was urgent .  Compl. Ex. B at 4.  First, the release of the Commission’s initial report was \nimminent.   Id.  Second, the Commission was “operating at a time when the White House ha s \nlaunched the ‘American AI Initiative.’”  Id.  So the Commission’s “findings , recommendations, \nand proceedings” would “have significant influence on AI policymaking by both Congress and the executive branch.”  Id. \nDOD acknowledged  EPIC’s FOIA request six days later.  Compl. Ex. C.  Though it had \n“begun processing”  the request, it was unable to respond within FOIA’s 20 -day period because \nof “unusual circumstances.”  Id.   It also denied EPIC’s request for expedited processing because \nEPIC had “not clearly demonstrated how the information will lose its value if not processed on \nan expedited basis.”  Id.   EPIC filed an administrative appeal of DOD’s denial of expedited \nprocessing.  Compl. Ex. E.  DOD had not acted on this appeal when EPIC sued here .  See \nCompl. ¶¶ 109–10. \nIn September, EPIC submitted requests under FOIA and FACA to the Commission itself.  \nCompl. Ex. I at 1, 11.  It aga in requested expedited processing  under FOIA .  Id. at 8–9.  EPIC \n                                                 \n2  The Complaint does not explain why EPIC thought it could get the Commission’s records \nthrough DOD.  The Commission is not part of DOD, though Congress funded the Commission \nwith $10,000,000 that it had appropriated to DOD.  See Pub. L. No. 115- 232, § 1051(a)(2), (d).  Case 1:19-cv-02906-TNM   Document 26   Filed 12/03/19   Page 3 of 234 said it was urgent to inform the public about the Commission’s activities before it released its \ninterim report.  Id.   EPIC also reiterated that the Commission’s findings and recommendations \nwould “have significant influence on the White House’s [AI] initiative and on AI policy generally.”  Id. at 9.

But c ourts need \nnot accept the truth of legal conclusions or “[t]hreadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of \naction, supported by mere conclusory statements.”  Ashcroft v. Iqbal , 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) .        \nIII. \nA. \n “By its terms, FOIA applies only to an ‘agency .’”  CREW  v. Office of Admin., 566 F.3d \n219, 222 (D.C. Cir. 2009) ; see 5 U.S.C. § 552(a) (“Each agency shall make available to the \npublic information as follows[.]”).  The Court concludes  that the  Commission is indeed an \n“agency” subject to FOIA.  Consider first the definition of “agency.”  The  general definition is \n“each  authority of the Government of the United States .”  5 U.S.C. § 551(1).  FOIA  specifies  that \n“‘agency’ as defined in section 551(1) of [title 5]  includes any  executive department, military \ndepartment, Government corporation, Government controlled corporati on, or other Case 1:19-cv-02906-TNM   Document 26   Filed 12/03/19   Page 5 of 236 establishment in the executive branch of the Government  (including the Executive Office of the \nPresident), or any independent regulatory agency .”  Id.  § 552(f)(1) (emphasis added).  \n Now consider  the NDAA, the Commission ’s organic statute .  It decrees : “There is \nestablished in the executive branch an independent Commission to review advances in artificial \nintelligence [.]”  Pub. L. No. 115- 232, § 1051(a)(1)  (emphasis added).   That Commission “ shall \nbe considered an independent establishment of the Federal Government as defined by section 104 of title 5 .”  Id.  § 1051(a)(2)  (emphasis added) .  Section 104 of title 5, meanwhile, explains \nthat “[f] or purposes of this title, ‘independent establishment’ means  . . . an establishment in the \nexecutive branch  . . . which is not an Executive department, military department, Government \ncorporation, or part thereof, or part of an independent establishment.”  5 U.S.C. § 104(1) (emphasis added).   Congress could have hardly  been clearer.  Having said that FOIA applie s to \n“any . . . establishment in the executive branch,” id. § 552(f)(1) (emphasis added) , it chose to call \nthe Commission an “establishment in the executive branch.”  \n This has happened before.  Thirty years ago, Congress created the Defense Nuclear \nFacilities Safety Board .  See Energy Research  Found. v . Def. Nuclear Facilities  Safety  Bd., 917 \nF.2d 581, 582 (D.C. Cir. 1990).  The Board’s organic statute  declared : “There is hereby \nestablished an independent  establishment in the executive branch.”   42 U.S.C. § 2286(a).  The \nBoard claimed it was not subject to FOIA, but the D.C. Circuit disagreed.  See Energy Research , \n917 F.2d at 58 1.  The court observed that § 2286(a)  “used the same terms contained in § 552( f)’s \ndescription of ‘agency.’”   Id. at 582.  “It would be a tall piece of statutory construction,” the \ncourt continued, “to say that an ‘establishment in the executive branch’ as used in § 2286(a) is \nnot an ‘establishment in the executive branch’ within the meaning of § 552(f).”  Id. at 582–83.  \nSo too here.  Case 1:19-cv-02906-TNM   Document 26   Filed 12/03/19   Page 6 of 237  There is more.  Energy Research  went beyond just the textual comparison.  It looked at \nthe whole of the Board’s statute and found “nothing to indicate that Congress intended to excuse \nthe Board from complying with FOIA.”   Id. at 583.  T he same is true here.   See Pub. L. No. 115-\n232, § 1051.  Indeed, there is powerful  circumstan tial evidence that Congress intended to impose \nFOIA on the  Commission.  In a different section of the  NDAA, Congress created the Cyberspace \nSolarium Commission.   Id. § 1652.  But it did not establish this c ommission “ in the executive \nbranch” or use a cross -reference to 5 U.S.C. § 104.  Congress said simply “[t]here is established \na commission  . . . known as t he ‘Cyberspace Solarium Commission.’”  Id.  § 1652(a)(1) –(2).  A  \nlater subsection then declared that FOIA “shall not apply to the activities, records, and proceedings of the [Cyberspace Solarium] Commission.”   Id. § 1652(m)(2).  So the C ongress \nthat created  the AI Commission knew how to excuse it from FOIA, but did not do so.   \nThe Government has no direct response to these textual arguments.  See  Reply in Supp. \nof Mot. to Dismiss FOIA Claims (“Gov’t Reply”) at 7 –9, ECF No. 25.  Instead, l ike a stranger \noffering cand y to a child, the Government invites the Court not to read 5 U.S.C. § 552(f)(1) \nliterally .  See infra Section III.B.  EPIC, meanwhile,  points to several  other “establishment[s] in \nthe executive branch” that do comply with FOIA.  Consider the language Congress used to create \nthese entities,  all of which have websites devoted to FOIA requests .

Case 1:19-cv-02906-TNM   Document 26   Filed 12/03/19   Page 8 of 239  Of course, an entity is not  subject to FOIA simply because it has a FOIA website .  \nPerhaps these ten bureau cracies  welcomed  the opportunity to open their internal deliberations to \npublic inspection.  But  this list suggests  that excusing the Commission from FOIA would be \nanomalous , to say the least. \nB. \nThe Government  urges  that 5 U.S.C. § 552(f)(1) does not mean what it says .  By its \nterms, § 552(f)(1) declares  that “any  . . . establishment in the executive branch” is subject to \nFOIA.  But the Government says not so.  See Gov’t Mem. at 15.  T he Government contends  that \nthe caselaw  requires  a non -literal reading.   See id.  at 15–18.  Its argument starts with Soucie v. \nDavid , 448 F.2d 1067 (D.C. Cir. 1971) .  See Gov’t Mem. at 14–15.   \nThe question in Soucie  was whether the Office of Science and Technology, a body in the \nExecutive Office of the President, was subject to FOIA.  448 F.2d at  1070 n.2, 1071.  At the \ntime, the only relevant definition of “agency” was the one in § 551(1) —an “authority of the \nGovernment of the United States.”   See id.  at 1073 .  Congress had not yet enacted § 552(f)(1).  \nSoucie  reasoned  that the definition in § 551(1) “confers agency status on any administrative unit \nwith s ubstantial independent authority.”  Id.   Since  the Office of Science and Technology did not \njust “advise and assist the President,” but also had an “independent functi on of evaluating federal \nprograms,” it was  an “ agency ” under  § 551(1), and thus  subject to FOIA .  See id.  at 1075.  \nThe relevance here of Soucie ’s functional analysis  is not immediately apparent.  The \ndecision came before the enactment of § 552(f)(1).  It thus dealt with the general phrase \n“authority of the Government,” not the  more specific phrase “establishment in the executive \nbranch.”   But, the Government says, the Court should consider the legislative history of the 1974 \namendment  that enacted § 552(f)(1).   See Gov’t Mem. at 15.  R ecall the text of that provision:  Case 1:19-cv-02906-TNM   Document 26   Filed 12/03/19   Page 9 of 2310 “‘agency’ as defined in section 551(1) of this title includes  any . . . establishment in the executive \nbranch of t he Government ( including the Executive Office of the President ).”  5 U.S.C. \n§ 552(f)(1) (emphasis added).   The conference report  for the 1974 amendment  contain s the \nfollowing language :   \nWith respect to the meaning of the term “ Executive Office of the Pres ident ” the conferees \nintend the result reached in Soucie v. David, 448 F.2d 1067 (C.A.D.C. 1971).  The term is \nnot to be interpreted as including the President’s immediate personal staff or units in the Executive Office whose sole function is to advise and assist the President.  \n H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 93- 1380, at 15 (1974)  (emphasis added).  \nSo the conferees intended to exempt some entities in the White House  from  FOIA, \ndespite what § 552(f)(1) says.  Back in the bacchanalian days of judicial idolization of legislative \nhistory, t he Supreme Court relied on this report  to hold that the telephone notes of  an Assistant to \nthe President were not “agency records” under  FOIA.  See Kissinger v. Reporters Comm. for \nFreedom of the Press , 445 U.S. 136, 155–56 (1980) .  The D.C. Circuit joined in, holding that \ncertain  entities in the White House  are not subject to FOIA.  See, e.g. , Rushforth v. Council of \nEcon. Advisers , 762 F.2d 1038, 1040, 1043 (D.C. Cir. 1985) .  Cases like Rushforth apply \nSoucie ’s functional analysi s, asking whether  the entity in the White House  has the “sole \nfunction”  of advising and assisting the President.  See id.  at 1042.  If the answer is yes, it is \nexempt from FOIA.  See id.  at 1043.  Formulated another way, the question is whether an entity \nin the White House  “wield[s] substantial authority independent ly of the President.”  C REW , 566 \nF.3d at  222 (quoting Sweetland v. Walters , 60 F.3d 852, 854 (D.C. Cir. 1995) ).  Under this \nformulation, i f the answer is no, the entity  is exempt from FOIA.  See id.  at 223.   \nThis is  all straightforward enough.  Whatever misgivings the Court may have  about using  \nlegislative histor y, the Court is bound by the higher courts ’ repeated reliance on the conference \nreport the Government identifies.  The D.C. Circuit has  cited that report to hold that not all Case 1:19-cv-02906-TNM   Document 26   Filed 12/03/19   Page 10 of 2311 entities in the White House  are subject to FOIA, despite the plain terms of § 552(f)(1).  So this \nwould be a much different case if the Commission were in the White House .  But  it is not.  See \nGov’t Mem. at 16–19.  \nThe Government instead derive s a much broader principle from  the conference report and  \nthe Soucie  line of cases .  According to the Government , whenever  it would raise separation of \npowers concerns to say that an entity is subject to FOIA, the text of § 552(f)(1) mus t give way .  \nSee id. at 15 –18.  The canon of constitutional avoidance would kick in , and a court would have \nto apply Soucie ’s functional test to determine whether the entity must comply with FOIA.  See \nid.  Here, the Government says, it would raise separation of powers concerns to say that the \nCommission is an “establishment in the executive branch” subject to FOIA.  See id.  at 18 –19.  \nThe Government reasons  that under Soucie ’s functional test, the Commission does not exercise \n“substantial independent authority” and is thus  exempt from  FOIA.   See id.  at 20.  This argument \nfails for many reasons . \nFirst , the Government misunderstands the canon of constitutional avoidance.  It is not a \nlicense to  ignore unambiguous text.  As the Supreme Court has recently reminded us, \n“constitutional avoidance comes into play only when, after the application of ordinary textual analysis, the statute is found to be susceptible of more than one construction.”  Nielsen v. Preap , \n139 S. Ct. 954, 972 (2019) (cleaned up).  “The canon has no application absent ambiguity.”  Id.  \n(cleaned up).  Ambiguity is absent here, see supra  Section III.A, so the canon does not apply.  \nSecond, Energy Research  strongly supports EPIC’s position.  That  decision came in \n1990.  By then, the D.C. Circuit had decided several cases that applied Soucie ’s functional test .  \nSee, e.g., Rushforth, 762 F.2d at 1040–41.  Yet the textual analysis in Energy Research —\nidentical to the textual analysis here —was dispositive .  See 917 F.2d at 582 –83.  The Case 1:19-cv-02906-TNM   Document 26   Filed 12/03/19   Page 11 of 2312 Government insists there was no need for constitutional avoidance in Energy Research  because \nthat case “did not raise any separation of powers issues.”  See Gov’t Reply at 7.  Perhaps, but  that \nis irrelevant.  The statutory text here, like the text at issue in Energy Research , is unambiguous .  \nSo constitutional avoidance does not apply here  either.  See Nielsen , 139 S. Ct. at 972. \nTo be sure, Energy Research  did go on to apply Soucie , but only to note that the same \nresult would obtain under a functional approach.  See 917 F.2d at 584–85.  The court was \nreluctant to apply Soucie  at all.   It noted that doing so would conflict with Crooker v. Office of \nthe Pardon Attorney , 614 F.2d 825 (2d Cir. 1980) .  See 917 F.2d at 584.  Crooker  concluded  that \nthe language in the conference report for the 1974 amendment “applies as a limitation upon \nFOIA coverage only within the Executive Office of the President.”  614 F.2d at 828 (emphasis \nadded).  It expressly rejected the Government’s “attempt[] to apply thi s limitation throughout the \nexecutive branch.”  Id.   Crooker  and Energy Research  dealt with entities not in the White House .  \nSee id. at 827–28; 917 F.2d at 582.  So too here.  The text of § 552(f)(1) is therefore dispositive . \nIn any event , as in Energy Research , the same result  obtains under a functional analysis.  \n“Soucie  itself recognized that an entity in the federal government which ‘investigates, evaluates  \nand recommends’ is an ‘agency.’”  Energy Research , 917 F.2d at 585 (quoting Soucie , 448 F.2d \nat 1073 n.15).  The  Commission “performs precisely these functions.”  Id.  Its mandate is to \nevaluate advances in artificial intelligence, and it must consider many  factors in conducting this \nreview.  See  Pub. L. No. 115- 232, § 1051(a)(1), (b)(1) –(2).  The  Commission has received \nseveral briefings from other government agencies.  See Compl. Ex. H.  Its final report will \nprovide its “full findings and recommendations.”  Id. \nIn the Government’s view, EPIC has conceded that the Commission is not an “agency” \nunder a functional analysis.  See Gov’t Reply at 14–15.  T he Court is not so sure.  True,  EPIC Case 1:19-cv-02906-TNM   Document 26   Filed 12/03/19   Page 12 of 2313 agreed with the Government’s characterization of the Commission as “possess[ing] no \nindependent authority” and “purely advisory in nature.”  EPIC’s Opp’n at 30.  B ut that was part \nof EPIC’s argument for why congressional appointment of the Commission’s members does  not \nviolate the Appointments Clause, U.S. Const. art . II, § 2, cl. 2.  See EPIC’s Opp’n  at 29–30.  \nEPIC never discussed whether the Commission is  an “agency” under a functional test, since it \nargued that this test was irrelevant.  See id.  at 24 –27.   \nIt is also somewhat ironic for the Government  to be insisting that the Commission \npossesses no “independent authority” under Soucie .  Recall that the question is whether an  entity \nexercises  substantial authority independent of the President .  See CREW ., 566 F.3d at 222.  The \nGovernment apparently believes  that the Commission does not  wield this authority.  Yet at the \nsame time , the Government stresses that the President “exerts no control over the Commission’s \nfunctioning.”  Gov’t Mem. at 19. \nAs the functional test is not relevant here, the Court need not press the point more .  \nSuffice it to say that the Commission ’s functions match the functions that were enough for \nEnergy Research  to call  the Nuclear Board an “agency.”   See 917 F.2d at 585. \nThird, the  Government reads far too much into the  Soucie  line of cases .  These cases do \nnot hold that  the functional test applies whenever  imposing FOIA on an entity would raise \nseparation of powers concerns.  They stand for the much narrower proposition that a functional approach is apt when the question is whether an official or entity close to the Presiden t must  \ncomply with FOIA.  “Failure to exempt presidential staff from the FOIA would raise a constitutional issue of separation of powers.”  Ryan v. DOJ , 617 F.2d 781, 788 n.19 (D.C. Cir. \n1980).  The reason is that imposing FOIA’s disclosure obligations on these officials would be “a Case 1:19-cv-02906-TNM   Document 26   Filed 12/03/19   Page 13 of 2314 potentially serious congressional intrusion into the conduct of the President’s daily operations.”  \nJudicial Watch, Inc. v. U.S. Secret Serv., 726 F.3d 208, 226 (D.C. Cir. 2013) .5 \nThat is  what the 1974 conference report is about —the conferees wanted to excuse from \nFOIA “the President’s immediate personal staff or units in the Executive Office whose sole \nfunction is to advise and assist the President.”  H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 93- 1380, at 15.  So the cases \nthat rely on this legislative history apply a functional analysis given  a specific  separation of \npowers concern.   That specific concern is not at issue  here.  T his case does not involve  \npresidential staff or  an entity i n the White House .  Indeed, the Government stresses that the \nCommission is far removed  from the President.  It notes that most of the  Commission’s members \nare congressionally appointed and that the President “exerts no control over the Commission’s \nfunctioning.”  Gov’t Mem. at 19.  The Government believes  it would be problematic  “if the \nCommission were actually located within the executive branch.”  Id. at 18.  \nOn that view , the Commission must be either an agent of Congress or an independent \nagency.  The Government fails to explain why it would violate separation of powers for \nCongress to impose FOIA  on either type of entity.  Nor is any constitutional problem apparent.  \nWhile Co ngress has yet to do so, surely it is free to impose the same transparency requirements \n                                                 \n5  The Government here has not  challenged the application of FOIA to the Executive Branch \nmore generally.  Cf.  William P. Barr, Attorney Gen., U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 19th Annual Barbara \nK. Olson Memorial Lecture  (Nov. 15, 2019), https://www.justice.gov/opa/speech/attorney -\ngeneral -william- p-barr-delivers -19th- annual -barbara -k-olson- memorial- lecture (remarks as \nprepared for delivery) (“[W]e all understand that confidential communications and a private, \ninternal deliberative process are essential for all of our branches of government to properly \nfunction. . . .  Yet Congress has happily created a regim e [under FOIA] that allows the public to \nseek whatever documents it wants from the Executive Branch at the same time that individual congressional committees spend their days trying to publicize the Executive’s internal decisional process.  That process ca nnot function properly if it is public[.]”). Case 1:19-cv-02906-TNM   Document 26   Filed 12/03/19   Page 14 of 2315 on its own agents that it has imposed on the Executive Branch.  And imposing disclosure \nobligations on independent agencies would not intrude on the President’s  daily o perations.  \nFor these reasons , the D.C. Circuit’s decision i n Judicial Watch is distinguishable.  The \nGovernment never describes the facts of this case, but repeatedly cites it for the proposition that \nseparation of powers  always  mandates a functional approach when interpreting FOIA.  See  id. at \n14–17, 19.  A close look reveals a more mode st holding.  \nThe question in Judicial Watch was whether White House visitor logs in the Secret \nService’s possession were “agency records” under  FOIA.  See 726 F.3d at 211.  The  Secret \nService is not in the President’s Executive Office, but t he court held that some of these logs were \nnot agency records —the logs that disclosed “the appointment calendars of the President and his \nclose advisors.”  Id.  One reason for this holding was that documents in the possession of the \nPresident  and his advisers “are excluded from FOIA.”  See id. at 224–25.  That much was clear \nfrom FOIA’s implicit carveout for “the President’s immediate personal staff or units in the \nExecutive Office whose sole function is to advise and assist the President.”  See id.  (quoting \nKissinger , 445 U.S. at 156).  This carveout avoids “render[ing] FOIA a potentially serious \ncongressional intrusion into the conduct of the President’s daily operations.”  Id.  at 226.  \nAllowing plaintiffs to access the President’s appointment calendars simply by targeting the Secret Service would have undermined this legislative scheme.  See id. at 225 –27.  The court \nthought it implausible that Congress intended this loophole.  See id.  at 225.  \nThis case, by contrast, implicates no  loophole.  The Government has not claimed that \nEPIC is trying to use its FOIA request to access  the records of the President or his close advisers.  \nRecall that the Government empha sizes  how the  Comm ission is far removed  from the President.  \nSo the separation of powers concerns in Judicial Watch are irrelevant . Case 1:19-cv-02906-TNM   Document 26   Filed 12/03/19   Page 15 of 2316 The Government insists, however, that the D.C. Circuit has at other times applied \nSoucie ’s functional test to entities not  in the White House .  See  Gov’t Mem. at 16–17; Gov’t \nReply at 12 n.2.  Like Judicial Watch , these cases are all distinguishable, and none of them \nrequires the Court to apply a functional test here.  \nFirst up is the D.C. Circuit ’s holding  in September 1974 that biomedic ine research \npanels, called initial review groups, were not agencies subject to FOIA.  See Wash . Research \nProject, Inc. v. Dep’ t of Health, Educ . & Welfare , 504 F.2d 238, 248 (D.C. Cir. 1974).  The court \napplied Soucie ’s functional test to determine whethe r an initial review group was an “authority of \nthe Government” under  5 U.S.C. § 551(1).  See id.  at 245–48.  This decision came two months \nbefore  Congress amended FOIA to specify that “authority of the Government” included \n“any  . . . establishment in the e xecutive branch.”  See Pub. L. No. 93- 502, 88 Stat. 1561, 1564 \n(Nov. 21, 1974).  So  the court  had no occasion to consider whether a functional analysis is \nnecessary when Congress has said that an entity is an “establishment in the executive branch .”  \nThe G overnment’s reliance on Washington Research Project  is therefore  misplaced . \nAlso misplaced is the Government’s reliance on Dong v. Smithsonian Institution, 125 \nF.3d 877 (D.C. Cir. 1997).  Dong held that the Smithsonian Institution was not an “agency” \nunder the Privacy Act.  Id. at 879.  The Privacy Act “borrows the definition of ‘agency’ found in FOIA, 5 U.S.C. § 552(f).”  Id.  at 878.  T he Smithsonian i s not in the Executive Office, yet the  \ncourt applied Soucie ’s functional approac h.  See id.  at 879, 881.  The court opined, moreover, \nthat the method of appointment for the Smithsonian’s Regents “would appear to violate the Constitution’s separation of powers principles.”   Id. at 879.  From this, the Government contends \nthat a functional approach applies for units  not in  the Executive Office “when separation of Case 1:19-cv-02906-TNM   Document 26   Filed 12/03/19   Page 16 of 2317 powers issues exist.”  Gov’t Mem. at 16, 18–19.  Dong does not stand for that proposition.  \nIndeed, t he Government’s  reading of Dong takes much of its analysis out of context . \nIt helps  to read Dong, as with any opinion, from beginning to end.  The decision began by \nobserving that an “agency” under FOIA and the Privacy Act “encompasses not only all entities covered by § 552(f) but also all those described by § 551(1).”   125 F.3d at 879.  So to be an \n“agency,” an entity “must fit into one  of the categories set forth either in § 552(f ) or § 551(1).”  \nId. (emphasis added).  The court first asked whether the Smithsonian  fit into any  categories in  \n§ 552(f)(1).  Id.   It considered two candidates: “establishment in the executive branch” and \n“Government controlled corporation.”  Id.   But the  Smithsonian was neither .  Id. at 879–80.  \nSeparation of powers was one reason  the Smithsonian was not  an “establishment in the \nexecutive branch.”  See id.  at 879.  Most  members of the Smithsonian’s Board of Regents were \neither congressional appointees or members of Congress.  Id.   The court commented  that this \nmethod of appointing the Regents “would appear to violate the Constitution’s separation of \npowers principles” if  the Smithsonian “were to wield executive powers.”  Id. \nThe Government believes that the same  reasoning applies here , since members of \nCongress appoint most of the Commission’s members.  See Gov’t Mem. at 19.  But Dong is \ndistinguishable on this score.  Co ngress did not specify  whether the Smithsonian was an \n“establishment in the executive branch. ”  See 20 U.S.C. § 41.  So  in answering that question, it \nmade sense for  Dong to consider non- textual factors such as separation of powers .  See  125 F.3d \nat 879.       \nOnly after  concluding that the Smithsonian did not fit into any categories in § 552(f)(1) \ndid the court apply Soucie ’s functional approach.  See 125 F.3d at 880.  It did so to determine \nwhether the Smithsonian was an “authority of the Government” under  § 551(1).  See id.  at 880–Case 1:19-cv-02906-TNM   Document 26   Filed 12/03/19   Page 17 of 2319 The Government next cites  a pair of cases that concluded the Tax Court is not an \n“agency” subject to FOIA.   Gov’t Mem. at 17; s ee Megibow v. Clerk of the U.S. Tax Court , 432 \nF.3d 387, 388 (2d Cir. 2005) (per curiam)  (adopting the reasoning of Megibow v. Clerk of the \nU.S. Tax Court , No. 04 Civ. 3321, 2004 WL 1961591 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 31, 2004) ); Byers v. U.S. \nTax Court , 211 F. Supp. 3d 240 (D.D.C. 2016) .  Megibow  examined the Tax Court’s functions \nand determined that it was a court, rather than an entity in  the E xecutive Branch.  See  No. 04 \nCiv. 3321, 2004 WL 1961591, at *5.  Byers , meanwhile, had the benefit of a  decision that had \ndeemed the Tax Court “part of the Executive Branch” in the context of “ a separation of powers \nanalysis.”  See 211 F. Supp. 3d at 247 (citing Kuretski v. Comm’r , 755 F.3d 929, 943 (D.C. Cir. \n2014) ).  Relying on Kuretski , the plaintiff in Byers  argued that the Tax Court was necessarily an \n“establishment in the executive branch” subject to FOIA.  See id.  at 248.  The court rejected that \nargument.  See id.  \n   Both Megibow  and Byers  are distinguishable .  Those cases dealt with an exception to \nFOIA  for “the courts of the United States.”  5 U.S.C. § 551(1)(B).   As Byers  put it: “If the Tax \nCourt is one of the ‘courts of the United States,’ it must be exempt from FOIA, even if it is part \nof the Executive Branch.”  211 F. Supp. 3d at 248.  The  exception for “courts of the United \nStates” is of course not relevant here.  \nIn sum, an “agency”  subject to FOIA  includes “any  . . . establishment in the executive \nbranch.”  5 U.S.C. § 552(f)(1).  Congress chose to call the Commission  an “establishment in the \nexecutive branch.”  See Pub. L. No. 115 -232, § 1051(a) .  The Government has not  convinced the \nCourt that it should ignore what Congress said.  And even under  the Government’s preferred \nfunctional approach, the  Commission is still s ubject to FOIA.   The Court  thus concludes that the \nCommission must comply with FOIA.  Case 1:19-cv-02906-TNM   Document 26   Filed 12/03/19   Page 19 of 2320 C. \n The Government contends that the Court can dismiss Counts VI and VII at this stage \neven if the Commission is an agency.  See Gov’t Mem. at 12–13.  Recall that  Count VI asserts a \nclaim under FOIA based on the failure of the Commission and DOD to comply with the statute’s \ndeadlines.  Compl. ¶¶ 147–52.  Count VII alleges that the Commission and DOD unlawfully denied expedited processing of EPIC’s FOIA  requests.  Id.  ¶¶ 154–58.  \n To begin, the Court sees nothing procedurally improper with the Government’s choice to \nseek dismissal of Counts VI and VII in the present motion.  The Court observes, however, that \nCounts VI and VII now have little , if any,  practical relevance.  The Government has not  yet \nsought dismissal of Count VIII, which alleges that both the Commission and DOD have \n“wrongfully withheld agency records ” under FOIA.   Id. ¶¶ 160–61.\n7  Since the Commission is an \nagency subject to FOIA, Count VIII against that entity will remain for now .  EPIC’s FOIA \nrequest was the first one  the Commission received, see Tr. of Prelim. Inj. Hr’g at 31, so E PIC’s \nrequest will automatically take precedence, even if  it can not meet the criteria for expedited \nprocessing.  DOD, of course, already has thousands of other pending requests.  Compl. Ex. C.  \nBut the Commission, not DOD, likely has the records  that EPIC wants.  See  Tr. of Prelim. Inj. \nHr’g at 32.  So if this matter proceeds as a standard FOIA case against the Commission under \nCount VIII, EPIC  would be on track to get as much relief as it can, no matter  what the Court \ndoes with Counts VI or VII.  \n1. \n In any event, the Court declines to dismiss either count  now .  Count VI alleges that both \nthe Commission and DOD violated various  statutory deadlines  related to EPIC’s FOIA requests .  \n                                                 \n7 The Government is “separately answering” Count VIII .  Partial Mot. to Dismiss  at 1 n.1.    Case 1:19-cv-02906-TNM   Document 26   Filed 12/03/19   Page 20 of 2321 See Compl. ¶¶ 147–50.  The Government  contends that  the Court should dismiss Count VI \nbecause it is superfluous.  See Gov’t Mem. at 26.  That is, violation of statutory deadlines is “ not \nan independent basis for a claim ,” Roseberry -Andrews v. DHS , 299 F. Supp. 3d 9, 20 (D.D.C. \n2018), but it is merely a reason why  FOIA requesters can sue  in the first place.   See Citizens for \nResponsibility & Ethics in Wash. v. FEC , 711 F.3d 180, 189–90 (D.C. Cir. 2013). \n Since violation of FOIA’s deadlines goes to whether EPIC has exhausted its \nadministrative remedies,  see id., Count VI is intertwined  with the other two FOIA counts, \nincluding the yet -unanswered Count VIII.  Based on  EPIC’s allegations, it appears that the \nCommission and DOD violated at least three deadlines .  DOD did not make a “determination” on \nEPIC’s FOIA request within 20 days.  Compl. ¶¶ 106–07, 149.  After D OD denied EPIC’s \nrequest for expedited processing, it never made a “determination ” on EPIC’s administrative \nappeal of that denial.   Id. ¶¶ 109–10, 150.  And the Commission failed to make a “deter mination ” \non EPIC’s request for expedited processing within ten days .  Id. ¶¶ 95, 97, 148.  Exhaustion of \nadministrative remedies may yet become an issue once the Government answers Count VIII.  So \nthe Court finds  it best to hold off for now disposing of  Count VI .8  If exhaustion does not \nbecome an  issue, the Court will decide at a later point, if necessary, what to do with this count .  \nIf the Government is correct that Count VI provides no independent basis for relief, it has \nnothing to fear from that claim in the meantime .  The Court will not dismiss Count VI now . \n                                                 \n8  One paragraph in Count VI alleges that the Commission failed to make a timely determination \non EPIC’s Septem ber 11 FOIA request.  Compl. ¶  147.  FOIA gives the agency at least 20 days \nto make this determination.  See 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(6)(A)(i) , (a)(6)(B)(i).  But EPIC filed its \nComplaint on September 27, only 16 days  after its September 11 request.   Compl. ¶  95.  Based \non this, the Government contends that the Court may dismiss  as premature “Plaintiff’s claim that \nthe AI Commission did not respond timely to its FOIA request.”  Gov’t Mem. at 12 n.4.  At this \nstage, however, the Court declines to excise paragra ph 147 from Count VI.  EPIC’s rush to the \ncourthouse may or may not be relevant to Count  VIII, but the Government is not currently \nseeking dismissal of Count VIII.  See  Partial Mot. to Dismiss at 1  n.1. Case 1:19-cv-02906-TNM   Document 26   Filed 12/03/19   Page 21 of 2322 2. \nAs to Count VII, the Court holds  that EPIC has stated a plausible claim that DOD and the \nCommission unlawfully denied expedited processing.  A FOIA requester gets expedited  \nprocessing if it “demonstrates a compelling need.”  5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(6)(E)(i)(I).  As relevant \nhere, “compelling need” means “urgency to inform the public concerning actual or alleged Federal Government activity .”  Id. § 552(a)(6)(E)(v)(II).  The Governm ent contends that EPIC  \nfails to establish  this sort of “urgency.”  See Gov’t Mem. at 22–26. \nTo answer this question, “courts must consider at least three factors: (1) whether the \nrequest concerns a matter of current exigency to the American public; (2) w hether the \nconsequences of delaying a response would compromise a significant recognized interest; and (3) whether the request concerns federal government activity.”  Al-Fayed v. CIA , 254 F.3d 300, \n310 (D.C. Cir. 2001).  EPIC has plausibly alleged that its  requests met all three factors.    \nThe third factor  is the most straightforward.  EPIC  sought  records about  the work of the \nCommission, a federal  agency, and  EPIC asserts  the records  are also relevant to action that the \nPresident or Congress may take in response to the Commission’s recommendations.  See Compl. ¶¶ 91, 101.  EPIC has thus plausibly alleged that its requests concerned “federal government activity.”  \nThe Cour t’s conclusion is the same for the  first and second factors .  When EPIC \nrequested expedited processing from DOD in February 2019, the  Commission had not yet \nreleased its initial report, let alone its interim report.   See id. ¶  101.  There was still no interim \nreport when EPIC requested expedited processing from the  Commission in September.  See id.  \n¶ 90.  EPIC claimed that the findings in these reports would affect  government policy.  See id.  \n¶¶ 91, 101.  It was thus  urgent that the public have access t o these reports and related  records, Case 1:19-cv-02906-TNM   Document 26   Filed 12/03/19   Page 22 of 2323 such as briefing materials and minutes from meetings.  See id. ¶¶ 90, 101.  Access would allow  \nEPIC and  the public to understand and critique the Commission’s work .  The Commission will \nsubmit its “full findings and rec ommendations” in August 2020, see  Compl. Ex. I, so if records \nremain out of public view, EPIC and the public  might have little  opportunity to influence the \nCommission’s recommendations . \nEPIC also m akes other allegations that suggest the Commission’s work w as and remains \na matter of “current exigency” and that  delay in receiving records would compromise a \n“significant recognized interest.”  For example,  the President has launched an “American AI \nInitiative” by Executive Order.   See Compl. ¶¶ 35, 101; id. Ex. B at 4 & n.22.  So the \nGovernment itself is prioritizing artificial intelligence.   Yet the Commission  “has operated \nalmost entirely in secret.”  Com pl. ¶ 59.  And EPIC stresses that policy in this area could res hape \nprivacy  and human rights.  Id.  ¶¶ 5, 22–26.  E vidence such as news articles  and other \ncontemporary documents may illuminate whether  EPIC’s FOIA requests meet the “urgency to \ninform” standard.  The Court concludes  only that EPIC  has strung together enough allegations on \nthis score to pass  the plausibility threshold.  The Court thus will not dismiss Count VII.  \nIV. \nFor all these reasons , it is  hereby  \nORDERED that the Government’s [23] Motion to Dismiss FOIA Claims is DENIED . \nSO ORDERED. \n \n \n      \nDated: December  3, 201 9    TREVOR N.
