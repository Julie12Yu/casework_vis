    "summary": "1. **Summary**:\n    The case involves a property dispute between Dutch Girl Plaza LLC and several petroleum companies over contamination of Dutch Girl's property by petroleum products originating from a neighboring gas station. The court partially grants and partially denies the defendants' motion to dismiss, permitting some claims to proceed while dismissing others due to issues such as the statute of limitations and inadequate pleading. AI involvement is noted as the plaintiffs' attorney inadvertently cited non-existent cases in their arguments, attributable to reliance on AI software.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**:\n    The key legal issue centers on whether the defendants are liable for contamination under both federal and state environmental laws despite statutory exceptions for petroleum products, and whether the claims are barred by statutes of limitations.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**:\n    The court dismissed several of Dutch Girl's claims, including their CERCLA and HSAA claims, due to the petroleum exclusion and the statute of limitations, as well as dismissing negligence claims and claims related to Proposition 65 and indemnity due to insufficient factual allegations. However, the court retained claims related to continuing trespass and nuisance.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**:\n    Imagine you spill something on your neighbor's yard, and it makes their plants sick. They want you to clean it up and pay for damages. You argue that it wasn’t illegal to spill what you did and that they've known about the spill for too long without taking legal action. In court, some of their complaints are dismissed because they waited too long to bring them up or didn’t have enough evidence to support them. However, some complaints about ongoing problems with the spill are still valid and need to be addressed. Also, their lawyer used an AI to help write their complaint, and it ended up including some incorrect information.",

ECF No. 21.  The Court will grant the \nmotion in part and deny it in part . \nI. BACKGROUND  \n  For purpose s of resolving the motion to dismiss, the Court accepts as true the allegations in \nthe complaint, ECF No. 1 .  Knievel v. ESPN , 393 F.3d 1068, 1072 (9th Cir. 2005).   Plaintiffs \nDutch Girl Plaza LLC and Steven H. Depper —a member of Dutch Girl —own the lot at 2094 \nMount Diablo Boulevard.  ECF No. 1 ¶  1.  Dutch Girl currently uses the property as an eco -\nfriendly dry -cleaning facility and has gained approvals to transform  the property into a mixed -use \nresidential and commercial development.  Id. ¶ 2.   \nAt 2098 Mount Diablo Boulevard, adjacent to the Dutch Girl lot, is a site owned and \noperated by Defendants for many years as a gas station.  Id. ¶¶ 4–7.  In 1987, when Conoco, Inc. \n(not a defendant here) operated the gas station, a leaking underground storage tank containing \nwaste oil was removed from the site.  Oil, grease, and diesel contamination was identified in the \nsoil, and the unauthorized release of gasoline was also discovered at the site.  Id. ¶ 38.  In 2004, Case 4:25-cv-01390-JST     Document 38     Filed 10/06/25     Page 1 of 16 \n2 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  Defendant Tesoro Companies directed the commission of environmental testing, which found that \nchemicals of concern remained present in the soil and groundwater.  Id. ¶ 43.  In 2007, Plaintiffs \nand Defendants reached an agreement for Defendants to install groundwater monitoring wells on \nthe Dutch Girl property.  At that time, Plaintiffs first learned that contamination from Defendants’ \nproperty had migrated into the Du tch Girl property, including into the groundwater.  Id. ¶ 46.  \nDespite “repeated assurance for over a decade that [Defendants] would address the contamination \nat the Dutch Girl Property, the contamination remains to this day.”  Id. ¶ 57.  Ongoing testing \nshows the continued presence of benzene, naphthalene, ethylbenzene, waste oil, and other \npetroleum products.  Id. ¶ 13.  Around February 26, 2023, Proposition 65 chemicals originating \nfrom Defendants’ site were discovered in the indoor air of the Dutch Girl building and were \ndetermined to pose human health risks by inhalation to workers and tenan ts.  Id. ¶ 55.   \nPlaintiffs fear that “contamination that has migrated from Defendants’ property onto \nPlaintiffs’ Property will be exposed during construction, creating a toxic hazard for both workers \non the Site and for the future residents of the Property,” which ultimat ely “may prevent future \ndevelopment of the Dutch Girl Property .”  Id. ¶ 11.  They filed this action on February 10, 2025 , \nbringing claims for : (1) response costs under the Comprehensive Environmental, Response, \nCompensation, and Liability Act (“CERCLA”), 4 2 U.S.C. §  9607(a); (2) declaratory relief under \nCERCLA; (3) response costs and damages under California’s Carpenter -Presley -Tanner \nHazardous Substances Act (“HSAA”), Cal. Health & Safety Code §§  25300 –25395.45 ; (4) \ndeclaratory relief under the HSAA; (5) continuing trespass; (6) continuing private nuisance; (7) \ncontinuing public nuisance; (8) negligence; (9) negligence per se; (10) common law equitable \nindemnity; (11) express indemnity; (12) declaratory judgment  under state law; (13) injunctive \nrelief under  state law; and (14) violation of California’s Proposition 65.   \nDefendants moved to dismiss on April 4, 2025.  ECF No. 21.  Plaintiffs oppose d the \nmotion, ECF No. 28, and Defendants filed a reply, ECF No. 30.  Plaintiffs subsequently filed \nerrata, acknowledging  that three citations in its opposition referred to “nonexisten t cases” and \nwere the product of an attorney’s “reliance upon artificial intelligence software ,” and requesting \nthat the Court strike the problematic citations.  ECF No. 31.  On June 2, 2025, the Court took this Case 4:25-cv-01390-JST     Document 38     Filed 10/06/25     Page 2 of 16 \n3 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  matter under submission without a hearing.  See Fed. R. Civ. Pro. 78(b); Civ. L.R. 7 -1(b).  \nII. JURISDICTION  \nThe Court has jurisdiction under  28 U.S.C. §  1331 . \nIII. LEGAL STANDARD  \nA complaint must contain “a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the \npleader is entitled to relief.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2).   “Dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) is \nappropriate only where the complaint lacks a cognizable legal theory or sufficient facts to support \na cognizable legal theory.”   Mendiondo v. Centinela Hosp. Med. Ctr ., 521 F.3d 1097, 1104 (9th \nCir. 2008).  A complaint need not contain detailed factual allegations, but facts pleaded by a \nplaintiff “must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level.”  Bell Atl. Corp. v. \nTwombly , 550 U.S. 544, 555  (2007).  “To survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain \nsufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.”  \nAshcroft v. Iqbal , 556 U.S. 662, 678  (2009) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  “A \nclaim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw \nthe reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for  the misconduct alleged.”   Id.  The Court \nmust “accept all factual allegations in the complaint as true and construe the pleadings in the light \nmost favorable to the nonmoving party.”   Knievel , 393 F.3d at 1072.   However, the Court is not \n“required to accept as true allegations that are merely conclusory, unwarranted deductions of fact, \nor unreasonable inferences.”  In re Gilead Scis. Sec. Litig ., 536 F.3d 1049, 1055 (9th Cir. 2008) \n(internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  \nIV. REQUEST S FOR JUDICIAL NOTICE  AND INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE  \n“As a general rule, [courts] ‘may not consider any material beyond the pleadings in ruling \non a Rule 12(b)(6) motion.’”   United States v. Corinthian Colleges , 655 F.3d 984, 998 (9th Cir. \n2011) (quoting Lee v. City of Los Angeles , 250 F.3d 668, 688 (9th Cir. 2001)). “When ‘matters \noutside the pleading are presented to and not excluded by the court,’ the 12(b)(6) motion converts \ninto a motion for summary judgment under Rule 56,” unless those matters satisfy the \n“incorporation -by-reference doctrine” or the standard for “judicial notice under Federal Rule of \nEvidence 201.”   Khoja v. Orexigen Therapeutics, Inc. , 899 F.3d 988, 998 (9th Cir. 2018) (quoting Case 4:25-cv-01390-JST     Document 38     Filed 10/06/25     Page 3 of 16 \n4 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(d)).  The Ninth Circuit has expressed concern with the practice of “exploiting \nthese procedures improperly to defeat what would otherwise constitute adequately stated claims at \nthe pleading stage.”   Id.  The Ninth Circuit also cautioned that “[i]f defendants are permitted to \npresent their own version of the facts at the pleading stage —and district courts accept those facts \nas uncontroverted and true —it becomes near impossible for even the most aggrieved p laintiff to \ndemonstrate a sufficie ntly ‘plausible’ claim for relief.”  Id. at 999.   \n“Judicial notice under Rule 201 permits a court to notice an adjudicative fact if it is ‘not \nsubject to reasonable dispute,’” i.e., the fact “is ‘generally known,’ or ‘can be accurately and \nreadily determined from sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be  questioned.’”  Id. (quoting \nFed. R. Evid. 201(b)).  “Unlike rule -established judicial notice, incorporation -by-reference is a \njudicially created doctrine that treats certain documents as though they are part of the complaint \nitself.”   Id. at 1002.  Docum ents “may be incorporated by reference into a complaint if the plaintiff \nrefers extensively to the document or the document forms the basis of the plaintiff ’s claim,” \nUnited States v. Ritchie , 342 F.3d 903, 908 (9th Cir. 2003), and “the documents’ authenticity . . . is \nnot contested,” Lee, 250 F.3d at 688 (alteration in original) (quotation marks and citation omitted). \n“[T]he mere mention of the existence of a document is insufficient to incorporate the contents of a \ndocument.” Coto Settlement v. Eisenberg , 593 F.3d 1031, 1038 (9th Cir. 2010).  \nA. Defendants’ Requests   \nDefendants request that the Court take judicial notice of “California State Water Resources \nControl Board, GeoTracker Site Profile for Global ID T0601300315, ‘Site Maps / Documents’ \ntab,” lodged  at ECF No. 22 -2.  Because courts regularly take judicial notice of government \ndocuments, and Dutch Girl does  not oppose Defendants’ request , the Court takes judicial notice of \nthe existence of this government webpage , but not the truth of the matters asserted in it.  See Salas \nv. Gomez , No. 14 -CV-01676 -JST, 2016 WL 3971206, at *5 (N.D. Cal. July 25, 2016); see also In \nre Bare Escentuals, Inc. Sec. Lit ig., 745 F. Supp. 2d 1052, 1067 (N.D. Cal. 2010) (explaining that \nthe court “may take judicial notice of the existence of unrelated court documents .  . . it will not \ntake judicial notice of such documents for the truth of the matter asserted therein”).  \nDefendants ask the Court to consider several documents  as incorporated by reference into Case 4:25-cv-01390-JST     Document 38     Filed 10/06/25     Page 4 of 16 \n5 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  the complaint.  ECF No. 21 at 10 n.1.  Exhibit A is a September 7, 2007 , Right of Entry \nAgreement  between Plaintiff Depper and Defendant Tesoro Environmental .  ECF No. 21 -2.  \nExhibit B is a n October 1,  2008 , Right of Entry Agreement between Depper and Tesoro \nEnvironmental .  ECF No. 21 -3.  Exhibit C is a September 27, 2016 Right of Entry Agreement \nbetween Depper and Tesoro Environmental .  ECF No. 21 -4.  Exhibit D is an October 25, 2018 \n“60-Day Notice of Violation under Proposition 65” sent by Depper to Tesor o Refining and \nMarathon Petroleum.  ECF No. 21 -5.  The complaint explicitly references each of these \ndocuments  and describes their contents .  ECF No. 1 ¶¶  47, 49, 69 –70.  Given that , and in the \nabsence of any objection from Dutch Girl, the Court considers these four  documents under the \nincorporation -by-reference doctrine.  \nThe final document, Exhibit E, is a June 24, 2024 “No Further Action Letter with Case \nClosure Summary,” sent by the San Francisco Bay Regional Water Quality Control Board.  ECF \nNo. 21 -6.  While the complaint mentions  that “the Regional Board closed the Site” on June 24, \n2024, ECF No. 1 ¶  55, n.7, the Court rejects Defendants’ contention that this sparse phrase \nincorporates by reference the letter informing Defendant Marathon of the case closure and \ndetailing the reasons supporting the closure.  See Coto Set tlement , 593 F.3d at 1038 (“[T]he mere \nmention of the existence of a document is insufficient to incorporate the contents of a \ndocument.”).   The Court will not consider Defendants’ Exhibit E.   \nB. Plaintiffs’ Request  \nPlaintiffs attach to their opposition a June 6, 2019 Indemnity Agreement signed by Tesoro \nRefining.  ECF No. 28 -2.  The opposition quotes from and relies on this document in response to \nseveral of Defendants’ arguments.  See, e.g. , ECF No. 28 at 13, 18, 22.  But this document is not \npled in the complaint, nor do Plaintiffs ask the Court to take judicial notice of it or deem it \nincorporated by reference in the complaint.  Accordingly, The Court does not rely on it in deciding \nthis motion.  See United States v. Corinthian Colleges , 655 F.3d 984, 998 (9th Cir. 2011).   \n/ / / \n/ / / \n/ / / Case 4:25-cv-01390-JST     Document 38     Filed 10/06/25     Page 5 of 16 \n6 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  V. DISCUSSION  \nA. CERCLA and HSAA Claims  \n1. Petroleum Exclusion  \nDefendants argue that CERCLA’s and HSAA’s petroleum exclusion applies and thus \nDutch Girl does not state a claim for relief on its claims brought under those statutes.  ECF No. 21 \nat 14 –15.  Under the petroleum exclusions, CERCLA’s definition of “pollutant or contaminant” \nand HSAA’s definition of “hazardous substance” each specifically exclude “petroleum,” “crude \noil,” and “natural gas.”  42 U.S.C. §  9601(33); Cal. Health & Safety Code §  78075(b)(1).  Dutch \nGirl contends tha t it pleads the release of “waste  oil” at the site, ECF No. 1 ¶¶ 3, 13, 38, which “is \noften mixed with other contaminants, including solvents . . . such as TCE and PCE.”  ECF No. 28 \nat 10 –11.  Dutch Girl argues  that “subsequent monitoring [at the site] has found contamination \nfrom . . . TCE and PCE,” and “[t]he presence of these chemicals brings this case outside the \npetroleum exclusion.”  Id.   \nThe problem with this argument, as Defendants point out, is that Dutch Girl does not plea d \nthe presence of TCE and PCE in its complaint.  That Dutch Girl pleads the release of waste oil, \nwhich according to its argument in opposition “is often mixed with other contaminants,” is \ninsufficient alone to bring its claims outside the petroleum exclusi ons.  Members of Beede Site \nGroup v. Federal Hom Loan Mortgage Corp. , which Plaintiffs cite for the proposition that “[t] he \naddition of non -petroleum -based solvents r emoves the pollution from the protections offered  by \nthe petroleum exclusion ,” does not help them.  See ECF No. 28 at 10 (citing Beede , 968 F. Supp. \n2d 455, 461 (D.N.H. 2013) ).  In that case, the court found that waste oil was not subject to the \npetroleum exclusion where there was expert evidence that waste oil was likely to contain metals, \nacids, post -refining additives , and other contaminants, but not where plaintiff “ made no showing ” \nthat soil was mixed with anything but petroleum.  Beede , 968 F. Supp. a t 461.  Here , putting aside \nthe argument in Plaintiffs’ opposition, they have not alleged the presence of contaminants that \nwould take this case out of the petroleum exclusion.  \nThe Court accordingly will dismiss the CERCLA and HSAA claims with leave to amend.  Case 4:25-cv-01390-JST     Document 38     Filed 10/06/25     Page 6 of 16 \n7 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  2. CERCLA Statute of Limitations  \nDefendants argue Dutch Girl’s CERCLA claim is barred by the statute of limitations, \nwhich requires that an action for cleanup costs be brought “within 6 years after initiation of \nphysical on -site construction of the remedial action .”  42 U.S.C. §  9613(g)(2)(B) .  The complaint \nalleges that, in 2007, Depper entered into a Right of Entry Agreement with Tesoro Resources to \n“install groundwater monitoring wells to monitor, maintain, sample, and collect water samples . . . \nto determine the scope of the contaminat ion and perform required remediation.”  ECF No. 1 ¶  47.  \nDutch Girl argues that, because the earlier excavations failed to fully resolve the problem, it was \nnot a “permanent” remedy and thus was a “removal action” or investigation —not a “remedial \naction” subject to the statute of limitations.  ECF No. 28 at 11.  This contention is contradicted by \nDutch Girl’s own complaint, which refers to the work done over the course of several years as \n“rem ediation.”  ECF No. 1 ¶¶  2, 6, 47, 49, 51 –53, 57.  The complaint also pleads that the Regional \nBoard closed the site in 2024, id. ¶¶ 55 n.7 —an indication that the measures taken “w[ere] \nintended to be a permanent remedy.”  Carson Harbor Vill., Ltd. v. Unocal Corp. , 287 F. Supp. 2d \n1118, 1158 (C.D. Cal. 2003) .  Accordingly, the Court finds that Dutch Girl has not stated a claim \nfor relief on its CERCLA claim because, on the face of the complaint, the claim falls outside the \nsix-year limitations period.     \n3. HSAA Statute of Limitations  \nThe parties agree a three -year statute of limitations applies to the HSAA claim.  ECF No. \n21 at 18; ECF No. 28 at 12; see Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §  338(b).  Plaintiffs acknowledge that they \n“incurred some  costs before February 2022 ” and in fact that they “learned of some  migration [of \npollutants] in 2007.”  ECF No. 28 at 12 (emphases in original).  But they argue that they relied on \na 2019 Indemnity Agreement in which Defendants “accepted responsibility . . . for the \ninvestigation and remediation” of the site and that Def endants failed to fulfill that agreement, and \nthus the discovery rule applies.  Id. at 12 –13.  Because the 2019 indemnity agreement is n ot \nproperly before the Court, see supra , the Court  will not consider this argument and  thus will \ndismiss Plaintiffs’ HSAA claim with leave to amend.   Case 4:25-cv-01390-JST     Document 38     Filed 10/06/25     Page 7 of 16 \n8 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  B. Continuing Trespass and Continuing Nuisance   \n“[G]enerally the principles governing the permanent of continuing nature of a trespass or \nnuisance are the same.”   Starrh & Starrh Cotton Growers v. Aera Energy LLC , 153 Cal. App. 4th \n583, 594 (2007).  “[T]he key to whether a trespass is permanent . . . or continuing is whether the \ntrespass can be discontinued or abated at a reasonable cost. . . .  [T]here must be evidence that the \ntrespass is reasonably abatable even if the harm caused the trespass continues to interfere with the \npossessory interest of the  property owner .”  Id. at 594.  “Generally, whether a trespass is \ncontinuing or permanent is a question of fact properly submitted to the jury.”  Id. at 597.   \nDefendants argue that Plaintiffs’ continuing trespass and continuing private nuisance \nclaims fail because “the alleged contamination at the Dutch Girl Property is not continuing.”  ECF \nNo. 21 at 18 –19.  For support, they cite only Beck Development Co. v. Southern Pacific \nTransportation Co. , 44 Cal. App. 4th 1160 (1996), arguing that, because the Beck  court relied in \npart on the fact that the Regional Board had determined “nothing further need be done” in \nreaching its conclusion that plaintiff had not proven  a continuing nuisance, id. at 1221 –22, the \nCourt ought to reach the same conclusion here , where the Regional Board issued a case closure .  \nBut Beck  was an appeal of a judgment entered after a full record was developed at trial, and the \nBeck  court underscored that “a too rigid distinction between permanent and continuing nuisances \nmay constitute a trap for the unwary plaintiff who guesses wrong,” and thus, “in doubtful cases the \nplaintiff has an election to treat a nuisance as permanent or co ntinuing.”  Id. at 1217.   \nSince Beck , “courts have consistently adhered to [the] rule that in a case in which the \ndistinction between permanent and continuing nuisance is close or doubtful the plaintiff will be \npermitted to elect  which theory to pursue.”  Capogeannis v. Super. Ct. , 12 Cal. App. 4th 668, 679 \n(1993) (emphasis in original); see id.  at 679 –80 (plaintiff could assert for the first time at summary \njudgment stage that the alleged nuisance was continuing and thus not subject to statute of \nlimitations).  Given the complicated history set forth in the complaint, including several allegedly  \nbotched attempts at remediation  and recurring issues at the site over the course of many years, the \nCourt finds that this is the kind of “close or doubtful” case that might constitute a continuing \ntrespass and continuing nuisance, depending on how the fac ts develop  over the course of the Case 4:25-cv-01390-JST     Document 38     Filed 10/06/25     Page 8 of 16 \n9 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  lawsuit.  Accordingly, the Court declines to dismiss these claims at this early stage.   \nC. Public Nuisance  \n“A public nuisance is one which ‘affects at the same time an entire community or \nneighborhood, or any considerable number of persons.’”   People ex rel. Gallo v. Acuna , 14 Cal. \n4th 1090, 1104 (1997) (quoting Cal. Civ. Code § 3480).  “A private individual may bring an action \nagainst a municipality to abate a public nuisance when the individual suffers harm that is .  . . \nspecially injurious to himself, but not otherwise.” Kempton v. City of Los Angeles , 165 Cal. App. \n4th 1344, 1349 (2008) (internal quotation m arks and citation omitted).   Defendants argue that \nPlaintiffs fail to plead that the alleged nuisance here affects an entire community or neighborhood  \nbecause Plaintiffs’ allegations about groundwater contamination are belied by the Regional \nBoard’s findings in its case closure  report .  ECF No. 21 at 20 –21.  Because th is argument relies \nupon a document the Court has declined to consider , see supra , the Court rejects th e argument.  \nD. Negligence  \nThe parties agree that Plaintiffs’ negligence claim is subject to a three -year statute of \nlimitations.  ECF No. 21 at 21; ECF No. 28 at 18; see Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §  338(b).   Defendants \nargue that the claim is time -barred because the complaint alleges that “Plaintiffs first learned about \nthe contamination” “[i]n or about 2007,” ECF No. 1 ¶  46, at least seven years before Plaintiffs \nfiled this action.  Plaintiff against responds by arguing that a 2019 indemnity agreement, the \nexistence of which is not pled in the complaint, mandates the invocation of the discovery rule here.  \nPlaintiffs thus “request the opportunity to amend” to add allegations regarding the agreement.  \nECF No. 28 at 18.  Accordingly, the Court will dismiss the negligence claim with leave to  amend.  \nE. Negligence Per Se  \n“Where a statutory standard establishes the defendant's duty, ‘proof of the defendant's \nviolation of a statutory standard of conduct raises a presumption of negligence that may be \nrebutted only by evidence establishing a justification or excuse for the statutory violation. ’”  \nSpates v. Dameron Hosp. Assn. , 114 Cal. App. 4th 208, 218, 7 Cal. Rptr. 3d 597, 606 (2003)  \n(quoting Ramirez v. Plough, Inc. , 6 Cal.4th 539, 547 (1993) ).  This rule is known as the doctrine \nof negligence per se.  Id.; see also Cal. Evid .Code § 669  (codifying doctrine) .  Under section 669:  Case 4:25-cv-01390-JST     Document 38     Filed 10/06/25     Page 9 of 16 \n10 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California   \nThe failure of a person to exercise due care is presumed if:  \n \n(1) He violated a statute, ordinance, or regulation of a public entity;  \n \n(2) The violation proximately caused death or injury to person or \nproperty;  \n \n(3) The death or injury resulted from an occurrence of the nature \nwhich the statute, ordinance, or regulation was designed to \nprevent; and  \n \n(4) The person suffering the death or the injury to his person or \nproperty was one of the class of persons for whose protection the \nstatute, ordinance, or regulation was adopted.  \nCal. Evid.  Code § 669(a).    \nPlaintiffs allege that Defendants violated state and federal statutes including California \nHealth and Safety Code sections 25189 and 25189.6 and California Water Code sections 13271 \nand 13304.  ECF No. 1 ¶  130.  Defendants argue that “Plaintiffs fail to explain how any individual \nDefendant’s conduct —or their conduct as a collective —satisfies the necessary elements of each \nstatute or even falls within the statutes’ scope.”  ECF No. 21 at 15 –16.    \nWhere a plaintiff pleads “only a bare allegation that all Defendants violated [several] \nstatutes” and “[t]he Court is left to guess who the activities of [the defendants] violated any of the \nstatutes,” the plaintiff fails to plead a viable negligence claim .  Coppola  v. Smith , 935 F. Supp. 2d \n993, 1032 –33 (E.D. Cal. Mar. 26, 2013).  Here, Plaintiffs only allege summarily that “Defendants’ \ncontinued failure to exercise reasonable care in controlling the release of hazardous substances and \nother contaminants v iolated numerous state and federal statutes, rules and regulations.”  ECF No. \n1 ¶ 130.   While Plaintiffs expand on their theory of how Defendants violated these statutes in their \nopposition, ECF No. 28 at 13 –15, “it is axiomatic that the complaint may not be amended by \nbriefs in opposition to a motion to dismiss.”  Strome v. DBMK Enters., Inc. , No. C 14 -2398 SI, \n2014 WL 4437777, at *4 (N.D. Cal. Sept. 9, 2014) (quoting Barbera v. WMC Mortg. Corp. , C 04 -\n3638 SBA, 2008 WL 167632 (N.D. Cal. Jan. 19, 2006)).   \nThe Court will dismiss Plaintiffs’ negligence per se claim.  \nF. Equitable Indemnity  \n“[T]he elements of a cause of action for equitable indemnity are: (1) a showing of fault on Case 4:25-cv-01390-JST     Document 38     Filed 10/06/25     Page 10 of 16 \n11 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  the part of the indemnitor; and (2) resulting damages to the indemnitee for which the indemnitor is \ncontractually or equitably responsible.”  Star Indem. & Liab. Co. v. Peerless Ins. Co. , No. CV 15 -\n643-JFW (JCx), 2015 3843526, at *5 (C.D. Cal. June 22, 2025) (citing Gouvis Eng. v. Super. Ct. , \n37 Cal. App. Ct. 642, 646 (1995)).  The California Supreme Court “has consistently ruled that a \ncause of action for indemnity does not accrue until the indemnitee suffers loss through payment of \nan adverse judgment or settlement.”  (collecting cases).  City of San Diego v. U.S. Gypsum Co. , 30 \nCal. App. 4th 575, 587 (1994); see id.  at 588 (dismissing equitable indemnity claim where plaintiff \n“admitted . . . that no damages ‘to date’ arise from payment of third party claims or judgments”).  \nDefendants argue that Plaintiffs fail to plead a judgment or settlement that could establish \nan equitably indemnity claim.  Plaintiffs respond by arguing that such a claim “can be asserted \nprospectively once the indemnitee faces potential liability or incu rs costs due to the indemnitor’s \nactions.”  ECF No. 28 at 22.  But the cases Plaintiffs cite are inapposite.  See Valley Circle Estates \nv. VTN Consol., Inc. , 33 Cal. 3d 604, 612 (1983) (allowing prospective indemnity cross claim for \nsubcontractor under specific statutory provision providing for such a claim); Platt v. Coldwell \nBanker Res. Real Est. Servs. , 217 Ca l. App. 3d 1439,  1444 n.7 (1990)  (also discussing crossclaims \nfor indemnity).  The Court finds Plaintiffs have not pled the requisite “adverse judgment or \nsettlement” and thus will dismiss the equitable indemnity claim.   \nG. Express Indemnity  \nDefendants similarly argue that Plaintiffs’ express indemnity claim fails because Plaintiffs \ndo not allege “a current, binding obligation for contractual indemnity between Plaintiffs and any \nof the Defendants.”  ECF No. 21 at 26.  Plaintiffs first argue that the complaint alleges the \nexistence of three agreements  that include indemnity agreements,  ECF No. 1 ¶¶  47, 49, 143, and \nthat Tesoro Resources failed to perform its obligations under those agreements, including \nindemnification.  Id. ¶ 145.  But “[t]o properly plead breach of contract, ‘[t]he complaint must \nidentify the specific provisions of the contract allegedly breached by the defendant.’”  Caraccioli \nv. Facebook, Inc. , 167 F. Supp. 3d 1056, 1064 (N.D. Cal. 2016), aff’d , 700 F. App’x 588 (9th Cir. \n2017) (quoting Donohue v. Apple, Inc. , 871 F. Supp. 2d 913, 930 (N.D. Cal. 2012)).  Plaintiffs do \nnot provide the terms of the contract that they allege Defendants breached, and so the Court cannot Case 4:25-cv-01390-JST     Document 38     Filed 10/06/25     Page 11 of 16 \n12 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  ascertain whether Plaintiffs have stated a claim.  See Langan v. United Servs. Auto. Ass’n , 69 F. \nSupp. 3d 965, 979 –980 (N.D. Cal. 2014) (dismissing a complaint where the court could not \ndiscern what material obligation the defendant breached because the court did not know the terms \nof the contract) .   \nPlaintiffs also argue that the 2019 indemnity agreement provides a basis for their express \nindemnity claim.  ECF No. 28 at 23 –24.  As already discussed, supra , this agreement is not pled in \nthe complaint and thus the Court cannot consider it.  Accordingly, the Court will dismiss the \nexpress indemnity claim.   \nH. Declaratory Judgment  \nBecause declaratory relief is a remedy and not a cause of action, see Lane v. Vitek Real \nEstate Indus. Grp. , 713 F. Supp. 2d 1092, 1104 (E.D. Cal. 2010), when the underlying claims are \ndismissed, the declaratory relief cause of action must be dismissed as well.  Shaterian v. Wells \nFargo Bank, N.A. , 829 F. Supp. 2d 873, 888 (N.D. Cal. 2011).  Here, because the Court denies the \nmotion to dismiss as to Plaintiffs’ private nuisance, public nuisance, and trespass claims, it also \ndenies the request to dismiss Pla intiffs’ request for declaratory relief.  \nI. Injunctive Relief  \n“Injunctive relief is a remedy, not a cause of action .”  City of S. Pasadena v. Dep ’t of \nTransportation , 29 Cal. App. 4th 1280, 1293  (1994) .  Plaintiffs’ freestanding cause of action for \ninjunctive relief is dismissed without prejudice to their seeking that remedy in an amended \ncomplaint in connection with any cause of action that supports it.  Cf. Allen v. City of Sacramento , \n234 Cal. App. 4th 41, 65  (2015)  (“A cause of action must exist before a court may grant a request \nfor injunctive relief. ”).   \nJ. Proposition 65 Claim  \nWith respect to the Proposition 65 claim, Defendants argue that the one -year statute of \nlimitations has expired because Plaintiffs first learned about contamination on the property in 2007  \nand Plaintiffs sent the requisite Proposition 65 notice in 2018 , demonstrating that t hey were aware \nof the alleged contamination .  ECF No. 21 at 29 –30; Cal. Civ. Proc. Code §  340(a).  Defendants \nfurther argue that Plaintiffs only sent the notice to Marathon Petroleum and Tesoro Refining and Case 4:25-cv-01390-JST     Document 38     Filed 10/06/25     Page 12 of 16 \n13 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  thus the claim fails as to the other defendants.  Id. \nPlaintiffs respond that the discovery rule applies  to toll the statute of lim itations.  ECF No. \n28 at 12 –13.  “The discovery rule, when applicable, mandates that accrual of a claim is postponed \nuntil the plaintiff discovers, or has reason to discover, the cause of action.”   Gerling Glob. \nReinsurance Corp. of Am. v. Fremont Gen. Corp. , No. 05-CV-05454 -CAS (PJWX ), 2007 WL \n9757934, at *7 (C.D. Cal. Jan. 10, 2007)  (citation and quotation omitted) , aff’d, 287 F. App ’x 3 \n(9th Cir. 2008) .  “A plaintiff ‘discovers ’ the claim when he or she at least suspects the factual \nbasis, as opposed to the legal theory,  of the claim, i.e., when he or she suspects an injury that was \ncaused by wrongdoing. ”  Id. (citation, quot ation, and ellipsis omitted).  Here, even assuming the \ndiscovery rule applies, it cannot assist Plainti ffs.  The complaint alleges discovery of the \nProposition 65 chemicals in indoor air in February 2023 —more than one year before Plaintiffs \nfiled this action.  ECF No. 28 at 25; ECF No. 1 ¶  55.  Plaintiffs ’ argument is also inconsistent with \ntheir contention that the 2018 notice letter provided the notice required b y Proposition 65 .  ECF \nNo. 28 at 26; Cal. Health & Safety Code §  25249.7(d)(1).  In other words, it is hard to reconcile \nthe fact that Plaintiffs sent a letter in 2018 stating  that Dutch Gi rl “intends to bring suit  . . . for, \namong other claims, violations of California  Health and Safety Code [sections] 25249.5 and \n25249.6 (also known as ‘Proposition 65 ’),” ECF No. 21 -5 at 2, with the argument that Plaintiffs \nlacke d sufficient information to bring suit  before 2025 .   \nWith regard to the adequacy of Plaintiffs ’ Proposition 65 notice, Plaintiffs contend, but do \nnot cite any authority to support, that “Defendants’ challenges to service or technical compliance \nare insufficient for dismissal.”1  Id.  In the absence of any authority suggesting otherwise, the \nCourt finds that: (1) the statute of limitations bars a Proposition 65 claim arising from the facts \nrecited in the 2018 notice; and (2) Plaintiffs have not pled that they provided the notice required \nby California Health and Safety Code section 25249.7(d)(1) for a Proposition 65 claim arising \nwithin the statute of limitations.  The Court will thus dismiss the claim.2 \n \n1 Plaintiffs’ opposition originally did cite a case that purported to support this argument, but that \ncase was later struck as part of Plaintiffs’ errata.  ECF No 31.  \n2 Plaintiffs also cite KFC W., Inc. v. Meghrig , 23 Cal. App. 4th 1167, 1180 –81 (1994)  for the \nproposition that “because pollutants continue to migrate onto  the Dutch Girl Property, such a Case 4:25-cv-01390-JST     Document 38     Filed 10/06/25     Page 13 of 16 \n14 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  K. Equitable Tolling  \nEquitable tolling is a judicially created doctrine “designed to prevent unjust and technical \nforfeitures of the right to a trial on the merits when the purpose of the statute of limitations —\ntimely notice to the defendant of the plaintiff's claims —has been satisfied.”  Fanucci v. Allstate \nIns. Co. , 638 F. Supp. 2d 1125, 1137 (N.D. Cal. 2009) (quoting McDonald v. Antelope Valley \nCmty. Coll. Dist. , 45 Cal. 4th 88, 99 (2008) (internal quotation marks omitted)).  This doctrine can \n“suspend or extend a statute of  limitations as necessary to ensure fundamental practicality and \nfairness.”  Saint Francis Mem’l Hosp. v. State Dep’t of Pub. Health , 9 Cal. 5th 710, 719 (2020) \n(internal citations omitted) (quoting McDonald , 45 Cal.4th at 99).  \n“Federal courts must abide by a state’s tolling rules, which are integrally related to statutes \nof limitations.”  Albano , 634 F.3d at 530.  For equitable tolling to apply under California law, a \nplaintiff must establish: (1) timely notice to the defendant; (2) lack of prejudice to the defendant; \nand (3) reasonable and good faith conduct on the part of the plaintiff.  McDonald , 45 Cal. 4th at \n102.  Finally, because the applicability of equitable tolling often relates to matters outside of a \ncomplaint, it is not “generally amenable to resolution on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion.”  Supermail  \nCargo, Inc. v. United States , 68 F. 3d 1204,  1206  n.2 (9th Cir. 1995)  (citing Cervantes v. City of \nSan Diego , F.3d 1273, 1276 (9th Cir.1993)).  A complaint cannot be dismissed on a Rule 12(b)(6) \nmotion “unless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts that would \nestablish the timeliness of the claim.”   Id. at 1207.  \nDefendants argue that the complaint (1) fails to allege which claims are subject to equitable \ntolling and why, and (2) belies Plaintiffs’ allegations regarding equitable tolling because it alleges \nregular communication between Plaintiffs and Defendants reg arding the contamination at the gas \nstation site since 2000 and that Plaintiffs have known about potential migration onto their property \nsince 2007.  ECF No. 21 at 31 –32.    \nThe complaint alleges that “equitable tolling of the statute of limitations applies” because \n \ncondition gives rise to new (and continuing) violations of  Proposition 65 that . . . defeat statutes of \nlimitations defenses .”  ECF No. 28 at 26.  KFC does not address Proposition 65 claims and is not \nhelpful to Plaintiffs.   Case 4:25-cv-01390-JST     Document 38     Filed 10/06/25     Page 14 of 16 \n15 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  Defendants “failed to take adequate and effective steps to address” contamination on the Dutch \nGirl property , “concealed and omitted relevant facts that would have allowed Plaintiffs to discover \nthe true nature and degree of the soil and groundwater contamination issues ,” and “actively \nmislead Plaintiffs through affirmative representations and omission with respect to the true nature, \nquality, and hazards of the contamination.”   ECF No. 1 ¶  57.  The Court agrees that these \nallegations are too vague and general to support equitable tolling.  See, e.g. , Biotech. Value Fund, \nL.P. v. Celera Corp. , 12 F. Supp. 3d 1194, 1206 (N.D. Cal. 2013) (complaint alleging equitable \ntolling “due to the surreptitious nature of defendants’ misconduct, which defendant concealed \nfrom plaintiffs and other investors throughout the relevant period” was insufficient).  It is true that \nthe complaint sets forth a lengthy and complicated history of interactions between Plaintiffs and \nDefendants, and prom ises by Defendants to investigate , monitor,  and remediate migration of \npollutants onto the Dutch Girl property , and u nder these circumstances, it is conceivable  that \nPlaintiffs “could not have discovered the alleged violations by exercising reasonable diligence,” \nand that Defendants in the meantime had notice of the facts giving rise to Plaintiffs’ eventual \nclaims.  Rosenfeld v. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. , 732 F. Supp. 2d 952, 964 (N.D. Cal. 2010).  \nBut the Court finds that, as currently pled, Plaintiffs fa il to “nudge[]” their equitable tolling \nallegations across the line from conceivable to plausible.”  Twombly , 550 U.S. at 547.   \nL. Punitive Damages  \nUnder California’s damage statute, a corporate employer is liable for punitive damages \n“based upon acts of an employee” only if:  \n \nthe employer had advance knowledge of the unfitness of the employee \nand employed him or her with a conscious disregard of the rights or \nsafety of others or authorized or ratified the wrongful conduct for \nwhich the damages are awarded or was personally guil ty of \noppression, fraud, or malice.  With respect to a corporate employer, \nthe advance knowledge and conscious disregard, authorization, \nratification or act of oppression, fraud, or malice must be on the part  \nof an officer, director, or managing agent of the corporation.  \n \nCal. Civ. Code §  3294(b).  “[T]he punitive damage statute requires proof of malice among \ncorporate leaders: the ‘officer[s], director[s], or managing agent[s].’”  Cruz v. Homebase , 83 Cal. \nApp. 4th 160, 167 (2000) (quoting Cal. Civ. Code §  3294(b)).  But w hile the Court applies Case 4:25-cv-01390-JST     Document 38     Filed 10/06/25     Page 15 of 16 \n16 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  California substantive law to a claim for punitive damages, “the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure \ngovern the punitive damages claim procedurally with respect to the adequacy of the pleadings.”  \nTerpin v. AT&T Mobility LLC , 118 F.4th 1102, 1112 (9th Ci r. 2024).  “In federal court, a plaintiff \nmay include a ‘short and plain’ prayer for punitive damages that relies entirely on unsupported and \nconclusory averments of malice or fraudulent intent.”  Clark v. Allstate Ins. Co. , 105 F. Supp. 2d \n1016, 1019 (S.D. Cal. July 27, 2000).   \nHere, however, Plaintiffs do not even make the requisite “conclusory averments” of \noppression, malice, or fraud.  In fact, the complaint’s only mention of punitive damages comes in \nthe prayer for relief, where Plaintiffs request a judgment “[f]or punitive damages and exemplary \ndamages against all Defendants.”  ECF No. 1 at 32.  This fails to satisfy even the low bar \nnecessary to plead a plausible entitlement to punitive damages and consequently will dismiss the \nrequest for punitive damages.  \nCONCLUSION  \nFor the foregoing reasons, the Courts grants the motion in part and dismisses Plaintiffs’ \nclaims for CERCLA  violations , HSAA  violations , negligence, negligence per se, equitable \nindemnity, express indemnity, Proposition 65  violations , and punitive damages .  The Court denies \nthe motion as to Plaintiffs’ claims for continuing trespass, continuing private nuisance, continuing \npublic nuisance, declaratory judgment, and injunctive relief.       \nThe Court grants leave to amend.  Plaintiffs may file an amended complaint within 28 days \nsolely to correct the deficiencies identified in this order.  \nThe case management confer ence s chedul ed for October 7, 2025 is contin ued to Decemb er \n9, 2025 at 2:00 p.m.  An updated joint case management statement is due Dec ember 2, 2025 .   \nIT IS SO ORDERED.  \nDated:   October 6, 2025  \n______________________________________  \nJON S.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: Ismael Martinez sued Foremost Insurance claiming inadequate compensation for hail and wind damage to his property, totaling $122,971.17, against which Foremost only paid $3,178.41. The court granted Foremost's motion for partial summary judgment on Martinez's bad-faith claim, as Martinez failed to demonstrate that Foremost lacked a reasonable basis for its insurance payment, which was based on the Actual Cash Value of the damages and Foremost's reliance on an engineering report. This case does not involve AI, ML, or automated systems directly in its facts or claims.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: The key legal issue is whether Foremost Insurance breached its contract and acted in bad faith by undercompensating Martinez for property damages under their insurance policy.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court granted summary judgment in favor of Foremost on the bad-faith claim, finding no evidence of bad faith in Foremost's payment decision. However, the court did not grant summary judgment on the breach of contract claim, as Foremost's motion did not provide sufficient basis for such relief, leaving that aspect of the case unresolved.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Ismael Martinez's house was damaged, and he thought his insurance should pay him more to fix it. The insurance company, Foremost, said they paid the right amount based on their calculations and expert advice. The judge agreed that the insurance company didn't do anything wrong on purpose (bad faith) but didn't make a decision yet about whether the insurance deal they made with Ismael was followed correctly (breach of contract). The judge also told Ismael to explain why he hasn’t been following court rules or else the rest of his case might be dismissed.",
    "full_text": "IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF NEBRASKA  \n \nISMAEL MARTINEZ,  \n \nPlaintiff,  \n \n v.  \n \nFOREMOST INSURANCE COMPANY ,  \n \nDefendant.   \n \n8:24CV15  \n \n \nMEMORANDUM  \nAND ORDER  \n  \nPlaintiff Ismael Martinez (“Martinez”) brought this lawsuit (Filing No. 1-1) against \ndefendant Foremost Insurance Company (“Foremost”) in the District Court of Douglas \nCounty, Nebraska, on December 4, 2023.  Martinez alleges that his home in Omaha, \nNebraska (the “property”), was severely damaged by hail and wind on August 7, 2021.  Despite purportedly being covered by an insurance policy issued by Foremost (the \n“policy”), Martinez reports the company has only paid $3,178.41 of his $122,971.17 in \ntotal losses incurred from the property damage.   His complaint asserts claims for breach of \ncontract and bad faith under Nebraska law .  See Neb. Rev. Stat. § 44- 1540.  \nOn January 16, 2024, Foremost removed the case to this Court (Filing No. 1) on the \nbasis of complete diversity between the parties.  See 28 U.S.C. §§ 1332(a), 1441(b).  It \nanswered (Filing No. 2) the complaint that same day.  The parties engaged in discovery for \nthe next year or so.  \nNow before the Court is Foremost’s Motion for Partial Summary Judgment (Filing \nNo. 15).  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a).  Foremost seeks an order granting partial summary \njudgment on all of Martinez’s claims that “seek[] coverage in excess of Actual Cash Value” \nas defined in the policy.  It relatedly asserts it is entitled to summary judgment on Martinez’s bad- faith claim because it issued payment “on an Actual Cash Value basis” and \ntherefore had a “good faith basis” in making its determinations .  In support, Foremost has 8:24-cv-00015-RFR-MDN     Doc # 22     Filed: 07/07/25     Page 1 of 9 - Page ID #\n<pageID>2 \n submitted a brief (Filing No. 16) containing its legal argument and statement of undisputed \nfacts and an index of exhibits (Filing No. 17).1 \nThree months have passed, and Martinez has failed to respond in any way to \nForemost’s motion.  See NECivR 7.1(b)(1)(B) (giving an opposing party 21 days to \nrespond to a motion for summary judgment), 56.1(b)(3) (same).  On April 9, 2025, Martinez’s attorneys moved to withdraw from the case (Filing No. 19), citing his repeated failure “to timely and fully respond to communications.”  See NEGenR 1.3(f).  The last \ntime they heard from Martinez was January 11, 2024.   \nThe magistrate judge granted their motion to withdraw on April 10.  In his Order \n(Filing No. 20), the magistrate judge told Martinez that he could retain substitute counsel but would be “deemed to be proceeding pro se ” upon submission of proof of service of the \nOrder.  He also informed Martinez that he was responsible for keeping the Court informed of his contact information and complying with the progression deadlines, rules, and orders \nof the Court.  Finally, the magistrate judge extended the deadline for him to file a response \nto Foremost’s pending motion and warned him “that failure to file a” timely response would \npreclude him “‘from contesting [Foremost’s] statement of facts.’”  See NECivR \n7.1(b)(1)(C). \nMartinez’s former counsel filed a Notice of Service (Filing No. 21) reporting that \nthey sent notice of the magistrate judge’s Order to Martinez by mail on April 15.  Still, the Court has not heard from Martinez .  Having given him more than ample time to respond, \nthe Court now addresses Foremost’s unopposed Motion for Partial Summary Judgment. \n \n1Those submissions fail to comply with the local rules in multiple respects.  See \nNECivR 7.1(d)(4) (requiring briefs be accompanied by certificates of compliance with the \nCourt’s rules on word limits and generative artificial intelligence), 56.1(a)(3) (“The \nstatement of material facts must describe the parties and recite all facts supporting the \ncourt’ s venue and jurisdiction. The statement must not contain legal conclusions.”), (4) \n(“The statement of material facts shall be filed in a separate document from the motion for summary judgment and brief in support of the motion.”). 8:24-cv-00015-RFR-MDN     Doc # 22     Filed: 07/07/25     Page 2 of 9 - Page ID #\n<pageID>3 \n I. BACKGROUND  \nThe facts available to the Court on this motion are sparse.  They are derived in part \nfrom Foremost’s curt Statement of Undisputed Facts, which provides a less than full picture \nof the circumstances underlying the parties’ dispute.  For purposes of this motion, those \nfacts that are properly supported by citations to the record are deemed undisputed given \nMartinez’s failure to respond to them in any way.  See NECivR 7.1(b)(1)(C) (“Failure to \nfile an opposing brief . . . precludes the opposing party from contesting the moving party’ s \nstatement of facts.”).  \nForemost is an insurance company based in Michigan.  In 2021, it issued a policy \n(Filing No. 17- 3) to Martinez for the property.  The policy’s coverage began on May 4, \n2021, and ended on May 4, 2022.  Under the terms of the policy, if a “total loss” of the \nproperty were to occur —which is defined as an event rendering the “dwelling [] damaged \nbeyond reasonable repair”—the covered “loss [would] be equal to the Amount of \nInsurance” on the Declarations Page.  For Martinez’s property , that amount was $102,549 \n(the “Amount of Insurance”).  \nThe policy also provided payment methods for damages  resulting in partial losses \nto the dwelling and losses to the property’s roof.  Under the “Scheduled Roof Payment \nMethod,” Foremost agreed to pay the lowest of (1) “[t]he scheduled roof payment,” \n(2) “[t]he amount required to repair or replace the damaged component parts of [the] roof \nmaterials,” or (3) the Amount of Insurance.  The policy further defines the “scheduled roof \npayment” as “all the estimated reasonable costs to repair or replace insured loss of or damage to any roof materials multiplied by the scheduled roof payment percentage” listed in a chart attached to the policy.   \nIn the event of partial losses  to the dwelling, the policy limited  coverage to an \n“Actual Cash Value Payment Method.”  In that case, Foremost would only pay “the lowest \nof” (1) “[t]he actual cash value of the lost or damaged component parts of [the] dwelling 8:24-cv-00015-RFR-MDN     Doc # 22     Filed: 07/07/25     Page 3 of 9 - Page ID #\n<pageID>4 \n at the time of the loss,” (2) “[t]he amount required to repair or replace the lost or damaged \ncomponent parts of [the] dwelling,” or (3) the Amount of Insurance.  \n“Actual cash value” is defined as “the amount it would cost to repair or replace \ninsured property with new property of like kind and quality , less allowance for physical \ndeterioration, depreciation, and obsolescence.”   By the policy’s terms, it does not include \n“amounts for contractor’s fees or charges for overhead and profit” unless those fees and charges “are reasonable and incurred.”  For purposes of “loss to roof materials, the \nscheduled roof payment is deemed to be and will determine the actual cash value of the \nloss.”  \nMartinez’s complaint alleges his property “suffered severe hail and wind damage on \nAugust 7, 2021,” at which time it “was valued at $100,100.00 by the Douglas County \nAssessor’s Office.”  He asserts he has incurred $122,971.17 in damages from the “total \nloss” of his property.  His allegations provide no other details of the nature of those \ndamages, and —given his failure to respond —there is little else the Court has to go off in \nterms of how he believes his property was impacted.  \nFor its part, Foremost states it relied on an October 3, 2022, report by Donan \nEngineering (Filing No. 17-5) in assessing the damage to the property.  That report \ndescribes Donan Engineering’s observations from a September 22, 2022, site-visit to the \nproperty.  In addition to its engineers, Martinez’s spouse  and a public adjuster were present \nduring the inspection.  The engineers took photographs and attached them to the report.  \nDonan Engineering concluded that “hail up to 1 inch in diameter [had] fallen” at the \nsite of the property , causing damage to the roof shingles.  It also found that a couple of \nshingles were “torn in a manner consistent with strong winds.”  It disagreed, however, with \nMartinez’s claim that the hail damage caused water intrusion resulting in damage to the interior of the property.  In Donan Engineering’s opinion, that water damage was “the result 8:24-cv-00015-RFR-MDN     Doc # 22     Filed: 07/07/25     Page 4 of 9 - Page ID #\n<pageID>5 \n of the gap in the roof’s chimney flashing” which had been developing for years.  It also \nconcluded the property’s siding was not damaged by the hail.  \nIn its October 19, 2022, estimate (Filing No. 17-4), Foremost stated it evaluated  the \nproperty’s damage “based upon the findings of Donan Engineering,” and made an estimate based on “the Actual Cash Value of [his] claim.”  Much of the estimated damages arose from the property’s roof.  Foremost applied a 46.6% depreciation rate to the cost of roof repairs, greatly diminishing the “Replacement Cost Value” of $11,559.25.  In total, the Actual Cash Value of the claim was calculated at $6,436.44.  After deducting a previous \n$2,258.03 payment and Martinez’s $1,000 deductible, Foremost decided it owed him only \n$3,178.41.  \nForemost avers it “has paid all money due and payable under” the policy.  It further \nasserts that it “had a good faith basis in reaching its determinations” on Martinez’s claim \nbecause it relied on Donan Engineering ’s report and its  own estimate in concluding what \ncovered losses Martinez incurred.   On those bases, it argues partial summary judgment is \nwarranted.  \nII. DISCUSSION  \n A. Standard of Review  \nUnder Rule 56(a), a party may move for summary judgment “as to an entire case[,] \n. . . claim,  defense, or part of a claim or defense.”  Fed R. Civ. P. 56 Advisory Committee \nNotes, 2010 Amendment; see also Hotel 71 Mezz Lender LLC v. Nat’l Retirement Fund, \n778 F.3d 593, 606 (7th Cir. 2015) (explaining  “[n]othing in Rule 56 demands an all-or -\nnothing approach” and that “a party may seek summary judgment as to a limited portion \nof its case”).  “Summary judgment is [required] ‘if the movant shows that there is no \ngenuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter \nof law.’”  Whittington v. Tyson Foods, Inc., 21 F.4th 997, 1000 (8th Cir. 2021) (quoting \nFed. R. Civ. P. 56(a)).   8:24-cv-00015-RFR-MDN     Doc # 22     Filed: 07/07/25     Page 5 of 9 - Page ID #\n<pageID>6 \n “The movant bears the initial responsibility of informing the district court of the \nbasis for its motion and must identify the portions of the record that it believes demonstrate \nthe absence of a genuine dispute of material fact.”  Bedford v. Doe, 880 F.3d 993, 996 (8th Cir. 2018); see also Torgerson v. City of Rochester, 643 F.3d 1031, 1042 (8th Cir. 2011) (en \nbanc).  It “can satisfy its burden in either of two ways: it can produce evidence negating an \nessential element of the nonmoving party’ s case, or it can show that the nonmoving party \ndoes not have enough evidence of an essential element of its claim to carry its ultimate burden of persuasion at trial.”  Bedford, 880 F.3d at 996; accord Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, \n477 U.S. 317, 325 (1986).   \nIf the movant makes this showing, the nonmovant must submit evidence “of specific \nfacts showing the presence of a genuine issue for trial” to prevent summary judgment.  Bedford, 880 F.3d at 997.  A genuine issue for trial exists when the nonmovant “present[s] enough evidence that a jury could reasonably find in his favor.”  Id.; see also Torgerson, \n643 F.3d at 1052 (explaining the fact in dispute must be “material to the outcome of the case” to preclude summary judgment).   \n B. Analysis\n2 \nForemost first asks the Court to “declar[e] that [Martinez] is only entitled to \npayment from Foremost for Actual Cash Value[ ] and for such other and further relief as \nthe Court deems just and equitable.”  Its motion fails to justify such relief. \n“An insurance policy is a contract between the insurer and the insured, whose \nrespective rights and obligations must be determined by contract principles.”  Rose v. Am. \nFamily Ins., 995 N.W.2d 650, 653 (Neb. 2023).  Under Nebraska law, “[t]he interpretation \nof a contract and whether the contract is ambiguous are questions of law .”  Avis Rent A Car \nSys., Inc. v. McDavid, 984 N.W.2d 632, 635 (Neb. 2023).   A contract “must be construed \n \n2Foremost applies Nebraska law in its argument for summary judgment.  Given that, \nand the lack of any indication that some other law governs Martinez’s claims, the Court \nfollows suit.   8:24-cv-00015-RFR-MDN     Doc # 22     Filed: 07/07/25     Page 6 of 9 - Page ID #\n<pageID>7 \n . . . to give effect to the parties’ intentions. ”  Rose, 995 N.W.2d at 653.   When its terms “are \nclear, a court may not resort to rules of construction, and the terms are accorded their plain \nand ordinary meaning as an ordinary or reasonable person would understand them.”  Seemann v. Seemann, 18 N.W.3d 118, 126 (Neb. 2025).  \nThe only fact statement Foremost provides to support its request for partial summary \njudgment on Martinez’s breach-of-contract claim is the following: “ The Policy provides \ncoverage on an Actual Cash Value only  [sic].”   It’s not entirely clear what that means.  As \nwritten, that statement seems to be a legal conclusion regarding the general scope of the \npolicy’s coverage  that may not entirely accord with the terms of the policy itself.  At least \nin cases of total loss, the payment owed under the policy is not  limited to an Actual Cash \nValue of repairs but is equal to the policy’s Amount of Insurance —$102,549.   \nWhile it seems improbable that the property suffered a total loss, Foremost’s \nbarebones brief and statement of facts provide little to no factual context for the Court to be certain that Martinez’s claim only  entitled him to  payment based on the Actual Cash  \nValue of the loss.  See Johnson v. Charps Welding & Fabricating, Inc., 950 F.3d 510, 524 \n(8th Cir. 2020) (explaining courts “will not mine a summary judgment record” for facts to “gild a party’s arguments” (quoting Rodgers v. City of Des Moines, 435 F.3d 904, 908 (8th Cir. 2006))).  Simply put, Foremost has failed to meet its burden to justify the entry of \nsummary judgment on this limited record.  See Spann v. Lombardi, 960 F.3d 1085, 1088 \n(8th Cir. 2020) (explaining that “a district court does not abuse its discretion by declining to address an argument for summary judgment that is not properly briefed”); Loc. No. 499, \nBd. of Trs. of Shopmen’s Pension Plan v. Art Iron, Inc., 117 F.4th 923,  933 (6th Cir. 2024) \n(“The movant ‘always bears the burden of demonstrating the absence of a genuine issue as \nto a material fact’  and bears this burden ‘regardless if an adverse party fails to respond.’” \n(quoting Carver v. Bunch, 946 F.2d 451, 455 (6th Cir. 1991))).  \nForemost fares better with respect to Martinez’s bad-faith claim.  To establish a \nclaim for bad faith under Nebraska law, Martinez “must show the absence of a reasonable 8:24-cv-00015-RFR-MDN     Doc # 22     Filed: 07/07/25     Page 7 of 9 - Page ID #\n<pageID>8 \n basis for denying benefits of the insurance policy and the defendant’ s knowledge or \nreckless disregard of the lack of a reasonable basis for denying the claim.”  Merrick v. \nFischer, Rounds & Assocs., 939 N.W.2d 795, 807 (Neb. 2020); accord Hayes v. Metro. \nProp. & Cas. Ins., 908 F.3d 370, 374 (8th Cir. 2018).  Based on Foremost’s statement of \nfacts, it is undisputed for purposes of this motion that “Foremost had a good faith basis in \nreaching its determinations as to the amount of covered payable loss” on Martinez’s claim \ndue to its reliance on Donan Engineering’s report and the estimate completed by its agent.  Without a response from Martinez demonstrating a genuine factual dispute, that dissipates \nany claim that Foremost had “no reasonable basis for denying” any part of his  claim.  \nHayes, 908 F.3d at 374.  Even if their calculations and payments somehow missed the mark, \nthere is no evidence that they were made in bad faith.  See Braesch v. Union Ins., 464 \nN.W.2d 769, 777-78 (Neb. 1991) (explaining a claim for bad faith only arises from intentional or reckless conduct, not mere negligence).  \nFor those reasons, the Court concludes summary judgment is appropriate as to \nMartinez’s bad-faith claim but not his breach- of-contract claim.  Because of his apparent \nfailure to participate in this litigation in any meaningful way over the past several months \ndespite the Court’s notices and warnings, Martinez is ordered to show cause why the \nremainder of his complaint should not be dismissed for failure to prosecute.  See Fed. R. \nCiv. P . 41(b); NECivR 41.2 (“ At any time, after appropriate notice, a case not being \nprosecuted with reasonable diligence may be dismissed for lack of prosecution.”); Ackra \nDirect Marketing Corp. v. Fingerhut Corp., 86 F.3d 852, 856-57 (8th Cir. 1996) (“[P]ro se  \nrepresentation does not excuse a party from complying with a court’ s orders and with the \nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure.”).  His failure to timely comply with that order may result \nin the dismissal of this case without further notice.  Accordingly,  \nIT IS ORDERED:  \n1. Defendant Foremost Insurance Company’s Motion for Partial Summary \nJudgment (Filing No. 15) is granted in part and denied in part.  8:24-cv-00015-RFR-MDN     Doc # 22     Filed: 07/07/25     Page 8 of 9 - Page ID #\n<pageID>9 \n 2. Plaintiff Ismael Martinez’s bad-faith claim (Filing No. 1-1) is dismissed with \nprejudice.  Foremost’s request for partial summary judgment is denied in all \nother respects.  \n3. On or before July 25, 2025, Martinez must show cause why the rest of his complaint should not be dismissed for failure to diligently prosecute this \ncase.  \n  \n Dated this 7th day of July 2025.  \n \nBY THE COURT:  \n \n \n \nRobert F.

    "summary": "1. **Summary:** The court denied Linwei Ding's motion to dismiss charges of stealing trade secrets to benefit a foreign government, specifically the People's Republic of China (PRC). The prosecution argued that Ding's AI company activities, aligning with PRC policies, indicated intent to benefit the PRC, while the court emphasized that the statute requires intent or knowledge of benefitting a foreign government without mandating direct evidence or participation of any foreign government.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue:** Whether the indictment sufficiently alleges that Ding intended to benefit the PRC through the theft of trade secrets, as required under 18 U.S.C. § 1831, even without direct evidence of coordination with the PRC government.\n\n3. **Court's Holding:** The court held that the indictment sufficiently alleged Ding's intent to benefit the PRC, as required by § 1831, through his AI company’s dealings with PRC entities. Thus, the motion to dismiss the charges was denied, allowing the case to proceed.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation:** In this case, a guy named Ding was accused of taking secret business information to help China. The law doesn't need proof that China asked for this help, just that Ding intended for China to benefit. The court said there’s enough reason to believe Ding might have intended to help China, so the case will continue in court.",
    "full_text": " \n \n \nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT  \nNORTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA  \n \nUSA , \nPlaintiff , \nv. \n \nLINWEI DING , \nDefendant . \n Case No.   24-cr-00141 -VC-1    \n \n \nORDER DENYING MOTION TO \nDISMISS AND MOTION FOR BILL \nOF PARTICULARS  \nRe: Dkt. Nos. 54, 63  \n \n \nThe motion to dismiss is denied.  \nFirst, there is no requirement in section 1831 that the foreign government have sponsored \nor coordinated the trade secret theft. The inclusion of the word “espionage” in section 1831’s \ntitle does not change the fact that the text requires no such government inter action. See also \nUnited States v. Chung , 659 F.3d 815, 828 (9th Cir. 2011)  (noting that a conviction under section \n1831 does not “ require [] evidence of a foreign government ’s direction or control ” but instead can \nrest solely on the defendant’s intent to benefit a foreign government).  \nSecond , Ding’s argument that the word “benefit” as used in section 1831 must mean \ndisclosure of the stolen trade secret is not supported by the text. As an initial matter, the statute \nonly speaks of an intent or knowledge that the trade secret theft will benefit the foreign \ngovernment, with no textual guardrails on the definition of “benefit.” The legislative history \nsupports a broader reading of “benef it,” noting that a benefit could also be reputational, strategic, \nor tactical.  H.R. R ep. 104 -788 at 11 (1996) (“ Rather, the government need only prove that the \nactor intended that his actions in copying or otherwi se controlling the trade secret would benefit \nthe foreign government, instrumentality, or agent in any way. Therefore, in this circumstance, Case 3:24-cr-00141-VC     Document 105     Filed 06/11/25     Page 1 of 3 \n2 benefit means not only an economic benefit but also reputational, strategic, or tactical benefit. ”). \nThis is  especially  apparent when comparing section 1832, which requires proof of an intent to \n“economically benefit,” with section 1831, which only requires intent or knowledge that the \ntrade secret theft will “benefit” a foreign government. Compare 18 U.S.C. §  1831(a) (“ Whoever, \nintending or knowing that the offense will benefit  any foreign government  . . .” (emphasis \nadded)) with id. § 1832(a) (“ Whoever, w ith intent to convert a trade secret,  . . . to the economic \nbenefit  of anyone other than the owner thereof  . . .” (emphasis added)).  \nDing’s next argument, that the indictment does not sufficiently allege Ding’s intent or \nknowledge to benefit the P eople’s Republic of China (PRC) , also fails. The government has three \nprimary theories for proof of Ding’s intent or knowledge to benefit the PRC : (1) in his marketing \nmaterials for his artificial intelligence (AI)  company, Ding circulated a PowerPoint citing PRC \nnational policies encouraging the development of domestic AI, (2)  Ding applied to a PRC talent \nprogram, programs that  are typically sponsored by the PRC to encourage companies to move  to \nthe PRC and  through which the PRC  pays for research, labs, etc. to incentivize th at move, and \n(3) an internal memo  for Ding’s company  noted that the  company  was marketing  to and in \ncommunications with public universities and municipal governments for those entities to engage \nthe company’s services. Superseding Indictment ¶¶  24–26. Certainly the third  theory , which  \nalleges Ding’s i ntent to directly provide a service to a government entity, would satisfy section \n1831 , so the motion to dismiss must be denied .  \nThe Court is somewhat skeptical of the government’s first two theories. The idea, \napparently, is that Ding knew about the PRC’s  AI initiatives and intended to benefit the PRC by \nfilling the gap identified by the PRC  and so help the PRC achieve its domestic AI goals . The idea \nthat Ding actually intended to benefit the PRC, as opposed to benefiting himself through an \nopportunity PRC was providing, seems dub ious. And at times, it seems as if  the government is \nreading  out of section 1831 the word “government” and is asking the Court to apply the statute to \nanyone who intends or knows that the trade secret theft  will benefit a foreign country . For \nexample, the government argues that  an actor who steals a trade secret and creates a company to Case 3:24-cr-00141-VC     Document 105     Filed 06/11/25     Page 2 of 3 \n3 \ntake advantage of a favorable regulatory environment, knowing that a foreign government has \ncreated a favorable regulatory environment, would face liability under section 1831. But in that \ncase, it’s not clear that the actor intends or knows that taking advantage of this favorable \nenvironment will benefit  a foreign government , based solely on the actor’s knowledge  that a \nfavorable regulatory environment has been  created by that foreign government. The first two \ntheories will only work if the government proves that Ding intended or knew that his trade secret \ntheft would benefit the PRC —not solely China as a country or Ding’s own economic interests .  \nFor similar reasons , and as discussed at the hearing , Ding’s motion for a bill of \nparticulars is denied. While the indictment does not list the specific government actors to which  \nDing’s company is alleged to have marketed its services, the government has provided the \ncompany memo listing those entities. And while Ding argues that the government has not alleged \na link between Ding’s trade secret theft and the use of the trade secre ts at Ding’s AI company, \nthe government does allege that Ding stole the trade  secrets and intended that theft to benefit the \nPRC through  the creation and services  of Ding’s company . That is sufficient to put Ding on \nnotice of the theories of liability the government intends to present at trial.  \nIT IS SO ORDERED.  \nDated:  June 9, 2025  \n______________________________________  \nVINCE CHHABRIA  \nUnited States District Judge  \n Case 3:24-cr-00141-VC     Document 105     Filed 06/11/25     Page 3 of 3",

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: The court case involves challenges to Georgia's current statewide electronic voting system, focusing on its cybersecurity vulnerabilities and the alleged burden it places on the constitutional rights of voters under the First and Fourteenth Amendments. The Plaintiffs argue that both the previous Direct Recording Electronic (DRE) voting system and the current Dominion Ballot Marking Device (BMD) system are compromised, citing evidence such as expert testimony and incidents like the Coffee County election system breach, which highlight potential security risks. AI or automated systems are implicated through the design and function of electronic voting machines, software, and pollbooks, all of which are critical in counting votes and maintaining voter information.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: The central legal issue is whether Georgia's electronic voting system, as implemented, has sufficient cybersecurity deficiencies to amount to a constitutional violation of voters' rights to cast effective votes that are accurately counted.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court found that there are material factual disputes, precluding the grant of summary judgment in favor of the State Defendants regarding the primary claims against the current electronic voting system (BMD). However, the court granted summary judgment for the State regarding claims related to the obsolete DRE system and granted summary judgment to Fulton County due to its lack of authority on the disputed voting system matters. The case will proceed to trial.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Think of Georgia's electronic voting system like a big computer being challenged because people are worried it can be hacked easily. The plaintiffs—people suing about the voting system—say the current way votes are counted and stored by these machines can make mistakes or be tampered with, which isn’t fair for voters. The court decided there is enough concern and evidence of these issues to have a trial to figure this out. However, any changes to the law, like switching to a paper voting system, are up to state lawmakers, not the court. The trial will figure out if the current system really is a problem, potentially affecting how votes are counted in future elections.",

Cf. Jacobson v. Fla. Sec ’y of \nState , 974 F.3d 1236 (11 th Cir. 2020) ; Wood v. Raffensperger , 981 F.3d 1307 (11 th \nCir. 2020).  Instead, this case focuses on whether  Georgia’s statewide electronic \nvoting system ,1 as currently designed and implemented , suffers from major \n \n1 The State’s election system equipment is uni formly used throughout Georgia for in -person voting \nin all elections , except when a select number of jurisdictions hold elections for a small number of \n Case 1:17-cv-02989-AT     Document 1705     Filed 11/10/23     Page 1 of 1352 cybersecurity  deficiencies that unconstitutionally burden Plaintiffs ’ First and \nFourteenth Amendment right s and capacity to case effective  votes that are \naccurately counted .2 \nSince its inception, this electio n case has gone through multiple stages of \nevolution. Plaintiffs have raised challenges to both the original, critically outdated \nDirect Recording Electronic (“DRE”) voting system and the current Dominion \nBallot Marking Device (“BMD”) sy stem that replaced the DRE system several years \ninto the case, starting in 2020. A plethora of new factual and legal developments \nemerged along the way, topped off by the breach of the Coffee County election \nsystem in early 2021. This breach and the copyin g and sharing of election system \nsoftware and voting data to actors and entities inside and outside of the state, as \nwell as through  the internet, bear serious ramifications for the future vulnerability \nof the State’s election system as a whole. Plaintiffs  initially discovered this breach \nin 2021 and, thereafter in 2022, conducted a series of depositions of individuals \ninvolved in the breach, some of whom were indicted in the pending RICO criminal \ncase in Fulton  County Superior Court . See Georgia v. Trump et al. , 23SC188947 \n(Fulton Cty. Super. Ct. Aug. 14, 2023) .  \n \nlocal offices in off election cycle years. O.C.G.A. § 21 -2-300. Absentee ballots are processed and \ntallie d on county electronic scanners, which are also provided by the State.  \n2  The Court notes that the record  evidence does not suggest that the Plaintiffs are conspiracy \ntheorists of any variety.  Indeed , some of the nation’s leading cybersecurity experts and computer \nscientists have provided testimony and affidavits on behalf of Plaintiffs’ case in the long course of \nthis litigation.  Case 1:17-cv-02989-AT     Document 1705     Filed 11/10/23     Page 2 of 1353 This case’s broad evidentiary scope can be daunting. To assist the reader’s \nreview of the Order, the Court has started by first providing a cast of many of the \nkey individuals  and experts who , in the last few years , have played a role in this \ncase as well as a glossary of specialized terms and abbreviations. The Court then \nproceeds to provide information necessary to give context for a range of relevant \ntopics, including, among others:  \n• the use of computerized electronic voting  systems  in Georgia and \nthe history of the cybersecurity and voting issues raised by \nPlaintiffs in their series of legal challenges, as previously addressed \nby this Court;  \n \n• the cybersecurity and reliability issues surrounding the use of the \nrelevant electronic voting systems and the auditin g of such systems \nand voting results;  \n \n• the cybersecurity experts’ evaluations and testimony regarding the \nState’s voting systems and exposure to breach es, especially in the \nabsence of timely, needed software patches and the \nimplementation of other cybersecu rity protective measures;  \n \n• the Department of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity & \nInfrastructure Agency ’s (“CISA”) review of the Dominion \nImageCast X system and software (currently used in Georgia) and \nCISA ’s issuance of a national advisory notice on June 3, 20 22 \nrecommending that jurisdictions using this particular Dominion \nsoftware and related technology implement specific measures  to \nlimit unauthorized access or manipulation of voting systems;  \n \n• the serious security issues and long -term ramificati ons \nsurrounding the breach of the Coffee County election system and \nunauthorized access to the State Dominion voting software and \nelection data, and the resulting impact on future voting security;3 \n \n \n3 Issues regarding the State Defendants’ delayed and incomplete review of the Coffee Co unty \nbreach are addressed in Section IV.E.4.f of this Order.  Case 1:17-cv-02989-AT     Document 1705     Filed 11/10/23     Page 3 of 1354 • Defendants’ principal defense that Plaintiffs lack standing to assert \nthe constitutional claims raised in this case and, on the other side, \nthe grounds Plaintiffs rely on to establish their legal standing to \npursue their claims in this case — grounds inc luding the alleged \nsevere burden placed on their capacity to cast an effective and \nreliable vote by Defendants’ handling of the election system;  \n \n• The Court’s legal and evidentiary analysis of the issues in dispute \nraised by the Defendants’ pending Mot ions for Summary \nJudgment.  \n \nAs these evidentiary and legal issues are complex and interwoven, review of \nthis Order takes patience. Ultimately, the Court concludes that there are material \nfacts in dispute presented in the record that preclude its grant of t he State \nDefendants’ Motions for Summary  Judgment  on the primary claims . [D0cs. 1567, \n1568 .] The Court will resolve these material factual disputes and related legal \nissues based on the evidence presented at a bench trial to begin on January 9, 2024. \nThat said, the Court finds that seve ral distinct requests for relief advanced solely \nby the Coalition Plaintiffs are largely outside the scope of this case , as discussed in \nSection V.D. of this Order. The Court also concludes that Fulton County’s Motion \nfor Summary Judgment [ Doc. 1571 ] should be granted based on the County’s lack \nof direct authority over the voting system matters in dispute here . \nTo be clear from the start, the Court does not have the legal authority to grant \nthe broad est relief that Plaintiffs request in this case without directly infringing on  \nthe state legislature’s vested power to enact legislation . Even if Plaintiffs prevail on \ntheir substantive claims, the Court cannot order the Georgia legislature to pass \nlegislation creating a paper ballot voting system or judicially impose a state wide Case 1:17-cv-02989-AT     Document 1705     Filed 11/10/23     Page 4 of 1355 paper ballot system as injunctive relief in this case. Quite simply, the Court has the \nlegal authority to identify constitutional deficiencies with the existing voting \nsystem, but it does not have the power to prescribe or mandate  new voting systems \n(i.e., a paper ballot system) to replace the current, legislatively enacted system. See \nBurdick v. Takushi , 504 U.S. 428, 433 –34 (1992); Wood v. Raffensperger , 501 F. \nSupp. 3d 1310, 1327 –28 (N.D. Ga. 2020), aff’d , 981 F.3d 1307 (11th Cir. 2020).  \nThat said, as the Eleventh Circuit previously recognized in this case, “suits \nchallenging election procedures  [or policies]  are routine ,” and  there are critical \nissues raised in this case that do not “present a political question beyond this \nCourt’s reach.” Curlin g v. Raffensperger , 50 F.4th 1114, 1121 n. 3 (11th Cir. 2022). \nStill, Plaintiffs carry a heavy burden to establish a constitutional violation \nconnected to Geo rgia’s BMD  electronic voting system, whether in the manner in \nwhich the State Defendants have  implemented the voting system — i.e., that it \nimposes serious security voting risks and burdens impacting Plaintiffs ’ voting \nrights  — or otherwise. If Plaintiffs prevail at trial  on one or more of their claims, \nthere are pragmatic, sound remedial policy measures t hat could be ordered or \nagreed upon by the parties, such as (1) providing for the use of printed ballots for \nvote counting without  the use of QR codes, (2) administering a broader scope and \nnumber of election audits to address vote count accuracy and other  related issues, \nand (3) implementing other essential cybersecurity measures and policies \nrecommended by the nation’s leading cybersecurity experts and firms, including  \nthe Department of Homeland Security’s CISA.  Case 1:17-cv-02989-AT     Document 1705     Filed 11/10/23     Page 5 of 1356 As the Court has consistently advised the parties, it is in the public interest \nfor them  to seriously engage in the hard work of attempting to reach a consensual \nresolution regarding those voting system remedial measures that the State could \nimplement and that the legislature co uld authorize funding for in the year ahead. \nThe Court cannot wave a magic wand in this case to address the varied challenges \nto our democracy and election system in recent  years, including those presented in \nthis case. But reasonable , timely discussion and compromise in this case , coupled \nwith prompt, informed legislative action , might certainly make a difference  that \nbenefits the parties and the public. For now, though, the Court must proceed with \ntrial starting on January 7, 2023.  \n Legal Stand ard  \nThe Court may grant summary judgment only if the record shows “that there \nis no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to \njudgment as a matter of law.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). A factual issue is genuine if \nthere is suffic ient evidence for a reasonable jury to return a verdict in favor of the \nnon-moving party. See Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc. , 477 U.S. 242, 248 (1986). \nA factual issue is material if resolving the factual issue might change the suit’s \noutcome under the go verning law. Id. The motion should be granted only if no \nrational fact finder could return a verdict in favor of the non -moving party. Id. at \n249.  \nWhen ruling on the motion, the Court must view all the evidence in the \nrecord in the light most favorable to the non -moving party and resolve all factual Case 1:17-cv-02989-AT     Document 1705     Filed 11/10/23     Page 6 of 1357 disputes in the non -moving party’s favor. See Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing \nProds., Inc. , 530 U.S. 133, 150 (2000). The moving party need not positively \ndisprove the opponent’s case; rather, the moving party must  establish the lack of \nevidentiary support for the non -moving party’s position. See Celotex Corp. v. \nCatrett , 477 U.S. 317, 325 (1986). If the moving party meets this initial burden, in \norder to survive summary judgment, the non -moving party must then pres ent \ncompetent evidence beyond the pleadings to show that there is a genuine issue for \ntrial. Id. at 324 –26. The essential question is “whether the evidence presents a \nsufficient disagreement to require submission to a jury [or trial judge] or whether \nit is so one -sided tha t one party must prevail as a matter of law.” Anderson , 477 \nU.S. at 251 –52.  \n Cast of Characters and Glossary of Terms  \nBefore the Court plunges into the factual background of this matter, it \nprovides for the reader’s reference  a “Cast of Characters” that i ncludes  the various \nparties, entities , and other individuals who play a significant role in this case .

These cut down \non the number of ballots that need to be \naudited, while also providing statistical \nconfidence that an incorrect election result is \nnot certified (i.e., made official). As the name \nsuggests, an RLA is designed to limit the risk \nthat a contest is certified with the wrong winner. \nIt does this by increasing the initial sample \nwhen discrepancies are found until either the \nlevel of confidence has been met or a full \nrecount has been performed.  RLAs are an \nincremental audit system: If the margin of an \nelection is wide, very few ballots must be  \nreviewed.

Case 1:17-cv-02989-AT     Document 1705     Filed 11/10/23     Page 15 of 13516  \n Relevant Background  \nThis election security case has been a long roller coaster ride, with many \ntwists and turns. Below, the Court provides the background and context necessary \nto understand the current dispute and the legal issues before the Court. In so \nproviding, the Court does not make any factual findings . And, a s required at \nsummary judgment, the Court presents the facts in the light most favorable to the \nnon-moving parties  — here , the Plaintiffs.  \nWith that framing in mind, the Court first , in Section A, discusses the \nvulnerabilities and issues raised regarding  the prior DRE voting system that \nexisted at the onse t of this cas e. While this system is no longer in operation, many \nof the very same concerns persist under the current BMD system. After addressing \nthe litigation and prior  findings about the old DRE system, the Court , in Section B, \ncharts the State’s transitio n from the DRE system to the current BMD system. \nNext,  in Section C,  the Court outlines Plaintiffs’ challenges to the constitutionality \nof the current BMD system . Then, in Section D,  the Court  reviews the concerns \npresented by the Plaintiffs  at the 2020 preliminar y injunction hearing , including \ntheir central concerns related to the QR barcodes used to tabulate votes  and the \nauditability of the BMD system  more broadly  (among other  issues ). After that, in \nSection E, the Court traces newer post-2020 developments regarding th ese same \nvulnerability concerns. These new developments include: the issuance of a  \ncomprehensive  report by Plaintiff’s expert, Dr. Alex Halderman , regarding the Case 1:17-cv-02989-AT     Document 1705     Filed 11/10/23     Page 16 of 13517 vulnerabilities of the BMD system; the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s \nCybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency’s (“CISA”) review and corroboration of \nDr. Halderman’s central findings; the results of a 2021 technical assessment \nconducted by the State’s retained consulting  cybersecurity firm, Fortalice; and, of \ncourse, the now infamous breach of the election system in Coffee County, Georgia \nand the State’s response to this breach. Finally, the Court addresses the present \nposture of the case in Section F.  \nIn outlining the l andscape of this case, the Court has endeavored to be \nthorough, and, as such, asks the reader to buckle up and bear with the ride.  \n The Vulnerabilities of the Previous DRE System  (And Why \nThey Are  Still Relevant)  \nPlaintiffs filed  this lawsuit in 2017 , raisi ng constitutional challenges to the \nelection system that was then in place in Georgia . (Original Complaint , Doc. 1 -2.)8  \nThis integrated system (“the DRE system”) was composed of the Direct Recording \nElectronic voting machines (“DREs”), the Global Electio n Management Systems \n(“GEMS”) servers, and the online voter registration database . (See generally id. ) \nIn the original complaint, Plaintiffs alleged that the system was compromised, had \nnot been properly examined and tested prior to the election as required by state \nlaw, and was vulnerable to outside manipulation . Plaintiffs ’ original complaint \nthus  alleged that  the State’s continued use of the DR E system unconstitutionally \nburdened their fundamental right to vote and denied them equal protection  of the \n \n8 The case was initially filed in the Superio r Court of Fulton County on July 3, 2017. Defendants \nremoved the case to this Court shortly thereafter.  Case 1:17-cv-02989-AT     Document 1705     Filed 11/10/23     Page 17 of 135131 Accordingly, th is Court cannot grant  relief on this issue  as part of the proceedings \nin this case.   \n4. Pollbooks/PollPads  \nFinally, i n challenging the BMD system and all its relevant components, the \nCoalition Plaintiffs also raise issues related the security and reliability of Georgia’s \nvoter registration database , electronic pollbooks , and PollPads.78   \nAs refresher background information, on Election Day, the State’s primary \nway of checking in voters for in -person voting “is with computer tablets containing \nlists of eligible voters in each precinct. These [tablets] are also known as \n‘PollPads.’” Curling v. Raffensperger , 50 F.4th at 1118 . To create the PollPad \ncheck -in lists, the State uses its electronic voter registration database. Id. Prior to \nElection Day, as early voting proceeds, the voter registration database and the \nPollPads a re “updated to reflect whether voters have requested absentee ballots, \nvoted absentee, or voted early.” Id. In the event of errors or malfunctions with the \nPollPads, state law requires each precinct to have a paper backup list. See Ga. \nComp. R. & Regs. 183 -1-12-.19(1) . Each of Georgia’s 159 counties may order its \npaper backup list during a period ending the week before the election. Id. The \ncounties then distribute the sub -lists to their  precincts . Id. But, because the paper \n \n78 The State Defendants on one hand argue that Curling Plaintiffs’ pollbook/PollPad arguments \nfall outsi de the bounds of this case as not properly pled in the operative complaints. The Court \nhas already “addressed and rejected” this argument, ( See 9/28/20 Paper Backup PI Order, Doc. \n918 at 4), and need not further address it here. On the flipside, the Coalit ion Plaintiffs argue that \nthe State Defendants have not addressed this  “claim”  in moving for summary judgment.  But there \nis no separate PollPad/pollbook “claim,” in this case. The Coalition Plaintiffs’ pollbook arguments \nare raised as a component of their s ubstantive constitutional claims (Counts I and II). The State \nDefendants clearly moved for summary judgment in full as to both claim s.  Case 1:17-cv-02989-AT     Document 1705     Filed 11/10/23     Page 131 of 135132 backups have to be printed and distributed, they do not contain fully up-to-date \ninformation come Election Day.  \n In light of this problem, the Coalition Plaintiffs, at the preliminary \ninjunction stage, sought to require the St ate Defendants to push back the print date \nfor the paper backup lists so that the paper lists would include more up -to-date \ninformation. After a hearing and the presentation of evidence, the Court granted \nthe Coalition Plaintiffs’ request for injunctive re lief and ordered , among other \nthings,  that the State provide updated paper backups at a later date. ( See Doc. 918 \nat 64 –67.) On appeal, the Eleventh Circuit vacated the preliminary injunction. \nCurling , 50 F.4th at 1125. In particular, the Circuit Court concluded tha t the \nCoalition Plaintiffs failed to demonstrate “a severe burden on the right to vote \nattributable to the State’s print date for the paper backup,” and that, on the other \nside of the scales, “relevant and legitimate state interests” justified the State’s \nexisting hard copy print date. Id. (citing “administrative factors —the need to \ndistribute a large number of lengthy lists while also managing other preparation \ntasks in advance of Election Day”).  \n Now, at summary judgment, the Coalition Plaintiffs rely , first, on the same \nevidence that the Eleventh Circuit found insufficient to establish a burden that \noutweighed the State’s administrative interests. In addition, the Coalition Plaintiffs \nargue that new evidence supports the grant of relief here. In briefing,  the Coalition \nstates , without citation, that “[t]he State Defendants do not update and distribute \npaper pollbook back -ups when critically needed in runoff elections.” (Coalition Case 1:17-cv-02989-AT     Document 1705     Filed 11/10/23     Page 132 of 135133 Pls.’ Resp., Doc. 1624 at 77.) They also cite to new evidence that the PollPa ds are \nconnected to the internet. ( Id.) (citing Lenberg's Dep Doc 1613 p. 72 ) (explaining \nthat, while at the Coffee County Elections Office, Ms. Hampton “showed me that it \nwas connected to the internet during its operation and that they literally could go \norder Domino's Pizza and have it delivered while it was connected to the internet.”)  \nSo, according to the Coalition, the PollPads are subject to the same cybersecurity \nrisks as the rest of the electronic voting machinery.  \n The Court wi ll not re hash  a request for a remedy that the Eleventh Circuit \nhas already expressly disapproved as not justified or sufficiently tied to the voting \nproblems identified. Curling , 50 F.4th at 1123  (noting that “delays or wait times at \nthe polling places”  were not sufficiently related to the fact that the State’s paper \nbackups were not up to date).  Indeed, as the Court o f Appeals noted the nature of \nthe curative remedy requested (i.e., the later provision of the voting information) \nwas distinctively administrative in character and challen ged issues  within the \ndiscretion of the Secretary of State’s Office. But, to the extent the  Coalition \nPlaintiffs challenge the  PollPads a s a coordinated part of Georgia’s electronic \nvoting system — regardless of whether  or not the Election Assistance Commission \n(“EAC”) certification techni cally covers  the PollPads  (see Defs. MSJ, Doc. 1568 -1 \nat 6) — the operation of the PollPads  (or other similar d evices used in their place)  \nremain s relevant to the functioning, integrity , and reliability of the election system \nchallenged in this case.  Evidence of this nature is plainly  relevant here  and can be Case 1:17-cv-02989-AT     Document 1705     Filed 11/10/23     Page 133 of 135134 presented at trial . The Court , however , will not all ow the Coalition  Plaintiffs  to \nwander into remedy turf not directly relevant to the central issues in this case.   \n Conclusion  \nThe importance of the security, reliability, and functionality of state election \nsystem s, classified by the U.S. Homeland Security Department as critical national \ninfrastructure, cannot be overstated in a world where cybersecurity challenges \nhave exponentially increased in the last decade. The dynamics of how a breach in \none part of a cyber  system may potentially carry cybersecurity reverberations for \nthe entire system for years to come exemplifies the important concerns raised in \nthis case.  The constitutional voting claims raised here involve complex evidence, \nlegal issues, and events , heat ed by the political stresses of the era.  Still, the Court \nreminds the reader that the fact that this Order allows Plaintiffs’ constitutional \nclaims to proceed to trial, with some exceptions, simply  means that there are \nsufficient factual disputes underlying  the legal disputes here to require a trial. But, \nas stated at the outset of this long Order, collaborative efforts to address the issues \nraised in this case might be more productive for the public good .   \nFor the reasons articulated above, the State Defendants’ Motions for \nSummary Judgment [Docs. 1567, 1568] are GRANTED IN PART AND \nDENIED IN PART . The motions are granted as to Plaintiffs’ DRE claims (Counts \nI and II of both Third Amended Complaints) but den ied as to the substantive BMD \nclaims (Counts III and IV of the Curling Plaintiffs’ Third Amended Complaint and \nCounts I and II of the Coalition Plaintiffs’ Supplemental Amended Complaint). Case 1:17-cv-02989-AT     Document 1705     Filed 11/10/23     Page 134 of 135135 \nUnder the umbrella of the substantive BMD claims, the Coalition Pla intiffs’ \ncollateral theories  and relief requests  — related to ballot secrecy, scanner settings, \nand paper backups of pollbook information — are, for the most part,  outside the \nscope of this case, with the following exp ress qualification :79 evidence regarding \nthe functioning of the pollbooks  and PollPads ,80 in connection with the operation \nof the election system as a whole, is stil l relevant, as discuss ed in Section V.D.4.  \nAdditionally,  as discussed herein, because the Plaintiffs’ asserte d harm is not \ntraceable to Fulton County,  Fulton County’s Motion for Summary Judgment [Doc. \n1571] is GRANTED IN FULL .  \nTrial is set for January 9, 2023.

    "summary": "**1. Summary:** In _United States v. Anthony D. Bressi, Damonico L. Henderson, and Terry Harris_, the court reviewed pretrial motions from the defendants, who were involved in a large-scale cross-border drug distribution scheme. The investigation, initiated by the FBI, uncovered extensive evidence against the defendants, including banking records, surveillance data, and controlled buys. The defendants challenged several aspects of the investigation, including evidence suppression and the need for separate trials, but the court found their claims lacked merit and denied the motions. Although there are references to SHIVA engaging in diverse technological fields, including AI, it did not play a role in the legal issues of this case.\n\n**2. Key Legal Issue:** The primary legal issue is whether the defendants’ pretrial motions, including motions to suppress evidence and for separate trials (severance), are valid and whether the obtained evidence violated any constitutional rights.\n\n**3. Court's Holding:** The court held that the defendants' pretrial motions to suppress evidence and for severance were without merit, and denied them. The court found that the evidence collected was lawful and that trying the defendants jointly was appropriate.\n\n**4. ELI5 Explanation:** Imagine three people got in trouble for running a massive illegal drug operation across state lines. The police found a lot of evidence, like weird bank transactions, shady meetings, and hidden labs. The three people tried to argue that the police did something wrong when collecting the evidence and wanted to be tried separately in court.

Both the investigation and the evidence it uncovered were extensive. \nPhysical surveillance. Video surveillance. Bank records. Cell phone records. Cooperating witnesses. Searches. Seizures.

As detailed below, these motion s \nto suppress and to sever are without merit. They are therefore denied.  \nI. BACKGROUND  \nA. Factual Background   \n1. Start of the Investigation  \nIn the summer of 2016, the Federal Bureau of Investigation began \ninvestigating the financial dealings of Anthony Bressi,1 an ex-convict who served \nextended prison sentences for manufacturing explosives and methamphetamine.2 \nFollowing his release from prison in 2014, Bressi formed a limited liability \ncompany named SHIVA Science & Technology Group LLC (“SHIVA”) and then \nopened business checking and savings accounts for SHIVA, as well as a personal \nchecking account in his name, with M&T Bank.3 Over the next two years, Bressi \nmade a series of cash deposits into these accounts that appeared to be “structured” —that is, made in amounts below the $10,000 minimum bank \nreporting requirement —  \n tipping off the FBI to possible money laundering.\n4  \nThe FBI then contacted Bressi’s probation officer (at the time, Bressi was \nunder supervision following his release from federal prison) about the possibility \n \n1  See GX 11.1 (Jan. 24, 2018, Case Opening File). \n2  See GX 6.2 (June 8, 2019, SHIVA Search Warrant Affidavit) ¶¶ 4–5. \n3  Id. ¶¶ 14, 17. \n4  See GX 11.1 (Jan. 24, 2018, Case Opening File) at 1–4. \nCase 4:19-cr-00207-MWB     Document 290     Filed 04/19/23     Page 2 of 1003 of information sharing.5 The United States Probation Office for the Middle District \nof Pennsyl vania  notified this Court and requested authorization “to share \ninformation and intelligence with any law enforcement agency involved in [the] \ninvestigation” into Bressi’s “abnormal [banking] activity.”6 The Court granted this \nrequest on October 14, 2016.7  \nAround this time, Bressi closed the accounts with M&T Bank and opened \nnew business and personal bank accounts with First Keystone Community Bank.8 \nConsistent with this Court’s October 2016 Order, Bressi’s probation officers then provided the FBI with copies of Bressi’s and SHIVA’s bank statements with First \nKeystone.\n9  \n multiple “suspicious cash transactions” between \nFebruary and November 2017 totaling approximately $740,000.10  \n Bressi entered the bank’s branch in Danville, \nPennsylvania (where Bressi lived) with a “black duffel bag which contained the \ncash deposit.”11 First Keystone’s employees found this particularly suspect given \n \n5  See Doc. 211- 1 (Oct. 14, 2016, Court Authorization for Information Sharing Between \nProbation and the FBI). \n6  Id. \n7  Id. \n8  GX 6.2 (June 8, 2019, SHIVA Search Warrant Affidavit) ¶¶ 17–18. \n9  Id. ¶ 46. \n10  GX 11.1 (Jan. 24, 2018, Case Opening File) at 3. \n11  Id. \nCase 4:19-cr-00207-MWB     Document 290     Filed 04/19/23     Page 3 of 1004 that “SHIVA, as portrayed by Bressi and its website, does not appear to be a \nbusiness that would deal in cash.”12  \n2. Initial Investigative Steps  \nThe FBI officially opened its investigation into Bressi in January 2018.13 In \nthe eighteen months that followed, the Government built its case against Bressi and \nhis co-defendants, Henderson and Harris, through a series of investigative actions.  \nBanking Records:  the Government \nobtained grand jury subpoenas for Bressi’s and SHIVA’s bank records.14 These \nrecords indicate that between August 2018 and June 2019, Bressi made cash deposits totaling nearly $1.8 million into SHIVA’s First Keystone business \nchecking account.\n15 During this period, there were no incoming wire transfers or \nbusiness checks deposited into SHIVA’s account.16 Instead, the account was \nfunded exclusively by cash deposits.17 Bank personnel informed the FBI that \nBressi personally made all the cash deposits at First Keystone’s Danville branch.18 \nAccording to the bank officials, Bressi stated that he “liked to deal in cash” and \n \n12  Id. \n13  Id. at 1. \n14  See Doc. 208 (Bressi Omnibus Mot. – Gov’t Opp.) at 4. \n15  GX 6.2 (June 8, 2019, SHIVA Search Warrant Affidavit) ¶ 19. \n16  Id. ¶ 22. \n17  Id. \n18  Id. ¶ 20. \nCase 4:19-cr-00207-MWB     Document 290     Filed 04/19/23     Page 4 of 1005 “does not like checks”; and when pressed by bank personnel, he offered only \n“vague answers about his business.”19  \nSHIVA’s Internet Profile and Purchase Activity: According to SHIVA’s \nwebsite, the company wa s involved in “Tech Developments” and “Consulting & \nCustom Solutions.”20 SHIVA claim ed to be “in the process of developing some \nworld -changing technologies in fields as diverse as energy, medicine, beverages, \ncommunications, entertainment, aerospace, transportation, chemistry, robotics, artificial intelligence, and defense.”\n21 SHIVA’s Facebook page highlight ed certain \nproducts it was purportedly designing and manufacturing, including “Dazzle \nCoating” —which it described as “a coating to protect aircraft, drones, rockets, and \nother vehicles from laser directed energy weapons” —and a “Beverage \nSynthesizer” —a device designed to “chemically reproduce any known \nbeverage.”22 SHIVA described itself as “Sci -Fi Realized” because “many of [its] \nproducts do just that —turn science fiction into science fact.”23 \nIn truth, SHIVA was long on fiction and short on fact.

As the Third Circuit has made plain, redacted \nconfessions of this sort, which implicate the precise number of individuals tried \nalongside the confessing co -defendant, violat e the Bruton rule.429  \nAccordingly, the Court finds that the statements made by Bressi can be \nredacted to comply with the Bruton rule. But the redacted transcripts proposed by \nthe Government do not. Before the Court accepts these statements into evidence, \nthe Government will need to perform further redactions, excising all references to Henderson and Harris that, consistent with Third Circuit precedent, qualify as “directly accusatory.”\n430  \n2.

    "summary": "Certainly! Here's a breakdown of this court case opinion:\n\n1. **Summary:** \n   - The case involves Elkin Valley Baptist Church, which mistakenly sent $793,876.10 to a fraudster posing as its building contractor. The Church sued PNC Bank, which processed the payment, and FNB Corporation, where the Church held its account, claiming violations of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) and negligence. The UCC Article 4A-207 addresses scenarios where banks may rely on account numbers for wire transfers, barring knowledge of discrepancies between the account number and the beneficiary's name. The court's analysis focuses on the bank's alleged failure to prevent fraud due to potential knowledge of irregularities.\n   - The court denies PNC's motion to dismiss, allowing negligence claims to proceed, as the bank might have knowledge of mismatched account details, evident due to technological advancements. Part of FNB's negligence claims is dismissed as preempted by the UCC, lacking allegations of extra-conduct outside the wire transfer's scope.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue:** \n   - Whether PNC Bank and FNB Corporation can be held liable under the UCC and common law negligence for processing a fraudulent wire transfer where the account name and number did not match.\n\n3. **Court's Holding:** \n   - The court denied PNC's motion to dismiss, allowing the Church’s claims under the UCC and negligence for its alleged failure in account handling, which potentially permitted fraudulent activity. However, it partially granted FNB's motion, dismissing the Church’s common law negligence claims against FNB as preempted by the UCC, due to a lack of allegations of conduct outside the wire transfer.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation:** \n   - A church tried to transfer money to build a chapel, but got tricked and sent it to a scammer's account instead. They blamed two banks for not catching this mistake. The judge said they might have a point against one bank (PNC) because banks have smart systems that should catch funny business like mismatched account details. But for the other bank (FNB), they didn't do anything wrong when the money was sent, so no dice.",

INTRODUCTION  \nIn this case, Plaintiff  Elkin Valley Baptist Church  (“EVBC” or “the Church”) , a North \nCarolina non-profit  corporation , bring s claims against both F.N.B. Corporation (“FNB”),1 the bank  \nwith which EVBC  maintained its account, and PNC Bank, N.A. (“PNC”), the bank which accepted \nand proce ssed  EVBC’s wire transfer2 of $7 93,876.10  intended for the Elkin Valley  congregation ’s \nbuilding contractor, Landmark Builders, Inc.  (“Landmark”), of Winston -Salem , North Carolina . \nDefendant financial institutions are citizens of the State s of Delaware (PNC) and Pennsylvania  \n(FNB);  maintain their principal  places of business in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania ; and have branch \noffices in multiple states, including  North Carolina.   \n \n \n1 FNB asserts that it has been incorrectly identified as F.N.B. Corp., a bank holding company, rather than as that \ncompany’s banking subsidiary First National Bank of Pennsylvania, which appears to be the bank with which EVBC \ntransacted business.  (Docket N o. 39 at 5).  \n2 Such wire transfers are accomplished by what is referred to in the statutory and case law, and thus herein, as “payment \norders” or “transfer orders”.  Case 2:23-cv-01798-NBF     Document 46     Filed 09/10/24     Page 1 of 752 \n As set forth in the Second  Amended Complaint  (the “SAC”) , Plaintiff brings claims  against \neach Defendant  under 13 Pa . C.S. § 4A207 , Misdescription of Beneficiary  (part of Pennsylvania’s \ncodifica tion of provisions of the U niform Commercial Code  (“UCC”) governing wire transfers)3 \nand for negligence under Pennsylvania common law.  Plaintiff grounds its claims in:  \n(a) Defendant PNC’s (i) accept ance and pay ment - in violation of section  4A207 (b)(2)  - of \nthe Church’s  wire transfer  order  when PNC  “knew ” that the account holder  name  belongi ng to the \naccount number on the transfer order did not match the intended b eneficiary  name  on that order , \nand (ii) negligent failures to exercise due care or diligence in opening  and maintaining a fraudulent \naccount, and /or in permitting withdrawal of Plaintiff’s funds therefrom ;4 and \n(b) Defendant FNB’s negligent failure s to (i) warn Plaintiff that PNC might pay the transfer \norder even if only the account number – and not the intended beneficiary name – on said order \nmatched t hat of the PNC account, in violation of section  4A207 (c)(2), and (ii) implement or adhere \nto reasonable systems of verification to ensure that its transfer orders reached the sender’s intended \nbeneficiary.  \n(Docket No. 28).5 \n \n3 As related infra at Section V, Pennsylvania’s codification of the UCC Funds Transfer prov isions (UCC Article 4A) \nis set forth at 13 Pa. C.S. § 4A 101 et seq.  Section 4A207(b)(1)  provides that if a bank  receives a payment order that \nidentifies the beneficiary by name and account number, the bank may rely on the account number even if the account  \nholder’s name identifies a different person than the beneficiary named in the order.  The bank may not, however, \naccept/process the order in reliance on the account number if the bank knows of the mismatch/ “misidentification” as \nto the intended beneficiar y’s name. 13 Pa. C.S. § 4A207(b)( 2).  The Court notes, for clarity, that references in the \nCode to the “beneficiary’s bank” denote the bank which makes final payment in a wire transfer  to the “beneficiary” , \nusually  as identified by the account number in a payment order.  The term does not, however, necessarily denote the \nbank of the beneficiary named  in the order, or of the originator’s intended beneficiary.  \nAs also discussed, infra, for purposes of this statute, “know” means actual knowledge, and incorporates a bank’s duty \nto reasonably disseminate information it has received to the individuals conducting its transactions. 13 Pa. C.S. § 1 -\n202(b), (f).  \n4 Cf. n.115, infra , (noting that the Court reads the SAC as  asserting these  common law negligence claims only for pre - \nand post-transfer conduct, rather than for the transfer itself).  \n5 Plaintiff’s SAC expresses an intention to add Individual and Business Entity Does (the individual(s) an d entity \nperpetrating the fraud) as defendants when they are identified.  (Docket No. 28 at ¶¶ 4 -5).  The Does are not named in \nthe caption of the SAC, but they are labeled “Defendant” in the body.   Notwithstanding the requirement under Fed. Case 2:23-cv-01798-NBF     Document 46     Filed 09/10/24     Page 2 of 753 \n Pecuniary  loss - suffered here by the congregation of a rural North Carolina church  (and \nby extension others who may have also benefitted from or depended upon the Church’s building \nproject , e.g., Landmark, its employees  and suppliers , their families, and community busines ses) - \nto fraud perpetrated  through exploitations of personal and banking internet/electronic technology \nis increasingly common , and the financial and social costs of wire transfer fraud are increasing \ndramatica lly.6  \nPresently before the Court are Motion s to Dismiss brought by Defendant s PNC  and FNB  \npursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) , together with  Defendants’ b riefs in support, \nPlaintiff ’s briefs  in opposition , Defendants’  reply briefs , and Plaintif f’s sur -reply .  (Docket No s. \n33-35, 37-40, 43 and 45 ).  The motion s have  been fully briefed and the parties have not requested \n \nR. Civ. P. 10 (a) that “[t]he title of the complaint must name all the parties”, courts have held that “a party not properly \nnamed in the caption of a complaint may still be properly before the court if the allegations in the body of the complaint \nmake it plain the part y is intended as a defendant.”  Mitchell v. Maynard , 80 F.3d 1433, 1441 (10th Cir. 1996) , quoted \nin CNX Gas  Co. v. Lloyd’s of London , 410 F.Supp.3d 746, 752 (W.D. Pa. 2019) .  Here, however, paragraphs 4 and 5 \nof the SAC make it clear that the EVBC does not intend that the Does constitute defendants, unless and until the SAC \nis amended to add them following ascertainment of their identities.  Accordingly, this Court need not now examine \ntheir effect on the Court’s diversity jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1332.  \n6 EVBC was  apparently a  victim of Business Email Compromise  (“BEC”) , an increasingly pervasive form of \ncybercrime that includes targeting businesses and individuals working with suppliers and inducing them to wire \ntransfer funds to a fraudulent accou nt.

After consideration  of the parties’ arguments  and for the following reasons, this \nCourt finds that the SAC states a claim for refund against FNB and for declaratory relief against \nPNC under Count  I, for damages against PNC under Count II  and for refund against FNB under \nCount III , but that the claim for damages against FNB under Co unt IV is preempted.  Accordingly, \nDefendant  PNC’s Motion will be  denied (subject to limitations hereinafter set forth) and Defendant \nFNB’s Motion will be denied as to Count II I and granted as to Count IV.  \nThe Court writes at some length at this juncture f or two reasons:   \n1) Whether  and when a UCC section 4A-207 action by a B usiness Email Compromise \n(“BEC”) cybercrime  target and wire transfer order “originato r” (such as the Church ) – against   the \n“originator’s bank” (such as FNB) which initially processed the order,  or the “beneficiary’s bank”  \n(such as PNC ) which ultimately transferred the originator’s funds to the cybercriminal’s account  \n– is maintainable as a matter of law is itself a matter of substantial ly divergent analysis among the \ncourts  to have addressed it.7  This necessitated the Court’s close examination of the law  and \nreasoning  as to each of the possible bas es for dismissal.8  \n2) The interpretation of this statutory provision  – including the scope of its preemption of \ncommon law9 – is, and will continue to be, of swiftly increasing commercial and social import as \n \n7 See generally, e.g.,  Gary D. Spivey, J.D., Annotation:  Construction and Application to Immediate Parties of Uniform \nCommercial Code Article 4A Governing Funds Transfers , 62 A.L.R.6th 1 (Originally published in 2011) . \n8 As discussed infra, the cases reflect differences in the courts’ interpretation of important statutory provision s (e.g., \n§ 1-202 which addresses “knowledge ”) and in their application of the plausibility standard of Rule 12(b)(6) and \nprinciples of privity and agency.  \nAs also n oted, infra , the Court has found the parsing of the statutory provisions/law and factual applications undertaken \nby the District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia helpful  in several respects.  See Studco Bldg. Sys. US, LLC v. \n1st Advantage Fed. Cr edit Union , 2:20 -CV-417, 2023 WL 1926747, at *12 (E.D. Va.

Studco  is \npending on appeal before the Fourth Circuit at Case No. 23 -1148 . \n9 See e.g. , Robert M. Lewis , Allocation of Loss Due to Fraudulent Wholesale Wire Transfers: Is There a Negligence \nAction Against a Beneficiary's Bank After Article 4A of the Uniform Commercial Code? , 90 Mich. L.

And the \ncourts ’ analys es of statutory and common law  causes of action in this context are inherently \nderived in part  from , and ha ve the potential to effect  fundamental shifts in, paradigms of, e.g., \ncorporate  agency  and duties of care . \nII. FACTUAL  BACKGROUND  \nThe following averments are taken from  Plaintiff ’s succinct Second Amended Complaint. \n(Docket No.  28).  The Court assumes the factual components thereof are true for purposes of the \npresent motion.  See Bruni v. City of Pittsburgh , 824 F.3d 353, 360 (3d Cir. 2016) .  In relevant \npart: \nIn November 2022, the congregation of Elkin Valley Baptist Church was in the process of \nconstruction,  pursuant to its agreement with Landmark Builders, Inc., a general contractor located \nin nearby Winston -Salem , North Carolina .10  At some time prior to Nov ember 7, 2022, a n unknown  \ndefrauder  led the Church to believe that Landmark was (a) encountering difficulties with its paper \ncheck processing and (b) direct ing that funds owed by the Church be wire transferred  to \nLandmark’s  PNC B ank account.  (Docket No. 2 8 at ¶¶  29-30).   \nAt some time prior to November 7, 2022 , PNC opened , on application by a  yet unidentified  \nindividual,  a business account  ****** 8034 in an un identified  name  and at an un identified  location  \n(the “Account”).   If the A ccount was opened in the name of Plaintiff’s contractor, Landmark \nBuilders, Inc., PNC’s compliance with applicable federal and state regulations , its own \npolicies/procedures and/or other “reasonable diligence” would have revealed  discrepancies (such \n \nUpdate).  \n10 EVBC “ was in the midst of a construction project for a new chapel ”, for which Landmark was its  General Contractor .  \n(Docket No. 22 at 4).  Case 2:23-cv-01798-NBF     Document 46     Filed 09/10/24     Page 5 of 756 \n as registered address  or Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) tax identification number ), and the \napplication/account was or would have been flagged as suspicious  and discovered to be fraudulent \nat that time .  If the A ccount was opened in another name, that fictitious business entity was not  a \nlegal entity of record in any jurisdiction and/or the individual opening the account lacked authority, \ncorporate records/documentatio n and/or personal identification , and/or provided fraudulent \ncorporate records/documentation and/or personal iden tification .  Here again, the fraudulent nature \nof the application/account  was or would have been discovered at that time through PNC’s \ncompliance with applicable law and its exercise of due diligence , including its customer \nidentification and account verif ication processes. PNC’s responsible Account Manager(s) either \n(a) failed to recognize material discrepancies/irregularities in the requisite  business customer \nidentification/ document ation  or (b) acted with knowledge and deliberate indifference in the \ninterest of personal financial gain in the form of employment incentives.  ( Id. at ¶¶ 8-18, 27-28). \nBased on the i nformation obtain ed during its  requisite account verification process  (e.g., \nthe nature of  the business ’ activities, purpose of the account, and expect ed type /dollar  value of its \nfinancial transaction s), PNC’s subsequent automated monitoring of the Account identified \nsuspicious activity before and after “the fraud on Plaintiff was perfected through PNC’s \nactions/inactions.”  PNC was then required to file Suspicious Activity Reports with the  federal  \nFinancial Crimes Enforcement Network (“FinCEN”) and conduct further due diligence on the \nAccount.  Although it was alerted to account fraud (by, e.g., the IRS tax identification  matching \nprogram, its own automated monitoring , and/or its further  procedural  inquiry  in response to \nsuspicious activity) , PNC failed to act .  It did so in deference to “a practice of willful blindness \nand deliberate indifference” , to avoid costs/ responsibilities inherent in address ing fraudulent \naccount issues and to “preserve transaction -related revenues [gained] from . . . suspicious Case 2:23-cv-01798-NBF     Document 46     Filed 09/10/24     Page 6 of 757 \n accounts. ”  Despite know ledge it held or would have held with due care/diligence  – that the \nAccount was associated with neither Landmark Builders, Inc. nor any other leg ally established \nbusiness,  or was invalidly opened,  i.e., that it was fraudulent , PNC left the Account open. (Id. at \n¶¶ 19 -26).11   \nOn November 7, 2022, pursuant to the m is-direction s of the  unidentified/unknown \ncybercriminal , EVB C initiated a wire transfer order in the amount of $793,876.10  through FNB, \nidentifying the  beneficiary’s  account by PNC number  ******8034 , and identifying the \nbeneficiary’s name and address  – as required by FNB – as those of its contractor, Landmark .  FNB \ndid not notify EVBC that PNC might  pay based on the account number even if it did not match \nthe beneficiary’s name.12  EVBC had no obligations to the holder of the Account into which  its \n \n11 See also id.  at ¶¶ 41 -49 (PNC also failed to comply with account opening/verification and suspicious activity \nprocedures required of it, as a financial institution, under federal “Know Your Customer” (“KYC”) regulations). The \nKYC regulations are part of the f ederal Anti -Money Laundering (“AML”) laws .  Cf. Studco , 2023 WL 1926747 , at \n*4  (“The Bank Secrecy Act ( ‘BSA ’) requires U.S. financial institutions to assist U.S. government agencies to detect \nand prevent money laundering, which includes reporting suspicious activity that might signify money laundering, tax \nevasion, or other criminal activities.”).  \nInterdiction of fraud is one of the primary aims of the BSA/AML regulatory scheme.  As the U .S. Treasury Department \nhas observed,  \n   \nFraud remains the largest and most significant proceed -generating  crime for which funds are \nlaundered in or through the United States. Criminals make billions of dollars annually by deceiving \nU.S. government programs, private companies, and individuals into sending funds via a variety of \nmethods where those funds are ul timately unaccounted for, diverted, or stolen.  \n \nU.S. Treas. Dept., National Money Laundering Risk Assessment (NMLRA)  (Feb. 2024), at 3 ; id. at 5.   In particular, \nthe government has come to emphasize the importance of banks verifying account holders’ identi ties in order to \ncombat fraud and resultant money laundering.  See U.S. Treas. Dept., Financial Crimes Enforcement Network \n(“FinCEN”), Financial Trend Analysis, Identity -Related Suspicious Activity: 2021 Threats and Trends  (Jan. 2024), at \n1 (FinCEN  “has hi ghlighted the importance of customer identity in achieving its mission, and has included cybercrime \nand fraud as government -wide priorities”); id. at 4 (“At account opening, an identity process is necessary to . . . enable \nthe financial institution to form  a reasonable belief that it knows the true identity of each customer, based on the bank’s \nassessment of the relevant risks and information provided . . . . Financial institutions may also rely on identity \nprocesses as part of authorizing account access by  existing customers and when those customers are making \ntransactions with counterparties.”).  See also  Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Spring 2024 Semiannual Risk \nPerspective , at 32 (FinCEN’s findings “emphasize the critical importance of effect ive customer identification and \nverification processes, at account opening and throughout the banking relationship.  . . . .  Effective processes to \nprevent, identify, and file [Suspicious Activity Reports] on fraudulent activity in a timely manner remain important to \nprotect both banks and consumers  . . . .”). \n12 As set forth in Section III, FNB disputes this allegation – a topic addressed in Section VI(B)(3).  See infra . Case 2:23-cv-01798-NBF     Document 46     Filed 09/10/24     Page 7 of 758 \n order was thus paid.  FNB failed to implement a reasonable verification system or otherwise verify \nthat the beneficiary’s name matched that of the Account holder.  ( Id. at ¶¶ 31, 33-35, 82 -87, 91 -\n93).   \nPNC “took custody of” EVBC’s funds on or about t hat day  and deposited them to the \nAccount.  PNC did so although it knew that neither the Account name nor its address matched \nthose of the beneficiary designated on EVBC’s wire transfer order, that is, despite “actual \nknowledge of a mismatch.”    (Id. at ¶¶ 3 6-38, 41 -43).13 \nPNC, having failed to follow applicable federal rules and regulations and/or its own \ninternal procedures for suspending withdrawals from accounts identified as suspicious, then \nallowed all but $17,939.00 of the funds to be withdrawn  from the Account by the BEC \nscammer(s).14  PNC later “remitted back to EVBC the $17,939.00 ” then remaining of its almost \n$800,000 sanctuary  construction fund.  (Id. at ¶¶ 48-52).  PNC knew, or would have known in the \nexercise of reasonable diligence , that the Account  ****** 8034 , its holders and/or its transactions \nwere suspicious  and/or fraudulent at the time of (a) the Account’s opening, (b) PNC’s acceptance \nand deposit of the Church’s transferred funds to the Account, and (c) withdrawal(s) of the funds \nfrom the Account  thereafter permitted by PNC . (Id. at ¶¶ 52 -56). See also  SAC paragraphs \nreferenced supra .   \n \n13 PNC’s objection that the SAC “contains no factual allegations to indicate when, why, how, or through what \ncircumstances PNC developed actual knowledge of the mismatch at the time of Plaintiff’s wire transfer”, see Docket \nNo. 34 at 8, is  addressed in Secti on VI(B)(1)(a), infra .  In brief,  read in the light most favorable to the Plaintiff,  the \nSAC  allege s that (1) prior to accepting and processing the Church’s wire transfer, PNC knew that the Account was \nsuspicious (and subject to heightened monitoring under  applicable federal regulations and PNC’s own \npolicies/procedures) or fraudulent and (2) PNC received and accepted Plaintiff’s wire transfer order containing \ndisparate name and account information.  (Docket No. 28 at ¶¶ 8 -52).  And as discussed infra , unde r common law \nagency principles and UCC § 1 -202(f)’s provision governing imputation of knowledge,  it thereby plausibly alleges \nthat PNC “knew” of the discrepancy between the intended beneficiary of the nearly seven -figure transfer order and \nthe account hold er of the suspicious/fraudulent Account.  \n14 The Account withdrawal(s) were made in whole or in part by a yet unidentified cybercriminal at an unidentified \nbranch location.

(Id. at Request for Relief).  \nIII. PROCEDURAL  HISTORY  \nPlaintiff filed its initial, Amended and Second Amended  Complaint s on October 18, 2023 , \nJanuary 26 , 2024,  and April 26 , 202 4, respectively.   (Docket No s. 1, 15 and 28).  Defendant PNC’s \nMotion to Dismiss and Brief in Support were filed on  May 10 , 2024 , with timely -filed Response  \nin Opposition  and Reply made by the parties  thereafte r.  (Docket Nos. 33-35 and 37).15  Defendant \nFNB’s Motion to Dismiss and Brief in Support were filed on July 1, 2024, with timely -filed \nResponse in Opposition and Reply made by the parties thereafter.  (Docket Nos. 38 -40 and 43).  \nPlaintiff’s Second Amended Complaint brings the following claims:  Counts I and II – \nviolations of  13 Pa C.S. § 4A207 (b) and common  law negligence , respectively,  against Defendant \nPNC ; and Counts III and IV – violations of 13 Pa C.S. § 4A207 (c) and common law negligence , \nrespectively,  against FNB.  \nPNC asserts, in moving to dismiss  Count I , that Plaintiff’s claim under the UCC fails \nbecause  EVBC (a) was not in privity with PNC, which processed the wire instruction in accordance \nwith federal law and regulations and through an automated process that reviews only the account  \nnumber provided, as is the industry custom , and (b) does not and cannot a llege sufficient facts to \n \n15 See also Docket No. 34 at 7.  Case 2:23-cv-01798-NBF     Document 46     Filed 09/10/24     Page 9 of 7510 \n support a plausible claim under section 4A-207.  As to Count II, PNC asserts that EVBC’s common \nlaw claim for negligence is preempted by the UCC and , to the extent it is not , the claim fails as a \nmatter of law because the bank owes no duty to Plaintiff, a non -customer.  (Docket No. 34 at 6).  \nFNB has submitted, as an Exhibit to its brief,  a copy of a one -page Outgoing Wire Form \n(“OWF”) that appears to bear the signature of Steve  Owings on behalf of EVBC  and lists the date , \noriginator, transfer amount, beneficiary name and address, beneficiary’s bank and account number \n(final four digits) all as set forth in the SAC .  (Docket No. 39 -1 at 2).  FNB has also submitted, as \npart of the  same Exhibit, three pages of Terms and Conditions (“T&C”) which it asserts were \nincorporated in the O WF, including a “Governing Law” provision calling for application of \nPennsylvania law, and a n “Identifying Information” provision to the effect that FNB “ may make \npayment . . . on the basis of an . . . account number despite the inconsistency of the name of the \naccount holder and the Beneficiary. ”  (Docket No. 39 -1 at 3-4).  In its opposing brief, Plaintiff \ndoes not dispute the authenticity of the one -page OWF , or the authenticity or authority of Mr. \nOwings’s signature thereon; but Plaintiff does dispute the authenticity of the appended T &C.  In \nresponse, FNB  has submitted , as an exhibit to its reply brief, the August 2, 2024 Affidavit of \nVanessa Reiser whic h seeks to authenticate the T &C.  (Docket No. 43 -2). \nIn moving to dismiss  Count III, FNB argues that  (a) despite not being attached to Plaintiff’s \nSAC, the OWF  (including appended T&C) may be considered by the Court because it is “integral \nto and explicitly relied upon in the SAC ” and (b)  paragraph 7 of the T &C conclusively establishes  \nthat EVBC received notice  that precludes its claim under section 4A -207.  (Docket No. 39 at 9 -10, \n14-15).  As to Count IV, FNB asserts that EVBC’s common law claim  for negligence is preempted \nby the UCC .  (Id. at 11 -13).   \nAs Defendant s’ motion s have  been fully briefed , they are ripe for disposition .  Case 2:23-cv-01798-NBF     Document 46     Filed 09/10/24     Page 10 of 7511 \n IV. LEGAL STANDARD  \nTo survive a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, \nthe complaint “must contain enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.”   \nMartinez v. UPMC Susquehanna , 986 F.3d 261, 265 (3d Cir. 2021)  (quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v. \nTwombly , 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007) ).  Plausibility exists somewhere between “possible” and \n“probable .”  The former necessitates factual allegations that are “more than merely consistent with \na defendant’s liability.”   Id. (citing  Ashcroft v. Iqbal , 556 U.S. 662, 678  (2009) ).  But the latter \nonly demands that the court be able “to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable \nfor the misconduct alleged.”   Iqbal , 556 U.S. at 678  (citations omitted). Detailed allegations are \nnot necessary to survive a Rule 12(b)(6)  motion to dismiss ; however, the complaint must contain \n“more than labels and conclusions ” or “an unadorned, the -defendant -unlawfully -harmed -me \naccusation.”  Fowler v. UPMC Shadyside , 578 F.3 d 203, 210 (3d Cir. 2009)  (citations omitted ).   \nThe United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit has instructed the district courts \nto utilize a three -step process in evaluating a Rule 12(b)(6)  motion to dismiss.  See Lutz v. Portfolio \nRecovery As socs., LLC , 49 F.4th 323, 327 (3d Cir. 2022).  First, t he court must  set out the elements  \nof the plaintiff’s claim; second, identify  and disregard any “formulaic recitation of the elements” \nor allegations  that are “so threadbare or speculative” as to amoun t to nothing more than mere \nconclusory statements; and, finally, evaluate “the plausibility of the remaining allegations” by  \nassuming their veracity and “construing them in the light mo st favorable to the plaintiff [.]”  Id. at \n327-328 (alteration, internal qu otation marks, and citations omitted ).  In addition,  courts must draw \nall reasonable inferences in favor  of the plaintiff .  See Connelly v. Lane Constr. Corp. , 809 F.3d \n780, 790 -791 (3d Cir. 2016) .   \nThe ultimate plausibility deter mination, in turn, is “a context -specific task that requires the \nreviewing court to draw on its judicial experience and common sense.” Connelly , 809 F.3d at 786 –Case 2:23-cv-01798-NBF     Document 46     Filed 09/10/24     Page 11 of 7512 \n 87, quoting Iqbal , 556 U.S. at 679 .16  As the Third Circuit has repeatedly held, consideration of \nthe “context” for a plausibility determination necessarily includes analysis of the law governing \nthe claim at issue.  See, e.g. , Mator v. Wesco Distribution, Inc. , 102 F.4th 172, 183 –84 (3d Cir. \n2024) (“When assessing the sufficiency of the complaint, we pay attention to the context of the \nclaim, including the underlying substantive law.”) (brackets and internal quotation marks omitted) . \nV. RELEVANT STATUTORY PROVISIONS   \nA. Provisions of 13 Pa . C.S. § 4A207 , Misdescription of Beneficiary  \nThe rights, duties and liabilities of the parties with respect to a wire transfer order are \ngoverned by Article 4A of the UCC.17   \n \n16 See also  Hughes v. Nw. Uni v., 595 U.S. 170, 177 (2022)  (“Because the content of the duty . . . turns on ‘the \ncircumstances . . . prevailing’ . . . , the appropriate inquiry [under Iqbal  and Twombly ] will necessarily be context \nspecific.”) (citations omitted).  \n17 The Official Comment to UCC § 4A -102, which addr esses the overall scope of the Article, provides in relevant \npart: \nArticle 4A governs a specialized method of payment referred to in the Article as a funds transfer but \nalso commonly referred to in the commercial community as a wholesale wire transfer. A f unds \ntransfer is made by means of one or more payment orders. The scope of Article 4A is determined \nby the definitions of “payment order” and “funds transfer” found in Section 4A -103 and Section \n4A-104. \nThe funds transfer governed by Article 4A is in large  part a product of recent and developing \ntechnological changes. Before this Article was drafted there was no comprehensive body of law --\nstatutory or judicial --that defined the juridical nature of a funds transfer or the rights and obligations \nflowing from payment orders.  . . . .  [A]ttempts to define rights and obligations in funds transfers \nby general principles . . . have not been satisfactory.  \nIn the drafting of Article 4A, a deliberate decision was made to write on a clean slate and to treat a \nfunds tr ansfer as a unique method of payment to be governed by unique rules that address the \nparticular issues raised by this method of payment. A deliberate decision was also made to use \nprecise and detailed rules to assign responsibility, define behavioral norms , allocate risks and \nestablish limits on liability, rather than to rely on broadly stated, flexible principles. In the drafting \nof these rules, a critical consideration was that the various parties to funds transfers need to be able \nto predict risk with ce rtainty, to insure against risk, to adjust operational and security procedures, \nand to price funds transfer services appropriately. This consideration is particularly important given \nthe very large amounts of money that are involved in funds transfers.  \nFunds transfers involve competing interests --those of the banks that provide funds transfer services \nand the commercial and financial organizations that use the services, as well as the public interest.  \nThese competing interests were represented in the draft ing process and they were thoroughly \nconsidered. The rules that emerged represent a careful and delicate balancing of those interests and \nare intended to be the exclusive means of determining the rights, duties and liabilities of the affected \nparties in an y situation covered by particular provisions of the Article. Consequently, resort to \nprinciples of law or equity outside of Article 4A is not appropriate to create rights, duties and Case 2:23-cv-01798-NBF     Document 46     Filed 09/10/24     Page 12 of 7513 \n Section 4A-207, as codified in Pennsylvania,  provides :18 \n(a) Reference to nonexistent or unidentifiable person or account . Subject to \nsubsection (b), if, in a payment order received by the beneficiary's bank, the name, \nbank account number or other identification of the beneficiary refers to a \nnonexistent or unidentifiable person  or account, no person has rights as a \nbeneficiary of the order and acceptance of the order cannot occur.  \n \n(b) Name and account number identify different persons . If a payment order \nreceived by the beneficiary's bank identifies the beneficiary both by name  and by \nan identifying or bank account number and the name and number identify different \npersons, the following rules apply:  \n \n(1) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (c), if the beneficiary's bank does \nnot know that the name and number refer to diff erent persons, it may rely on \nthe number as the proper identification of the beneficiary of the order. The \nbeneficiary's bank need not determine whether the name and number refer to \nthe same person.  \n \n(2) If the beneficiary's bank pays the person identified  by name or knows that the \nname and number identify different persons, no person has rights as beneficiary \nexcept the person paid by the beneficiary's bank if that person was entitled to \nreceive payment from the originator of the funds transfer. If no pers on has rights \nas beneficiary, acceptance of the order cannot occur.  \n \n(c) Applicable rules when bank pays person identified by number .  If a payment \norder described in subsection (b) is accepted, the originator's payment order \ndescribed the beneficiary inco nsistently by name and number and the beneficiary's \nbank pays the person identified by number as permitted by subsection (b)(1), the \nfollowing rules apply:  \n \n(1) If the originator is a bank, the originator is obliged to pay its order.  \n \n(2) If the originator  is not a bank and proves that the person identified by number \nwas not entitled to receive payment from the originator, the originator is not \nobliged to pay its order unless the originator's bank proves that the originator, \nbefore acceptance of the origina tor's order, had notice that payment of a \npayment order issued by the originator might be made by the beneficiary's bank \non the basis of an identifying or bank account number even if it identifies a \nperson different from the named beneficiary. Proof of not ice may be made by \n \nliabilities inconsistent with those stated in this Article.  \nUCC § 4A -102 cmt.  \n18 The Court notes that in a revision to the UCC very recently adopted by the Pennsylvania legislature, one word in § \n4A-207 was changed (from “writing” to “record”).  Because the revision post -dates the events at issue, the Court has \nset forth and applied the pre -revision Code.  Case 2:23-cv-01798-NBF     Document 46     Filed 09/10/24     Page 13 of 7514 \n any admissible evidence. The originator's bank satisfies the burden of proof if \nit proves that the originator, before the payment order was accepted, signed a \nwriting  stating the information to which the notice relates.  \n \n(d) When person identified by number not entitled to receive payment .  In a \ncase governed by subsection (b)(1), if the beneficiary's bank rightfully pays the \nperson identified by number and that person was not entitled to receive payment \nfrom the originator, the amount pa id may be recovered from that person to the \nextent allowed by the law governing mistake and restitution as follows:  \n \n(1) If the originator is obliged to pay its payment order as stated in subsection (c), \nthe originator has the right to recover.  \n \n(2) If the originator is not a bank and is not obliged to pay its payment order, the \noriginator's bank has the right to recover.  \n \n13 Pa. C.S. § 4A207.  \n Comment  2 to section 207 observe s that:  \nSubsection (b) allows banks to utilize automated processing by allowin g banks to \nact on the basis of the number without regard to the name if the bank does not know  \nthat the name and number refer to different persons. ‘Know ’ is defined in Section \n1-201(25) to mean actual knowledge, and Section 1 -201(27) states rules for \ndetermining when an organization has knowledge of information received by the \norganization . 19  The time of payment is the pertinent time at which knowledge or \nlack of knowledge must be determined.  \n \n UCC  § 4A -207 cmt. 2 (emphasis added).   The Comment a lso observed that “the clear trend is for \nbeneficiary's banks to process payment orders by automated means . . .  .”20  Id. \n \n19 Former UCC §§ 1 -201(25) and 1 -201(27) were subsequently  (and prior to the events at issue) codified at UCC §§ \n1-202(b) and 1 -202(f), respectively.   See Section V(B), infra . \n20 Comment 2 provides more fully:  \nSubsect ion (b) . . . deals with the problem of payment orders in which the description of the \nbeneficiary does not allow identification of the beneficiary because the beneficiary is described by \nname and by an identifying number or an account number and the name and number refer to different \npersons. A very large percentage of payment orders issued to the beneficiary's bank by another bank \nare processed by automated means using machines capable of reading orders on standard formats \nthat identify the beneficiary by  an identifying number or the number of a bank account. The \nprocessing of the order by the beneficiary's bank and the crediting of the beneficiary's account are \ndone by use of the identifying or bank account number without human reading of the payment orde r \nitself. The process is comparable to that used in automated payment of checks. The standard format, \nhowever, may also allow the inclusion of the name of the beneficiary and other information which \ncan be useful to the beneficiary's bank and the beneficia ry but which plays no part in the process of \npayment. If the beneficiary's bank has both the account number and name of the beneficiary supplied Case 2:23-cv-01798-NBF     Document 46     Filed 09/10/24     Page 14 of 7515 \n  \nby the originator of the funds transfer, it is possible for the beneficiary's bank to determine whether \nthe nam e and number refer to the same person, but if a duty to make that determination is imposed \non the beneficiary's bank the benefits of automated payment are lost. Manual handling of payment \norders is both expensive and subject to human error. If payment orde rs can be handled on an \nautomated basis there are substantial economies of operation and the possibility of clerical error is \nreduced. Subsection (b) allows banks to utilize automated processing by allowing banks to act on \nthe basis of the number without r egard to the name if the bank does not know that the name and \nnumber refer to different persons. ‘Know ’ is defined in Section 1 -201(25) to mean actual \nknowledge, and Section 1 -201(27) states rules for determining when an organization has knowledge \nof infor mation received by the organization. The time of payment is the pertinent time at which \nknowledge or lack of knowledge must be determined.  \nAlthough the clear trend is for beneficiary's banks to process payment orders by automated means, \nSection 4A -207 is n ot limited to cases in which processing is done by automated means. A bank \nthat processes by semi -automated means or even manually may rely on number as stated in Section \n4A-207. \nIn cases covered by subsection (b) the erroneous identification would in virt ually all cases be the \nidentifying or bank account number. In the typical case the error is made by the originator of the \nfunds transfer. The originator should know the name of the person who is to receive payment and \ncan further identify that person by an  address that would normally be known to the originator. It is \nnot unlikely, however, that the originator may not be sure whether the identifying or account number \nrefers to the person the originator intends to pay. Subsection (b)(1) deals with the typical  case in \nwhich the beneficiary's bank pays on the basis of the account number and is not aware at the time \nof payment that the named beneficiary is not the holder of the account which was paid. In some \ncases the false number will be the result of error by the originator. In other cases fraud is involved.  \nUCC § 4A -207 cmt. 2.  \nThe Court further observes that the Comment, promulgated in 1989,  reflects the social benefit balancing (between \nlarge -scale transactional efficiencies and social utility maximizing all ocation of risk of loss ) made by the drafters.   \n \nAt the time the UCC’s Fund Transfer provisions were first enacted, large numbers of financial transactions could be \nautomatically processed by banks “using machines capable of reading orders” formatted with  a payee -identifying \nnumber. Additional information provided on the order, e.g., beneficiary name, although potentially useful, was \npresumed to require manual handling – increasing costs and introducing clerical error.  Thus, the Comment concludes, \n“the benefits of automated payment [would be] lost” if banks were required to manually  review and confirm such \nadditional information about the intended beneficiary whenever available.   \n \nThe current capabilities ( e.g., accessibility and retrievability of data, data storage capacities, processing speeds and \nprogrammable functions) of modern  digital computing systems and transactional and account monitoring software, \nare vastly beyond those of the late 20th century.  And the state -of-the-machinery assumptions reflected in the Comment \n(e.g., the infeasibility of automating additional verificat ion/transaction safeguards such as transfer order beneficiary \nname “skimming” and matching) are thus plainly and increasingly superseded.  Fortunately, the statutory framework \ncreated by the drafters of Article 4A accommodates the anticipated automation ev olution of its subject by providing a \nknowledge standard which expressly incorporates reasonableness parameters - ones that look to a bank’s due care in \nits dissemination of corporate information received in the relevant technological, regulatory and inter nal practices \ncontexts.  See 13 Pa. C.S. § 1202 (set forth infra ).  \nFinally, as discussed more fully, infra , Article 4A’s incorporation of a reasonable dissemination standard is consistent \nwith the drafters’ intent to create “precise and detailed rules to assign responsibility, define behavioral norms, allocate \nrisks and establish limits on liability” that would allow financial institutions “to predict . . .  [and] insure against risk , \nto adjust operational and security procedures, and to price funds transf er services appropriately”.  UCC § 4A-102 cmt.  \nIndeed, the limited liability paradigm established under Article 4A serves their “thoroughly considered” balance of \n(a) financial institutions’ need to fashion their own transactional policies/procedures arou nd discernable risks and (b) \nthe public’s interest in transactional rules with lastingly equitable and effective allocations of risk of loss.  See 13 Pa. \nC.S. §§ 1202, 4A207.  Case 2:23-cv-01798-NBF     Document 46     Filed 09/10/24     Page 15 of 7516 \n B. Provisions of 13 Pa. C.S. § 1202, Notice; Knowledge  \n The “General Definitions and Principles of Interpretation ” for provisions of the  UCC are \nset forth in Article 1, including section 1 -202, which provides:  \n(a) Subject to subsection (f), a person has \"notice\" of a fact if the person: (1) has  \nactual knowledge of it; (2) has received a notice or notification of it; or (3) from all \nthe facts and circumstances known to the person at the time in question, has reason \nto know that it exists.  \n  \n(b) \"Knowledge\" means actual knowledge. \"Knows\" has a corresponding meaning.  \n  \n(c) \"Discover\", \"learn\", or words of similar import refer to knowledge rather than \nto reason to know.  \n  \n(d) A person \"notifies\" or \"gives\" a notice or notification to another person by \ntaking such steps as may be reasonably required to inform the other person in \nordinary course, whether or not the other person actually comes to know of it.  \n  \n(e) Subject to subsection (f), a person \"receives\" a notice or notification when: (1) \nit comes to that person's attention; or (2) it is duly delivered in a form reasonable \nunder the circumstances at the place of business through which the contract was \nmade or at another location held out by that person as the place for receipt of such \ncommunications.  \n  \n(f) Communication to Organizations. Notice, knowledge, or a notice or \nnotification received by an organization is effective for a particular  transaction from \nthe time it is brought to the attention of the individual conducting that transaction \nand, in any event, from the time it would have been brought to the individual's \nattention if the organization had exercised due diligence. An organizati on exercises \ndue diligence if it maintains reasonable routines for communicating significant \ninformation to the person conducting the transaction and there is reasonable \ncompliance with the routines. Due diligence does not require an individual acting \nfor the organization to communicate information unless the communication is part \nof the individual's regular duties or the individual has reason to know of the \ntransaction and that the transaction would be materially affected by the \ninformation.21 \n \nNor does the Court find any tension between the incorporation of § 1 -202(f)’s rea sonable dissemination test for \ncorporate “knowledge” (and thus potential transactional liability for want of due diligence as to intra -corporate \ncommunications) and § 4A -207(b)’s recognition of a “safe harbor” of reliance on an account number, properly rea d.  \nSee discussion in Section VI(B)(1)(d) infra . \n21 UCC  § 1-202 cmt. ( “Subsection (f) makes clear that notice, knowledge, or a notification, although ‘received,’ for \ninstance, by a clerk in Department A of an organization, is effective for a transaction conducted in Department B only \nfrom the time when it was or should have been communicated to the individual conducting that transaction.”).  \nThe Court notes that, in keeping with general principles of corporate agency,  § 1-202(f) imputes/attributes to the Case 2:23-cv-01798-NBF     Document 46     Filed 09/10/24     Page 16 of 7517 \n  \n13 Pa. C.S.  § 1202.  \nC. Provisions of 13 Pa . C.S. § 4A402, Obligation of Sender to Pay Receiving Bank  \n The payment obligations set forth under section 4A -402 extend to funds transfers under \nsection 4A-207 (relating to misdescription of beneficiary) and include in pertine nt part:   \n(b) Payment order issued to beneficiary's bank .  With respect to a payment order \nissued to the beneficiary's bank, acceptance of the order by the bank obliges the \nsender to pay the bank the amount of the order, but payment is not due until the \npayment date of the order.  \n \n(c) Payment order issued to receiving bank other than beneficiary's bank . This \nsubsection is subject to subsection (e) and to section 4A303 (relating to erroneous \nexecution of payment order). With respect to a payment order issued to a receiving \nbank other than the beneficiary's bank, acceptance of the order by the receiving \nbank obliges the sender to pay the bank the amount of the sender's order. Payment \nby the sender is not due until the execution date of the sender's order . The obligation \nof that sender to pay its payment order is excused if the funds transfer is not \ncompleted by acceptance by the beneficiary's bank of a payment order instructing \npayment to the beneficiary of that sender's payment order.  \n \n(d) Refund.   If the sender of a payment order pays the order and was not obliged \nto pay all or part of the amount paid, the bank receiving payment is obliged to \nrefund payment to the extent the sender was not obliged to pay. Except as provided \nin sections  [inapplicable he re], interest is payable on the refundable amount from \nthe date of payment.  \n \n13 Pa. C.S. § 4A402.   The effect of the foregoing provisions is to bring about “an orderly \nunraveling of a funds transfer” that is not completed, by requiring each bank in the cha in to refund \npayment to its immediate sender.  Grain Traders v. Citibank, N.A. , 160 F.3d 97, 101 (2d Cir. 1998) .  \n \ncorporation the aggregated  information/knowledge ( i.e., any notice, know ledge or notification of a fact) received by \nits employees/agents.  But also , in a refinement of general principles of agency and duties of care, it limits the \ncorporation’s charged “knowledge” with respect to a particular transaction  to implementation of reasonable routines \nand compliance for internal communication (across organizational divisions) of such of that aggregated \ninformation/knowledge as would be “significant” to that transaction  (and thus should be communicated to the \nindividual agent(s) condu cting it) . \nBy imposing accountability on the corporation for the responsible uptake of knowledge (including, e.g., informational \nrelevance, relatedness, or significance) not only of but from  the discrete information available to it, the Code serves to  \nrestrain the corporation from evading liability through institutional compartmentalization or willful blindness.  See \nSection VI(B)(1)(c), infra .  Cf. 13 Pa. C.S. § 4A102;  n.20, supra .

Supp. 3d 514, \n528 (M.D. Pa. 2021)  (concluding that “the majority opinion [in Dittman ] in fact relied primarily \non UPMC's affirmative conduct, and not solely the parties’ employment relationship” ).127 \nFinally, t he Fragale  court also distinguished Anderson128 on the ground that the risk of an \nincompetent teen driver stealing a car and injuring a pedestrian in Anderson  was far more \nforeseeable than the risk of an imposter using a bank account to divert wired funds  at issue  in \nFragale .  In this regard, the Fragale  court observed that:  \nAt most, Plaintiff has alleged that banks like Wells Fargo were generally on notice \nthat such schemes exist.  However, Plaintiff does not allege any facts to suggest \nthat when Wells Fargo actually opened the Account, it should have been on notice \nthat this particular account was being opened for criminal or fraudulent purposes.  \nFragale , 480 F.

Here, the Church  \nhas plausibly alleged circumstances suggesting that irregularities in the particular account at issue \nmarked it as suspicious, and therefore risky, from the start.  Th e Court therefore must differ from  \n \n126 The Fragale  court also distinguish ed Dittman  on the ground that the bank in Fragale  neither required the plaintiff \nto submit personal information, nor stored any such information.  480 F. Supp. 3d at 662 .  But s uch details may be \nperipheral to the question of whether the bank’s conduct subjected the plaintiff to risk, and to the considerations which \nformed the basis of the  Pennsylvania Supreme Court’s decision.  \n127 In Rutter’s , the court indicated that where “there is no pre -existing ‘special relationship’ . . . , a defendant's \naffirmative conduct can nonetheless be the origin of such a special relationship —in other words, a ffirmative conduct \nassociated with an increased risk of harm can yield a special relationship for tort purposes.  Rutter ’s, 511 F. Supp. 3d \nat 529 .  See also Walters v. UPMC Presbyterian Shadyside , 646 Pa. 746, 775 -76, 187 A.3d 214, 232 (2 018) (under \n“our time -honored general rule . . . . ‘each person may be said to have a relationship with the world at large that creates \na duty to act where his own conduct places others in peril’”) (quoting Wenrick v. Schloemann -Siemag \nAktiengesellschaft , 523 Pa. 1, 8 (Pa. 1989) ).  Cf. Dahlstrom v. Shrum , 368 Pa. 423, 425 (Pa. 1951)  (\"The risk \nreasonably to be perceived defines the duty to be obeyed, an d risk imports relation; it is risk to another or to others \nwithin the range of apprehension. ”) (quoting Palsgraf v. Long Is. R.R. Co. , 248 NY 339, 34, 162 N.E. 99 (1928)  \n(Cardozo, J.).  \n128 Anderson v. Bushong Pontiac Co., cited in  n.117, supra . Case 2:23-cv-01798-NBF     Document 46     Filed 09/10/24     Page 71 of 7572 \n Fragale on the question of duty.129 \n Based on the fore going authorities and analysis, this Court concludes that the Supreme \nCourt of Pennsylvania would most likely hold that a bank owes a duty to users of the banking \nsystem, including noncustomers, to refrain from opening or administering accounts in an \nunrea sonable  manner which serves to create or increase the risk that such users of the banking \nsystem will be injured by cybercrime or other fraud .  Accordingly, the Court finds that Plaintiff \nhas stated a claim for negligence against PNC under the common law o f Pennsylvania.130 \nVII. CONCLUSION  \nThe Court is mindful of its obligation s, when tasked with ascertaining legislative intent, to \n“first look to the language of the statute itself”  - apply ing the intent revealed thereby if the language \nis clear and unambiguous  - and to interpret  the statute’s language  “in context, with every statutory \nsection read together and in conjunction with the remaining statutory language, and construed with \nreference to the entire statute as a whole.”  Tr. Under Agreement of Taylor , 164 A.3d at 1155 , 1157  \n(internal quotation mark s and citation omitted).   In keeping with these principles, the Court finds \n \n129 Because the plaintiff did not state a claim under the traditional common law theories articulated in Dittman  or \nAnderson , the Fragale  court proceeded to analyze whether a new duty should be recognized in accordance with the \nfive-factor test propounded by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in Althaus v. Cohen , 756 A.2d 1166, 1169 (Pa. 2000) .  \nThe court in Chemalloy  undertook the same exercise, and both courts concluded that on balance the factors weigh \nagainst recognizing a duty.  See Fragale , 480 F. Supp.  3d at 669 ; Chemalloy , 609 F. Supp. 3d at 379 .   \nThis Court would be inclined to weigh several of the factors differe ntly (or would predict that the Pennsylvania \nSupreme Court would weigh such factors differently) .  However, because th e Court finds that Plaintiff has , under the \npresently applicable standard, stated a claim for negligence predicated on a recognized duty, it need not embark on an \nanalysis of the Althaus  factors.  See, e.g. , Feleccia v. Lackawanna Coll. , 215 A.3d 3, 13 -14 (Pa. 2019)  (“[A]n Althaus  \nanalysis was not necessary here because our review reveals the present circumstances involve application of existing \nstatutory and common law duties of care”);  Alderwoods , 106 A.3d at 40  (“It is not necessary to conduct a full -blown \npublic policy assessment in every instance in which a longstanding duty imposed on members of the public at large \narises in a novel factual scenario.”).  \n130 The Court notes that the SAC asserts that PNC’s alleged violations of KYC regulations rendered it negligent per \nse.  (Docket No. 28  at ¶ 69).  Cf. n.11, supra .  Negligence per se is not a separate claim under Pennsylvania law but is \nsubsumed  within Plaintiff’s general negligence claim.  Since the Court finds that Plaintiff has stated a claim predicated \non a common law duty, it is unnecessary at this stage to determine whether Plaintiff’s negligence per se claim \n(predicated on a statutory/regu latory duty) is also viable.  And since the question would benefit from development of \nadditional factual detail and further briefing, the Court declines to address it now.  Case 2:23-cv-01798-NBF     Document 46     Filed 09/10/24     Page 72 of 7573 \n that the Church has stated a lternative  refund claim s against FNB under the plain terms of UCC \nsection 4A -207 (governing liability ) and section 4A -402 (governing  “chain of payment” ) – either \nunder section 207(b)(2) if PNC knew of the payment order misidentification or under section \n207(c) if PNC did not know.  However, determining w hich alternative theory may prevail (and \nhence which bank , as between PNC and FNB , may ultimately bear the loss ) presents a more \ncomplex problem of interpretation.   See Section s VI(B)(1)  – (3), supra . \n Over a quarter of a century ago, the drafters of Article 4A provide d a “thorough ly \nconsidered” statute  governing responsibility, behavioral norms, risk allocation and liability for a \nfledgling commerce in wire transfers , which was “ a product of recent and developing technological \nchanges. ”  UCC § 4A -102 cmt.  The rules that emerged represent a “careful and delicate balancing ” \nof the competing interests  of the banks , commercial and financial organizations that provide  and \nutilize funds transfer services  and the public .  Id.  Article 4A’s provision s governing misdescription \nof a beneficiary  reflect that balanc e - and the drafters’ awareness of the  dynamic  nature  of their \nsubject - in their  creation of clearly -drawn rules which are also explicitly predicated on a \nconception of organizational knowledge founded in traditional common law principles of agency \nlaw and reasonableness.131   \nRead in conjunction with section 1 -202(f), section 4A -207 evinces the drafters’ intent to \nencourage a socia lly optimal balance between the efficiency and certainty afforded by automated \nfunds  transfer processing, on one hand, and the utilization of available information to minimize \nforeseeable losses from wire transfer fraud, on the other.  The Code seeks to ac hieve such a balance \nby authorizing banks to identify funds transfer beneficiaries by account numbers alone when the \n \n131 See UCC § 4A -207(b) (determining beneficiary bank’s responsibility based upon its knowledge); id. cmt. 2 (noting \nthat organization’s knowledge is determined under rules stated in § 1 -202(f)); id. § 1-202(f) (charging organization \nwith knowledge for particular  transaction based on requirement of “ reasonable routines for communicating significant \ninformation ”). Case 2:23-cv-01798-NBF     Document 46     Filed 09/10/24     Page 73 of 7574 \n banks do not know of a misidentification, while at the same time charging them with knowledge \nof any information in their system that shoul d be brought to bear on a particular transaction under \na reasonable routine for communication of significant information.  \n Determination of whether a bank is charged with knowledge of a misidentification under \nthe Code requires consideration of what inform ation was received by the bank (system -wide) \nbefore or during the funds transfer, and what routines it had, or should have had, in place for \ndissemination of such information to its agents conducting the transaction.  Ascertainment of what \ntypes of informa tion a “reasonable” routine would convey (and when, and to whom) requires \nweighing the burdens of distributing and using such information against the expected benefits of \nits use – a process familiar to the courts in assessing reasonableness across many co mmon law and \nstatutory contexts.132 \n This Court believes that such a weighing of the burdens and benefits of information \ndissemination is inherently required in order to  implement the carefully balanced framework \ncontemplated by the Code.   And for the reasons aforesaid, t he Court finds it plausible that such a \nweighing will favor imputation to PNC of effective knowledge of the misidentification.133 \n \n132 A similar weighing of burdens and benefits is applicable to assessment of a bank’s asserted common law negligence \nin account administration before and after a wire transfer transaction, which is not governed by Article 4A.  \n \n133 The Court is inclined to believe that once a wire transfer transaction has commenced, the beneficiary’s bank is \nalmost certain to be the “least -cost avoider” – that is, the party be st positioned to prevent fraud loss through reasonable \npreventive measures.  See generally , G. Calabresi, The Costs of Accidents  (1970) , cited in  Air & Liquid Sys. Corp. v. \nDeVries , 586 U.S. 446, 455 (2019) .  As one jurist has aptly explained in the UCC/banking context,  \nPlacing liability with the least -cost avoider increases the incentive for that party to adopt preventive \nmeasures and ensures that such measures would have the greatest marginal effect on preventing the \nloss. This efficiency -promoting principle informs the  burden -shifting provisions of the UCC, \nD.C.Code §§ 28:3 –406, 28:4 –406. See Putnam Rolling Ladder Co., Inc. v. Manufacturers Hanover \nTrust Co. , 74 N.Y.2d 340, 547 N.Y.S.2d 611, 613, 546 N.E.2d 904, 908 (1989)  (“By prospectively \nestablishing rules of liabil ity that are generally based not on actual fault but on allocating \nresponsibility to the party best able to prevent the loss by the exercise of care, the UCC not only \nguides commercial behavior but also increases certainty in the marketplace and efficiency  in dispute \nresolution.”).  \nNat'l Union Fire Ins. Co. of Pittsburgh, Pa. v. Riggs Nat. Bank of Washington, D.C. , 5 F.3d 554, 557 (D.C. Cir. 1993)  Case 2:23-cv-01798-NBF     Document 46     Filed 09/10/24     Page 74 of 7575 \n Finally,  based on its review of Pennsylvania case law  the Court  finds that Plaintiff has \nplausibly alleged that PNC , in breach of its common law duties : (a) failed to exercise reasonable \ncare in its account opening and administration  and (b) permitted withdrawal of the diverted funds \ntransfer in the face of actual or constructive knowledge of beneficiary miside ntification ; and \nthereby substantial ly contributed to the fraudulent diversion of the Church’s chapel -building fund .  \nBecause PNC’s alleged negligent conduct was beyond the scope of the wire transfer itself, EVBC’s \ncommon law claim against PNC is not preem pted.  O n the other hand, the SAC does not allege \nconduct beyond the scope of the wire transfer on the part of FNB that plausibly contributed to \nEVBC’s injury, and consequently EVBC’s common law negligence claim against FNB is \npreempted.  \n Based on the fore going, Defendant PNC  Bank, N.A. ’s Motion to Dismiss (Docket No. 33) \nis DENIED ; and Defendant F .N.B. Corporation ’s Motion to Dismiss (Docket No . 38) is \nGRANT ED in part and DENIED in part . Said Motion is granted to the extent that Count IV of \nPlaintiff’s Second Amended Complaint is dismissed, with prejudice.  An appropriate Order \nfollows.   \n \n \n                                                                                            /s/ Nora Barry Fischer    \n                         Nora Barry Fis cher \n              Senior U.S. District Judge      \nDated:  September 10 , 2024   \n                                                                                            \ncc/ecf:  All counsel of record  \n \n \n(Silberman, J., concurring), quoted in part in  DeVries , 586 U.S. at 460 n.3  (Gorsuch, J., dissenting).  \nThe Code  provisions and Official Comments of UCC §§ 4A-207 and 1 -202(f)  strongly suggest that the drafters applied \nthe same principles in advancement of the same goals.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: In the case of G.G. v. Salesforce.com, Inc., G.G., a minor who was trafficked for sex through Backpage.com, sued Salesforce under the Trafficking Victims Protection Act (18 U.S.C. § 1595), alleging it knowingly benefited from Backpage's illegal activities by providing it with CRM software that facilitated sex trafficking operations. The court granted Salesforce’s motion to dismiss, relying on Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which protects online service providers from being treated as publishers of third-party content. The court also concluded that the plaintiffs did not adequately establish Salesforce's direct participation or knowledge of G.G.'s specific trafficking.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether Salesforce can be held liable under the Trafficking Victims Protection Act for allegedly benefiting from and supporting Backpage's illegal sex trafficking operations, in light of the protective provisions of Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court held that Salesforce is protected from liability under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act because Salesforce was deemed an interactive computer service provider, and the claims treated Salesforce as a publisher of third-party content. Additionally, the plaintiffs failed to provide sufficient evidence that Salesforce knew about or participated in the specific trafficking of G.G.\n\n4. **ELI5 explanation**: Imagine a company sells a special tool to a business. Someone then uses the business's services in a very bad way, like through ads that should have never been posted. The family of a victim sued the tool-selling company saying the company helped the business do bad things just because they sold them the tool to stay organized. However, the judge said, \"You can't sue the tool seller just because the tool was used poorly; also, there's a special rule that protects them because they're not responsible for what people do with the tool.\"",

Wood   SALESFORCE.COM, INC .,    ) \n ) \nDefendants.  ) \n \nMEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER  \n \nWhen  G.G. was thirteen years old, she ran away from home and fell into the hands of a \nsex trafficker. Th e trafficker pos ted advertisements for sex with G.G. on the classified ad website \nrun by B ackpage.com (“Backpage”).1 As alleged in the complaint , Backpage did not just allow \nbut encouraged these types of illegal ads, to the point of becom ing a dominant force in online sex \ntrafficking. Beginning in 2013, Backpage contracted with Defendant Salesforce.com, Inc.  \n(“Salesforce”) to provide it with customer relationship management (“CRM”) business software \nand support. Th at relationship allegedly helped grow Backpage’s operations, including promoting \nthe business of sex traffickers . G.G. and her mother, Deanna Rose, (together, “Plaintiffs”) have \nnow sued Salesforce pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 1595, alleging that, through its contracts with Backpage,  Salesforce violated the federal anti -trafficking laws by knowingly benefiting from and \nparticipating in a venture that it knew, or should have known, was engaged in illegal sex trafficking. Salesforce has filed a motion  to dismiss the complaint in its entirety  pursuant to \n \n1 The Third Amended Complaint, which is the operative complaint, includes Backpage as a defendant. \nBefore Backpage answer ed the Third Amended Complaint , however, the Court granted Plaintiffs’ motion \nvoluntarily to dismiss Backpage from this suit. (Dkt. No. 101.) Case: 1:20-cv-02335 Document #: 105 Filed: 05/16/22 Page 1 of 35 PageID #:<pageID>2 \n Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) . (Dkt. No. 63.)  For the reasons given below, the Court \ngrants  the motion. \nBACKGROUND \n \nFor purposes of Salesforce’s motion  to dismiss , the Court accepts as true all well- pleaded \nfacts  in the Third Amended Complaint (“TAC”)  and views those  facts in the light most favorable \nto Plaintiffs  as the non- moving part ies. Killingsworth v. HSBC Bank Nev ., N.A., 507 F.3d 614, \n618 (7th Cir. 2007). The TAC alleges as follows.  \n Backpage was established in 2004 as an online marketplace for various goods and \nservices. ( TAC  ¶ 16, Dkt. No. 62.) Among other things, Backpage allowed classified ads  for sex. \n(Id.) In 2008, Backpage’s primary competitor, Craigslist, made it harder for users to post ads for \nsex on its platform . Capitalizing on the  displaced ad volume, Backpage enter ed into a period of \nexplosive growth, soon bec oming the most popular online classified site for adult advertisements \nand deriving the vast majority (up to 99%) of its revenue from such ads. ( Id. ¶¶ 16, 23–24.)  \n Salesforce is the world’s top CRM platform , selling software to help companies manage \ntheir relationships with customers, improve profitability, and streamline processes. ( Id. ¶¶ 29–30.) \nSpecifically, Salesforce sells “software as a service” (“SaaS”) technology consisting of  a set of \napplications that, among other things, can help businesses manage sales and marketing functions, \nassist with customer service and support, provi de customer data integration and support, permit \nboth internal communications and communications with customers, offer business intelligence analytics, and process other forms of data. ( Id. ¶ 31.) The Salesforce platform also has a \n“customer org”—that is, a portal that  serves as a point of interaction between Salesforce and its \ncustomers. ( Id. ¶ 32.) The customer org is confidential to each Salesforce customer and consists of Case: 1:20-cv-02335 Document #: 105 Filed: 05/16/22 Page 2 of 35 PageID #:<pageID>3 \n that customer’s users, data, and automation. ( Id.) Additionally, to help its customers achieve their \nbusiness goals, Salesforce also provides personalized support. ( Id. ¶ 33.)  \nAs Backpage grew, it required more support and better CRM tools and capabilities to keep \nup with customer demand and scale its platform. ( Id. ¶ 35.) To meet this need, Backpage \ncontracted  with Salesforce in 2013. ( Id. ¶ 37.) As set forth in the Master Service A greements \nbetween Salesforce and Backpage, Salesforce retained the right to delete or restrict access to \nBackpage’s customer org if Backpag e’s actions or content was tortious. ( Id. ¶ 47.) During their \nnegotiations in November 2013, Backpage’s C hief Executive Officer (“CEO”) Carl Ferrer and \nanother high- level executive met with a c ertified Salesforce C onsulting P artner to assess \nBackpage’s needs and goals as a business  and to determine how Salesforce could help. ( Id. ¶ 53.) \nAn in -house Salesforce account e xecutive continued those conversations, which eventually \nculminated in a deal  between the companies . (Id. ¶ 54.) O ver the next five years, Salesforce sold \nBackpage access to several products , including the premium “Enterprise Edition” of its CRM \nsoftware . (Id.) An in-house Salesforce executive recommended the Enterprise Edition, which is \ndescribed as “fully customizable.” ( Id. ¶ 45.) And, in 2015, Salesforce provided the technological \ninfrastructure for Backpage to move its business overseas, allegedly to help it evade law enforcement scrutiny in the United States. ( Id. ¶ 46.) Overall, Backpage purchased a new \napplication, requested support, or renewed a contract with Salesforce  on at least five occasions . \n(Id. ¶ 48.) Each of those times, Backpage consulted with Salesforce about how best to assess and \nmeet its operational needs. ( Id.) \nUsing the sophisticated CRM  tools, as well as platform support , provided by Salesforce, \nBackpage was able to scale its operations  and expand its business . (Id. ¶¶ 39 –42.) The nature of \nthose operations —and Salesforce’s knowledge of them —are at the center of the present lawsuit. Case: 1:20-cv-02335 Document #: 105 Filed: 05/16/22 Page 3 of 35 PageID #:<pageID>4 \n Plaintiffs allege that Backpage was  primarily (or even solely ) a sex -trafficking business. As  early \nas 2008, Backpage had been publicly identified by law enforcement and state and federal officials \nas being associated with sex trafficking. ( Id. ¶ 18.) And over the next decade, Backpage faced \ncalls to remove its adult services section  by, among others, a group of state attorneys general . \nBackpage refused, resisting efforts to shut down its site on First Amendment grounds. ( Id. ¶ 21.) \nYet, even in the midst of persistent controversy and allegations regarding sex trafficking on Backpage, Salesforce continued to provide software and support to Backpage throughout this period. ( Id. ¶ 50.)  \nEventually, Backpage and its corporate leadership faced federal criminal charges. ( Id. \n¶¶ 25–26.) Backpage’s CEO pleaded guilty to charges that he conspired to facilitate  prostitution \nusing a facility in interstate or foreign commerce and engage d in money laundering, while the \ncorporation pleaded guilty to conspir ing to engage in money laundering. ( Id. ¶¶ 25 n.17, 26 n.18; \nsee also Plea Agreement, United States v. Ferrer , No. 2:18- cr-00464 -DJH (D. Ariz. Apr. 5, \n2018); Plea Agreement, United States  v. Backpage , No. 2:18- cr-00465- DJH (D. Ariz. Apr. 5, \n2018.) As part of its  plea agreement  with the government , Backpage admitted to having operated \nas a site for the sale of illegal sex and to receiving benefits from the sex trafficking of minors. ( Id. \n¶¶ 26–27.)  \nG.G. was one of those sex- trafficking victims. In 2016, when she was thirteen years old, \nG.G. ran away from home  and was soon picked up by her trafficker . (Id. ¶¶ 74, 76.) While \nsearching for her daughter, Rose found an ad featuring G.G. on Bac kpage’s Escort Page. ( Id.) \nRose notified Backpage that G.G., a child, was being advertised for sex on their website and requested that the ads be taken down. ( Id.) Backpage, however, did not remove the ads and \ninstead merely referred Rose to the National C enter for Missing and Exploited Children. ( Id.) Case: 1:20-cv-02335 Document #: 105 Filed: 05/16/22 Page 4 of 35 PageID #:<pageID>5 \n Although G.G. is no longer under the control of her trafficker, she suffered significant physical \nand emotional injuries as a result of her tragic ordeal and still suffers from the effects of being trafficked at such a young age. ( Id. ¶ 79.) \nDISCUSSION  \n \n To survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, a complaint must contain sufficient factual allegations \nto “state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.” Ashcroft v. Iqbal , 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) \n(quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly , 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007)). In evaluating a motion to dismiss, \nthe Court accepts as true all well -pleaded facts and draws all reasonable inferences from those \nfacts in the plaintiff’s  favor. Bell v. City of Country Club Hills , 841 F.3d 713, 716 (7th Cir. 2016). \nWhile a complaint need not contain detailed factual allegations, there “must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level.” Twombly , 550 U.S. at 545.“A claim has facial \nplausibility when the pla intiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable \ninference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.” Ashcroft , 556 U.S. at 678. \nFederal law provides for both criminal sanctions against sex traffickers and civil rem edies \nfor victims of sex trafficking. Relevant to this case, 18 U.S.C. § 1591 creates both primary and secondary liability for the sex trafficking of minors, and 18 U.S.C. § 1595 allows any victim of such trafficking to sue for damages. Specifically, § 1595 allows  victims of sex trafficking \nviolations under § 1591 to “bring a civil action against the perpetrator (or whoever knowingly benefits, financially or by receiving anything of value from participation in a venture which that person knew or should have  known has engaged in an act in violation of [§  1591].” 18 U.S.C. \n§ 1595(a). Beyond the requirement that there be an underlying violation of § 1591, a plaintiff seeking to impose liability under § 1595 must establish that the defendant (1) knowingly benefi ted Case: 1:20-cv-02335 Document #: 105 Filed: 05/16/22 Page 5 of 35 PageID #:<pageID>6 \n from (2) participating in a venture that (3) the person knew or should have known violated \n§ 1591. See M.A. v. Wyndham Hotels & Resorts, Inc., 425 F. Supp. 3d 959, 969 (S.D. Oh. 2019) . \nHere, Plaintiffs seek to hold Salesforce liable under § 1591 for the trafficking of G.G. by \nher trafficker as facilitated by Backpage. Specifically, Plaintiffs allege that a sex trafficker used ads on Backpage to traffic G.G. , a minor, in violation of § 1591. Plaintiffs fu rther allege that \nBackpage facilitated and assisted the use of its site by sex traffickers  such as the one who \ntrafficked G,G. , and that Salesforce, in turn, helped Backpage expand its business with those sex \ntraffickers. Salesforce asks this Court to dism iss Plaintiffs’ complaint against it for two reasons: \nfirst, Salesforce contends that Plaintiffs’ claims are barred by the affirmative defense to liability \nunder § 1595 provided by § 230 of the Communications Decency Act  (“CDA”) , 47 U.S.C. § 230; \nand secon d, Salesforce argues that Plaintiffs have failed to state an actionable claim under 18 \nU.S.C. § 1595. As the defense under § 230, if applicable, is determinative and would warrant dismissal with prejudice, the Court begins its analysis there.  \nI. Section 230 \nSection 230 acts as a bar against liability for certain types of claims against certain \ndefendants —specifically, it provides that “[n]o provider or user of an interactive computer service \nshall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.” 47 U.S.C. § 230(c)(1) . Thus, so long as a defendant can establish that it is (1) a \nprovider or user of an interactive computer service and (2) the claims against it seek to treat it as a publisher of a third party’s content, § 230 will bar those claims. See Chi. Lawyers’ Comm. for Civ. Rights Under Law, Inc. v. Craigslist, Inc., 519 F.3d 666, 671 (7th Cir. 2008) (explaining that “[w]hat §  230(c)(1) says is that an online information system must not ‘be treated as the publisher \nor speaker of any information provided by’ someone else” for purposes of establishing liability). Case: 1:20-cv-02335 Document #: 105 Filed: 05/16/22 Page 6 of 35 PageID #:<pageID>7 \n Specifically in the context of sex trafficking claims, including under § 1595, courts have found \nthat §  230 precludes liability w here the allegations are predicated on the posting of user content —\nthat is, the advertisements trafficking the plaintiffs . See, e.g., M.A. ex rel. P.K. v. Vill. Voice \nMedia Hldgs, LLC , 809 F. Supp. 2d. 1041, 1052, 1056 (holding that § 230 barred claims against \nBackpage because there was “no allegation that Backpage was responsible for the development of any portion of the content  of the [sex trafficker’s] posted ads or specifically encouraged the \ndevelo pment of the offensive nature of that content.”) . Section 230’s protection against such \nclaims, however, is not absolute —as relevant here, Congress amended § 230 through the Allow \nStates and Victims to Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act (“FOSTA”) to explicitly exempt certain kinds of sex trafficking claims. FOSTA, Pub. L. No. 115- 164, 132 Stat. 1253 (2018). As a result , \n§ 230(e)(5)(A) now clarifies that “nothing in this section  . . . shall be construed to impair or limit \nany claim in a civil action brought under [§  1595], if the conduct underlying the claim constitutes \na violation of [§ 1591].”  \nSection  230 functions as an affirmative defense. See, Doe v. GTE Corp., 347 F.3d 655, \n657 (7th Cir. 2003); Bonilla v. Ancestry.com Operations, Inc., No. 20- C-07390, 2021 WL \n5795306, at *4 (N.D. Ill. 2021). Typically, the existence of a potential affirmative defense does \nnot “render the claim for relief invalid,” and “courts should usually refrain from granting Rule 12(b)(6) motions” on that basis . Brownmark Films, LLC v. Comedy Partners , 682 F.3d 687, 690 \n(7th Cir. 2012). However, “[a] n exception applies when the allegations of the complaint set forth \neverything necessary to satisfy the affirmative defense.” Hyson USA, Inc. v. Hyson 2U, Ltd., 821 F.3d 935, 939 (7th Cir. 2016) (internal quotation marks omitted). And courts often address the question of § 230’s applicability on a motion to dismiss. See, e.g., Marshall’s Locksmith Serv. Inc. v. Google, LLC , 925 F.3d 1263, 1267 (D.C. Cir. 2019) (affirming dismissal of a complaint on Case: 1:20-cv-02335 Document #: 105 Filed: 05/16/22 Page 7 of 35 PageID #:<pageID>8 \n § 230 grounds and citing cases in which courts had acted si milarly ). As the D.C. Circuit explained \nin Marshall’s Locksmith Service, Inc. , invocation of § 230 immunity in a Rule 12(b)(6) motion is \n“[c]onsistent with Congress’ intent to confer broad immunity for the re -publication of third- party \ncontent.” Id. ; see also  Nemet Chevrolet, Ltd. v. Consumeraffairs.com, Inc., 591 F.3d 250, 254 (4th \nCir. 2009) (“Section 230 immunity, like other forms of immunity, is generally accorded effect at \nthe first logical point in the litigation process.”).  Still, for a defendan t to raise the defense at the  \nmotion to dismiss  stage successfully , “plaintiff[s] must affirmatively plead [themselves] out of \ncourt .” Hyson USA , 821 F.3d at 939 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Salesforce contends that \nPlaintiffs here have done just that, arguing that the allegations of the TAC unambiguously establish that §  230 precludes Plaintiffs’ claims against it and that no exception to § 230’s \nprotections apply.  \nA. Salesforce as an Interactiv e Computer Service  \nFirst, Salesforce asserts that it qualifies for §  230’s protections because it is a provider of \nan “interactive computer service.” Section 230 defines “interactive computer service” as “any information service, system, or access software  provider that provides or enables computer access \nby multiple users to a computer server, including specifically a service or system that provides access to the Internet.” 47 U.S.C. § 230(f)(2). Salesforce argues that it falls under the definition of “access software provider,” which is defined as  “a provider of software (including client or server \nsoftware) or enabling tools which do any one or more of the following: (a) filter, screen, allow, or disallow content; (b) pick, choose, analyze, or digest cont ent; or (c) transmit, receive, display, \nforward, cache, search, subset, organize, reorganize, or translate content.” 47 U.S.C. § 230(f)(4).  \nIndeed, applying the plain language of the statutory definition to the allegations in the \nTAC, Salesforce plainly qualifies as an “interactive computer service.” At  oral argument on this Case: 1:20-cv-02335 Document #: 105 Filed: 05/16/22 Page 8 of 35 PageID #:<pageID>9 \n motion, Plaintiffs conceded that Salesforce is a software company, and the complaint alleges that \n“Backpage paid the money that it earned from trafficking to Salesforce in exc hange for the \nSalesforce technology and support necessary for Backpage to operate and expand its business.” (TAC ¶ 77.) Looking further in to details of the complaint, the support Salesforce provided \nBackpage involved the provision of technological capabili ties—specifically , software that \nallowed Backpage employees to analyze and digest customer data as well as applications providing for the transmission of both internal employee communications and external customer outreach and support .\n2 Plaintiffs’ claims  can best be summarized thusly: “Salesforce provided \nsupport to Backpage in the use of [Salesforce’s sophisticated software and related] technologies and had knowledge of the manner in which Backpage operated with these enhance d capabilities.” \n \n2 The following allegations are representative of how Plaintiffs’ claims against Salesforce are predicated \nupon capabilities pr ovided by Salesforce’s software.  Plaintiffs allege that Salesforce acted:  \n \nBy “[p]roviding, assisting, supporting, and facilitating Backpage with capabilities and support for \ndirect marketing campaigns, coupled with information gathering such as tracking clicks and \ntracking internet activity of the sex traffickers.” (TAC ¶  87(c).)  \n \nBy “[p]roviding, assisting, supporting, and facilitating more personalized outreach with \nautomation using ‘dynamic content’ and automated messaging to target traffickers and sex buyers.” ( Id. ¶ 87(d).)  \n \nBy “[p]roviding, assisting, supporting, and facilitating account planning including customer \nfollow up, account reminders, modification of marketing and sales plans, and cross -function \ncustomer service capabilities to improve outreach and services to traffickers.” ( Id. ¶ 87(h).)  \n \nBy “[p]roviding, a ssisting, supporting, and facilitating a custom Application Programming \nInterface (API) for use by Backpage employees, which is a software intermediary that allows two \napplications to talk to each other. This capability was for use by Backpage and did not enable \ncomputer access by the public or non- Backpage personnel.” ( Id. ¶ 87(i).)  \n \nBy “[p]roviding, assisting, supporting, and facilitating efficiency enhanced with automation, such \nas cutting the time it takes to email and nurture leads, scoring leads usin g customer parameters set \nby the customer using artificial intelligence (AI) and handling customer questions using \nautomation such as chatbots.” ( Id. ¶ 87(o).)  \n \nWhat all these allegations have in common is that they describe capabilities provided by Salesf orce’s \nsoftware and utilized by Backpage rather than actions  taken by Salesforce itself.   \n Case: 1:20-cv-02335 Document #: 105 Filed: 05/16/22 Page 9 of 35 PageID #:<pageID>10 \n (TAC ¶ 87(b) .) Put differently, Salesforce, through its software, provided multiple users access to \na set of enabling tools that allow those users to analyze, organize, arrange, transmit, and display \ncontent  provided by a third- party (here, Backpage). This description, which aligns with the \nstatutory definition, unambiguously establishes that Salesforce is an “interactive computer service.”  \nNonetheless, Plaintiffs argue that Salesforce has not establish ed that it is an interactive \ncomputer service because i t was not involved in the management of content posted to Backpage. \nInstead, Plaintiffs contend, Salesforce only managed relationships between Backpage and its customers —most of whom, Plaintiffs maintain, were sex traffickers. But managing those \nrelationsh ips did require Salesforce to analyze content —content provided by Backpage  about its \ncustomers. ( See, e.g., TAC ¶  87(f) (alleging that Salesforce “provid[ed], assist[ed], support[ed], \nand facilitat[ed] surveillance and analysis of customer and user activit y with regard to access to \nads”).)  \nTo avoid this result , Plaintiffs ask the Court to read an additional  requirement in to the \nstatutory definition of interactive service provider. Specifically, Plaintiffs appear to take the position that § 230 only covers providers who host publicly accessible platforms. Salesforce’s applications, of course, were only available internally to Backpage employees. But nothing in either the statutory text or case law  support s this vie w. It is true, as Plaintiffs note, that §  230 most \ncommonly has been applied to bar  liability for defendants who host public platforms. See, e.g., \nBennett v. Google , LLC , 882 F.3d 1163, 1167–68 (D.C. Cir. 2018) (applying § 230 to bar claims \nagainst a public internet search engine); Klayman v. Zuckerberg , 753 F.3d 1354, 1356–58 (D.C. \nCir. 2014) (applying § 230 to bar claims against a social networking website). But the mere fact that the defendants that have successfully involved § 230 to avoid liability have been  publicly Case: 1:20-cv-02335 Document #: 105 Filed: 05/16/22 Page 10 of 35 PageID #:<pageID>11 \n accessible does not mean that such accessibility is a statutory requirement. See, e.g., Fields v. \nTwitter, Inc. , 217 F. Supp. 3d 1116, 1128 (N.D. Ca l. 2016) ( “[A] number of courts have applied \nthe CDA to bar claims predicated on a defendant’s transmission of nonpublic messages, and have \ndone so without questioning whether the CDA applies in such circumstances.” (citi ng cases) ), \naff’d on other grounds , 881 F.3d 739 (9th Cir. 2018) ).  \nZango v. Kaspersky Lab, Inc., 568 F.3d 1169 (9th Cir. 2009), to which both Plaintiffs and \nSalesforce cite, is instructive . In Zango, the plaintiff “propose[d] a gloss on ‘interactive computer \nservice’ that would construe a computer service as ‘interactive’ only if it enables people to access the Internet or access content found on the Internet.” Id. at 1175. Based on that construction, the defendant, which distributed malware software, would not fall under § 230’s definition. Id. at 1172. The Ninth Circuit , however, “decline[d] to read the statute so narrowly,” explaining that, \n“[a]s written, §  230 does not limit the definition of ‘interactive compute r service’ to services that \nprovide access to the Internet; rather, its singular requirement is for ‘access by multiple users to a \ncomputer server.’” Id. at 1175–76 (quoting § 230(f)(2)). Th e Court finds this analysis persuasive. \nAfter all, if an interacti ve computer service  is defined as  “includ ing specifically a service or \nsystem that provides access to the Internet,” it is not necessarily  limited to such services. 47 \nU.S.C. § 230(f)(2). And  in any event, as alleged, Salesforce does  provide access to its applications \nthrough the Internet. ( See TAC ¶  45 n.20 (citing to “Sales Cloud Pricing” when describing the \nsoftware edition used by Backpage) .) \nStill, Plaintiffs insist that because Salesforce was not involved in managing the content \nunderlying their claims —the ads posted on Backpage by G.G.’s sex trafficker —§ 230’s \nprotections cannot apply to Salesforce . According to Plaintiffs’ reading, § 230’s references to \n“content” must be understood not as content generally but rather as the content underlying the Case: 1:20-cv-02335 Document #: 105 Filed: 05/16/22 Page 11 of 35 PageID #:<pageID>12 \n claim against the defendant. Using this logic, Backpage, as the actual host of the content in \nquestion, would be considered a provider of interactive computer services, while Salesforce, whose applications supported Backpage’s internal operations, would not. But the text of § 230 imposes no such requirement —an interactive computer service must simply permit users to \ninteract  with content , without any reference to wh at content. Without a textual basis or supporting \ncase law, t he Co urt declines to impose unilaterally a requirement that whether a defendant is an \n“interactive computer service” under §  230 depends  on the nature of the claims against it.  \nPlaintiffs further assert  that, at the very least, it is too soon to decide the issue of whether \nSalesforce qualifies as an interactive computer service. Plaintiffs contend that even if the Court is unable to hold that Salesforce is not  an interactive computer service as a matter of law, discovery \nis still necessary to resolve the question of whether Salesforce  in fact  is  one. But the allegations \nof the complaint make clear that Salesforce’s technology allows users (Backpage employees) to manipulate content in a variety of ways , including by analyzing and organizing customer data and \ntransmitting messages between Backpage and potential customers. When questioned during oral argument about the benefits of allowing limited discovery on this issue, Plaintiffs suggested that it could provide more insight into w hat Salesforce’s software was doing. Yet the Plaintiffs already \nhave provided a thorough overview of Salesforce’s technology in the TAC , suggesting that they \nare already well -acquainted with the capabilities of the software. Similarly, the TAC contains \ndetailed factual allegations regarding discussions between Salesforce and Backpage executives , \nincluding quotations from emails between Backpage and individuals associated with Salesforce. Given the detailed allegations already contained within the complaint,  as well as Plaintiffs \ninability to specify how discovery would shift the analysis, the Court finds it possible to rule on \nthis issue without further inquiry.  Case: 1:20-cv-02335 Document #: 105 Filed: 05/16/22 Page 12 of 35 PageID #:<pageID>13 \n Accordingly, for the reasons discussed above, the Court holds that , as a matter of law \nbased on the allegations of the TAC , Salesforce is an interactive computer service.  \nB. Salesforce as a Publisher  \nSection 230 does not, however, provide a complete defense for any type of claim against \nan interactive computer service. Craigslist , 519 F.3d at 669–70 ( explain ing that “ § 230(c)  as a \nwhole cannot be understood as a general prohibition of civil liability for web- site operators and \nother online content hosts ,” and noting, as an example, that defendants may be liable for claims \nlike “contributory infringement if their system is designed to help people steal music” ). But if \nSalesforce can be liable only in a capacity as a publisher, then § 230 applies. Id .; see also City of \nChi. v. StubHub! Inc., 624 F.3d 363, 366 (7th Cir. 2010) (finding that a claim seeking a judgment \nthat a ticket reseller was responsible for collecting state taxes did not implicate §  230 because the \ntax in question “[did] not depend on who ‘publishes’ any information or is a ‘speaker’”) . Whether \na claim treats a defendant as the publisher of third -party content “ does not depend on the form of \nthe asserted cause of action; rather, it depends on whether the cause of action necessarily requir es \nthat the defendant be treated as the publisher or speaker of content provided by another.” Jane \nDoe No. 1 v. Backpage.com LLC , 817 F.3d 12, 19 (1st Cir. 2016) (citing cases); see also Cohen v. \nFacebook, Inc., 252 F. Supp. 3d 140, 156 (E.D.N.Y. 2017) (explaining that §  230 “ is implicated \nnot only by claims that  explicitly point to third party content but also by claims which, though \nartfully pleaded to avoid direct reference, implicitly require recourse to that content to establish liability or implicate a defendant’s role, broadly defined, in publishing or excluding third party [c]ommunications”).  \nHere, Plaintiffs seek to hold Salesforce liable for harm caused to G.G. by her trafficking \nvia ads posted on Backpage. In Salesforce’s view, this is a straightf orward example of a claim Case: 1:20-cv-02335 Document #: 105 Filed: 05/16/22 Page 13 of 35 PageID #:<pageID>14 \n treating a defendant as a publisher; after all, Plaintiffs are attempting to hold Salesforce \nresponsible for the harmful effects of third -party content posted online. For their part, Plaintiffs  \nargue that because Salesforce, even if it is an interactive computer service, did not make any \ndecisions regarding the editing, monitoring, or publishing of the harmful advertisements, it is not being treated  as a publisher. Plaintiffs suggest that Salesfo rce should have monitored Backpage’s \nuse of Salesforce’s tools and deleted or restricted access to its software in response to illegal activity —in other words, that Salesforce acted as publisher regarding Backpage’s content on \nSalesforce’s own applications . (See TAC ¶  47.) And at least some of Plaintiffs ’ claims relate to \nBackpage’s use of Salesforce’s CRM software to engage in online marketing communications with sex traffickers to expand Backpage’s customer base. ( See TAC ¶¶ 87(c), (g), (h), (k).) But \nthose claims would also treat Salesforce as a publisher, as courts have consistently found that § 230 bars imposing liability on a provider of messaging or e -mail services for content and \nactivities conducted via those services. See Fields , 217 F.  Supp. 3d at 1127–29. \nPlaintiffs’ remaining allegations can be summed up thusly: Backpage, far from acting as a \nneutral platform for advertisements, actively sought out sex traffickers. To do so, Backpage worked with the sex traffickers to ensure that the advertisements, including those featuring G.G., were “sanitized” to hide their illegality. And Salesforce, even though it was aware that \nBackpage’s business model was based on sex trafficking, provided tools and support for those tools to help Backpage e xpand its customer base. But while Plaintiffs, perhaps recognizing that  \nthe claims at their core rest upon the publication of an advertisement, repeatedly emphasize Salesforce’s actions  in their briefing , the TAC itself does not suggest that  Salesforce ever took \nany actions regarding the harmful advertisements or the sex traffickers. ( See TAC  ¶ 40 \n(“Salesforce provided personalized support for the technological tools and instruments that made Case: 1:20-cv-02335 Document #: 105 Filed: 05/16/22 Page 14 of 35 PageID #:<pageID>15 \n it possible for Backpage  to engage in the internet based on- line selling of sex, sex trafficking, and \ncompelled prostitution.” ) (emphasis added ).)3 Put simply,  Plaintiffs seek to hold Salesforce liable \nfor the fact that Backpage used Salesforce software to cultivate sex traffickers as customers and \ngrow the website’s reach among sex traffickers, ultimately resulting in the posting of the advertisement  featuring G.G. This is a quintessential claim covered by §  230: it seeks to impose \nliability on an interactive computer service for third -party content that was published on an online \nplatform.  \nThe Court’s finding does not, as Plaintiffs suggest, abandon the statutory language of \n§ 230 by asking not whether the claims treat Salesforce as the “publisher or speaker” of third -\nparty content but whether the third -party content is a “necessary part” of the facts. Plaintiffs rely \non Doe v. Internet Brands  for the  proposition that “the CDA does not provide a general immunity \nagainst all claims derived from third -party content.” 824 F.3d 846, 853 (9th Cir. 2016). But  \nInternet Brands  itself makes clear that applying § 230 to Plaintiffs’ claims does not contradict  this \nprinciple. In Internet Brands , the defendant was the operator of a networking web site for models. \nId. at 848. Somehow, through an outside source, the defendant became aware of two men that \nwere using the site to prey on women. Id.  at 849. The plaintiff, one of the women victimized by \nthose men, sued  the website owner for failing to warn users about the presence of predators on its \nsite and the risk of being victimized . Id. In finding that § 230 did not apply to preclude liability, \nthe Ninth Circuit emphasized that , while the publishing of the plaintiff’s data on the networking \nwebsite was a but -for cause of her injuries, in many ways “publishing activity is a but -for cause of \n \n3 It might be the case that Backpage should be held “liable for creating and posting, inducing another to \npost, or otherwise activel y participating in the posting” of the harmful statement. Huon v. Denton, 841 \nF.3d 733, 742 (7th Cir. 2016). But there is no allegation that Salesforce  ever solicited advertisements, or \nedited them, or took any action to participate in the posting of G.G.’ s advertisement .  Case: 1:20-cv-02335 Document #: 105 Filed: 05/16/22 Page 15 of 35 PageID #:<pageID>16 \n just about everything” with which the defendant website was involved. Id.  at 853. Because the \nplaintiff’s claims were not for any content posted on the website , but rather for a failure to warn in \nwhich the duty breached did not require the defendant to take any action with regards to third-\nparty content posted on its site, the claims did not tre at the defendant as a publisher or speaker of \nsuch content. Id.  at 851.  \nBut here, Plaintiffs seek to hold Salesforce liable for the fact that G.G. was trafficked via \nadvertisements placed on Backpage by her trafficker. Although Plaintiffs try to frame the ir claims \nin terms of Salesforce’s actions (namely, helping Backpage expand the site on which G.G.’s trafficker would eventually place the advertisements trafficking G.G.), Plaintiffs do not contend that they would have a claim against Salesforce regardles s of what was posted to Backpage . See \nJane Does 1 –50 v. Salesforce., No. A159566 at 13–14 (Cal. Ct. App. Dec. 30, 2021) (not \ndesignated for publication) (holding that plaintiffs, alleging they “were injured by online advertising, placed on Backpage by pimps and traffickers, that caused them to enter sex \ntrafficking and be  sexually exploited,” brought claims that “seek to treat Salesforce as the \npublisher of ads created by a third party” and are barred by § 230). Nor can Plaintiffs point to any distinct duty that Salesforce owed to Plaintiffs untethered from the third -party  content. C ompare \nLemmon v. Snap, Inc., 995 F.3d 1085, 1092 (9th Cir. 2021) (explaining that claims for negligent product -design against a mobile app developer sought to “hold [the defendant] liable for its role in \nviolating its distinct duty to design a  reasonably safe product.”) In effect, Salesforce could not \nsatisfy its “alleged obligation” to Plaintiffs without altering either the content generated by Backpage by monitoring the use of its software and forbidding its use in certain ways, or by insistin g that Backpage only hosted certain content on its own site. In other words, Plaintiffs Case: 1:20-cv-02335 Document #: 105 Filed: 05/16/22 Page 16 of 35 PageID #:<pageID>17 \n claims are predicated on the notion that Salesforce should be held responsible for the existence of \nthird -party content , her adverti sements —that is, they treat Salesfor ce as a publisher.  \nPlaintiffs protest what they deem  an “overbroad” interpretation of § 230. But as the \nSeventh Circuit has recognized, “Section 230(c)(1) is general,” and “a law’s scope often differs from its genesis.” Craigslist , 519 F.3d at 671–72 (applying § 230 to bar claims brought against an \nonline service provider for allegedly violating the Fair Housing Act by posting discriminatory notices). And other courts have applied § 230 to bar claims similar to those here, including claims directly against  Backpage for sex traffickin g on the basis that Backpage’s decisions about various \nposting requirements were done with the express purpose of facilitating sex trafficking. See Jane Doe No. 1, 817 F.3d at 20 –22 (holding that , although the plaintiffs tried to argue that §  230 did \nnot apply “by claiming Backpage’s decisions about what measures to implement deliberately attempt to make sex trafficking easier, this is a distinction without a difference” and finding that the claims  “necessarily treat[ed] the website as a publisher or speaker of content provided by third \nparties , and, thus, are precluded by section 230(c)(1)”).  \nIn fact, it is the very breadth of § 230’s coverage that motivated Congress to pass FOSTA  \nfor the express purpose of pre serving claims such as these by exempting them from the \nprotections of  § 230. See FOSTA, Pub. L. No. 115 -164, 132 Stat. 1253, 1253 (2018) (explaining \nthat “clarification” of §  230 was “warranted to ensure” t hat § 230 did not provide protection to \nwebsites that unlawful ly promote and facilitate sex traffickers). That Congress felt the need to \namend §  230 to include express exemptions for certain sex trafficking claims suggests that such \nclaims would otherwise be covered by § 230. Put simply, courts have coalesced around an understanding of § 230 that “grant[s] sweeping protection.”\n4 Malwarebytes, Inc. v. Enigma \n \n4 In advocating for a narrower reading of § 230, Plaintiffs cite a non -precedential statement by Justice \nThomas in connection with a denial of certiorari in which he suggests that, in an appropriate case, the Case: 1:20-cv-02335 Document #: 105 Filed: 05/16/22 Page 17 of 35 PageID #:<pageID>31 \n [the defendan t website] not only knew that human trafficking was occurring on its website, but \nthat [the defendant website] was part of an active conspiracy with plaintiff’s traffickers to traffic \nplaintiff ,” and denying a similar motion to dismiss by the defendant hot el where the complaint \nalleged that hotel staff contacted the plaintiff to request that she be more discrete with her activities and that police had spoken with the hotel regarding the plaintiff being a minor (emphasis added)) ; compare Lundstrom v. Choice Hotels Int’l, Inc., No. 21- cv-00619- PAB -SKC , 2021 WL \n5579117, at *8–9 (D. Colo. Nov. 30, 2021) (finding that allegations that a defendant hotel franchisor was “on notice about the prevalence of sex trafficking generally at its hotels and in the hotel indus try” was “not sufficient to show that the defendant should have known about what \nhappened to [the] plaintiff”  and thus could not sustain § 1595 claim).  \nIn short, to bring a claim for liability under § 1595, a plaintiff must plausibly allege that a \ndefenda nt (1) knowingly benefited, either financially or otherwise, from (2) participation in a \nventure, although such participation need not necessarily be direct participation in the sex \ntrafficking, and that (3) the person knew or should have known violated § 1591 as to the plaintiff. \nD. Application to Plaintiffs’ Claims Against Salesforce  \nWith this understanding of the elements for a beneficiary claim under § 1595 in mind, the \nCourt now considers whether Plaintiffs have stated such a claim against Salesforce and concludes that they have not. Specifically, Plaintiffs have failed to allege plausibly that Salesforce knew, or should have known, about G.G.’s specific trafficking or any of the advertisements trafficking her on Backpage. Compare Twitter , 555 F. Supp. 889, 925 (finding that plaintiffs adequately pleaded \na § 1595 claim where they alleged that the defendant website was alerted to the existence of \nvideos involving the plaintiffs and provided evidence that the plaintiffs were underage in response to a requ est for more information). Plaintiffs do not contend that they have pleaded such Case: 1:20-cv-02335 Document #: 105 Filed: 05/16/22 Page 31 of 35 PageID #:<pageID>32 \n knowledge, instead relying on their argument that § 1595 does not require that Salesforce have \nany knowledge or involvement as to G.G’s specific trafficking. But, as has alrea dy been \ndiscussed, this Court disagrees with that approach and finds that § 1595 requires a defendant to have participated in a venture that the defendant knew or should have known was involved in sex trafficking of the plaintiff , not sex trafficking more generally. Thus, because Plaintiffs have not \nalleged that Salesforce had actual or constructive knowledge of G.G.’s trafficking, they have not adequately pleaded that element of a §  1595 claim.  \nPlaintiffs also have not adequately alleged that Salesforce “participated” in the venture \nwith Backpage that trafficked G.G. C onsidering the TAC as a whole, Plaintiffs allege that \nBackpage used Salesforce’s CRM software to cultivate and expand a customer b ase of sex \ntraffickers, including G.G.’s  trafficker . At times, the TAC appears to suggest that Salesforce itself \ntook actions to assist Backpage’s efforts. ( See TAC ¶  41 (“Salesforce was the driving force that \nenabled Backpage t o scale its operations and i ncrease the trafficking conducted on Backpage.”).) \nBut the factual allegations directly underlying these claims make it clear that Salesforce provided the technology (and corresponding technological support) that Backpage utilized to grow its own business. ( See Id. (“By providing technology, implementation skills, and ongoing support that all \nconstitute affirmative acts by Salesforce that encouraged the wrongdoing in which Backpage.com was engaged.”).) In other words, while Salesforce may have provided the tools that Backpage \nused to build a business based on sex trafficking, Salesforce did not take part in the construction of the business itself.  \nAllegations concerning Salesforce’s role in marketing Backpage to sex traffickers \nillustrate how the actions Pl aintiffs allege Salesforce took to assist and support Backpage in its sex \ntrafficking venture are, in actuality, actions that Backpage took using Salesforce ’s CRM software. Case: 1:20-cv-02335 Document #: 105 Filed: 05/16/22 Page 32 of 35 PageID #:<pageID>33 \n The TAC describes Salesforce’s CRM technology as providing companies “access to a \ncoordinated set of applications tailored to its business model, including applications \nthat . . . manage all marketing functions.” ( Id. ¶ 31.) Plaintiffs then allege that Salesforce \n“facilitat[ed] and provid[ed] support for direct marketing campaigns for Ba ckpage  to expand \nBackpage’s sex trafficking venture.” (TAC ¶  87(c).) But even in this allegation, Plaintiffs \nacknowledge that it is Backpage, not Salesforce, that actually expanded the operations through marketing activities.  ( See also Pls.’ Resp. to Mot. to Dismiss at 25, Dkt. No. 66 (“Among other \nthings, Salesforce facilitated trafficking through Backpage by assisting Backpage in its marketing efforts that allowed Backpage to solicit sex traffickers and their victims .”) The mere fact that \nSalesforce ’s software played a critical role in Backpage’s expansion, indeed, even if such \nexpansion would not be possible without the capabilities provided by that software, is not enough to demonstrate Salesforce’s own participation in any venture w ith Backpage. See United States v. \nPapagno, 639 F.3d 1093, 1098 (D.C. Cir. 2011) (explaining the difference between “assistance” \nand “participation,” noting that insurers who cover operations do not participate in that operation, fans who cheer the home team may help the team win but do not participate in the game, and engineers who design soldiers’ weapons may support the war effort but do not participate in the war). Thus, to the extent Plaintiffs’ claims rest on any actions taken by Backpage using Salesf orce’s software, they have not adequately alleged Salesforce “participated” in any venture.  \nPlaintiffs contend that they have plausibly alleged that Salesforce did not just sell \nBackpage off -the-shelf software but instead also offered Backpage “personalized support.” Yet, \nalthough the complaint contains multiple mentions of Salesforce providing Backpage with “personalized services tailored specifically to the needs of its illegal business,” Plaintiffs provide no examples of these services, or description, or even suggestion, of how Salesforce altered its Case: 1:20-cv-02335 Document #: 105 Filed: 05/16/22 Page 33 of 35 PageID #:<pageID>34 \n software to better facilitate sex trafficking. (TAC ¶  46.) For instance, Plaintiffs emphasize that \nSalesforce provided technical support in moving some of Backpage’s operations overseas —\nostensibly to help B ackpage avoid U.S. law enforcement. But even assuming that Backpage’s fear \nof criminal liability motivated its desire to have a duplicate copy of its system, the TAC contains \nno facts indicating that Salesforce was aware of this motivation, nor do Plaintif fs explain how, \ngiven that the complaint alleges that G.G. was trafficked on backpage.com (and not any overseas website), this duplicate copy relates to their claims.  \nSimilarly, Plaintiffs point to the allegation that an in -house Salesforce executive \nrecommended that, based on Backpage’s needs (which Plaintiffs assume to be related to sex \ntrafficking and prostitution), Backpage use Salesforce’s Enterprise CRM edition. Plaintiffs emphasize that the Enterprise CRM edition is described as “fully customizable, ” suggesting that \nthis means that Salesforce then took action to tailor the software to better meet Backpage’s needs (which, Plaintiffs allege, were solely related to sex trafficking). Yet the mere fact that the \nEnterprise CRM edition is customizable (that is, capable of being customized) does not, without more, support a reasonable inference that Salesforce actually customized the software to meet Backpage’s needs. In sum, Plaintiffs have failed to allege facts supporting that Salesforce “took part in” Backpage’s sex -trafficking venture.  \nThus, for the reasons stated above,  the Court finds that Plaintiffs have failed to state a \nclaim against Salesforce for beneficiary liability under §  1595. If this were the only basis for \ndismissal, the Court would consider dismissal without prejudice to allow Plaintiffs one final opportunity to amend their complaint to state a viable claim.  But as discussed above, the allegations of the TAC establish that Salesforce is entitled to dismissal based on the affirmative Case: 1:20-cv-02335 Document #: 105 Filed: 05/16/22 Page 34 of 35 PageID #:<pageID>35 \n \ndefense in § 230 of the Communications Decency Act as well. Accordingly, the dismissal is with \nprejudice.  \nCONCLUSION \n \nAccordingly, this case is dismissed with prejudice because Salesforce is protected from \nliability under § 230 of the Communications Decency Act. Even if § 230 did not apply, Plaintiffs \nhave failed  to plead adequately the required elements of a claim for beneficiary liability under \n§ 1595. The Clerk will enter final judgment in favor of Salesforce.  \n \nENTERED:  \n \n \n \nDated :  May 16, 2022  __________________________ \n Andrea R.

Summary: In this District of New Jersey court case, the United States and the Attorneys General of 20 states alleged that Apple, Inc. engaged in anticompetitive practices to maintain its dominance in the smartphone and performance smartphone markets. The plaintiffs claim that Apple's restrictive policies on app development, particularly regarding super apps, cloud streaming apps, text messaging, smartwatches, and digital wallets, prevent fair competition and lead to the monopolization of these markets. Apple's motion to dismiss the case was denied by the court, allowing the case to proceed to further litigation.\n\n2. Key Legal Issue: Whether Apple is engaged in anticompetitive practices through its control over software application interfaces and other technologies, thereby violating federal and state antitrust laws by maintaining or attempting to maintain a monopoly in smartphone markets.\n\n3. Court's Holding: The court denied Apple's motion to dismiss, finding sufficient evidence in the amended complaint that Apple may have engaged in anticompetitive conduct and maintained monopoly power in the smartphone and performance smartphone markets. The court upheld the plaintiffs' standing to bring the case and found that the allegations of market definition and monopolistic behavior were sufficiently plausible for the litigation to proceed.\n\n4. ELI5 Explanation: The U.S. government and several states are suing Apple, accusing it of playing unfairly to stay the biggest player in the smartphone space. They say Apple makes it tough for app makers to create programs that work with other devices and even tougher for users to switch away from Apple's products. The judge said they have a valid point, at least enough to let them try to prove it in court, so the lawsuit will continue.",

BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY2\nThe underlying issue in this case is whether Apple has engaged in anticompetitive practices\nin violation of federal and state antitrust laws. Apple is a global technology company\nheadquartered in Cupertmo, California. (Am. Compl. ^ 19). The iPhone, Apple's signature\nproduct, is currently the dominant smartphone in the United States. (Icf. at ^ 20, 165, 172,181).\nAccording to the Amended Complaint, Apple maintains a market share of 65 percent m the\nsmartphone market and 70 percent in the performance smariphone market. (M at ^ 181).\nA. Applets Technology\nTo understand Plaintiffs' theories advanced in the Amended Complaint, the Court first\ndescribes the relevant technology. A smartphone is a type of mobile device that utilizes advanced\nhardware and software components to allow users to \"not only make phone calls, but allow users\nto listen to music, send text messages, take pictures, play games, access software for work, manage\ntheir finances, and browse the internet.\" (Id at ^ 148-49). These functions are provided through\nsoftware applications, also known as \"apps.\" (Id at ^ 158). In order for an app to run on a\nsmartphone, it must communicate with the smarfcphone's operating system (\"OS\") through\napplication programming interfaces (\"APls\"), (M) Apps that inn with a particular smartphone's\nOS are native apps. {Id. at ^ 159). With respect to Apple, apps that run with Apple's iPhone\noperating system (\"iOS\") are considered native. (M) Third-party developers can also use APIs for\nthe iPhone's iOS to create apps for the iPhone. (M at ^158). They can use \"middleware\" software,\nwhich \"provides similar APIs and functionality across a diverse set of operating systems and\ndevices[J\" to create \"cross-platform applications without having to write separate code for\nindividual operating systems or devices.\" (M at ^ 163). However, developers are bound by certain\n2 The following factual allegations are taken from the Amended Complamt that are accepted as true. Sheridan v. NGK\nMetals Corp,, 609 F.3d 239, 262 n.27 (3d Cir. 2010).Case 2:24-cv-04055-JXN-LDW     Document 283     Filed 06/30/25     Page 2 of 33 PageID:\n<pageID>policies imposed by Apple that allegedly restrict the developer's ability to standardize the app\nacross different OS. (Id. at ^ 41). Thus, the app must be approved by Apple to be published on\nApple's App Store. (Id)\nAccording to Plaintiffs, Apple harms competition by restricting certain cross-platform\ntechnologies that would make it easier for consumers and developers to purchase and develop\nproducts for devices outside of the Apple ecosystem. (M at ^ 41-42, 60-118). Plaintiffs allege\nthese restrictions affect five key categories: super apps, cloud-streammg apps, text messaging,\nsmartwatches, and digital wallets. (Id.)\ni. SuperApps\nA super app is middleware that runs multiple, smaller \"mini programs\" in one app,\neffectively consolidating access to different apps, experiences, content and services. (Id at ^ 61,\n63). By using a super app, consumers do not have to find an app in an app store, download the app,\nset up the app, and continually log into the app for each specific activity or function that they need.\n{Id. at ^ 62, 68). Rather, consumers can simply find, download, set up, and log into one app that\nhosts all the activities and functions that would otherwise require multiple, separate apps. (M)\nSuper apps work by utilizing standard programming languages that enable the app to be used on\n\"any web browser and on any device,\" including an iPhone. (Id. at ^ 61). Developers, therefore,\ndo not need to create apps using a specific device's API. (Id) This access and the functionality of\nsuper apps make them attractive and valuable to users. (M at ^ 62). However, because the same\napp can be accessed on different devices with low switching costs, super apps may decrease a\nuser's dependence on a specific device's operating system. (M at ^ 63, 66). For example, a user\nhas more choices when purchasing a new smartphone if the super app they rely on can be run just\nthe same on any smartphone. (Id. at 1] 64).Case 2:24-cv-04055-JXN-LDW     Document 283     Filed 06/30/25     Page 3 of 33 PageID:\n<pageID>Plaintiffs allege Apple limits super apps through its App Store Guidelines (M at ^ 67).\nSpecifically, Plaintiffs allege that Apple has \"effectively blocked\" developers from creating apps\nthat host mini programs by (1) requiring apps to display mini programs using text-only lists, (2)\npreventing apps from categorizing mini programs, and (3) blocking mini programs from accessing\nApple's in-app payment system and using other payment systems. (Id. at ^ 67-70).\nit. Cloud StreaminR Apps\nCloud streaming apps allow users to \"run a computaiionally intensive program without\nhaving to process or store the program on the smartphone itself.\" (M at ^ 72). Rather, the\nsmartphone utilizes \"the computing power of a remote server, which inns the program and streams\nthe results back to the phone.\" (M) This allows developers \"to bring cutting-edge technologies\nand services to smartphone consumers—including gaming and interactive artificial intelligence\nservices—even if their smartphone includes hardware that is less powerful than an iPhone.\" (M)\nFor users, the usage of cloud gaming apps would allow for \"rich gaming experiences\" without\nneeding powerful and expensive hardware. {Id.} For developers, cloud platforms can serve as\nmiddleware to develop a single app that works across different smartphone's OS and \"provides\nmore and simpler options for offering subscriptions, collecting payments, and distributing software\nupdates.\" (M at ^ 73). Plaintiffs allege that if Apple permitted cloud streaming apps, it could be\nforced \"to compete more vigorously against rivals\" and reduce users need to purchase expensive\nphones with advanced hardware. (M at ^ 79).\nAccording to the Amended Complaint, Apple has prevented third-party developers from\noffering cloud gaming subscription services as a native app on the iPhone. (M at D 75). Rather,\nApple has imposed upon developers the \"onerous requirement\" whereby any cloud streaming\ngame or update thereto must \"be submitted as a stand-alone app for approval by Apple,\" whichCase 2:24-cv-04055-JXN-LDW     Document 283     Filed 06/30/25     Page 4 of 33 PageID:\n<pageID>has \"increased the cost of releasing games on the iPhone and limited the number of games\"\ndevelopers can make available to users. (M at ^ 76). Apple also requires developers to expend\n\"considerable time and resources re-engineering apps\" to meet its \"rules and restrictions\" for cloud\ngames. (M at ^78).\niii. Text Messaging\nImportantly, mobile phones allow the exchange of Short Message Service (\"SMS\") text\nmessages between other mobile phones, including smartphones. (Id. at ^ 45, 83). Apple Messages\n(\"iMessage\") is a native app that allows SMS messages to be exchanged between iPhones and\nother mobile phones. (M at ^ 80, 85). SMS, though, does not support modem messaging features\nor over the top protocols (\"OTT\"), like sending large files, editing messages, and reacting with\nicons, and encryption, typing indicators, read receipts, and disappearing messages. (M at fl 83,\n84). With respect to iMessage, Plaintiffs allege Apple designates the APIs needed to implement\nSMS as 'private/\" which prevents third-party developers from combining the \"'text-to-anyone'\nfLmctionality ofSMS with the advanced features of OTT messaging.\" (M at ^ 85). Thus, iMessage\ndoes not allow text messages to be received by or sent to cross-platform messaging alternatives.\n{Id.} Rather, text messages from cross-platform messaging apps can only be received by or sent\nfrom iPhones if all the parties to the text exchange have downloaded the respective cross-platform\nmessaging app. {Id) In contrast, IMessage allows users to send messages to anyone by entering\ntheir phone number because it \"incorporates SMS and OTT messaging.\" (M)\nPlaintiffs allege Apple inhibits developers' ability to provide a quality cross-platform\nmessaging app, as compared to iMessage, by (1) preventing developers from combining SMS with\nOTT, (2) stopping thh'd-party messaging apps from operating in the background, (3) preventing\naccess to video previews before answering a video call, and (4) preventing the use of modemCase 2:24-cv-04055-JXN-LDW     Document 283     Filed 06/30/25     Page 5 of 33 PageID:\n<pageID>features on text messages sent from other smartphones. (M at ^ 85-90). Plaintiffs further allege\nthat Apple has created barriers in communication between iPhones and other smartphones to drive\nconsumers towards the iPhone and to make it harder for current iPhone users to switch\nsmartphones. (Id, at \\ 90).\niv. Smartwatches\nSmartwatches are wrist-worn devices that allow users to access apps and perform other\nfunctions like responding to notifications, making mobile payments, and tracking health data. {Id.\nat T[ 95). A smartwatch must be paired with a smartphone to optimize its functionality, so it is\nimperative when buying a smartwatch that the user's smartphone is capable of pairing. (Id) Third-\nparty smartwatches are compatible with smartphones by requiring users to download an app to\ntheir smartphone and then connect the app and watch via Bluetooth. {Id. at ^ 97). Apple Watch,\nApple's smart watch, does not have this functionality and can only be paired with an iPhone. {M.\nat ^ 96). However, third-party smartwatches conversely, can pair to the iPhone. (M at ^ 100).\nPlaintiffs allege that once consumers purchase an Apple Watch, they are less inclined to\nswitch to a different smartphone because the Apple Watch is not compatible with other\nsmartphones. (M at ^ 94, 96). According to the Amended Complaint, Apple degrades third-party\nsmartwatohes' functionality through \"its technical and contractual control of critical APIs\" by (1)\ndepriving iPhone users with third-party smartwatches of the ability to respond to notifications, (2)\ninhibiting third-party smartwatches from maintaining reliable connection to the iPhone, and (3)\nundermining the performance of third-party smartwatches that comiect directly with a cellular\nnetwork^, at f( 100-03).Case 2:24-cv-04055-JXN-LDW     Document 283     Filed 06/30/25     Page 6 of 33 PageID:\n<pageID>v. Digital Wallets\nDigital wallets are \"apps that allow a user to store and use passes and credentials, including\ncredit cards, personal identification, movie tickets, and car keys, in a single app\" and can be used\nfor transactions in mobile apps and websites. (M at ^ 105). According to the Amended Complaint,\nif developers could create cross-digital platforms, users would be able to \"use the same wallet,\nwith the same cards, IDs, payment histories, peer-to-peer payment contacts, and other information\"\namong different devices, thereby making it easier for users to switch smartphones. (M, at 1[ 109).\nApple Wallet, Apple's proprietaiy digital wallet, is on the IPhone and it incorporates Apple\nPay, Apple's proprietary payment system, to <cprocess[] digital payments on the web, in apps, and\nat merchant points of sale. (Id. at ^ 107). It utilizes near-field communication (\"NFC\") hardware\nto provide tap-to-pay. (M at ^ 109). However, Plaintiffs contend that Apple exerts its smartphone\nmonopoly by precluding banks, merchants, and other parties from using NFC to facilitate tap-to-\npay and the ability to \"develop[] better payment products and services for iPhone users.\" (Id. at ^\n111-12).\nBeyond not allowing others to utilize NFC, Apple impedes and undermines the capabilities\nof digital wallets by restricting others from offering the ability to authenticate digital payment\noptions during online checkouts, thereby limiting third-party wallets' ability \"to provide a simple,\nfast, and comprehensive solution to purchasing.\" (Id. at ^j 116). Further, Apple blocks other digital\nwallets from serving as an alternative in-app payment, which prevents these wallets from\nimproving users' experiences by including \"use of rewards points in purchasing, digital receipts,\nreturns, loyalty programs, and digital coupons for purchases of relevant subscriptions and digital\ngoods.\" {M. at T| 117).Case 2:24-cv-04055-JXN-LDW     Document 283     Filed 06/30/25     Page 7 of 33 PageID:\n<pageID>B. Procedural HistoxT\nOn March 21, 2024, Plaintiffs initiated this antitrust action against Apple. {See ECF No.\n1). On June 11 , 2024, Plaintiffs filed an Amended Complaint which added Indiana, Massachusetts,\nNevada, and Washington as Plaintiffs and a claim for relief under Tennessee state law. (See\ngenerally Am. CompL). In total, the Amended Complaint raises seven claims for relief; (1)\nmonopolization of the performance smartphone market in the United States (First Claim for\nRelief); (2) attempted monopolization of the performance smartphone market in the United States\n(Second Claim for Relief); (3) monopolizatlon of the smartphone market in the United States\n(Third Claim for Relief); (4) attempted monopolization of the smartphone market in the United\nStates (Fourth Claim for Relief); (5) violation of the New Jersey Antitrust Act, NJ. Stat. Aim. §\n56:9-1, etseq. (Fifth Claim for Relief); (6) violation of the Wisconsin Antitrust Act, Wis. Stat. Ch.\n133.03., efseq. (Sixth Claim for Relief); and (7) violation ofthe Tennessee Trade Practices Act,\nTenn. Code Ami. § 47-25-101, ef seq. (Seventh Claim for Relief). (See jd)\nOn August 1, 2024, Apple filed a motion to dismiss the Amended Complaint pursuant to\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). (ECF No. 86) (\"Br.\"). Plaintiffs opposed the motion\n(ECF No. 106) (\"Opp'n), to which Apple replied. (ECF No. 169) (\"Reply\"). This matter is now\nripe for consideration.3\nII. LEGAL STANDARD\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) governs motions to dismiss for \"failure to state a\nclaim upon which relief can be granted.\" For a complaint to survive dismissal under the Rule, it\nmust contain sufficient factual matter to state a claim that is plausible on its face. Ashcroft v. Iqbal^\n556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) (citing Bell Ati. Corp. v. Twombty, 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007)). A claim\n3 The Court has also considered Plaintiffs' notice of supplemental authority (ECF No. 255) and Apple's response\nthereto. (ECF No. 258).Case 2:24-cv-04055-JXN-LDW     Document 283     Filed 06/30/25     Page 8 of 33 PageID:\n<pageID>is facially plausible \"when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the\nreasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.\" Id. Although the\nplausibility standard \"does not impose a probability requirement, it does require a pleading to show\nmore than a sheer possibility that a defendant has acted unlawfully.\" Connelly v. Lane Constr.\nCorp., 809 F.3d 780, 786 (3d Cir. 2016) (citation modified). As a result, a plaintiff must \"allege\nsufficient facts to raise a reasonable expectation that discovery will uncover proof of [his or] her\nclaims.\" M at 789.\nIn evaluating the sufficiency of a complaint, district courts must separate the factual and\nlegal elements. Fowler v. UPMC Shadyside, 578 F.3d 203, 210-11 (3d Cir. 2009). Restatements\nof a claim's elements are legal conclusions, and therefore, not entitled to a presumption oftmtii.\nBwfch v. Milberg Factors, Inc., 662 F.3d 212, 224 (3d Cir. 2011). The Court, however, \"must\naccept all of the complaint's well-pleaded facts as true[.j\" Fouler, 578 F.3d at 210. Even if\nplausibly pled, however, a complaint will not withstand a motion to dismiss if the facts alleged do\nnot state \"a legally cognizable cause of action.\" Turner v. J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., No. 14-7148,\n2015 WL 12826480, at n (D.NJ. Jan. 23, 2015).\nTo determine a complaint s sufficiency, the Third Circuit requires a three-part inquiry: (1)\nthe court must first recite the elements that must be pled in order to state a claim; (2) the court\nmust then determine which allegations in the complaint are merely conclusory and therefore need\nnot be given an assumption of truth; and (3) the court must \"assume the[ ] veracity\" ofwell-pleaded\nfactual allegations and ascertain whether they plausibly \"give rise to an entitlement for relief.\"\nSantiago v. Warminster Twp., 629 F.3d 121, 130 (3d Cir. 2010) (citation modified).Case 2:24-cv-04055-JXN-LDW     Document 283     Filed 06/30/25     Page 9 of 33 PageID:\n<pageID>III. DISCUSSION\nApple moves to dismiss the Amended Complaint on multiple grounds. First, Apple\ncontends the monopolization claims fail because the Amended Complaint fails to allege, (i)\nexclusionary conduct and instead only challenges Apple's lawful refusals to deal; (u) substantial\nanticompetitive effects in the smartphone market; or (iii) Apple's maintenance of monopoly power\nin any relevant market* (See Br. at 18-46).4 Second, Apple argues the attempted monopolization\nclaims fail because the Amended Complaint does not plead Apple's specific intent to monopolize\nor a dangerous probability of achieving monopoly power. (See id at 46). Third, Apple contends,\neven if the monopollzation and attempted monopolization claims were to survive, the Court must\ndismiss the \"monopoly playbook\" allegations that broadly reference other products and services\noffered by Apple but are unrelated to Plaintiffs theory of harm. (See id. at 46-48). Finally, Apple\nargues the Plaintiff States lack standing to pursue their claims through either their sovereign\ncapacities or under a parens patriae theory. (See id, at 40 n.6). Plaintiffs oppose each of these\narguments. {See Opp'n at 10-40). The Court addresses each argument in turn.\nA. The Amended Complaint Adequately Alleges Monopolixation Claims Under\nSection 2 of the Sherman Act (First and Third Claims for Relief).\n\"Section 2 of the Sherman Act, in what [the Third Circuit] ha[s] called 'sweeping\nlanguage/ makes it unlawful to monopolize, attempt to monopolize, or conspire to monopolize,\ninterstate or international commerce.\"5 Broadcom Corp. v. Qualcomm Inc., 501 F.3d 297, 306 (3d\n4 For sake of clarity, when citing the parties' briefs, the Court cites to the page number listed in the ECF header. If\nthere is no page number listed in the ECF header, the Court cites to the page number listed in the respective document.\n5 Section 2 provides:\nEvery person who shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspu'e with any\nother person or persons, to monopolize any part of the trade or commerce among the several States,\nor with foreign nations, shall be deemed guilty of a felony, and, on conviction thereof, shall be\npunished by fme not exceeding $100,000,000 if a corporation, or, if any other person, $1,000,000,\nor by unprisonment not exceeding 10 years, or by both said punishments, in the discretion of the\ncourt,\n10Case 2:24-cv-04055-JXN-LDW     Document 283     Filed 06/30/25     Page 10 of 33 PageID:\n<pageID>Cir. 2007). A Section 2 monopoly violation consists of two elements: '\"(1) the possession of\nmonopoly power in the relevant market and (2) the willful acquisition or maintenance of that power\nas distinguished from growth or development as a consequence of a superior product, business\nacumen, or historic accident.'\" Queefi City Pizza v. Domino's Pizza, 124 F.3d 430, 437 (3d Cir.\n1997) (quotmgAspe}-t Skiing Co. v. Aspen Highlands Sknng Corp., 472 U.S. 585,596 n. 19 (1985)).\nThe parties dispute whether Plaintiffs have adequately alleged both elements. (See Br. at 18-46;\nOpp'n at 10-37). The Court addresses each element in turn.\n1. The Amended Complaint Adequately Alleges Apple Possesses Monopoly\nPower in the Smartphone and Performance Smartphone Markets.\nThe first element of a Sherman Act Section 2 claim is \"'the possession of monopoly power\nin the relevant market.^ Queen City Pizza, 124 F.3d at 437 (quoting Aspen Skimg, 472 U.S. at\n596 n. 19) (emphasis added). Under Section 2, courts must start by defining the relevant market\nbecause, \"[wjithout a definition of [the] market there is no way to measure [the defendant's] ability\nto lessen or destroy competition.\" Ohio v. Am. Express Co^ 585 U.S. 529, 543 (2018) (quoting\nWalker Process Equip., Inc. v. Food Mack & Chem, Corp., 382 U.S. 172, 177 (1965)); see also\nConcord Assocs., L.P. v. Ent. Props. Tr., 817 F.3d 46, 53 (2d Cir. 2016) (\"[The market definition]\nanalysis is equally applicable to claims made under Section [2] of the Sherman Act, because\n'without a definition of that market there is no way to measure the defendant's ability to lessen or\ndestroy competition.'\" (quoting Xerox Corp. v. Media Scis. Int'l, Inc., 511 F. Supp. 2d 372, 383\n(S.D.N.Y. 2007))); see also Queen City Pizza, 124 F.3d at 435 ('\"[A] plaintiff must identify the\nrelevant product and geographic markets and allege that the defendant exercises market power\nwithin those markets.1\" (quoting Queen City Pizza, Inc. v.

Accordingly, the Court begins its analysis with a discussion of the\nrelevant markets.\n1, The Relevant Product and Geographic Markets\nApple argues that Plaintiffs' relevant markets - smartphones and performance smartphones\nare not property defined.6 (Br. at 41 n.33). Plaintiffs counter that the Amended Complaint\nadequately pleads United States markets for smartphones and performance smartphones. (Opp'n\nat 11-13). The Court agrees.\nThe relevant market must be a market for particular products or services, the \"outer\nboundaries\" of which \"are determined by the reasonable interchangeability of use or the cross-\nelasticity of demand between the product itself and substitutes for it.\" Brown Shoe Co. v. U.S., 370\nU.S. 294, 325 (1962). \"However, within this broad market, well-defined submarkets may exist\nwhich, in themselves, constitute product markets for antitrust purposes.\" Id. (citing Umted States\nv. E. I. du Poni de Nemow's & Co., 353 U.S. 586, 593-95 (1957). The submarket's boundaries\n\"may be determined by examining such practical indicia as industry or public recognition of the\nsubmarket as a separate economic entity, the product's peculiar characteristics and uses, unique\nproduction facilities, distinct customers, distinct prices, sensitivity to price changes, and\nspecialized vendors.\" M.\n\"In most cases, proper market definition can be determined only after a factual inquiry into\nthe commercial realities faced by consumers.\" Queen City Pizza, 124 F.3d at 436 (citing Eastman\nKodak, 504 U.S. at 482); see also Hanover 3201 Realty, LLC v. Village Supermarkets, Inc., 806\nF.3d 162, 183 (3d Ch\\ 2015) (same). As such, courts typically decline to dismiss antitrust claims\n6 In its reply brief, Apple states that it \"disputes that the complaint defines a proper market but assumes that it has for\nthe purposes of this motion.\" (Reply at 12 n.3). Since Apples' arguments m its moving brief regarding its lack of\nmonopoly power directly reference the relevant markets identified by Plaintiffs, {see Br. at 41, 43), the Court will\naddress whether the Amended Complaint has adequately pled relevant product and geographic markets.\n12Case 2:24-cv-04055-JXN-LDW     Document 283     Filed 06/30/25     Page 12 of 33 PageID:\n<pageID>based on failure to plead the relevant market. Queen City Pizza, 124 F.3d at 436; see also Newcal\nIndus., Inc. v. Ikon Off. Sol., 513 F.3d 1038, 1045 (9th Cir. 2008) (\"[S]ince the validity of the\n'relevant market is typically a factual element rather than a legal element, alleged markets may\nsurvive scrutiny under Rule 12(b)(6) subject to factual testing by summary judgment or trial. )\n(citaiton modified); Netafmi Irrigation, Inc. v. Jain Irrigation, Inc., 562 F. Supp. 3d 1073, 1081\n(E.D. Cal. 2021) (explaining relevant market allegations are often able \"to survive scrutiny under\nRule 12(b)(6)\" because \"relevant market determinations are typically fact-intensive, with actual\n'inquiry into the commercial realities faced by consumers'\" (quoting High Tech. Careers v. Scm\nJose Mercury News, 996 F.2d 987, 990 (9th Cir. 1993))).\nHowever, \"there is no per se rule prohibiting dismissal on this basis, and plaintiffs have\nthe burden of defining the relevant market. Bayer Healihcare LLC v. Second Stone Enters. LLC,\nNo. 24-7618, 2025 WL 1531237, at *6 (D.NJ. May 29, 2025). Dismissal may be appropriate\nwhere a plaintiff: (1) \"fails to define its proposed relevant market with reference to the rule of\nreasonable interchangeabUity and cross-elasticity of demand\"; or (2) \"alleges a proposed relevant\nmarket that clearly does not encompass all interchangeable substitute products even when all\nfactual inferences are granted in plaintiffs favor.\" Queen Cily Pizza, 124 F.3d at 436-37\n(collecting cases). Accepting the factual allegations underlying Plaintiffs' monopolization claims\nas true, the Court must determine whether the alleged markets underlying the Amended Complaint\nare \"implausible.\" Hanover 3201 Realty, 806 F.3d at 183.\nHere, Plaintiffs allege two relevant markets - smartphones and performance smartphones\nthat are differentiated from other types of similar products. (Am. Compl. ^ 164-175). The\nAmended Complaint defines the smartphone market as distinguishable from \"feature phones,\"\nwhich offer \"less capable hardware and software options,\" and other portable devices such as\n13Case 2:24-cv-04055-JXN-LDW     Document 283     Filed 06/30/25     Page 13 of 33 PageID:\n<pageID>tablets, smartwatches, and laptop computers, which \"lack the combination of function, size, and\nportability that consumers rely on in a smartphone. (M at ^[172-73).\nWhile Apple argues the performance smartphone market is \"an invented definition\ndivorced from commercial reality that may not even encompass all iPhone models,\" (Br. at 43),\nthe Court disagrees. As alleged in the Amended Complaint, the performance smartphone\nencompasses a narrower product market \"that compete[s] with most iPhones and excludes the\nlowest-end smartphones, which industry participants sometimes refer to as 'entry-leveP\nsmariphones.\" (Id. at \\ 165). As opposed to performance smartphones, entry-level smartphones\nare made with different quality materials with less durability, maintain \"lower-performance\ncomponents,\" and \"lack features such as an NFC antenna that allows consumers to use their phone\nto make payments or access passes for public transit.\" (M at 1[ 168). Further, consumers usually\npurchase performance smartphones \"for use with post-paid service plans that include promotional\ndiscounts to consumers who purchase performance smartphcmes,\" as opposed to entry-level\nsmartphones that generally use pre-paid service plans. {Id. at ^ 169).\nThe Court finds the performance smartphone constitutes a \"distinct submarket[] for\nantitrust purposes,\" which, in construing the factual allegations in a light most favorable to\nPlaintiffs, varies in price and quality from entry-level smartphones. United States v. Bertelsmann\nSE & Co. KGaA, 646 F. Supp. 3d 1,28 (D.D.C. 2022) (collecting cases). Other courts have reached\na similar conclusion. See, e. g.. In fenuitional Boxing Club ofN.Y., Inc. v. U.S., 358 U.S. 242, 250-\n52 (1959) (affirming the district court's finding that \"there exists a separate, identifiable market\nfor championship boxing contests\" as opposed to non-championship bouts (citation modified));\nSyufy Enters, v.

FTC, 301 F.2d 585, 598 (3d Civ. 1962) (affirming the FTC's finding that\n\"higher priced and low priced categories [of sporting goods] can be distinguished competitively\nfrom each other and that they constitute separate and distinct lines of commerce ) (citation\nmodified); Federal Trade Comm 'n v. Lancaster Colony Corp., 434 F.

AT&T Corp., 248 F.3d 131, 147 (3d Cir. 2001) (citation modified).\n\"Consequently, the geographic market is not comprised of the region in which the seller attempts\nto sell its product, but rather is comprised of the area where his customers would look to buy such\na product.\" Tzmis Bros. Co., Inc. v. Ford Motor Co., 952 F.2d 715, 726 (3d Cir. 1991); see also\nUnited States Horticultural Supply v. T^ ^0,,^ Co., 367 F.App'x 305,311 (3d Cir. 2010) (noting\nthe geographic market is based on buyer behavior). The geographic market \"may be local, regional,\nnational or international in origin.\" In re Mushroom Direct Purchaser Antitrust LWg., 514 F. Supp.\n2d 683, 697 (E.D. Pa. 2007). Plaintiffs bear the burden of proving the relevant geographic market.\nTurns Bros., 952 F.2d at 726.\nPlaintiffs' assertion that the United States serves as the relevant geographic market is\nsupported by factual allegations of consumer behavior. For example. Plaintiffs allege United States\nusers \"demand services offered by U.S. retailers when they purchase a smartphone,\" such as\n\"activating their new device, setting it up, and transferring important content like apps, messages,\nphotos, and video to their new smartphone.\" (Am. Compl. ^ 176). In contrast, if a customer\n15Case 2:24-cv-04055-JXN-LDW     Document 283     Filed 06/30/25     Page 15 of 33 PageID:\n<pageID>purchases a smartphone abroad, the smartphone may (i) face compatibility issues with the\ndomestic carrier, (ii) lack \"the necessary radio technology to take advantage of the carrier's highest\nspeed connections,\" (iii) limit the customer from accessing support during set up,\" or (iv) not have\nvalid warranty. (M) Second, if customers purchase the smartphones through a United States\nretailer, they will have access to \"valuable promotions,\" whereas the \"same promotions and free\nfinancing are unavailable to U.S. consumers who purchase their phones in other countries.\" (Id at\n^ 177). Further, numerous \"regulatory requirements\" must be met to enter the smartphone market,\nwhich effectively bars some smartphone makers from offering smartphones to United States\nconsumers. (Id. at ^ 178). Additionally, Plaintiffs allege Apple sets different prices \"for the same\nsmartphone in the United States separately from those in other countries.\" (M at ^ 179).\nAccordingly, the Court finds the Amended Complaint sets forth plausible allegations that the\nUnited States is the relevant geographic market.\n2. Monopoly Power in the Relevant Markets\nHaving found that Plaintiffs have adequately pled relevant markets in the United States,\nfine Court must next determine whether Apple maintains monopoly power in these markets. Apple\nargues the monopollzation claims fail because Plaintiffs have not plausibly alleged possession of\nmonopoly power in either the smartphone or performance smartphone market. (Br. at 41-46). In\nopposition. Plaintiffs contend the Amended Complaint adequately pleads that Apple possesses\nmonopoly power in the smartphone and performance smartphone markets through both direct and\nindirect evidence. (Opp n at 13-18).\n\"Monopoly power is the ability to control prices and exclude competition in a given\nmarket.\" Broadcom, 501 F.3d at 307 (citing Vnited States v. Grinnell Corp., 384 US. 563, 570-\n71 (1966). \"If a firm can profitably raise prices without causing competing firms to expand output\n16Case 2:24-cv-04055-JXN-LDW     Document 283     Filed 06/30/25     Page 16 of 33 PageID:\n<pageID>and drive down prices, that firm has monopoly power. Id. (citing Hanison Aire, Inc. v. Aerostar\nInf'l Lie., 423 F.3d 374, 380 (3d Cir. 2005)). The plaintiff bears the burden of proving a defendant\nmaintains monopoly power. In re Remeron Direct Purchaser Antitrust Litig. , 367 F. Supp. 2d 675,\n679-80 (D.N.J. 2005). Monopoly power may be proven, (1) through \"direct evidence of\nsupracompetitive prices and restricted output\"; or (2) through indirect evidence of \"a dominant\nshare in a relevant market\" and \"significant entry barriers.\" Broadcom, 501 F.3d at 307 (citation\nmodified); see also Mylcm Pharms. Inc. v. Warner Chikott Pub. Ltd Co., 838 F.3d 421, 434-35\n(3d Cir. 2016).\nAs monopoly power may be proven through direct or indirect evidence, the Court first\nfocuses its analysis on whether Plaintiffs have alleged indirect evidence establishing that Apple\nhas monopoly power over the smartphone and performance smartplione markets.\nThe parties dispute what percentage of market share must be pled. {See Br. at 43-44; Opp n\nat 13-14). Apple argues monopoly power has never been found by the Supreme Court with \"'less\nthan 75% market share.'\" (Br. at 43 (quoting Ko/on Indifs. Inc. v. E.I. DuPont de Nemows & Co.,\n748 F.3d 160, 174 (4th Cir. 2014)). Whereas, Plaintiffs assert the Third Circuit has held that\n\"'[ajbsent other pertinent factors, a share significantly larger than 55% has been required to\nestabllsh[] prima facie market power.'\" (Opp'n at 13-14 (quotmg United Slates v. Dentsply Int'l,\n399 F.3d 181,187 (3d Cir. 2005)).\nSpecifically, \"[c]ourts within the Third Circuit have held a defendant has significant market\nshare supporting an inference of monopoly power if the defendant possesses sixty percent or more\nmarket share in the relevant market.\" Royal Mile Co., Inc. v. UPMC, No. 10-1609, 2013 WL\n5436925, at ift30 (collecting Third Circuit cases); see also Federal Trade Comm 'n v. AbbVie Inc.,\n976 F.3d 327, 371 (3d Cir. 2020) (\"A court can infer market power from a market share\n17Case 2:24-cv-04055-JXN-LDW     Document 283     Filed 06/30/25     Page 17 of 33 PageID:\n<pageID>Complaint includes numerous statements allegedly made by Apple executives regarding the\nbarriers set in place to maintain its monopoly. (See, e.g., Am. Compl. ^ 65 (alleging an Apple\nmanager stated, \"allowing super apps to become \"the main gateway where people play games,\nbook a car, make payments, etc.' would 'let the barbarians in at the gate.' Why? Because when a\nsuper app offers popular mini programs, ciOS stickiness goes down'\"); id. at \\ 71 (alleging \"Apple\nblocked cloud gaming apps that would have given users access to desirable apps and content\nwithout needing to pay for expensive Apple hardware\" as it feared a world where 'all that matters\nis who has the cheapest hardware' and consumers could 'buy[J a [expletlve] Android for 25 bux\nat a garage sale and . . . have a solid cloud computing device' that 'works fine'\"); id at ^ 91\n(alleging \"Apple's Senior Vice President of Software Engineering explained that supporting [over\nthe top] messaging in [IMessage] 'would simply serve to remove [an] obstacle to IPhone families\ngiving their kids Android phones'\"); id, (alleging Apple's Senior Vice President of Worldwide\nMarketing \"forwarded an email to CEO Tim Cook making the same point: 'moving iMessage to\nAndroid will hurt us more than help us'\"). At this stage, these allegations are sufficient to\ndemonstrate Apple's specific intent to monopolize the smartphone and performance smartphone\nmarkets. See BanxCorp v. Banh'ate Inc., No. 07-3398, 2011 WL 6934836, at *23 (D.NJ. Dec.30,\n2011) (holding that specific intent was demonstrated where statements by Bankrate's Chief\nExecutive Officer acknowledged there were barriers to competition enabling Bankrate to increase\nprices without losing customers).\nFurther, in a footnote, Apple argues Plaintiffs fail to \"allege a dangerous probability that\nApple can exclude Google, Samsung, and its other rivals to achieve a monopoly power.\" (Br. at\n46 n.8). The Court disagrees. When considering the dangerous probability of achieving monopoly\npower, courts \"may consider factors such as 'significant market share coupled with anticompetitive\n29Case 2:24-cv-04055-JXN-LDW     Document 283     Filed 06/30/25     Page 29 of 33 PageID:\n<pageID>practices, barriers to entry, the strength of competition, the probable development of the industry,\nand the elasticity of consumer demand' to determine whether dangerous probability was alleged\nin the pleadings.\" Philadelphia Taxi Ass 'n, 886 P.3d at 342 (quoting Broadcom^ 501 F.3d at 318).\nAs discussed supra, the Amended Complaint alleges Apple maintains a market share of 65 percent\nin the smartplione market and 70 percent in the performance smartphone market, imposed several\nbarriers to entry, and has engaged in anticompetitive conduct. At this stage, the Court finds\nPlaintiffs have sufficiently alleged a dangerous probability of achieving monopoly power. Cf.\nBf'oacicom, 501 F.3d at 318 (determining whether there Is a dangerous probability of achieving\nmonopoly power is a \"particularly fact-intensive inquhy\" that \"courts typically should not resolve\nthis question at the pleading stage unless it Is clear on the face of the complaint that the dangerous\nprobability standard cannot be met as a matter of law\") (citation modified).\nAs such, at this stage of the proceedings. Plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged attempted\nmonopolization clams. Therefore, the Court denies Apple's motion to dismiss the Second and\nFourth Claims for Relief for failure to plead Apple's specific Intent to monopolize and dangerous\nprobability of achieving monopoly power.\nC. The Plaintiff States' Have Established Parens Patnae Standins to Bring Their\nClaims.\nFinally, the Court considers Apple's assertion that the Plaintiff States lack standing to\npursue their claims in the Amended Complaint, through either their sovereign capacities or under\naparens patriae theory. (See Br. at 40 n.6). In opposition, the Plaintiff States contend the Amended\nComplaint establishes parenspatriae standing. (See Opp'n at 39-40). The Court agrees.\nWhile the Court recognizes that \"'States are not normal litigants for the purposes of\ninvoking federal jurisdiction[,]'\" certain circumstances permitted them to do so. Harrison v.\nJefferson Par. Sch. Bd, 78 F.4th 765, 769 (5th Cir. 2023) (quoting Massachiisefts v. EPA, 549\n30Case 2:24-cv-04055-JXN-LDW     Document 283     Filed 06/30/25     Page 30 of 33 PageID:\n<pageID>U.S. 497, 518 (2007)). \"[SJtates have at least four types of interests that, if injured, satisfy\nstanding's first requirement: sovereign, quasi-sovereign, proprietary, or private.\" Id. (citing Alfred\nL. Snapp & Son, Inc. v. Puerto Rico ex rel. Barez, 458 U.S. 592, 601-02 (1982)).

In Snapp, the Supreme Court identified\nthe following quasi-sovereign interests: \"First, a State has a quasi-sovereign interest in the health\nand well-being—both physical and economic—of its residents in general. Second, a State has a\nquasi-sovereign interest in not being discrimmatorily denied its rightful status within the federal\nsystem.\" 458 U.S. at 607.\nCourts have found states have parens patriae standing to seek protection for antitrust\nviolations. See, e.g,. New York v. Microsoft Corp., 209 F. Supp. 2d 132, 150-52 (D.C.C. 2002)\n(finding \"signiflcantQ hamper[ing] [of] competition\" by a monopolist is enough for Article III\nstanding) (citation modified); In re Ins.

In Harrison, the Fifth Circuit held that Louisiana did not have parens pairiae standing to sue\nJefferson Parish School Board (\"JPSB\"), a board for a school district located in Louisiana, for\nallegedly discriminating against two students. 78 F.4th at 768, 772-74. Unlike the \"classic example\nof suits vindicatmg sovereign interests [such as] those involving public nuisances and economic\ninterests,\" the Court explained Louisiana was \"not asserting a separate injury such as being denied\nits full participation in the federal system, nor d[id] it allege injury to its citizens['] health or\neconomic well-being in a way that also implicates its own interests.\" M at 772-73 (citation\nmodified). Rather, Louisiana's interest was \"wholly derivative of the interests ofJPSB's students.\"\nId, at 773. Since Louisiana failed to show it suffered an injury to a quasi\" sovereign interest, the\ncourt found It lacked standing to maintain its suit in federal court. Id. at 774.\nIn contrast, the Plaintiff States have properly pleaded sufficient injury to their quasi-\nsovereign interests in the economic well-being of their respective states. The Plaintiff States\narticulate their quasi-sovereign interest in \"seek[mg] to enjoin Apple's anticompetitive conduct\nthat entrenches its monopoly over, and drives up prices within, U.S. smartphone markets.\" (Opp'n\nat 39).

Accordingly, the Court finds the Plaintiff States have established their standing to sue\nparens patriae at this stage.\nIV.

The remaining breach of contract claims, including the applicability of certain exclusions and defenses, will proceed to trial.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether State Farm was justified in denying coverage based on policy exclusions related to wear and tear and other factors, and whether the loss in progress doctrine applied, thereby precluding coverage.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court held that State Farm's motion for summary judgment was granted concerning the claim for punitive damages, as Milia lacked evidence of intentional or egregious conduct by State Farm. However, the motion was denied for the breach of contract claims, thus allowing those issues, including the applicability of policy exclusions and defenses, to be resolved at trial.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine you have an insurance policy for your house, and a storm hits, causing damage. You ask your insurance company to pay for the repairs, but they refuse, saying that the damage happened because your house was already in bad shape and that you knew it might happen even before you bought the insurance. You take them to court, hoping to win some extra money as a punishment for their denial. The court decides you can't get that extra money because you didn't show they were bad on purpose, but the bigger question of whether they have to pay for the repairs at all will be decided by a jury later.",

The Evidence \nOn February 18, 2022, Milia purchased a two -building apartment complex located at 123 and \n131 N. Bingham Street, Memphis, Tennessee 38112 (the “Premises”).2 (ECF No. 51- 2, 1.) Milia \nwas present for National Property Inspections’  pre-purchase inspection of the Premises on \nDecember 2, 2021. ( Id.) The Pre -Purchase Inspection R eport recommended that the roof be \nrepaired or replaced. ( Id.) Regarding the roof, the r eport stated that  (1) it was not possible to inspect \nfor the possibility of active leaks due to a lack of interior access; (2) the roof surface was composed \nof two different materials of different ages; (3) the sealant on joints in the roof was  deteriorated; \n(4) loose and unsecured roofing materi al may allow water intrusion ; (5) wrinkles in roofing \nmaterial and low spots allowed standing water ; and (6) it was recommended that a qualified roofing \ncontractor evaluate the entire roof surface and make any repairs needed to protect against water intrusion. (Id. at 2.)  The report contained photographs depicting existing and/or ongoing water \npooling on the roof. ( Id.) Additionally, it noted that the roof did not have a drainage system, and \ndeterioration on the trim in several locations around the buildings was indicative of water intrusion. \n(Id.)  \nState Farm issued a Businessowners Policy to Milia bearing the policy number 92- NC-X094 -\n5 (the “Policy”) for the Premises. ( Id.) The Policy had an effective date of February 17, 2022, and \nran through February 17, 2023. (ECF Nos. 51- 2, 2-3 & 52- 2, 2.)   \nOn March 23 or 24 of 2022, Milia’s insurance agent reported a claim for damage to the roof to \nState Farm  based on information contractor Southern Roofing provided. (ECF Nos. 51- 2, 5 & 52-\n \n1 The Court only discusses the facts pertinent to State Farm’s Motion. The facts are taken from the parties’ \nfilings. Any disputes of fact are noted.  \n2 Two different buildings are at issue in this case. However, the briefings do not distinguish between the \ntwo in the argumentative sections.  The Court follows the parties lead in doing so.   Case 2:23-cv-02005-JTF-cgc     Document 55     Filed 07/03/25     Page 2 of 22 \nPageID <pageID>3 \n 2, 3. & 5.) Southern Roofing reported that  Building No. 123 had its roof ripped off and there was \nsignificant interior water damage to Units 11 and 12. ( Id.) \nMilia retained Delta Public Adjusters, LLC (“Delta”) to inspect the Premises. ( Id. at 6.) Delta \nin turn requested that Wallace & Todd Consulting (“W&T”) inspect the two buildings. (ECF No. \n51-4, 3.) W&T observed that (1) temporary repairs had been made to the west end of the building \nwhere Delta’s photographs depicted wind damage , and to the apartment below the wind damage \non the east side of Building No. 123; (2) wind damage to the roof seams and an uplifted drip edge along the south side of Building No. 131 could be observed from Building No. 123 and the ground \nunderneath; (3) no winds exceeding 40 MPH  occurred on the date of loss and the most recent date \nof elevated win d (recorded as 64 MPH ) occurred on January 1, 2022; (4) the pre -purchase \ninspection of the Premises did not mention the peeled back condition of the roof; and (5) the limited amount of water damage to the cover board below the wind damaged seams in Building No. 131 supported t he conclusion that the wind damage was a recent occurrence. ( Id. at 4-8.) \nDelta sent State Farm photographs and an estimate of the damages on April 18, 2022. ( ECF \nNo. 51- 2, 6.) On May 3, 2022, with Delta and Southern Roofing present on Milia’s behalf, State \nFarm claims adjuster Elizabeth Fatovic inspected the Premises. ( Id.) Fatovic evaluated Delta’s \nreport after her own inspection and requested that it provide an updated estimate. ( Id.) State Farm \nreceived the  amended estimate on May 7, 2022. ( Id.)  \nBased on Fatovic’s inspection and observations, State Farm retained a structural engineer from \nApplied Building Sciences, Inc. (“ABS”) to investigate  further. ( Id.) ABS found, among other \nthings, that (1) the roof was damaged; (2) at least some of that damage, such as the peeling back of the roof covering at the west end, south wing, and east wing of Building No. 123 occurred \nduring “the storm”; (3) there were numerous observable deficiencies on the roof including Case 2:23-cv-02005-JTF-cgc     Document 55     Filed 07/03/25     Page 3 of 22 \nPageID <pageID>4 \n functional, installation and age -related problems; (4) ponding water at various locations indicated  \na long- term problem with a lack of drainage; (5) no high wind events were reported in the area on \nthe reported date of loss, and the last such event occurred on January 1, 2022; (6) the failure /peel \nback of the roof covering occurred at relatively  low wind speeds and was  attributable to poor \ninstallation  and to the deteriorated condition of the roof; and  (7) Building No. 131 did not incur \nany storm -related damages .3 (ECF No. 51- 5, 230- 32 & 244- 46.)  \nBased on State Farm’s investigation of the claim, ABS’s findings in its r eport, and Fatovic’s \nobservations, it determined that the Premises’ damage was not consistent with damage from a high \nwind event occurring on the reported date of loss. ( ECF No. 51- 2, 6.)  State Farm ’s formal  \ndetermination  states its conclusion that the damage to the P remises was the result of workmanship \nissues and the overall poor condition of the roof, including but not limited to prior water intrusions and neglect. (ECF No. 51- 2, 6.)  In a letter dated July 6, 2022, State Farm informed Milia it was \ndenying the claim because the damage was not covered  based on the  exclusions  cited therein . (Id. \nat 7.)  Milia contends that the findings in ABS’s report are inconsistent with State Farm’s \nconclusion. (ECF No. 52- 2, 3.)  \nMilia’s expert, Robert M. Thompson, inspected the P remises on February 29, 2024, and his \nreport did not reference any damage caused by hail. ( Id.) That re port also acknowledged that winds \ndid not exceed 40 mph near the Premises, nor were there any “elevated wind events” recorded in \nShelby County, Tennessee on the date of loss. ( Id. at 8.)    \nB. The Relevant Exclusions  \nAs relevant here, the policy excludes coverage for:  \n \n \n3 ABS’s report refers to Building No. 123 and Building No. 135. (ECF No. 51- 5, 230- 32.) The relevant \nbuilding numbers in this case are 123 and 131. The Court assumes that reference to “Building No. 135” is a  \ntypographical error.  Case 2:23-cv-02005-JTF-cgc     Document 55     Filed 07/03/25     Page 4 of 22 \nPageID <pageID>5 \n 1.  . . . any loss which would not have occurred in the absence of one or more of the \nfollowing excluded events[:]  \n. . .  j.

Other Types of Loss  \n(1) Wear and tear;  \n(2) Rust or other corrosion, decay, deterioration, hidden or latent defect or any quality in property that causes it to damage or destroy itself; . . .

Continuous Or Repeated Seepage, Discharge Or Leakage of Water  \nContinuous or repeated seepage, discharge or leakage of water, or the  presence of \ncondensation of humidity, moisture or vapor, that occurs over a  period of 14 days \nor more.  \n \n(ECF No. 51- 5, 13- 15.)  \n The Policy also provides that:  \n \n3. [State Farm does] not insure under any coverage for any loss consisting of one \nor more of the items below. Further, [State Farm does] not insure for loss described in Paragraphs 1. and 2. immediately above regardless of whether one or more of the following: (a) directly or indirectly cause, contribute to or aggravate the loss; or (b) occur before, at the same time, or after the loss or any other cause of the loss:  \n \na.

The Lawsuit  \nAfter State Farm denied coverage, Milia brought this lawsuit in state court . (ECF No. 1- 2.) \nMilia allege d that “ [o]n or about March 23, 2022, a certain severe weather event which included \nhigh velocity wind of up to Sixty (60) MPH [] seriously damaged the [Premises’] roofing system.” \n(Id. at 8.) Milia also allege d that the Premises were damaged by “large circumference hail.” ( Id.) \nIt argue d that State Farm was  liable for breach of contract for refusing to cover the wind damage  \nto the  roofing and the water d amage to the interior incurred during the hail and high wind events. \n(ECF No. 1- 2, 9.) Milia sought  $4,000,000 in compensatory damages, pre - and post -judgment \ninterest, attorney’s fees, and punitive damages “as the Court may deem appropriate.” ( Id. at 12.) It \nargue d that punitive damages were  appropriate because State Farm didn’t conduct a reasonable \ninvestigation and wrongly denied the claim, in essence. ( See id.  at 11.)  \nState Farm removed the case to this Court on January 4, 2023. (ECF No. 1.) This motion for \nsummary judgment is the only substantive motion that has been filed in this case. The case is set \nfor a jury trial on September 8, 2025. (ECF No. 48.)  \nII. LEGAL STANDARD  \nSummary judgment is proper “if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to \nany material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” Fed. R. Civ. P.  56(a). Case 2:23-cv-02005-JTF-cgc     Document 55     Filed 07/03/25     Page 6 of 22 \nPageID <pageID>7 \n The court must view the facts in the record and reasonable inferences that can be drawn from those \nfacts in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 587 (1986).  \nOnce a properly supported motion for summary judgment has been filed, the party \nopposing summary judgment must show that there is a genuine dispute of material fact by pointing to evidence in the record or arguing that the moving party is not entitled to j udgment as a matter \nof law. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a), (c)(1). “When confronted with a properly supported Motion for Summary Judgment, the party with the burden of proof at trial is obligated to provide concrete evidence supporting its claims and establishing the existence of a genuine issue of fact.” Cloverdale Equipment Co. v. Simon Aerials, Inc., 869 F.2d 934, 937 (6th Cir. 1989) (citing Celotex Corp. v. Catrett , 477 U.S. 317 (1986)). The opposing party “cannot rest solely on the allegations \nmade in [his] pleadings.” Everson v. Leis , 556 F.3d 484, 496 (6th Cir. 2009) (alteration in original)  \n(internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Skousen v. Brighton High Sch., 305 F.3d 520, 527 (6th \nCir. 2002)). \nA genuine issue for trial exists if the evidence would permit a reasonable jury to return a \nverdict for the nonmoving party. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248 (1986). The court’s role is not to weigh evidence or assess the credibility of witnesses, but simply to determine “whether the evidence presents a sufficient disagreement to require submission to a jury or whether it is so one -sided tha t one party must prevail as a matter of law.” Kroll v. White Lake Ambulance \nAuth., 763 F.3d 619, 623 (6th Cir. 2014) (quoting Anderson, 477 U.S. at 251–52).   \n   Case 2:23-cv-02005-JTF-cgc     Document 55     Filed 07/03/25     Page 7 of 22 \nPageID <pageID>8 \n III. ANALYSIS  \nA. Evidentiary Objections  \nMilia  argues that certain materials State Farm relies on to demonstrate the nonexistence of \ngenuine  dispute s of material fact are inadmissible. Specifically, Milia contends that the National \nProperty Inspections  Report and CoreLogic Wind Verification Report constitute inadmissible \nhearsay and lack authentication. (ECF No. 52- 2, 2 & 5.) It also objects to the recitation of the \npolicy provisions under the best evidence rule. ( Id. at 3.)   \nFed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(2) provides that, in litigating a motion for summary judgment, “[a] party \nmay object that the material cited to support or dispute a fact cannot be presented in a form that \nwould be admissible in evidence.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(2). Assessing  whether summary -judgment \nevidence could “be presented in a form that would be admissible in evidence” at trial under Rule \n56(c)(2) is “ substantially more complicated than just deeming statements hearsay .” Siefert v. \nLiberty Twp ., No. 23- 3692, 2024 WL 4100897, at *6 (6th Cir. Sept. 6, 2024)  (Moore, J., \nconcurring) (quoting Wyatt v. Nissan N. Am., Inc ., 999 F.3d 400, 424 & n.8 (6th Cir. 2021) ). “[T]he \nadvisory committee's commentary for Rule 56 as well as Supreme Court and Sixth Circuit \nprecedent support [the] conclusion that courts, in determining whether to consider hearsay evidence, may inquire as to whether the party opposing summary judgment is capable of producing \nan otherwise inadmissible hearsay statement in a form that will be admissible at trial, i.e., via \nsubstituted oral testimony by the third -party declarant.” Wyatt , 999 F.3d 424 n.8.  \ni. The National Property Inspection s Report  \nIn its Motion for Summary Judgment, State Farm relies on National Property Inspections’ \nPre-Purchase Inspection Report to show that the major issues with the Premises’ roof predated the Case 2:23-cv-02005-JTF-cgc     Document 55     Filed 07/03/25     Page 8 of 22 \nPageID <pageID>9 \n Policy ’s coverage period. (ECF No. 51- 2, 1-2.) Milia requests that the report be excluded because \nit is unauthenticated  inadmissible  hearsay. (ECF No. 52- 2, 2.) State Farm did not respond.  \nThe report likely constitutes hearsay—it contains statements, all of which were made by \nan out of court declarant , and it is being offered for its truth. Fed. R. Evid. 801(c). That said, the \nreport is  admissible as a business record pursuant to Fed. R. Evid. 803(6), which allows for the \nadmission  of:  \nA record of an act, event, condition, opinion, or diagnosis if:  \n(A)  the record was made at or near the time by —or from information transmitted \nby someone with knowledge;  \n(B)  the record was kept in the course of a regularly conducted activity of a business, \norganization, occupation, or calling, whether or not for profit;  \n(C)  making the record was a regular practice of that activity;  \n(D)  all these conditions are shown by the testimony of the custodian or another qualified witness, or by a certification that complies with Rule 902(11) or (12) or with a statute permitting certification; and  \n(E)  the opponent does not show that the source of information or the method or circumstances of preparation indicate a lack of trustworthiness.  \n \nFed. R. Evid. 803(6). The National Property Inspections Report  was prepared in the normal \ncourse of National Property Inspections’  business as a pre -purchase inspection. (ECF No. 51 -2, 1.) \nThere is no dispute  that the report  was prepared shortly after  the inspection was performed, and \nthat it was prepared by a professional inspector . The preparation of such a  report  is undoubtedly a \nregular practice for those who perform home and building inspections for prospective buyers. \nMilia does not suggest it will challenge any techniques and/ or methodologies  relevant to the \nreport’s preparation, and the Court finds it noteworthy that Milia apparently  found the information \nin the National Property Inspections Report to be sufficiently trustworthy to base its decision to purchase the Premises  on its  findings .  \nWere State Farm to  call a witness to testify to all  these conditions , the Court would \nconclude that the National Property Inspections Report  is admissible hearsay pursuant to the Case 2:23-cv-02005-JTF-cgc     Document 55     Filed 07/03/25     Page 9 of 22 \nPageID <pageID>10 \n business records exception. Since Milia has not argued that there would be any obstacle to State \nFarm calling such a witness, it has not met its burden under Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(2) . With respect \nto authentication, the same witness would also be able to testify that the report is what it is claimed to be. Fed. R. Evid. 901(b)(1) .   \nii. The CoreLogic  Wind Verification Report   \nMilia next seeks the exclusion of the CoreLogic Wind Verification Report on the ground \nthat it is inadmissible hearsay that has not been authenticated. (ECF No. 52- 2, 5.) Per CoreLogic’s \nwebsite: “Wind Verif ication Reports are powered by a fully- automated, severe wind verification \nsystem from CoreLogic. This system combines proprietary, three -dimensional storm models with \nartificial intelligence, radar data, and real -world observations to analyze what actually happened.”\n4  \n The report is not hearsay. The hearsay rule applies only to out -of-court statements . See Fed. \nR. Evid. 801(c)(1). The rule defines a “statement” as “a person's oral assertion, written assertion, or nonverbal conduct, if the person intended it as an assertion.” Fed. R. Evid. 801(a). The \nCoreLogic Report constitutes a report of raw data generated by a machine or algorithm. The consensus among the circuit courts is that machine -generated data cannot be hearsay because it \ndoes not constitute a statement under Fed. R. Evid. 801(a). See  Lyngaas v. Curaden Ag, 992 F.3d \n412, 431 (6th Cir. 2021) (collecting cases); see also  4 Federal Evidence § 8:13 (4th ed.) (“On a \nmechanical level, the question whether the hearsay doctrine reaches information provided by \nmachines . . . is easily answered.  Under Rule 801(a), a statement is ‘a person's' utterance, so \nnothing ‘said’ by a machine . . . is hearsay[.]”).  \n Although the CoreLogic Report is not hearsay, State Farm will still bear the burden of \nauthenticating it. See Lyngaas , 992 F.3d at 431. Milia has not  show n that it would be impossible \n \n4 CoreLogic, Wind Verification Reports (2015), https://www.wvs.corelogic.com/pdfs/wind -verification -\nreport -datasheet.pdf.  Case 2:23-cv-02005-JTF-cgc     Document 55     Filed 07/03/25     Page 10 of 22 \nPageID <pageID>11 \n for State Farm to produce proof at trial “sufficient to support a finding that the item is what the \nproponent claims it is.” Fed. R.  Evid. 901(a). As such, the Court declines to exclude the CoreLogic Report in  assessing State Farm’s Motion for Summary Judgment. \niii. Insurance Policy Recitation  \nState Farm included the relevant policy provisions  in its s tatement of undisputed facts. \n(ECF No. 51- 2, 3.) Milia objects to this recitation under the best evidence rule. (ECF No. 52- 2, 3.) \nThe best evidence rule provides that “[a]n original writing, recording, or photograph is required in order to prove its content unless these rules or a federal statute provides otherwise.” Fed. R. Evid. 1002. “The purpose of the best evidence rule is to pr event fraud and encourage accuracy.” Slocum \nv. Bear , No. 1:18 -CV-423, 2021 WL 3683873, at *4 (S.D. Ohio Mar. 26, 2021), report and \nrecommendation adopted, No. 1:18- CV-423, 2021 WL 3683353 (S.D. Ohio Aug. 19, 2021) \n(citations omitted). It is unclear why Milia takes issue with State Farm’s recitation of the relevant Policy section. As Milia acknowledges, State Farm also provided an admissible duplicate of the \nPolicy in Exhibit C. (ECF No. 51- 5, 7- 47.) The Court declines  to exclude State Farm’s policy \nrecitation under the best evidence rule.  \nB. Coverage and Exclusions  \nState Farm argues that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on Milia’s breach of contract \nclaim because Milia’s claimed loss is  not covered under the Policy. (ECF No. 51- 1, 9.) State Farm \ncontends that it was not required to cover the claimed loss because (1) the exclusions contained in the Policy, including those for “wear and tear,” “deterioration,” “continuous or repeated seepage, discharge or leakage of water… that occurs ove r a period of 14 days or more,” and “faulty, \ninadequate, or defective … workmanship” unequivocally preclude coverage for Milia’s claimed Case 2:23-cv-02005-JTF-cgc     Document 55     Filed 07/03/25     Page 11 of 22 \nPageID <pageID>12 \n loss; and (2) coverage is precluded under the loss in progress doctrine . (Id. at 7-8.) The Court \nhandles several interpretive issues before turning to these two substantive disputes. \ni. Policy Interpretation  \na. Principles of Interpretation  \nStandard contract interpretation principles apply to insurance policies. Hudson v. Liberty Mut. \nPers. Ins. Co., No. 2:23- CV-02060- TLP-CGC, 2024 WL 4101937, at *5 (W.D. Tenn. July 24, \n2024)  (citations omitted). “ Courts must give the insurance policy's terms their common, plain and \nordinary meaning. ” Id. (citations omitted). “ The plain and ordinary meaning is the meaning which \nthe average policy holder and insurer would attach to the policy language.” Id. (quoting Trust Ins. \nCo. v. Phillips , 474 S.W.3d 660, 667 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2015)  (internal quotation marks omitted) . \nThe insurance contract “must be read as a layman” would read it . S. Trust Ins. Co., 474 S.W.3d at  \n667 (quoting Paul v. Ins. Co. of N. Am ., 675 S.W.2d 481, 484 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1984)). C ourts \nshould consider the contract “as a whole, ‘for one clause may modify, limit or illuminate another.’” \nId. at 670 (citation omitted).  \nWhen a Tennessee court interprets contract language, it first decides whether the language is \nambiguous. Id. (citing Planters Gin Co. v. Fed. Compress Warehouse Co., 78 S.W.3d 885, 890 \n(Tenn. 2002)) . “If ambiguous language limits coverage, the language must be strictly construed in \nfavor of the insured.” Hudson, 2024 WL 4101937, at *5 (citation omitted).  \nb. Definition and Interpretation of Undefined Phrases  \nHere, the issue of whether the cited Policy exclusions apply is directly dependent upon the \nmeaning of two specific phrases. The Policy excludes coverage for losses “consisting of” or \n“directly and immediately caused by” certain events. ( See, e.g., ECF No. 51- 5, 13- 14.) Neither Case 2:23-cv-02005-JTF-cgc     Document 55     Filed 07/03/25     Page 12 of 22 \nPageID <pageID>13 \n phrase is defined in the Policy, and the briefings do not define them.5 (See ECF No. 51- 1, 11.) The \nonly hint is that the two cannot mean the same thing, since numerous paragraphs exclude coverage  \nfor losses “consisting of” or “directly and immediately caused by” some occurrence. ( See id .)   \n Without a supplied technical definition, the Court turns to the dictionary and its sister courts. \nMerriam -Webster provides that the phrasal verb “consist of” means “to  be formed or made up of \n(specified things or people) .”6  \nAs for “direct and immediate cause,”  another court grappling with  a similar State Farm policy \nthoroughly examined the caselaw and dictionary entries, before concluding that “[w]hen there is a \nchain of events leading to a loss, as here, a direct and immediate cause has been defined as the one \nnearest in time to the specific event at issue.” W inders v. State Farm Fire & Cas. Co., 359 F. Supp. \n3d 1274, 1279 (N.D. Ga. 2018) (providing a textual analysis and collecting cases). Keep in mind \nthat a cause nearest i n time to an event is not necessarily the same as a proximate cause, which \nrefers to the primary or reasonably foreseeable cause of an injury.  \nii. Do the Exclusions Apply?  \nState Farm contends that there does not exist a genuine dispute of material fact and that it is \nentitled to judgment as a matter of law on Milia’s breach of contract claim because the Policy \nexcludes coverage for damage caused by or resulting from wear and tear; rust or other corrosion, \ndecay, deterioration, hidden or latent defect or any quality in property that causes it to damage or \ndestroy itself; settling, cracking, shrinking or expansion; continuous or r epeated discharge or \nleakage of water, or the pr esence of condensation of humidity, moisture or vapor, that occurs over \n \n5 In its brief , State Farm claims that the Policy “does not provide coverage for damage caused by or \nresulting from  wear and tear . . . .” (ECF No. 51 -1, 11 (emphasis added).) While this paraphrasing of the Paragraph 2 \nExclusion suggests that State Farm believes the phrases mean “caused by or resulting from,” nothing in the record \nsupports that interpretation.  \n6 Consist of, Merriam -Webster.com (last visited June 16, 2025).  Case 2:23-cv-02005-JTF-cgc     Document 55     Filed 07/03/25     Page 13 of 22 \nPageID <pageID>14 \n a period of 14 days or more ;  or faulty, inadequate or defective workmanship, repair, construction, \nor maintenance. (ECF No. 51- 1, 12.)  \nA review of the disputed and undisputed facts relevant to these exclusions guides this inquiry.  \nFirst, the roof was  in poor condition before Milia purchased the Premises. The National  Property \nInspections ’ December 2, 2021 Pre-Purchase  Inspection Report  provides  that: the sealant on the \njoints was deteriorated, wrinkles in the material permitted pooling of water, unsecured roofing \nmaterials would permit water intrusion , and there was evidence of water intrusion on Unit 123. \n(ECF No.  51-2, 2.) Milia has not  shown that this fact is in dispute. \nSecond, it cannot be genuinely disputed that  winds  did not exceed 40 MPH  and hail did not \nfall at the Premises  on the date of  the claimed  loss.7  Milia’s claims that the Premises were battered \nby “large circumference hail” and “high velocity wind of up to Sixty (60) MPH” on that date are without support in the record. (ECF No. 1-2, 8.) Milia’s own experts support the Court’s \nconclusion. ( See ECF No s. 51-4, 6 & 51- 2, 8.)  \nYet Milia points out that State Farm’s expert, ABS,  confirmed its experts’ findings that wind  \ndamaged the roofing system. (ECF No. 52- 1, 3.) ABS’s report acknowledge s the “failure/peel back \nof the roof covering,” but states that it occurred at “relatively low wind speeds and is attributed to poor installation and to the deteriorated condition of the roof.”  (ECF No. 51- 5, 245.) State Farm  \nnever responded to Milia’s point that its own expert observed that the roof  was damaged  by wind, \nalbeit  “at relatively low wind speeds .” (Id.) Nevertheless,  State Farm ’s position  seems to  be that \nthe excludable causes —wear and tear, deterioration, and poor maintenance of the roof —were \n \n7 The CoreLogic Wind Verification Report provides that  the “[d]ate of loss field  will ignore the normal \n[recording] threshold of 58 MPH within 3 miles, and  will report any wind speed down to  40 MPH.”  (ECF No. 51 -4, \n126.) Since the CoreLogic  Report s are the only measure of the windspeeds in the record,  and the Report provides that \n“[n]o wind greater than 40 MPH [was] detected” on March 23, 2022,  the Court treats the non- occurrence of winds \nexceeding 40 MPH on the date of claimed loss as fact in assessing this M otion. ( See id.  at 125.)  Case 2:23-cv-02005-JTF-cgc     Document 55     Filed 07/03/25     Page 14 of 22 \nPageID <pageID>15 \n responsible for the claimed loss because otherwise, the relatively slow wind  speed  would not have \nbeen able to cause such severe damage.  Even so, the nexus between the roof’s condition before \nthe Policy period commenced and the wind damage to the roof is cabined to these  one-line \nconclusions  in ABS’s expert report. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Milia , \nthere remains a genuine dispute of material fact as to whether there exists a  causal  connection \nbetween the roof’s poor condition and th e damage it incurred during the storm .  \nAs explained below, it is not clear that the Policy exclusions apply e ven if it were undisputed \nthat the slow wind able to peel back the roof solely because of the roof’s poor condition. \na. Paragraph 2 Exclusions8         \nTwo Paragraph 2 exclusions are at issue. First is Paragraph 2 .l. which excludes coverage for \nlosses “consisting of” or “directly and immediately caused by” wear and tear, deterioration, and \npoor maintenance of the roof, among other things. (ECF No 51- 5, 13- 14.)  Second is Paragraph \n2.p. which relates to continuous or repeated seepage that occurs over a period of 14 days.9 (Id. at \n15.)  \nInterpreting Paragraph 2.l.  with the definition outlined above, the “consisting of” provision \ncover s scenarios  where the claimed loss itself is wear and tear,  deterioration, poor maintenance, or \nany of the other listed  causes . Here, the claimed loss “ consists of ” a peeled back roof and water \ninfiltration . Thus, by definition, the claimed loss itself is not one of the excludable grounds  set \nforth in Paragraph 2.l .     \n \n8 The denial letter refers to Paragraph 1 .j., an exclusion for losses involving fungi virus or bacteria growth, \nproliferation, spread or presence. (ECF No. 51- 5, 252- 53.) However, the Court cannot find any mention of fungi, \nvirus, or bacteria in the parties’ filings. The denial letter also references 2.k., an exclusion for losses involving neglect  \nof an insured to use all reasonable means to save and preserve property from further damage at and after the time of \nloss. ( Id.) Again, the parties’ briefings are silent on this exclusion . It is unclear why  either  exclusion was invoked. T he \nCourt finds, as a matter of law, that neither exclusion applies . \n9 The denial letter erroneously places this exclusion under Paragraph 3. ( See ECF No. 51 -5, 253- 54.)  Case 2:23-cv-02005-JTF-cgc     Document 55     Filed 07/03/25     Page 15 of 22 \nPageID <pageID>16 \n State Farm appears  to be pursuing the other provision under this exclusion , that the loss was \n“directly and immediately caused by” wear and tear, deterioration, poor maintenance or one of the \nother excluded causes . State Farm fares no better under this provision for two reasons .  \nFirst, the record demonstrates at minimum a factual dispute as to whether wind caused the \nclaimed loss. And  while a jury may find that the proximate cause of the roof’s failure/peel back  \nwas its poor condition, State Farm must show that the roof’s poor condition was “the cause nearest \nin time ” to the  roof’s peel back. See Winders , 359 F. Supp. 3d at  1279. Viewing the evidence in \nthe light most favorable to Milia, the nearest cause in time to the roof’s peel back was the wind.  \nHence, exclusion 2.l. may not apply to the roof failure/peel back under the  “directly and \nimmediately caused by” provision.  \nSecond, it seems that the Policy itself requires State Farm to cover the loss under the exact \ntheory it presses in its brief. The Policy provides that if an excluded cause of loss in Paragraphs \n(1) through (7) under “ l. Other Types of Loss” “results in an accidental direct physical loss by any \nof  the  ‘specified causes of loss ’ or by building glass breakage, we will pay for the loss caused by \nthat  specified cause of loss ’. . . .” (ECF No. 51- 5, 14.) The Policy provides that “[s]pecified causes \nof loss” means, among other things, windstorms. ( Id. at 29.) Neither the Policy nor the parties \nexplain what qualifies as a windstorm . The Tennessee Supreme Court’s preferred definition, “the \naspect of a storm [ ] that is an outburst of  tumultuous force [,]” is not particularly helpful either. \nLunn v. Indiana Lumbermens Mut. Ins. Co., 184 Tenn. 584, 591 (1947)  (internal quotation marks \nomitted) (quoting 29 American Jurisprudence, page 792, Section 1052). What’s important here is that the classification of a weather event as a windstorm does not appear to require that winds exceed 40 MPH —the slowest  windspeed that the CoreLogic Report would record—or that winds  \nexceed any speed at all. Thus, the exception to this exclusion seems to obligate  State Farm to cover Case 2:23-cv-02005-JTF-cgc     Document 55     Filed 07/03/25     Page 16 of 22 \nPageID <pageID>17 \n the claimed loss if wear and tear and deterioration resulted in a windstorm being able to peel back \nthe roof , allowing for water infiltration . \nAs for the loss pertaining to water infiltration, the Court cannot determine whether the water \ninfiltration occurred due to the roof peeling back, or if it occurred due to the unsecured roofing material  (which would likely satisfy one of the roof condition- related exclusions) . Nothing in the \nrecord  points to either conclusion. State Farm has therefore not met its burden in showing that the \nParagraph 2 .l. exclusion bars coverage for the water infiltration.  \nTurning to 2.p., the exclusion cited as grounds for  denying coverage for the water infiltration \ndamage, the Court cannot find anything in the record that establishes that seepage, discharge or leakage of water occurred over a period of 14 days or more. (ECF No. 51- 1, 15.) Perhaps State \nFarm is referring to the pooling of water on the roof. Even so, it is unclear how long that water was pooling, and i f that pooling of water relates to the claimed water infiltration damage. The \nrecord is insufficient for the Court to determine if this exclusion applies . \n To summarize, State Farm’s M otion is DENIED with respect to its arguments that \nexclusions 1.j., 2.k., 2.l., and 2.p apply and bar coverage. The Court concludes that exclusions 1.j. \nand 2.k. do not apply as a matter of law . State Farm’s defenses under exclusions 2.l. and 2.p. can \nbe renewed at trial.  \nb. Paragraph 3 Exclusions  \nThe relevance of  the Paragraph 3 exclusions is unclear . In its July 6, 2022 letter, State Farm \nrelied on 3.c., which excludes coverage for any loss “ consisting of ” faulty, inadequate, or defective \nworkmanship, repair, materials, and maintenance, among other things. (ECF No. 51- 5, 253- 54.)  \nRegarding 3.c., as established previously, the claimed losses themselves were not faulty, \ninadequate or defective work. T he claimed loss es “consist of” a peeled back roof and water Case 2:23-cv-02005-JTF-cgc     Document 55     Filed 07/03/25     Page 17 of 22 \nPageID <pageID>18 \n infiltration. This means that the  claimed losses  did not “consist of” anything excluded in 3.c. So, \n3.c. cannot be a ground for denying coverage.  \nParagraph 3 also contains an exclusion for weather conditions . Neither party discussed this \nexclusion, but it seems to bear directly on this case ’s facts . This exclusion, 3.a. , precludes coverage \nfor losses “consisting of” weather conditions but only if weather  conditions contribute in any way \nwith a cause or event excluded in paragraphs 1 and 2 to produce the loss. (ECF No. 51- 1, 15.) The  \nCourt cannot make sense of this exclusion. What kind of claimed loss is “formed or made up of” \nweather conditions?  \nThe more pressing point  is that Paragraph 3 .a. provides that if “direct physical loss results \nfrom items 3.a., 3.b., or 3.c.,” then State Farm will “pay for the resulting loss unless the loss itself is one of the losses not insured in SECTION I.” ( Id.) As stated before, the direct and immediate \ncause of the roof peel back appears to be the wind. Regardless of whether the wind speed  was \nsevere  or “relatively low ,” wind speed is a weather event. It would seem the Policy’s plain terms \nprovide coverage.   \n State Farm’s M otion is DENIED with respect to its argument  that Paragraph  3.c. applies \nand bars coverage. State Farm’s defense under this exclusion can be renewed at trial.  \niii. Does the Loss in Progress Doctrine Preclude Coverage?  \nNotwithstanding the applicability of the exclusions, State Farm argues that the claimed loss is \nnot covered under the Policy because the loss in progress doctrine  applies.  (ECF No. 51- 1, 10.)  \nIn short, the loss in progress doctrine  precludes coverage where “the insured is aware of a \nthreat of loss so immediate that it might fairly be said that the loss was in progress and that the insured knew it at the time the policy was issued or applied for.” Inland Waters Pollution Control, \nInc. v. Nat'l Union Fire Ins. Co., 997 F.2d 172, 178–79 (6th Cir. 1993). As the Sixth Circuit has Case 2:23-cv-02005-JTF-cgc     Document 55     Filed 07/03/25     Page 18 of 22 \nPageID <pageID>19 \n explained, the loss in progress doctrine embodies “the principle that losses which exist at the time \nof the insuring agreement, or which are so probable or imminent that there is insufficient ‘risk’ being transferred between the insured and the insurer, are not proper subjects of insurance.”  Am. \n& Foreign Ins. Co. v. Sequatchie Concrete Servs., Inc., 441 F.3d 341, 345 (6th Cir. 2006)  (quoting \n7 Couch on Insurance § 102.8) . “[T]he doctrine is properly invoked when the insured knows about \nthe claimed loss bef ore the policy is purchased.”  Union Univ. v. Evanston Ins. Co., No. \n120CV01254JDBJAY, 2022 WL 507666, at *10 (W.D. Tenn. Feb. 19, 2022)  (quoting State Auto. \nMut. Ins. Co. v. R.H.L., Inc ., No. 07- 1197, 2010 WL 909073, at *4 (W.D. Tenn. Mar. 12, 2010) ).  \nThe two Sixth Circuit cases  above  illustrate the sort of foreknowledge an insured must have \nfor the rule to apply. Inland Waters  involved a disposal com pany employed to remove and dispose \nof hundreds of drums containing waste paint material. 997 F.2d at 173. The  company crushed the \ndrums on the customer’s property and discovered that the drums contained liquids were soaking \ninto the soil. Id.  Six years later , investigations of the property determined that the se liquids \ncontaminated the soil and groundwater. Id. The relevant insurance policy’s coverage period \ncommenced after the company crushed the drums, but before the discovery of the soil and groundwater contamination. Id. at 174. At issue was whether the loss in progress doctrine \nprecluded coverage for the disposal company’s liability relating to the contamination.  Id. The Sixth \nCircuit did not reach a conclusion, but directed the district court to consider on remand whether \n“the disposal company knew or should have known at the time it obtained insurance coverage . . . that the  spill would result in damage to the groundwater or that the spill posed an immediate threat \nof damage to the groundwater.” Id. at 179.  \nIn Sequatchie Concrete Services , a general contractor was supposed to provide waterproof \nblocks for a hotel’s construction. 441 F.3d at 342. During construction, the hotel complained that Case 2:23-cv-02005-JTF-cgc     Document 55     Filed 07/03/25     Page 19 of 22 \nPageID <pageID>20 \n the blocks  were not waterproof, and leaks were occurring. Id. at 342. The contractor advised that \nthis was normal until the building was  completed and sealed. Id. at 343. The building continued to \nleak when sealed, and the hotel informed the contractor that it expected that the costs associated \nwith the problem would be paid for. Id. The contractor referred the matter to its corporate counsel \nwho informed the hotel that the contractor was not liable. Id. Afterwards, an insurance company \nissued a policy to t he contractor. Id.  The hotel then sued the contractor. Id. The contractor sought \ncoverage for the loss —legal liability for providing the ineffective waterproof blocks . Id. The Sixth \nCircuit concluded that the loss in progress doctrine precluded coverage  because the contractor was \naware of the threat of los s before the coverage period began. Id.  at 346.   \nState Farm contends that the loss in progress doctrine  precludes coverage here because the Pre-\nPurchase Inspection Report issued before the Policy’s inception put Milia on notice that roof was in poor condition and that some water infiltration had already occurred. (ECF No. 51- 1, 13.) Milia \nresponds that it had no knowledge that a windstorm would lift the roofing system and cause water infiltration on the property. (ECF No. 52- 1, 7.)  \nState Farm urges  that the doctrine’s  applicability  does not hinge on whether Milia had \nknowledge that a windstorm would cause the claimed loss. (ECF No. 53, 5.)  State Farm is right in \na sense. For the doctrine  to preclude coverage here, it must be shown that Milia knew that the \nroof’s condition prior to the coverage period (1)  made the roof’s failure/peel back imminent or \nhighly probable , and (2) made water infiltration imminent or highly probable. See Inland Waters , \n997 F.2d at 179. State Farm has not offe red any evidence in support  of either of these conclusions. \nThe Court concludes that a  reasonable jury could determine that although Milia knew  that the roof \nwas not in good condition before the coverage period , it did not know that either of the two \nscenarios described above were imminent or highly probable.  Case 2:23-cv-02005-JTF-cgc     Document 55     Filed 07/03/25     Page 20 of 22 \nPageID <pageID>21 \n  State Farm’s invocation of the l oss in progress doctrine  does not entitle it to judgment as a \nmatter of law  on this basis . The  Motion is DENIED with respect to this defense. However, State \nFarm can renew the  defense at trial.  \nC. Punitive Damages  \nLast, State Farm contends that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law  on Milia’s claim for \npunitive damages notwithstanding the Court’s decision as to the merits of Milia’s breach of \ncontract claim because Milia has not produced any evidence that would suggest that it has acted \nintentionally, fraudulently, or recklessly in denying coverage.   \nTennessee law permits  awarding  punitive damages in only “the most egregious”  breach of \ncontract cases where “there is clear and convincing proof that the defendant has acted either \nintentionally, fraudulently, maliciously, or recklessly.”  LBC Assocs. Chattanooga #1 v. Allied \nProp. & Cas. Ins. Co., No. 220CV02650SHLTMP, 2021 WL 5154245, at *6 (W.D. Tenn. Aug. 23, 2021)  (internal  quotation marks and citations omitted).  \nIs this  one of  the most egregious breach of contract cases ?  Milia urges that State Farm’s \ncancellation of the February 17, 2022–February 17, 2023 policy on May 20, 2022, two months \nafter the March 23, 2022 claimed date of loss, amounts to malicious, willful, intentional, or fraudulent conduct. (ECF Nos. 52- 1, 9 & 52- 4, 2.)  The Court does not agree .  \nFirst, Milia’s response is devoid of any evidence demonstrating or even suggesting that State \nFarm acted intentionally, fraudulently, maliciously, or recklessly in denying coverage. A reasonable jury could not find for Milia on its bare, unsupported, and conclusory claim that it is \nentitled to punitive damages.  \nSecond, Milia’s demand for punitive damages appears to arise from allegations that are \nunrelated to its breach of contract claim. In its Complaint, Milia sought punitive damages based Case 2:23-cv-02005-JTF-cgc     Document 55     Filed 07/03/25     Page 21 of 22 \nPageID <pageID>22 \n on State Farm’s conduct in denying coverage. (ECF No. 1- 2, 10- 11.) That denial of coverage \nundergirds the breach of contract claim. Now, Milia claims to be seeking punitive damages for \nState Farm’s premature cancellation of the P olicy. (ECF No. 52 -1, 9.) Milia makes no attempt to \nexplain how the policy cancellation is constitutive of the breach of contract claim. There being no allegation that State Farm is liable for canceling the policy, Milia cannot sustain its claim for punitive damages arising out of t hat cancellation.  State Farm’s Motion for Summary Judgment on \nMilia’s claim for punitive damages is GRANTED. \nIV. CONCLUSION \nConsistent with the foregoing, State Farm’s Motion for Summary Judgment is GRANTED \nwith respect to Milia’s claim for punitive damages but DENIED with respect to all other claims.  \nThe Court concludes that exclusions 1.j. and 2.k. do not apply as a matter of law. The merits of all other claims and defenses will be decided at trial.  \nIT IS SO ORDERED, this 3\nrd day of July 2025.  \n \n           s/John T. Fowlkes, Jr.  \n   `     JOHN T.

The court found it had personal jurisdiction but compelled the parties to arbitrate due to a valid arbitration agreement covering the claims.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue:**\n   Whether the court can exercise personal jurisdiction over the defendants and if the claims must be resolved through arbitration due to the arbitration clause within the Subaward Agreement.\n\n3. **Court's Holding:**\n   The court held that it had personal jurisdiction over the defendants, as they purposefully availed themselves of the Alabama business environment by recruiting companies in the state. However, it ordered the parties to resolve their disputes through arbitration per the arbitration clause in the Subaward Agreement.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation:**\n   A company feels tricked and sues other companies and people because it thinks they lied to get its money. The court checks if it has the right to decide the case because of where everyone is located.

In other \nwords, the pla intiff must “plead[] factual content that allows the court to draw the \nreasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct  alleged .”1  Id.   \n Finally, if a valid arbitration agreement exists, a court  may compel arbitration \nby dismissing the case  in lieu of issuing a stay  when all of the issues raised must \nproceed to arbitration.

See FED. R. CIV. P. 9(b).  See also Tello v. Dean Witter \nReynolds, Inc., 494 F.3d 956, 972 (11th Cir. 2007).  However, because the court will not reach the \nfactual  sufficiency of Quantum’s claims in this opinion, the court does not restate the extent of the \nstandards for pleading fraud under Rule 9.  \n Case 5:21-cv-01680-AKK   Document 34   Filed 06/28/22   Page 3 of 254 \n awardees that work on federal contracts .  See doc. 23 at 3– 4.  In this role, SPGI \ndistribute s funds from AFRL and must “adequately safeguard all assets and assure \nthat they are used solely for authorized purposes.”  See i d.   \nIn February 2019, AFRL allegedly awarded to SPGI a contract identified  as \nCooperative Agreement No. FA8650 -19-2-6983.  Id.  at 3.  Soon after, Daniel Tolley, \na Virginia citizen who serves as SP Global’s president and SPGI’s treasurer, \n“established a ‘consortium’ called the Autonomy Research Network Consortium \n(‘ARCNet’).”  Id. at 4–5.  Tolley “represented to the public that businesses could \njoin [ARCNet ] for a fee and then be eligible to bid on projects under the Cooperative \nAgreement.”  Id.    \nSPGI, SP Global, Tolley, and Thomas D. Burns, Sr. —a Virginia citizen who \nserves as CEO of SP Global, chairman of its board, and SPGI’s president —allegedly \ncontrol led ARCNet.  Id. at 5.  They began to recruit “several Alabama businesses ” \nto join ARCNet and “used [the businesses’]  names for promotional efforts.”  Id.  at \n5.  Quantum, among other Huntsville -based companies , bought a “membership \ninterest” in ARCNet, and ARCNet  vowed that it and SPGI would “actively solicit \nopportunities for members, ‘administer and manage the funds collected through the \nconsortium[,]’ and ‘[b]e responsible for the management and integration of all [the] \n[c]onsortium’s efforts under the C ooperative Agreement or associated legal \nmechanisms.’”  Id.  (quoting doc. 23- 2).  ARCNet purportedly promised Quantum Case 5:21-cv-01680-AKK   Document 34   Filed 06/28/22   Page 4 of 255 \n “access to AFRL opportunities under the Cooperative Agreement,” and Quantum \njoined  ARCNet “with the expectation of realizing profits in th e future.”  Id. \n Midway  into 2020, things appeared  to go as envisioned .  In September 2020, \n“one or more” of the defendants “communicated to Quantum in Alabama about a \nrequest for proposal and the possibility of Quantum performing work under a \nsubaward.”  Id. at 6.  To this end, the defendants provided Quantum with certain \nmaterials, including a proposal form ; Quantum submitted its proposal;  and the \ndefendants relayed it  to AFRL.  Id.  On October 1, 2020, SPGI entered into a “cost \nreimbursement Subaward Agreement 2020- ARC- S-20013 . . . with Quantum for \ncollecting, securing[,] and monitoring autonomous and artificial intelligence.”  Id.   \nFrom its location in  Huntsville, Quantum performed tasks under the Subaward \nAgreement  for several months and sent invoices to SPGI for this  work.  Id.  \n But, unbeknownst to Quantum, things had begun to unravel .  Allegedly , the \ndefendants had moved “millions of dollars from AFRL  . . . into a separate bank \naccount that, by law, was supposed to be used to pay Quantum and other \nsubawardees” and taken the money for themselves and their own businesses.   Id. at \n6–7.  In particular, Tolley and Burns purportedly  took over $11 million from the \nAFRL funds : Tolley  allegedly received “personal payments” from the funds,  and \nBurns apparently admitted to “us[ing] money intended for Quantum to pay [the] \n[d]efendants’ rent, salaries and insurance, and . . . [for] affiliated businesses.”  Id.  at Case 5:21-cv-01680-AKK   Document 34   Filed 06/28/22   Page 5 of 256 \n 7 (citing doc. 23- 9).  All the while, the defendants purportedly encouraged Quantum  \nto join ARC Net and then to work on the Suba ward A greement.  See id.  \n Eventually, AFRL prevent ed the defendants from making “advance draws” of \nthe federal funds, pumping the brakes on the apparent operation.  See id.   SPGI and \nARCNet  subsequently “issued a suspension of work notice to Quantum in Alabama, \n. . . and Quantum stopped work.”  Id.   Quantum and other sub- awardees \n“complained about the unpaid invoices” to no avail .  See id.  at 8–9.  Quantum claims \nthat at least one of the defendants “comm unicated with Quantum by telephone and/or \nby e-mail in Alabama” and “acknowledge [d] that the money was gone.”  Id.  at 9.  At \nthat point, the defendants  purportedly  represented that “they would pay all \noutstanding invoices when they secured funding from an outside investor –  \nessentially promising to replace the misappropriated funds with funds from another \nsource.”  Id.   Quantum thereafter  filed this lawsuit, pleading claims for (1) breach of \ncontract against SPGI;  (2) quantum meruit against SPGI;2 (3) unjust enrichment \nagainst all defendants ; (4) fraud and deceit against SPGI, Burns, and Tolley;  (5) \nconversion against all  defendants;  (6) breach of fiduciary duty against SPGI, Burns, \nand Tolley;  (7) conspiracy against all defendants ; and (8) violation of the  Alabama \n \n2 The heading for the quantum meruit claim in Quantum’s complaint states that Quantum brings \nthe claim against “All D efendants.”  Doc. 23 at 11.  However, Quantum demands judgment on the \nclaim only against SPGI and brings the quantum meruit claim as an alternative to the breach of \ncontract claim against SPGI.  I d.

Doc. 23.   \nIII. \nIn their motion to dismiss , the defendants contend that the  court lacks personal \njurisdiction , Quantum  agreed to arbitrate its claims, and Quantum fails to allege \nsufficient facts.  Doc. 29.  The court begins with the threshold questions of \njurisdiction  and arbitration .  As explained below, although the court has personal \njurisdiction over the defendants, the parties must arbitrate these claims .  \nConsequently, the c ourt will not address the Rule 12(b)(6) sufficiency of the factual \nallegations.  \nA. \n The defendants claim that Quantum  fails to establish personal jurisdiction for \nthree reasons: (1)  SPGI ’s contracts  with Quantum  and other Alabama corporation s \ncannot establ ish the “minimum contacts” necessary for specific jurisdiction; (2) SP \nGlobal, Tolley, and Burns were not party to any contract with Quantum; and (3)   \nTolley and Burns “personally had [no]  contacts with Alabama outside of their \ndealings with SPGI.”  Doc. 2 9 at 7.   In short, the defendants  assert that “Quantum \nasserts an insufficient basis for specific personal jurisdiction over  . . . SPGI and SP \nGlobal, [and] Quantum asserts no basis  for specific jurisdiction over  . . . Tolley and \nBurns.”  Id.  at 8 (emphasis in original).   \n Case 5:21-cv-01680-AKK   Document 34   Filed 06/28/22   Page 7 of 258 \n 1. \nA plaintiff can establish a court’s personal jurisdiction over a nonresident \ndefendant via general or specific jurisdiction.3  Tinsley , 112 F. Supp. 3d at 1258 \n(citing Int’l Shoe Co. , 326 U.S. at 316); see Consol . Dev. Corp. v. Sherritt, Inc. , 216 \nF.3d 1286, 1291 (11th Cir. 2000).  General jurisdiction exists where the defendant s’ \nconnections with the forum state “are so ‘continuous and systematic ’ as to render \nthem essentially at home in the forum State. ”  Goodyear Dunlop Tires Operations, \nS.A. v. Brown , 564 U.S. 915, 919 (quoting Int’l Shoe Co. , 326 U.S. at 317).  Specific \njurisdiction, by contrast,  “arises out of [the defendants’] activities in the forum that \nare related to the cause of action alleged in the complaint .”  Consol. Dev. Corp. , 216 \nF.3d at 1291.4 \nTwo requirements exist for specific jurisdiction.  Olivier , 979 F.2d at 830.  \nFirst, the defendants must have “ engaged in minimum contacts ” with the forum state . \nId.  Second, “ the exercise of personal jurisdiction over the defendants [must not]  \n \n3 Because this court sits in diversity, it may exercise p ersonal jurisdiction over the nonresident \ndefendants to the extent permitted under Alabama law and under the Constitution.  See Meier ex \nrel. Meier v. Sun Int’l Hotels, Ltd., 288 F.3d 1264, 1269 (11th Cir. 2002).  And because Alabama’s \nlong- arm statute aut horizes personal jurisdiction to the extent permitted by federal due process, \nOlivier , 979 F.2d at 830; Tinsley v. BP Corp. N. Am., Inc., 112 F. Supp. 3d 1253, 1257 (N.D. Ala. \n2015), the state - and federal -law inquiries  merge.   \n \n4 To the extent that Quant um claims  to establish  general personal jurisdiction, the court agrees \nwith the defendants that Quantum’s allegations do not show that the defendants have “continuous and systematic” contacts with Alabama such that they are “essentially at home” in this fo rum.  See \ndoc. 29 at 6; Goodyear , 564 U.S. at 919. The defendants’ alleged contacts with Alabama are much \nmore limited.  Thus, the court proceeds to specific jurisdiction.  Case 5:21-cv-01680-AKK   Document 34   Filed 06/28/22   Page 8 of 259 \n offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice. ” Id. at 830– 31 \n(quotation omitted).  Under the first prong, a defendant engages in mi nimum \ncontacts with the forum state when it “‘purposefully avail s itself  of the privilege of \nconducting activities within the forum State , thus invoking the benefits and \nprotections of its laws. ’”  Consol . Dev. Corp. , 216 F.3d at 1291 (quoting Hanson v. \nDenckla , 357 U.S. 235, 253 (1958)).  In addition, the plaintiff’s claims must ‘“ arise \nout of or relate to ’ at least one of the defendant ’s contacts with the forum .”  Louis \nVuitton Malletier, S.A. v. Mosseri, 736 F.3d 1339, 1355 (11th Cir. 2013) (quoting \nBurger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz , 471 U.S. 462, 472 (1985)) .  If the plaintiff \nestablishes purposeful availment and a relationship between the contacts and the \nclaims, then, to defeat specific jurisdiction, the defendants  “must make a ‘compelling \ncase’  that the exercise of jurisdiction would violate traditional notions of fair play \nand substantial justice.”   Id. \n The analysis of the relationship between the claims and the defendants’ \ncontacts “focus[es] on the direct causal  relationship between the defendant[s], the \nforum, and the litigation,” as  this relationship “is the essential foundation” of \npersonal jurisdiction.  Id.  at 1355 –56.5  “[T]he conduct at issue is that of the \n \n5 Conducting this analysis  in Mosseri , for example, the Eleventh Circuit determined that a \nplaintiff’s trademark claims arose out of the defendant’s contacts with the forum state where the \ndefendant’s ties to the state “all involve[d] the advertising, selling, and distributing of alleged counterfeit and infringing . . . goods into the state and accepting payment from [the state’s] customers for such goods.”  736 F.3d at 1356.

Central Bank , 904 F. Supp. 2d 1215, 1223 \n(N.D. Ala. 2012) (emphasis omitted).   Relatedly, the purposeful availment analysis \nasks whether the defendants’ contacts with the forum state show that the defendants \n“should reasonably anticipate being haled into court in the forum.”  Mosseri, 736 \nF.3d at 1357.   \n2. \n Quantum claims that the court has specific jurisdiction over the defendants.  \nAllegedly, the defendants \npurposefully availed themselves of the laws and privileges of the state \nof Alabama by, among other things, conducting business in Alabama, \nrecruiting business in Alabama, engaging in tortious conduct and \ncausing harm to Quantum in Alabama, marketing and selling securities \nin Alabama, and participating in a conspiracy to defraud Quantum in \nAlabama.  Defendants knew or should have anticipated that Qua ntum \nwould feel the effect of their misconduct in Alabama.  Furthermore, \nbecause Defendants conspired and operated a scheme to defraud \ncitizens of Alabama, they should not be surprised when they are haled \ninto court here to answer for their conduct.  \n \nSee doc. 23 at 2– 3.  Taking these underlying factual allegations as true, t he cou rt \nagrees  that it has personal jurisdiction over the defendants.   Far from alleging just \none arrangement between Quantum and SPGI, Quantum pleads that all four \ndefendants established or controlled ARCNet and intentionally recruited Quantum \nand four other A labama- based companies to join ARCNet under a conspiracy to \ndefraud Quantum and the other businesses.  Id.  at 5.  To accomplish this, the Case 5:21-cv-01680-AKK   Document 34   Filed 06/28/22   Page 10 of 2511 \n defendants purportedly advertised and sold membership interests in ARCNet to \nQuantum with the expectation that Quantum  would seek and perform ARCNet -\nrelated federal contracts at its location in Huntsville.  See id.  at 5–7.  The defendants \nalso allegedly “used [Quantum’s and the other Alabama businesses’] names for \npromotional efforts.”6  Id.  at 5.   And, a fter SPGI entere d into a contract with \nQuantum, Tolley and Burns allegedly moved funds from the ARCNet account —\nfrom which Quantum would be paid—to the SP Global account in order to divert the money to their own companies.  See id.  at 6–8.  These claims, if true,  establish  that \nQuantum’s claims arise from the defendants’ contacts with Alabama and that the \ndefendants purposefully availed themselves of the benefits of transacting in Alabama \nwhen they actively recruited Quantum and others to join ARCNet.  \n Accordingly, the burden shifts to the defendants to make a “compelling case” \nthat the exercise of personal jurisdiction contravenes  “traditional notions of fair play \nand substantial justice. ”  See Mosseri, 736 F.3d at  1355.   As to this prong, the  court  \nconsiders  four factors: “(1) the burden on the defendant [s]; (2) [Alabama’s]  interest \nin adjudicating the dispute; (3) [Quantum’s] interest in obtaining convenient and \neffective relief; and (4) the judicial system ’s interest in resolving the dispute.”   See \n \n6 To support this claim, Quantum supplies a screenshot of “promotional materials” that appear to \nbe a list of ARCNet’s then -members on its websit e.  See doc. 23- 4.  At least at this juncture, the \ncourt is not totally convinced that this list is a “promotional” material that highlights ARCNet’s \nlinks to Alabama.  However, the court understands Quantum to argue that this evinces the defendants’ deali ngs in places that include Alabama and their attempts to show ARCNet’s reach.  Case 5:21-cv-01680-AKK   Document 34   Filed 06/28/22   Page 11 of 2512 \n id. at 1358 (quoting Licciardello v. Lovelady , 544 F.3d 1280, 1288 (11th Cir. 2008)) \n(internal quotation marks omitted).   Here, the defendants fall short.  \n For one, the defendants say nothing about the burdens, if any, they will \nexperience in having to defend against t his case in Alabama.  See generally docs. \n29; 32.  Nor do they argue that Alabama, where Quantum and several of the other \nallegedly defrauded companies are located, lacks a sufficient interest in adjudicating Quantum’s claims.  And i ndeed, Alabama “has a very strong interest in affording its \nresidents a forum to obtain relief from intentional misconduct of nonresidents causing injury in [Alabama].”  See Lovelady , 544 F.3d at 1288.  Quantum , for its \npart, has an interest in obtaining relief in its home state, and it “is not required to \ntravel to the nonresident[s]’ state of residence to obtain a remedy” for misconduct that, allege dly, was expressly directed at it in Alabama.  See id. ; doc. 23 at 5.   Finally, \nthe judiciary has an interest in resolving this dispute in Alabama, where the \ndefendants purportedly targeted and recruited certain businesses to join  ARCNet and \nwhere the defendants knew  Quantum would  perform ARCNet -related work under \nthe Subaward Agre ement.  See Mosseri, 736 F.3d at 1358; doc. 23 at 5– 6.   \n Collectively, Quantum has met its burden as to personal jurisdiction, and the \ndefendants have failed to show that the exercise of personal jurisdiction offends due \nprocess.  Accordingly, the motion to dismiss, doc. 29, is due to be denied as to \npersonal jurisdiction.  Case 5:21-cv-01680-AKK   Document 34   Filed 06/28/22   Page 12 of 2513 \n B. \n The court turns now to whether Quantum must arbitrate its claims under the \nSubaward Agreement.  “ When, as in this case, a party moves a district court to \ncompel arbitration under the FAA, the court must first determine whether ‘ the \nmaking of the agreement for arbitration or the failure to comply therewith is  . . . in \nissue. ’”  Burch v. P.J. Cheese, In c., 861 F.3d 1338, 1346 (11th Cir. 2017).   Put \nanother way, the court cannot compel Quantum to arbitrate its claims unless \nQuantum  previously agreed to do so, see Employers Ins. of Wausau v. Bright Metal \nSpecialties, Inc. , 251 F.3d 1316, 1322 (11th Cir. 2001), and, at this stage , the court \nmust consider  “(1) whether there is a valid agreement to arbitrate; and (2) whether \nthe dispute in question falls within the scope of that agreement .”  See Scurtu v. Int ’l \nStudent Exch. , 523 F. Supp. 2d 1313, 1318 (S.D. Ala. 2007).    To resolve these \nquestions, the court looks to  “state-law principles relating to ordinary contract \nformation and interpretation, construed through the lens of the federal policy \nfavoring arbitration.”   See id.   “[D]oubts concerning the scope of arbitrable issues \nshould be resolved in favor of arbitration,” but this presumption “does not apply to disputes concerning whether an agreement to arbitrate has been made.”  Burch , 861 \nF.3d at 1346 (emphasis in original).   \nHere , no one disputes t hat Quantum  entered into the Subaward Agreement  \ncontaining the arbitration clause , so the relevant questions are  (1) who can enforce Case 5:21-cv-01680-AKK   Document 34   Filed 06/28/22   Page 13 of 2514 \n the clause and (2) what claims fall under its scope.  The arbitration clause in the \nSubaward Agreement  provides:  \nAny party ( claimant ) who has any dispute relating to this Subaward \nshall provide written notice to any other person that has an interest in \nthe controversy (respondents) describing the general nature of the \ncontroversy.  Said notice must designate an Independe nt Person as an \nauthorized representative who is empowered to fully settle the \ncontroversy on behalf of the claimant.  . . .  If the authorized \nrepresentatives do not resolve the controversy within ten (10) calendar \ndays, or unless both parties agree that a resolution is imminent, the ten \n(10) calendar days may be extended for an additional five (5) working days or additional time as agreed in writing by the parties, otherwise \nthey shall discontinue direct negotiations and submit the controversy to \nmandatory and binding arbitration.  \nIf the controversy is not resolved, the parties to the controversy shall \nsubmit to mandatory and binding arbitration.  The controversy will be \nsettled by a single Ohio, Montgomery County arbitrator.  Said \narbitration will be gover ned by Ohio Statutes.  In the event both parties \nare unable to agree on an Ohio, Montgomery County Arbitrator, then \nthe controversy will be settled by arbitration according to the \nCommercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (AAA).  . . .  The arbitrator’s decision is final and not subject to judicial \nreview.  \nDoc. 23 -6 at 12.  \nThe defendants argue that the broad wording of this agreement —“any dispute \nrelating to this Subaward” —cleanly sweeps Quantum’s lawsuit within its scope and \nmanda tes that Quantum arbitrate the claims it raises here.   See doc. 29 at 14– 15.  \nAdditionally, according to the defendants, although SP Global, Tolley , and Burns \nare not parties to the Subaward Agreement , they can enforce the arbitration clause  \nbecause Quantum relies on the Subaward Agreement to assert claims against them  Case 5:21-cv-01680-AKK   Document 34   Filed 06/28/22   Page 14 of 2515 \n and because the arbitration clause governs disputes between “ any party” and “any \nother person that has an interest in the controversy. ”  Id. at 15 n.14; doc. 32 at 3– 4; \nsee doc. 29- 1 at 12.   For its part, Quantum argues that (1) it has “sued people and \nentities that are not parties to the purported arbitration agreement ,” (2) it has asserted \nclaims unrelated to and outside the agreement’s scope , and (3) the apparent conflict \nin the  provisions of the Subaward Agreement that refer to arbitration and judicial \njurisdiction  show s that “the parties did not intend to be bound by the purported \narbitration clause .”  Doc. 3 1 at 12 –15.  \nBefore delving into thes e arguments, the court must address a problem about \nthe choice of law  to apply in interpreting the Subaward Agreement , including its \narbitration clause.  The Subaward Agreement clearly  provides that “[it]  will be \ngoverned by the laws of the State of Ohi o,” doc. 23- 6 at 15, a clause Quantum cites \nwhile addressing an argument related to the arbitration clause, see doc. 31 at 14.  But \nneither party asks the court to enforce the  choice- of-law provision or, conversely, \nchallenges its enforceability.  Rather, they both argue their motions using Alabama \nlaw.  See docs. 29; 31; 32.  As a result, the court has opted to cite Alabama law in \ninterpreting the Subaward Agreement while  citing corresponding Ohio authorities \nthat suggest the court’s conclusions would be the same under either, albeit using Case 5:21-cv-01680-AKK   Document 34   Filed 06/28/22   Page 15 of 2516 \n slightly different reasonings.7 \n1. \n The first question is whether the defendants who did not enter into the \nSubaward Agreement —SP Global, Burns, and Tolley—can com pel enforcement of \nthe arbitration clause .  In some circumstances, nonparties to an arbitration agreement \ncan indeed compel arbitration.   See Ex parte Stamey, 776 So. 2d 85, 89– 90 (Ala. \n2000).  See also I Sports v. IMG Worldwide, Inc. , 813 N.E. 2d 4, 8 (Oh io Ct. App. \n2004) (outlining the circumstances under which “[a] nonsignatory may compel \narbitration against a party to an arbitration agreement”).  \nFirst, a nonparty may compel arbitration against a party if the nonparty  is an  \nintended third- party beneficiar y of the contract.  Ex parte Dyess , 709 So. 2d 447, \n \n7 The Subaward Agreement also contains a forum -selection clause designating Ohio courts, see \ndoc. 23- 6 at 16, that the court considers in a later section of this opinion.  While the parties likely \nwaived choice -of-law and venue -based challenges by failing to raise them  here, the court believes \nits hybrid method of looking to both sources of law  strikes the most cautious approach to the issue.  \nFor instance, the Sixth Circuit declined to consider  a choice -of-law issue where, although the \nparties’ agreement provided that Ohio law would govern its “interpretation and construction” and \nalthough Michigan, the forum state, favored enforcement of  choice- of-law provisions, the plainti ff \nsued under a Michigan statute and “neither party raised the choice of law provision at the district court level.”  Hardy v. Reynolds & Reynolds Co., 311 F. App’x 759, 761 –62 (6th Cir. 2009).  In \nso holding, the  Sixth Circuit noted that “the general prin ciples of contract interpretation that would \napply in interpreting the [agreement] [did] not significantly differ from Ohio to Michigan.”  Id. at \n762–63.  And in Medalie v. FSC Securities Corporation, the Southern District of Florida applied Florida law to  interpret a contract after recognizing that “[b]y arguing their motions based on \nFlorida law, the parties ha[d] stipulated that Florida law applie [d].”  87 F. Supp. 2d 1295, 1297 \n(S.D. Fla. 2000).  To be sure, in Medalie , the parties had also contractuall y consented to venue, \npersonal jurisdiction, and subject matter jurisdiction in Florida.  Id.  But the court also observed \nthat “[b] ecause the parties did not raise a conflict of laws issue in [their]  motions and argued their \nmotions based only on Florida law, the law of the forum [would]  govern, absent any facts justifying \nthe application of some other state ’s law. ”  Id. at 1297 n.1. \n Case 5:21-cv-01680-AKK   Document 34   Filed 06/28/22   Page 16 of 2517 \n 450, 452 (Ala. 1997) ; I Sports, 813 N.E. 2d at  8.  Here, however, SP Global, Tolley, \nand Burns cannot compel arbitration under a third- party beneficiary theory because \nthey have not established Quantum’s and SPGI’s intent to bestow a direct benefit on \nthem.  Indeed, the Subaward Agreement expressly provides that “[t]here are no third-\nparty beneficiaries to this Subaward” and explains that “[n] othing in this Subaward, \nexpress  or implied, confers any legal or equitable right, benefit, or remedy of any \nnature whatsoever upon any other person or party . . . .”  See doc. 23- 6 at 16.  \n In Alabama, an arbitration agreement may also be sufficiently broad to include \nclaims against nonparties.   See Stamey, 776 So. 2d at 89– 90.  For example , Alabama \ncourts have found that a rbitration agreements cover  claims against nonparties when \nthe agreement expressly  covers “all disputes,”  the description of the entities subject \nto arbitration is not restrictive, the claims against the nonparties ar ise out of the \ncontract  or are intertwined with the claims against the party, and the nonparties are \nclosely related to a party .  See Ex parte Na pier, 723 So. 2d 49, 53 –54 (Ala. 1998) ; \nEx parte Gates, 675 So. 2d 371, 374– 75 (Ala. 1996); Matthews  v. AT&T Operations, \nInc., 764 F. Supp. 2d 1272, 1283 –84 (N.D. Ala. 2011) .  Not dissimilarly, Ohio courts \nalso recognize the ability of a nonsignatory to compel arbitration against a signatory \nunder an equitable estoppel theory, which “arises when the signatory to the contract \nalleges ‘substantially interdependent and concerted misconduct by both \nthe nonsignatory and one or more of the signatories to the contract. ’”  See I Sports, Case 5:21-cv-01680-AKK   Document 34   Filed 06/28/22   Page 17 of 2521 \n relating to the agreement’ is considered ‘the paradigm of a broad clause.’”  Id.  The \nCourt also observed that “[a]rbitration is not limited to claims alleging a breach of \ncontract,” meaning a broad arbitration clause can  cover alleged violations of \nstatutory rights so long as “the parties agreed to arbitrate the issue.”  See id.  at 493.   \nFollowing these principles, the Court of Appea ls of Ohio in Sebold v. Latina Design \nBuild Group, L.L.C. addressed an arbitration clause that covered “any \n‘disagreements arising out of contract or breach thereof.’”  166 N.E. 3d 688, 692 (Ohio Ct. App. 2021).  There, the court held that the plaintiffs’ claims for violations \nof the Ohio Home Construction Services Supplier Act  and the  Ohio Consumer Sales \nPractices Act , breach of contract , and breach of implied duty to perform in a \nworkmanlike manner, among other claims, “[were] all disputes that emanate[d] from \nthe parties’ contractual relationship” and thus “[fell] squarely under the arbitration provision.”  Id.  at 691, 693.\n9 \nThis case law demands a broad interpretation of the phrase “any dispute \nrelating to this Subaward,”  and Quantum’s claims fall within the scope of claims \nbroadly related to the Subaward Agreement .  See doc. 23- 6 at 12.  The unjust \nenrichment claim alleges that the defendants unjustly receiv ed funds  from AFRL \nbecause of Quantum’s work performed under the Subaward Agreement.  Doc. 23 at \n \n9 Moreover, the court recognized that “[a]ny doubts concerning the scope of arbitrable issues \nshould be resolved in favor of arbitration.”  Sebold , 166 N.E. 3d at 692.  Case 5:21-cv-01680-AKK   Document 34   Filed 06/28/22   Page 21 of 2522 \n 12.  The fraud and deceit claim alleges that SPGI, Burns, and Tolley fraudulently \nconcealed that they had no intention to pay Quantum and falsely promised contract \nopportunities to induce Quantum to enter the Subaward Agreement.  Id.  at 13 –14.  \nThe conversion claim alleges that the defendants rerouted funds that Quantum  \nearned  for work performed under the Subaward Agreement.  Id.  at 15 –16.  The \nbreach of fiduciary duty claim alleges a relationship of trust established by \nQuantum’s reasonable belie f that SPGI, Burns, and Tolley would pay Quantum for \nwork performed under the Subaward Agreement.  Id.  at 17.  The conspiracy claim \nrests on all of the se allegations.  See id.  at 18.  And the Alabama Securities Act claim \nalleges that the ARCNet membership is a security under Alabama law that SPGI, \nBurns, and Tolley sold to Quantum so they could reap funds from AFRL intended for Quantum under the Subaward Agreement.  Id.  at 20 –21.   \nIn short, w ithout the Subaward Agreement, there are no claims.\n10  And the \nfederal and state policies  favoring arbitration bolsters this conclusion .  Accordingly, \nall of Quantum’s claims fall within the broad arbitration clause of the Subaward \nAgreement.  \n \n10 The conclusion is the same even if Quantum is asserting  that the defendants withheld a separate \nbenefit owed to Quantum because of its membership in ARCNet , and not specifically because of \nthe Subaward Agreement.  ARCNet would apparently “solicit oppor tunities” for its members.  \nDoc. 23 at 5.  Those opportunities were projects under the Cooperative Agreement.  See id.  at 4–\n6.  Quantum seized one such opportunity and consequently entered into the Subaward Agreement.  \nIn other words, the Subaward Agreement was Quantum’s benefit from joining ARCNet.  Therefore,  none of the claims can ignore the Subaward Agreement and rest only on Quantum’s \nmembership in ARCNet.  Case 5:21-cv-01680-AKK   Document 34   Filed 06/28/22   Page 22 of 2523 \n 3. \n Quantum’s final argument that  contradictory language in the Subaward \nAgreement obscures the parties’ intent  is also unavailing .  See doc. 31 at 14.   The \nallegedly contradictory terms are the arbitration provision and the forum -selection \nclause  in the Subaward Agreement.  See id.   The forum -selection clause is contained \nwithin the provision that reads:  \nThis Subaward will be governed by the laws of the State of Ohio. The \nParties agree that jurisdiction and venue for any dispute arising under \n(or as a result of) this Subaward will be trie d in appropriate federal or \nstate courts encompassing Montgomery County, Ohio, and each Party \nsubmits to the jurisdiction of such courts.  \nDoc. 29- 1 at 16.11  To be sure, when read in conjunction with the arbitration clause, \nthis provision may appear to establish incompatible agreements to arbitrate and to \nlitigate.  However, the clauses can be reconciled.  \nUnder Alabama law and Ohio law, courts must attempt to reconcile \ninconsistent contract terms, give effect to each term, and construe the terms in \n \n11 Again, neither party has asked the court to enforce this provision.  See docs. 29; 31; 32.  See  also \ndoc. 31 at 14 n.9.  Presumably, Quantum believes its claims  fall outside the scope of this provision, \nsee doc. 31 at 14 n.9,  and the defendants ultimately want Quantum to arbitrate its claims outside \nof any judicial forum, be it an  Ohio court or an Alabama court , see doc. 32 at 3–4.  (Quantum also \nsuggests that applying Ohio law would not alter the  relevant components of the  court’s analysis, \nanyway.  See doc. 31 at 13.)   While this court believes that Quantum’s claims  likely  fall within the \nscope  of the forum -selection clause for the same reasons they fall under  the arbitration clause, see \nsupra, because the parties do not contest venue and in light of the federal policy favoring valid \narbitration agreements, the court will dismiss the case on arb itration, not venue, grounds.  And \nagain, because the Subaward Agreement states that Ohio law will govern, in an abundance of caution, the court cites to Alabama law and Ohio law in its interpretation of the Subaward Agreement.  The court also observes tha t these laws appear to align in this context.  Case 5:21-cv-01680-AKK   Document 34   Filed 06/28/22   Page 23 of 2524 \n relation to the contract as a whole.  Bay Shore Power Co. v. Oxbow Energy Sols., \nLLC, 969 F.3d 660, 666 (6th Cir. 2020); Advance Tank & Const r. Co. v. Gulf Coast \nAsphalt Co. , 968 So. 2d 520, 527 (Ala. 2006).  And generally speaking, courts have \nreconciled apparently contradictory arbitration and forum -selection clauses by \nfinding that the parties intended to arbitrate claims within the scope of the arbitration clause, litigate nonarbitrable claims, and  choose the governing law and forum for \nthat litigation .  See, e.g. , Applied Energetics, Inc. v. NewOak Cap. Markets, LLC, \n645 F.3d 522, 525 (2d Cir. 2011); Pers. Sec. & Safety Sys. Inc. v. Motorola Inc. , 297 \nF.3d 388, 395– 96 (5th Cir. 2002); Advance Tank , 968 So. 2d at 527; Cook v. Cmty. \nHealth Partne rs, No. 13CA010520, 2015 WL 1291514, at *3 –4 (Ohio Ct. App. \nMarch 23, 2015); Sims v. Clarendon Nat. Ins. Co. , 336 F. Supp. 2d 1311, 1319 n.3 \n(S.D. Fla. 2004).  \n Here, the parties  agreed  to submit “any dispute relating to [t]he Subaward” to \n“mandatory and binding arbitration,” doc. 29- 1 at 12, but also agreed “ that \njurisdiction and venue for any dispute arising under (or as a result of) this Subaward \n[would] be tried in appropriate federal  or state courts encompassing Montgomery \nCounty, Ohio” applying Ohio law , id. at 16.   Under a plain reading of the provisions,  \nthe parties agreed to litigate only the issues of jurisdiction and venue in Ohio court \nand to leave all other issues  to arbitration.  And a lthough they also preselected this  \njurisdiction and venue, the forum -selection clause would place any disputes about Case 5:21-cv-01680-AKK   Document 34   Filed 06/28/22   Page 24 of 2525 \n \njurisdiction and venue —e.g., challenges to  enforceability —in the hands of the Ohio  \ncourt.  Then, the  arbitration clause would require arbitration of all other issues.   \nBecause the clauses can be reconciled ,12 the court sees no basis for setting aside the \narbitration provision, and Quantum must  submit to arbitrat ion on its claims.   \nIV. \n In sum, the  court will grant the motion to dismiss, doc. 29, because the \ndefendants can validly enforce the mandatory arbitration clause against Quantum on \nits claims  under the Subaward Agreement.  As a result, the court need  not wade into \nthe sufficiency of Quantum’s factual allegations or the Rule 12(b)(6) aspect of the \nmotion to dismiss.  A separate order follows.  \nDONE  the 28th day of June, 2022.  \n \n        \n_________________________________ \nABDUL K. KALLON  \nUNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE  \n \n12 A broader interpretation of the forum- selection clause would provide  Ohio courts jurisdiction \nover all disputes , without limitation.  Quantum seems to endorse this interpretation by selectively \nomitting the c rucial language “jurisdiction and venue” and “will be tried” from the forum -selection \nclause.  See  doc. 31 at 14 –15.  Perhaps Quantum is correct that the parties essentially meant to say \nthat jurisdiction and venue for any dispute arising under the Subawar d Agreement are the federal \nand state courts encompassing Montgomery County, Ohio.  See id.; doc. 26- 3 at 16.  Even if so , \nhowever, the forum -selection and arbitration clauses can still be reconciled .  Quantum and SPGI \nwould have agreed to arbitrate all cl aims within the scope of the arbitration clause and to litigate \nin that particular forum issues outside the scope of the clause or arising out of the arbitration.  This \nreconciliation suggests that the parties did intend to be bound by arbitration for the claims at issue.  Case 5:21-cv-01680-AKK   Document 34   Filed 06/28/22   Page 25 of 25",

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: Anthony Bressi was charged with conspiracy to manufacture and distribute controlled substances. Over the course of five years, several pretrial motions were filed by Bressi, including challenges to evidence and the indictment itself. The court denied most of his motions, addressing issues from the alleged breach of an immunity agreement to the destruction of evidence and constitutionality of the Controlled Substances Act, while delaying judgment on the misuse of grand jury subpoenas. The case does not involve artificial intelligence or automated systems.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: The main legal issues center around whether evidence should be suppressed due to alleged government misconduct, including breaches of agreements, improper use of grand jury subpoenas, illegal search and seizure, and if the indictment should be dismissed based on these grounds and challenges to the Controlled Substances Act.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court denied all of Bressi's motions except for reserving judgment on the misuse of grand jury subpoenas, highlighting a lack of evidence supporting Bressi's claims and emphasizing procedural correctness in the government’s actions.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine you're a kid who got caught breaking a rule and you think the evidence collected against you was mishandled or unfair. You argue that the people in charge didn't play by the rules either. Much like a referee listening to complaints, the judge hears your side and the side of the people who caught you. In this story, the judge thinks that the complaints aren't convincing enough to change the outcome and decides everything but waits to decide on one tricky part involving how you were investigated. In simpler terms, the judge said, \"Most of what you're saying doesn't change what you did wrong, but I'll think more about this one thing before the final decision.\"",

No. 4:19-CR-00207-01 \n(Chief Judge Brann) \n  \nMEMORANDUM OPINION \n \nSEPTEMBER 6, 2024 \nI. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND \nOn June 27, 2019, a grand jury indict ed Defendant Anthony Bressi charging \nhim with conspiracy to manufacture, distribute, and possess with intent to distribute \ncontrolled substances, and with possession with the intent to distribute controlled \nsubstances.1 In the five years since Bressi entered a plea of not guilty,2 he has filed \na litany of pretrial motions, including several motions to suppress evidence.3 On \nFebruary 28, 2023, the Court denied each of those Motions.4 In July 2023, Bressi’s \nco-Defendant filed a Daubert Motion which Bressi joined.5 Over the next year, the \nparties litigated that issue, including multiple attempts from the Government to \n \n1  Indictment, Doc. 16.

The Court was finally able to \nresolve those issues on July 3, 2024.6 Under the impression  that the matter was \nfinally ready for trial, the Court scheduled  a status conference for July 19, 2024 for \nthe purpose of setting a trial date.7 \nBressi had other ideas. The morning of the status conference,  Bressi filed an \nomnibus Motion seeking to suppress certain evidence, dismiss the indictment, limit \nthe testimony of Government expert Re becca Patrick, and compel discovery.8 \nBressi’s Motion is ripe for disposition and,  for the reasons below, is denied in its \nentirety except as to Bressi’s Motion to Suppress Evidence Seized via Grand Jury \nSubpoena.9 \nII. MOTIONS TO DISMISS \nBressi argues three bases to dismiss the Indictment: 1) the Government’s \nfailure to honor an immunity agreement; 2) the Government’s destruction of crucial \nevidence; and 3) the unconsti tutionality of the Controlled Substances Act. The Court \naddresses each in turn. \n  \n \n6  July 3, 2024 Mem.

The Court reserv es judgment as to this  issue pending further \nbriefing and a hearing, whic h will be scheduled by separate Order of Court. Case 4:19-cr-00207-MWB     Document 368     Filed 09/06/24     Page 2 of 243 A. Immunity Agreement \nBressi alleges that his prosecution is  a breach of an im munity agreement \nbetween him and the Government: \nOn or about June 8, 2019, while his business premises were being \nsearched, Defendant spoke with law enforcement agents and ultimately \nagreed to deliver a counterfeit controlled substance as part of an \nimmunity agreement. Said agreemen t included terms that he would not \nbe prosecuted, that his employees would be left alone and not \nprosecuted[.]10 \nBressi acknowledges that “there was no formal writ ten agreement,” but that \nhe had reason to believe such an agreement existed. He suggests that belief was \nreasonable because 1) when he was previ ously prosecuted in an explosives case, \nnobody else was charged, including the purchasers of the explosives and the \nindividual who arranged the dea l; and 2) while in federal prison, Bressi had “heard \nof numerous situations in which pressure  was placed on family members to force \nsomeone to confess, cooperate  or turn themselves in.” 11  \nFirst, there are any number of reasons th at others may not have been charged \nin the prior case. Second, whether there are situations where law enforcement may \nhave placed pressure on fam ily members of an individual to secure that individual’s \nconfession or cooperation says  nothing about whether that happened here, nor is it \nevidence of an immunity  agreement if it did. \n \n10  Doc. 356, at 41. \n11  Doc. 362, at 15. Case 4:19-cr-00207-MWB     Document 368     Filed 09/06/24     Page 3 of 244 Bressi also asserts it would be illogical for a seasoned criminal like himself to \nadmit to committing the crime of manuf acturing and distributing hundreds of \nkilograms of controlled substances  absent an immunity agreement.12 It could also be \nsaid that it would be illogical for a person who recently finished a lengthy prison \nsentence, particularly a person who was on supervised release, to immediately \nengage in further criminal activity. Neve rtheless, as evidenced by this Court’s \ncriminal docket and Bressi’s own actions, such things happen all the time.13 \nTo the extent that Bressi observes that  such courses of action are illogical or \nfoolish, the Court agrees. However, Bressi ’s conclusory argument that he is not a \nfool or that he did not engage in  foolish behavior is insufficient.14 Bressi’s Motion \nto Dismiss the Indictment for breach of  an immunity agreement is denied. \nB. Destruction of Evidence \n Dismissal of an indictment for the failure to preserve potentially useful \nevidence is an extreme sanction, only appropriate where the Government engages in \n“shocking, outrageous, and clearly intolerable” conduct which renders the trial \nfundamentally unfair.15 Bressi argues that dismissal of  the Indictment is warranted \n \n12  Id. \n13  The Court notes that this is true even if Bressi is innocent of these charges. Bressi was \npreviously arrested and convicted for Manu facturing Explosives Without a License. United \nStates v. Bressi , No. 4:95-CR-252 (M.D. Pa.). He was la ter convicted of Conspiracy to \nManufacture a Controlled Substance while on pret rial release awaiting trial on the explosives \ncharge. United States v. Bressi , No. 4:96-CR-238 (M.D. Pa.). \n14  See U.S. v. Thompson, 25 F.3d 1558, 1562-63 (11th Cir. 1994)  (conclusory statement that \nimmunity agreement existed insufficient). \n15  U.S. v. Henry , 842 Fed. Appx. 809, 815 (3d Cir. 2021) (collecting cases). Case 4:19-cr-00207-MWB     Document 368     Filed 09/06/24     Page 4 of 245 because the Government “engaged in the destruction of crucial evidence in this \ncase.”16 Such evidence includes 1) substances  which were not sa mpled or tested by \nthe Pennsylvania State Police drug lab;17 2) office equipment, files, and other \ndocumentation including evidence of SHIVA’s consulting work;18 3) Bressi’s \nemails;19 and 4) surveillance footage.20 The Court addresses each in turn. \nFirst , as discussed in its Memorandum  Opinion regarding Bressi’s Daubert \nMotion, the failure to test or preserve full, unopened containers  was not a ground to \nexclude an expert opinion.21 Similarly, it is not a basis upon which to dismiss an \nindictment. Rebecca Patrick te stified that it would have been impossible to store all \nthe chemicals at her laboratory.22 “[D]estruction of evidence  in accordance with an \nestablished procedure precludes a finding of bad faith absent other compelling \nevidence.”23 As the Court noted in its prior Opini on, Bressi can argue at trial that the \nsealed containers did not contain the substances advertised on their labels.24 He can \nalso cross-examine Patrick and other Gove rnment witnesses regarding their practice \nof disposing of these substances. But Bre ssi has not carried his burden to show bad \nfaith, much less that the destr oyed evidence is exculpatory. \n \n16  Doc. 356 ¶ 45. \n17  Id. ¶ 45. \n18  Id. ¶ 46. \n19  Id. ¶¶ 47-48. \n20  Id. ¶ 49. \n21  July 3, 2024 Mem.

Case 4:19-cr-00207-MWB     Document 368     Filed 09/06/24     Page 5 of 246 Second, the Government has indicated th at it has not destroyed any other \nevidence recovered from SHIVA or Bressi’s home.25 Rather, it has preserved all of \nthe evidence it recovered— absent the chemicals discussed above—which remains \navailable for Bressi to inspect. Files, equi pment, or other persona l effects which were \nnot recovered by the Government  were left at the premises, which Bressi had been \nrenting. Disposition of the properties was then  left to the landlords . Bressi apparently \nfaults the Government for not taking cust ody of and preserving the entirety of his \npossessions. However, the Government has no such obligation. \nThird , Bressi avers that he “repeatedly offered the Government access to his \nemail accounts, as well as SHIVA’s, yet the Government declined that access and \nfailed to preserve those emails which are now irretrievably lost.”26 Within this \nallegation is an admission that Bressi hims elf had access to these emails; he could \nnot have offered the Government access to something he did not himself possess. \nFurther, “email by its nature, has a sender and a recipient. If [Bressi] wished, he might seek copies of any important email from the counterparty.”\n27 Finally, as above, \nthe Government is under no obligation to seize and preserve Bressi’s emails. \nFourth , the Government notes that “[n]othing of evidentiary value was \nrecovered [from the surveillance footage], as it appeared th at the surveillance system \n \n25  Doc. 365, at 8-10. \n26  Doc. 356, ¶ 47. \n27  U.S. v. Lattanzio , No. CR 15-446 (KM), 2017 WL 3297510, at *7 n.11 (D.N.J. Aug. 1, 2017). Case 4:19-cr-00207-MWB     Document 368     Filed 09/06/24     Page 6 of 247 continued to record and overwrite from June 8, 2019 through August when it was \nrecovered.”28 Contrary to Bressi’s assertion,  the surveillance system was not \ndestroyed, but remains availa ble to Bressi for inspection upon request, as it has been \nfor the last five years.29 \nFurther, Bressi overstates the extent to which the refere nced evidence would \nbe exculpatory. Throughout this case, Br essi has maintained that SHIVA was a \nlegitimate business engaged in the de velopment of “some world-changing \ntechnologies in fields as diverse as en ergy, medicine, bevera ges, communications, \nentertainment, aerospace, transportation, chemistry, robotics, artificial intelligence, \nand defense.”30 Even if all of that is true, it would have little bearing on the \nGovernment’s allegations that, whatever  else SHIVA was doing, it was also \nmanufacturing and distributing controlled substances. Bressi misunderstands the \nGovernment’s burden. It need not prove  beyond a reasonable doub t that Bressi was \nnot producing “Dazzle coating”—a coating to protect aircraft, drones, rockets, and other vehicles from laser directed energy weapons. Rather, the Government simply \nmust prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Bressi was manufacturing and distributing controlled substances. \n \n28  Doc. 365, at 10. \n29  Id. \n30  Doc. 271, at 5.

Controlled Substances Act \nIn the half century sin ce the enactment of the C ontrolled Substances Act \ncourts have rejected countle ss challenges to its constituti onality. Bressi’s challenges \nfare no better. The CSA does not violate the Ninth Amendment.31 It does not violate \nthe Commerce Clause,32 and therefore is not an unconstitutional exercise of the \npolice power.33 The delegation to the DEA, through the Attorney General, of the \nscheduling of substances under the CS A is constitutionally permissible.34 \nBressi suggests that the Controlled Substances Act burdens his First \nAmendment right to practice his religion as a Tantrist.35 Bressi avers that Hindus—\nTantra is a sect of Hinduism—have a l ong history of using marihuana, which is \nrestricted by the CSA.36 Assuming arguendo  that the CSA’s prohibition on the use, \n \n31  See Montana Caregivers Ass'n, LLC v.

Financial Records \nAs Bressi notes, his “financial record s were initially provided to the FBI by \nfinancial institutions through Bank Suspicious Activity Reports (BSARs) and \nCurrency Transaction Reports (CTRs).”44 Arguing that his financial records are \nprotected by the Fourth Amendment, Bressi simply rehashes an argument that this \nCourt already rejected when it deni ed Bressi’s last suppression motion.45 Bressi \neffectively asks the Court to reconsider its prior decision, but offers no new evidence or intervening change in the la w that would warrant doing so.\n46 Bressi’s suggestion \nthat suppression is warranted under the Fifth Amendment is similarly meritless.47 \nB. Improper Grand Jury Subpoenas \nBressi argues that certain evidence should be excluded based on what he \nperceives to be misuse of the grand jury.48 He notes that 56 subpoenas were issued \nafter Bressi and his co-Defendants we re indicted.

Deficient Warrants \nBressi’s omnibus motion also includes a request for a hearing pursuant to \nFranks v. Delaware,52 and suppression of evidence seized from warrants issued on \nor after June 18, 2018.53 But Bressi already requested a Franks hearing in his prior \nomnibus motion, filed in April 2022, whic h this court denied in February 2023.54  \nBressi’s motion either rehashes argume nts this Court already rejected, makes \nallegations unrelated to Franks , or makes allegations wh ich are both unsupported by \n \n49  Id. ¶ 33. \n50  Doc. 365, at 6. \n51  U.S. v.

So Bressi’s second request for \na Franks hearing is denied. \nIn Franks v. Delaware , the Supreme Court of the United States set out the \nallegations necessary to ma ndate an evidentiary heari ng to challenge a search \nwarrant’s veracity.55 Because there is “a presumption of validity with respect to an \naffidavit supporting [a] search warrant,”56 “Franks requires a demanding \npreliminary showing before a hearing is even granted.”57 \n“To obtain a Franks hearing, a defendant must es tablish (1) that a warrant \napplication contained false statements made  with reckless disregard for the truth and \n(2) that the remaining truthful statements , standing alone, do not establish probable \ncause.”58 “[O]missions are made with reckless di sregard for the truth when an officer \nreckless omits facts that any reasonable person would want to know,” whereas \n“assertions are made with reckless disreg ard for the truth when an officer has \nobvious reasons to doubt the truth of what he or she is asserting.”59  \n“There must be a ‘substantial prelim inary showing’ that the affidavit \ncontained a false statement, which was ma de knowingly or with reckless disregard \nfor the truth, which is material to the finding of probable cause.”60 “In order to make \n \n55  Franks , 438 U.S. at 171-72. \n56  Id. at 155-56. \n57  U.S. v.

Bressi does not point to a specific search \nwarrant he claims was obtained through Agent O’Malley’s intentional or reckless \ndisregard for the truth. He only gestures va guely to the “warrant applications,” the \n“initial warrant applications ,” and “later warrants.”62 As Bressi’s subsequent filing \ndemonstrates, many search warrant s were executed in this case.63 Bressi himself \nseems to acknowledge that his allegations apply to differe nt sections of different \nwarrants. But this C ourt cannot apply the Franks test by babbling about falsehoods \nin the abstract. Instead, as  the Supreme Court of the Un ited States has instructed, \nBressi has a burden to “point out specifically  the portion of the warrant affidavit that \nis claimed to be false.”64 There is a good reason for this burden. For any falsehood \nthat Bressi has satisfied his substantial preliminary showing on, this Court must \n \n61  Id. (citing Franks, 438 U.S. at 171). \n62  Doc. 356 ¶¶ 28-31. \n63  See Exh.

So more specificity is required to \nenable the analysis Bressi is requesting from  this Court. If Bressi expects this Court \nto comb through these e xhibits and litigate the Franks motion on his behalf, that \nexpectation is misplaced. \nSecondly, this Court would never reach the warrant -reconstruction phase for \nBressi’s request because none of his false statements or om issions have been \nsupported through a substantial preliminary showing.  \nIn his initial motion, Bressi argued that Agent O’Malley omitted information \nindicating that SHIVA may have operate d for licit purposes, including Bressi’s \npatent applications, SHIVA’s purchases of non-drug-precursor chemicals, and \nSHIVA’s expenditure of money on supplies and equipment unconnected with the \nproduction of trafficking in contro lled substances or  money laundering.66 This Court \nrejected the argument that these omissions were made with intentional or reckless \ndisregard for the truth becau se such facts showed no contradiction, and therefore \nwere extraneous, rather than facts that  “any reasonable person would have known \nthat . . . the judge would wish to know.”67  Bressi now states that O’Malley was \n \n65  See Wilson , 212 F.3d at 789; Dempsey v.

It shows that he is doing \nhis job.  \nBressi also states that, as demonstr ated by subsequent testimony, Joesph \nBozenko “was not an individual who was aw are of research lab practices but was \nable only to provide information as to whether there were illicit purposes of these \npurported purchases.”72 First, Bressi has failed to demonstrate that O’Malley was \n \n68  Doc. 356 ¶¶ 24, 26-27. \n69  Id. ¶¶ 19-21 (citing Doc. 297-1 at 12-13). \n70  Doc. 297-1 at 13. \n71  Doc. 356 ¶ 21. \n72  Doc. 356 ¶¶ 22, 26.

And if there is a nywhere in the 900 plus pages of warrant affidavits and \napplications that O’Malley has cited Boze nko for such expertise, Bressi has failed \nto fulfill his burden to “point out specifically  the portion of the wa rrant affidavit that \nis claimed to be false.”76 So this objection fails three times over to support a \n“substantial preliminary showing” of an intentional or reckless omission. \nBressi’s original omnibus motion also re ferenced information that he alleges \nundermines the confidential witnesses’ credibility: both CW-1 and CW-2 were \n \n73  Id. ¶ 28. \n74  See Thompson v.

Bressi repeats these \nallegations in his supplemental motion.78 This argument, too, is rejected for the same \nreason now as it was rejected in February 2023. \nBressi also claims that Agent O’Malle y withheld various information from \nBozenko.79 But Bozenko is not a magistrate j udge; he was not as ked to evaluate \nprobable cause, but rather to answer a specific question about whether some of \nBressi and SHIVA’s purchases were cons istent with manufacturing controlled \nsubstances. For the same reason, this information would be extraneous to a \nmagistrate reviewing any of O’Malley’s warrant applications.

As the Court has explained, the Government is under no \nobligation to either disprove or help Bressi prove his theo ry of the case. As to the \nformer, it can be true th at Bressi was both manufacturing illicit substances and \noperating a legitimate business. As to the la tter, that burden falls entirely on Bressi. \nWhile he can certainly use the evidence the Government does present at trial to prove \nhis case, the Government is under no obligati on to introduce eviden ce for his benefit. \nOf course, Bressi need not prove anythi ng. He need not testify or present any \nevidence at all. However, the nature of Br essi’s filings and arguments to date suggest \nthat he may seek to demonstrate his innoc ence at trial by proving that SHIVA was a \nlegitimate business. To that end, the Cour t notes that, while Br essi has opposed the \nGovernment’s forensic chemis t expert witnesses, he ha s not disclosed any expert \nwitnesses of his own. The Court therefore briefly addresses two issues that it foresees \nas potential areas of concern as trial approaches. \nFirst, Bressi has previously suggested that the Government’s untimely \ndisclosures have precluded him from engaging his own experts.93 Insofar as Bressi \nintends to make a similar argument regarding the evidence which is the subject of \nhis Motion to Compel, discussed below, it is without merit. Bres si cannot circumvent \nthe deadlines for expert disclosures by faili ng to request the evidence that he seeks \nto have an expert review. Where Bressi ha s failed to request that certain evidence is \n \n93  See, e.g., Doc. 348, at 4 (suggesting that Government ’s untimely expert di sclosures prevented \nhim from reviewing evidence with his own expert).

The right to testify in one’s defense “is not without limit.”94 Bressi “does \nnot have an unfettered right to  offer testimony that is . . . inadmissible under standard \nrules of evidence.”95 Bressi has not disclosed himsel f as an expert, identified any \nsuch expert testimony he ma y provide, nor is there any ev idence in the record that \nhe is quailed to offer such testimony. \nThe Court emphasizes that the Court’s Opinion and ruling does not preclude \nBressi from testifying or introducing evidence in his defense.96 Bressi may still \nattempt to prove that SH IVA was a legitimate busine ss through the Government’s \nevidence or by offering his own non-expert evidence, including his own non-expert \ntestimony.97 The Court does not mean to dissuade Bressi from testifying or otherwise \noffering such evidence. Rather, it is the Cour t’s intention is to provide clarity as the \nparties, in particular Bressi, prepare for trial. \n  \n \n94  Jones v. Davis, 8 F.4th 1027, 1036 (9th Cir. 2021). \n95  Id.

Although the case involves AI through data usage concerns with TikTok, the decision focused on jurisdiction rather than the AI implications.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue:**\n   Whether the case should remain in federal court or be remanded to state court, focusing on whether there is a substantial federal question justifying federal jurisdiction.\n\n3. **Court's Holding:**\n   The court held that the case does not fall under federal jurisdiction because it does not involve a substantial federal question, and thus granted the State's motion to remand the case to the Circuit Court of Union County, Arkansas.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation:**\n   Imagine you are explaining this to a child: Arkansas told TikTok, \"You're not telling the truth about what you do with people's secrets.\" TikTok wanted the case to be handled by the bigger, federal court, but the judge decided it wasn't a big enough federal issue, so it sent the case back to a local court where it started.",

Case No. 1:23- cv-01038 \n \n \nTIKTOK INC. , TIKTOK PTE. LTD.,  \nBYTEDANCE INC., and BYTEDANCE  \nLTD.  \n DEFENDANT S \n \nORDER \nBefore the Court is Plaintiff the State of Arkansas’s (the State) Motion to Remand to the \nCircuit Court of Union County, Arkansas.  ECF No. 23.  Defendants TikTok Inc., TikTok Pte. \nLtd., ByteDance Inc. , and ByteDance Ltd.’s (collectively, TikTok ) have responded.  ECF No. 25. \nThe State has filed a reply to TikTok’s response in opposition of the State’s motion to remand.  \nECF No. 31.   \nTikTok has  also filed a Motion for Oral Argument.  ECF No. 26.  The St ate has filed a \nresponse in support of TikTok’s Motion for Oral Argument.  ECF No. 28.  The matters are ripe \nfor the Court’s consideration.  \nI. BACKGROUND \nOn March 28, 2023, the State filed the instant action in the Circuit Court of Union County, \nArkansas.  ECF No. 3.  The State brings seven (7) claims, all of which arise under the Arkansas Deceptive Trade Practices Act .  ECF No. 3.  More specifically, the State alleges that TikTok \nviolat ed the Arkansas Deceptive Trade Practices Act by:  \n• “[D]eceiving Arkansas consumers  . . . about the risk of the Chinese Government \nand Communist Part accessing and exploiting their data” ( Count I );  \n Case 1:23-cv-01038-SOH     Document 32      Filed 07/25/23     Page 1 of 16 PageID #:\n<pageID>2 \n • “[K]nowingly paint[ing] a false and deceptive picture for Arkansas consumers, \nnamely that there is little to no risk of the Chinese Governm ent or Communist Party \n. . . accessing and exploiting their data” ( Count II );  \n \n• “[F]ailing to ‘ alert Arkansas consumers to the fact that it may share their data with \nentities and individuals in China , who are subject to Chinese Law,’”  in its privacy \npolicy ( Count III);  \n \n• “[N]ot disclosing to consumers in TikTok’s recent or current U.S. privacy \npolicy, . . . the fact that it may share their data with entities and individuals in China, \nwho are subject to Chinese Law” ( Count IV );  \n \n• Not alerting “ Arkansas  consumers to the fact that it may share their data with \nentities and individuals in China , who are subject to Chinese laws that expose their \ndata to the Chinese government and communist party” ( Count V );  \n \n• “[N]ot disclosing to consumers in its recent or current  U.S. privacy policy, . . . that \nit may share their data with entities and individuals in China” ( Count VI ); and  \n \n• Claiming that Separate Defendant TikTok is independent from Separate Defendant \nByteDance “when any reasonable person would understand . . . ByteDance’s influence and direction over TikTok hiring[] employees, and management shows that ByteDance exercises significant control over TikTok” ( Count VII ).   \n \nECF No. 3, at 54- 60.  The State seeks a declaration “that TikTok’s actions are deceptive and \nunconscionable,” an injunction preventing TikTok “from continuing to treat Arkansas consumers \nunconscionably and deceptively,” and an award of “civil penalties of  not more than ten thousand \ndollars per violation” and “costs incurred in inv estigating and pursuing this action.”  ECF No. 3, \nat 61.   \nOn May 9 , 2023, TikTok  removed the action to the United States District Court for the \nWestern District of Arkansas.  ECF No. 2.  TikTok  then filed a motion for a stay .  See  ECF No. 6.  \nTikTok expla ined that the State would file a motion to remand and request ed additional time to \nanswer the State’s complaint pending resolution of that remand motion.  ECF No. 6.  On May 15, 2023, the Court granted TikTok’s  motion to stay, requiring the State to f ile any motion seeking \nremand on or before Thursday, June 8, 2023, and providing that “if the Court denies [the State’s]  Case 1:23-cv-01038-SOH     Document 32      Filed 07/25/23     Page 2 of 16 PageID #:\n<pageID>3 \n motion for remand, then [the State]  will have thirty (30) days to amend its complaint, and [TikTok]  \nwill then have thirty (30) days aft er the filing of any amended complaint to file [its]  responsive \npleadings.”  ECF No. 7, at 2.   \nOn June 8, 2023, the State timely filed the instant motion to remand.  ECF No. 23.   The  \nState contends th at remand to the Circuit Court of Union County is appropriate because its claims \narise exclusively under Arkansas law.  In the State’s view,  the only issue is “whether the Arkansas \nDeceptive Trade Practices Act allows TikTok to continue lying to Arkansas consumers about what \nhappens with their data.”  ECF No. 24, at 8.   T he State argues that “how the federal government \naddresses the security risks posed by the disclosure of Americans’ private data to the Chinese Government has no bearing on the question of  whether an American company’s statements about \nsuch disclosure violate the Arkansas Deceptive Trade Practices Act.”  ECF No. 24, at 11.   \nTikTok responds, arguing that the matter is properly in federal court.  ECF No. 25.  TikTok \nemphasizes  the current relationship between Separate Defendant Tik Tok, Separate Defendant \nByteDance, China, and the United States and argues that because the State’s claims touch upon matters of national importance  (namely,  national security and foreign relations), remand is  not \nappropriate .  See  ECF No. 25, at 8 (arguing that the instant action is “an extraordinary attempt by \nthe State to regulate sensitive issues of national security and foreign affairs”).  TikTok provides the Court with a detailed history of the relationship between TikTok and the United States, citing  \nrecent litigation  and executive orders, as well as  negotiations that either occurred in the recent past \nor that are ongoing.  TikTok  identifies the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States \n(CFIUS ), which has, while ac ting on behalf of the executive branch, been investigating TikTok’s \nuse of American data and TikTok’s relationship with China .  See 50 U.S.C. § 4565 (establishing \nCFIUS).  For example, TikTok explains that in 2017, Defendant ByteDance acquired Musical.ly, Case 1:23-cv-01038-SOH     Document 32      Filed 07/25/23     Page 3 of 16 PageID #:\n<pageID>4 \n which TikTok describes as “a China -headquartered company that distributed a video- sharing \napplication also called Musical.ly.”  ECF No. 25, at 10.  Since then, “the federal government has \nbeen conducting a years -long investigation of the purported risk of Chinese access to U.S. TikTok \nuser dat a through the [CFIUS].”   See ECF No. 25, at 10.  According to TikTok, it has “proposed a \nnumber of strategies  [to the United States government]  to mitigate any purported national security \nrisks,” and negotiations be tween TikTok and the United States government regarding possible \nmitigation strategies are ongoing.  ECF No. 25, at 10- 11. 0F1   \nThe State has replied .  See  ECF No. 31.  T he State argues that federal jurisdiction, when \nnot based on diversity jur isdiction, re quires a question of federal law, which TikTok has not \nidentified.   The question that is  identified by TikTok—“whether TikTok has deceived consumers \nabout the risk that the Chinese  Government will access their personal information” —is one of fact, \nnot law.  See ECF No. 31, at 5.  The State also disagrees with TikTok’s contention that this action \nconstitutes a collateral attack on ongoing federal court proceedings .  ECF No. 31, at 10 (“This suit \nis also not a ‘collateral attack on the federal court proceedings resulting from President Trump’s \n[International Emergency Economic Powers Act] order,’ which was previously enjoined.”  ECF No. 31, at 10 (citation omit ted)).   Specifically, the State maintains  that the proceedings in the \nUnited States District Court for the District of Columbia , which TikTok reference s in its response, \nhave since been dismissed.  ECF No. 31, at 10 ( noting that the executive branch has wi thdrawn \n \n1According to TikTok, former President Donald Trump ordered Defendant ByteDance to divest itself of Defendant \nTikTok, and that order is currently “subject to a pending petition for review in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the \nDistrict of Columbia Circuit, wh ich has original and exclusive jurisdiction to hear challenges to CFIUS proceedings \nand orders.”  ECF No. 25, at 11.  TikTok further represents that  former President Trump signed an executive order \ndated August 6, 2020 which prohibited transactions between any person in the United States’s jurisdiction and \nDefendant ByteDance or its subsidiaries.  Later that year, the United States Secretary of Commerce issued a document \nimplementing the August 6 executive order and prohibiting transactions between persons in the United States and \nDefendant ByteDance or its subsidiaries.  TikTok explains that the United States District Court for the District of \nColumbia has since “entered two preliminary injunctions preventing those prohibitions from going into effect.”  ECF  \nNo. 25, at 12.   \n Case 1:23-cv-01038-SOH     Document 32      Filed 07/25/23     Page 4 of 16 PageID #:\n<pageID>5 \n President Trump’s order and the corresponding federal court suits have been dismissed by \nstipulation).  The State states that it is not  asking the Court “to manage relations between China \nand the United States or to ‘second- guess the federal govern ment’s assessment of the nature and \ndegree of any national security threat from China via -a-vis TikTok.’ ”  ECF No. 31, at 5.  Instead, \nit is asking for relief which would require  TikTok to “provid[e] truthful information to Arkansas \nconsumers.”  ECF No. 31, at 10. 1F2  Both parties request a hearing  on the matter of remand.  ECF \nNos. 26, 28. \nII. MOTION TO REMAND  \nThe parties have provided the Court with extensive briefing on the matter, and their \narguments are supported by extensive caselaw.  Despite this, the question before the Court is a \nnovel and difficult one.  Upon careful consideration and for the following reasons, the Court finds \nthat remand is appropriate.   \nFederal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction.  See Dakota, Minn. & E. R.R. Corp. v. \nSchieffer , 715 F.3d 712, 712 (8th Cir. 2013).  “Subject -matter jurisdiction is a threshold \nrequirement which mus t be assured in every federal case.”  Kronholm v. Fed.  Deposit Ins. Corp., \n915 F.2d 1171, 1174 (8th Cir. 1990) .  “[A] defendant may remove a case filed in state court to \nfederal court .”  In re Cotter Corp., 22 F.4th 788, 791- 92 (8th Cir. 2022).  The burden of \nestablishing federal subject matter jurisdiction rests on the removing party.  Bowler v. Alliedbarton \nSec. Servs. , LLC, 123 F. Supp. 3d 1152, 1155 (E.D. Mo. Aug. 12, 2015).  Here, TikTok cited 28 \nU.S.C. § 1331 in its notice of removal, which provides t hat “district courts shall have original \njurisdiction of all civil actions arising under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States.”   \n \n2The State contends that the United States government “could continue investigating the risks of the Chinese \nGovernment’s access to TikTok’s U.S. -user data and negotiating with TikTok for protections of U.S. -user data, both \nwhile this ac tion proceeds and after TikTok is enjoined from deceiving Arkansas consumers.”  ECF No. 31, at 10 n.1.   Case 1:23-cv-01038-SOH     Document 32      Filed 07/25/23     Page 5 of 16 PageID #:\n<pageID>6 \n Following removal, a plaintiff may then “file ‘a motion to remand the case on the basis of \nany defect.’”  In re Cotter Corp., 22 F.4th 788, 791- 92 (quoting 28 U.S.C. § 1447(c)).  “ Removal \nstatutes are strictly construed in favor of state court jurisdiction ,” meaning that the Court “must \nresolve all doubts concerning removal in favor of remand.”  Stone v. Baxter Int’t, Inc. , No. \n4:08- cv-3201, 2009 WL 236116, at *5 (D. Neb. Jan. 30, 2009).   \nA. Well -Pleaded Complaint Rule  \nPursuant to the well -pleaded complaint rule, “federal jurisdiction exists only when a federal \nquestion is presented on the face of the pla intiff’s properly pleaded complaint.”  Caterpillar Inc. \nv. Williams , 482 U.S. 386, 392 (1987).  “[A] case will not be removable if the complaint does not \naffirmatively allege a federal claim.”  James Valley Coop. Tel. Co. v. S.D. Network, LLC , 292 F. \nSupp. 3d 938, 944 (D.S.D. Nov. 13, 2017) (quoting Beneficial Nat’l Bank v. Anderson, 539 U.S. \n1, 6 (2003)).  Instead, “‘only those cases in which a well -pleaded complaint establishes either that \nfederal law creates the cause of action or that the plaintiff’s ri ght to relief necessarily depends on \nresolution of a substantial question of federal law,’ in that ‘federal law is a necessary element of \none of the well -pleaded . . . claims’” will a case be removable.  EFCO Corp. v. Iowa Ass’n of Bus.  \n& Indus., 447 F. Supp. 2d 985, 992- 93 (S.D. Iowa Aug. 23, 2006) (alteration in original) (citation \nomitted) ; see Empire Healthchoice Assurance, Inc. v. McVeigh, 547 U.S. 677, 690 (2006) \n(considering the language of § 1331 and explaining that the phrase “arising under” means that the \n“well -pleaded complaint establishes either that federal law creates the cause of action or that the \nplaintiff’s right to relief necessarily d epends on resolution of a substantial question of federal law ’” \n(citations omitted) ).   \n“[T]he plaintiff is master of his claim and may avoid federal removal jurisdiction by \nexclusive reliance on state law.”  Moore v. Kansas City Pub. Schs., 828 F.3d 687, 692 (8th Cir. Case 1:23-cv-01038-SOH     Document 32      Filed 07/25/23     Page 6 of 16 PageID #:\n<pageID>7 \n 2016) (alteration in original) (citation omitted); cf. Minn. by Ellison v. Am. Petroleum Inst., 63 \nF.4th 703, 709 (8th Cir. 2023) (“But ‘a plaintiff may not defeat removal by omitting to plead \nnecessary federal questions.’” (citation omit ted)); Chaganti & Assocs., P.C. v. Nowotny , 470 F.3d \n1215, 1220 (8th Cir. 2006) (“[C]ourts will not permit plaintiff to use artful pleading to close off defendant’s right to a federal forum . . . .” (alteration in original) (citation omitted)).  The Eighth  \nCircuit, relying on Supreme Court precedent, has explained that:  \nBecause this well -pleaded complaint rule “makes the plaintiff the master of the \nclaim[, the plaintiff] may avoid federal jurisdiction by exclusive reliance on state \nlaw.” Defendants are “not  permitted to inject a federal question into an otherwise \nstate-law claim and thereby transform the action into one arising under federal law.”  \nIt is firmly established that a federal defense, including a preemption defense, does not provide a basis for r emoval, “even if the defense is anticipated in the plaintiff’s \ncomplaint, and even if both parties concede that the federal defense is the only question truly at issue in the case.”  \n \nCent.  Iowa Power Co- op v. Midwest Indep. Transmission Sys.  Operator, Inc., 561 F.3d 904, 912 \n(8th Cir. 2009) (alteration in original) (citations omitted).   \nThe Court begins with the plain text of the State’s complaint, the obvious starting point \nunder the well -pleaded complaint rule.   See Caterpillar Inc. , 482 U.S. at 392.  The State’s \ncomplaint is sixty -two (62) pages in length, with only seven (7) of those pages setting  forth the \nState’s claims against TikTok.  The other fifty -five (55) pages ar e ostensibly what inspired TikTok \nto remove this action to federal court, as the State dedicates much of its complaint to highlighting \nthe alleged national importance of this action.  For example, the State asserts that “[t]here is a very real and serious bipartisan concern across the U.S. government and in many states that the Chinese Government and/or Communist Party may access TikTok’s U.S. content and user data.”  ECF No. 3, at 25.  Although TikTok seizes upon language like this in support of its argume nt that the matter \nis properly in federal court , the State’s posturing does not necessarily mean that this Court has Case 1:23-cv-01038-SOH     Document 32      Filed 07/25/23     Page 7 of 16 PageID #:\n<pageID>8 \n subject matter jurisdiction. 2F3 \nSetting aside the State’s primarily political arguments  regarding the national  “bipartisan \nconcern,” the Court finds that the complaint does not contain any claim  “arising under the \nConstitution, laws, or treaties of the United States.”  See 28 U.S.C. § 1331.  Each of the State’s \nclaims are carefully pled pursuant to Arkansas law, and the State specifically disclaims any \ncontention that its claims are brought pursuant to federal law.  See  ECF No. 3.  Pleading its claims \nin this manner is within the State’s prerogative, as the State  is the master of its own complaint.  \nMoore , 828 F.3d at 692 (citation omitted).  Therefore, because the face of the State’s complaint \ndoes not expressly bring any cause of action under federal law, the Court must turn to TikTok’s \narguments that federal jurisdiction is nevertheless appropriate. 3F4 \nB. Grable  Doctrine  \n The heart of the parties’ disagreement is whether the Grable  doctrine applies.  The Supreme \nCourt has recognized an exception to the well -pleaded complaint rule in which federal -question \njurisdiction may exist despite the fact that the face of the plaintiff ’s complaint contains only \nstate-law claims, as the state law claims “nonetheless turn on substantial questions of federal law.”  \nMinn. By Ellison, 63 F.4th at 711 (quoting Grable and Sons Metal Prods., Inc. v. Darue Eng’g & \nMfg., 545 U.S. 308, 312 (2005)).  This exception, commonly referred to as the Grable  doctrine, \nallows a federal court to “treat the claims as arising under federal law even though state law creates the cause of action.”  Id.   However, this exception is only applicable in limited circumstances.  See, \n \n3Much like here, in  Indiana v. TikTok, Inc. , the district court distinguished between political posturing and th e \nsubstantive claims asserted .  See 2023 WL 3596360, at *1.  The district court found that remand to state court was \nappropriate, stating  in part that “[h]a d [the state -plaintiff] filed [a] short and plain statement of its claim, this case \nwould have stayed in [state court] where it was filed.  But since more than 90% of the complaint was devoted to \nirrelevant posturing, [TikTok] removed the cas e . . . .”  Id.   \n \n4To the extent that TikTok argues that the face of the State’s complaint contains claims arising under  federal law , that \nargument  is weak at best and absent at worst.  The parties seem to agree that the complaint, on its face, contains only \nstate-law claims.   Case 1:23-cv-01038-SOH     Document 32      Filed 07/25/23     Page 8 of 16 PageID #:\n<pageID>9 \n e.g., Empire Healthchoice Assurance , Inc., 547 U.S. at 699 (referring to a “special and small \ncategory” of cases); Cooper Clinic, P.A. v. Mercy Clinic Fort Smith Cmtys., No. 2:14- cv-02233, \n2015 WL 437571, at *1 (W.D. Ark. Feb. 3, 2015) (ref erring to a “‘slim category’ of federal \njurisdiction” with “unruly” case law (citation omitted)).   \nGrable  set forth a four- element test, which asks whether “a federal issue is: (1) necessarily \nraised, (2) actually disputed, (3) substantial, and (4) capabl e of resolution in federal court without \ndisrupting the federal -state balance approved by Congress.’”  Minn. by Ellison , 63 F.4th at 711 \n(quoting Gunn v. Minton, 568 U.S. 251, 258 (2013)).  The Eighth Circuit recently explained that \na claim is “necessarily  raised” (and the first Grable  element is satisfied) “when it ‘is a necessary \nelement of one of the well -pleaded state claims’ in the plaintiffs’ complaint.”  Id.   If all four \nelements are satisfied, then “the case is removable although no federal question appears on the \nface of the complaint.”  Id. at 709.  The Grable  analysis requires precision, and “[a] removing \ndefendant ‘should be able to point to the specific  elements of [the plaintiff’s] state law claims’ that \nrequire proof under federal law.”  Id.  at 711 (alteration in original) (citation omitted).  \nAccording to the Eighth Circuit, “[t]he best example” of when Grable  is applicable “is \nGrable  itself.”  Id.   In Grable , the plaintiff filed a quiet title claim in state court following the IRS’s \nseizure and sale of the plaintiff’s property.  In his complaint, the plaintiff “pled a purely state -law \nclaim,” but the determinative question before the district court wa s “whether the IRS had valid \ntitle over the property,” a question which “depended entirely on whether the IRS followed . . . federal notice requirements.”  Id.  at 711; see also Grable , 545 U.S. at 315- 16.  In finding that \nfederal subject matter jurisdictio n existed, the Supreme Court noted that Grable’s outcome would \nhave far -reaching consequences, settling a legal question “once and for all” and “thereafter . . . \ngovern[ing] numerous tax sale cases.”  Empire Healthchoice Assurance, I nc., 547 U.S. at 700 Case 1:23-cv-01038-SOH     Document 32      Filed 07/25/23     Page 9 of 16 PageID #:\n<pageID>10 \n (citation omitted).  Grable  does not encompass actions in which the United States simply has an \ninterest in that action.  See id. at 701 (recognizing that although “[t]he United States no doubt \n‘ha[d] an overwhelming interest’” in the subject matter being li tigated, “it takes more than a federal \nelement ‘to open the “arising under” door’” (citation omitted)).  In sum , the Court must determine \nwhether the State’s claims, which are brought pursuant to state law, “nonetheless turn on \nsubstantial questions  of fed eral law.”  Minn. by Ellison, 63 F.4th at 711 (quoting Grable , 545 U.S. \nat 312).    Because the State brings its claims pursuant to the Arkansas Deceptive Trade Practices \nAct, the Court looks to that statute to ascertain what the State is required to prove.  “The Arkansas \nDeceptive Trade Practices Act . . . focuses on consumer protection in connection with trade practices.  The Act makes ‘[e]ngaging in any . . . unconscionable , false, or deceptive act or practice \nin business, commerce, or trade . . .’ unlawful.”  Independence Cnty. v . Pfizer, Inc., 534 F. Supp. \n2d 882, 886 (E.D. Ark. Feb. 11, 2008) ( second, third, and fourth alterations in original) (citation \nomitted).  The Act ’s purpose is to “protect[] consumers from unfair ways of doing business.”  Id.  \nat 887.  “Enforcement rests largely with the Attorney General, Ark. Code Ann. § 4- 88-113(a) -(e).”  \nLeato v. W.  Union Holdings, Inc., No. 5:19- cv-05029, 2019 WL 1051190, at *3 ( W.D. Ark. Mar. \n5, 2019).  To succeed on its claims, the State must demonstrate the following: “(1) a deceptive \nconsumer -oriented act or practice which is misleading in a material respect; and (2) injury resulting \nfrom such act.”  Forever Green Athletic Fields, Inc. v. Lasiter Constr., Inc., 384 S.W.3d 540, 552  \n(Ark. Ct. App. May 11, 2011).   \nTikTok alleges that Grable  applies here because the State will, as an essential element of \nits claims, need to prove “the falsity of [TikTok’s] alleged statements about the Chinese Government’s ability to access and exploit TikTok user data.”  ECF No. 25, at 13.  However, Case 1:23-cv-01038-SOH     Document 32      Filed 07/25/23     Page 10 of 16 PageID #:\n<pageID>11 \n TikTok does not direct  the Court to a  specific element of the State’s claims that “turn [s] on \nsubstantial questions of federal law.”  Minn. by Ellison, 63 F.4th at 711 (quoting Grable , 545 U.S. \nat 312).  Stated differently, although TikTok asserts variations of the  argument that “federal \njurisdiction is necessary to ensure that a state cannot use its laws and courts to supplant or \nsupplement this country’s national security and foreign policy determinations,” ECF No. 25, at 20, TikTok never identifies which  federal law is at play here.  Simply alleging that “this country’s \nnational security and foreign policy determinations” are at -issue is not suffi cient to warrant the \napplication of Grable .  The Court makes this determination with the understanding that Grable  \napplies in rare circumstances, Empire Healthchoice Assurance , Inc. , 547 U.S. at 699, and that the \nCourt “must resolve all doubts concerning removal in favor of remand,” Stone , 2009 WL 236116, \nat *5.   \nBefore concluding, the Court looks to guidance from other f ederal courts.  In support of its \nmotion to remand, t he State relies extensively on Indiana v. TikTok Inc.   See 2023 WL 3596360.  \nAlthough Indiana v. Tik Tok, Inc. is not binding on this Court, it is factually similar, and the Court \nfinds that it is persuasive here.  In that case, t he State of Indiana brought state-law consumer \nprotection claims against TikTok and sought  an injunction like  that which the State seeks here.  \nAfter TikTok removed the action to federal court, the State of Indiana filed a moti on seeking \nremand.  In support of its argument that the action was properly in federal court, TikTok “claim[ed] that a federal issue [was] necessarily stated and disputed” due to the issue of “the Chinese \nGovernment’s access to TikTok user data and ability to exploit that user data .”  Id. at *2.\n4F5  TikTok \nfurther argued that any state -court proceeding would disrupt CFIUS’s ongoing investigation and \n \n5More speci fically, TikTok argued that “the Court would need to determine whether the Chinese Government will \n‘access and exploit’ user information to ‘help develop artificial intelligence technologies and assist Chinas in \nespionage efforts.”  Id.  at *4.  Case 1:23-cv-01038-SOH     Document 32      Filed 07/25/23     Page 11 of 16 PageID #:\n<pageID>12 \n negotiations.   \nThe district court found that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction and granted remand.  The \ndistrict court disagreed “that potential es pionage has anything to do with [the State of] Indiana’s \nclaim ” because  “the State of Indiana needed only “prove that [TikTok] committed ‘an unfair, \nabusive, or deceptive act, omission, or practice in connection with a consumer transaction’ as that \nis defined i n Indiana Code.”  Id. at *4; Ind. Code § 24- 5-0.5-3(a).  It further found that the State of \nIndiana’s claims did not constitute a collateral attack on CFIUS’s actions.  The district court “fail[ed] to see how anything determined [in the matter] could affec t the outcome of the CFIUS \nproceedings” because those proceedings are “forward- looking,” meaning that “they will address \nhow [TikTok] can mitigate national security issues going forward, while t he State of Indiana’s \nclaims sought “to address alleged misrep resentations that have already occurred.”  Indiana v. \nTikTok, Inc., 2023 WL 3596360, at *4.  Finally, the district court stated that “‘[a] judicial determination that [TikTok Inc.] failed to make a complete disclosure of their data handling \npractices, or t hat they did fully disclose those practices . . . ‘will be neither here nor there to \nCFIUS’s  evaluation of the privacy risks posed by the TikTok app.’ ”  ECF No. 31, at 7 (alteration \nin original) (quoting Indiana v. TikTok, Inc. , 2023 WL 3596360, at *4).   \nNumerous other federal courts have found that Grable  does not apply where the party \nadvocating for federal court jurisdiction simply identified a generalized federal interest.  For \nexample, in Stout v. Novartis Pharm aceutical Corp., the district cou rt found that Grable  was \ninapplicable because the defendants  merely  recognized  “some generalized dispute” touching upon \nfederal law rather than “ identify[ing] any actual dispute respecting the interpretation of federal \nlaw.”  See Nos. 08- 856, 07- 2774, 09- 0095, 09- 916, 07- 1657, 07- 655, 2009 WL 4576130, at *4 \n(D.N.J. Nov. 30, 2009) .  In Pennsylvania v. Eli Lilly & Co. , the district court found that Grable  Case 1:23-cv-01038-SOH     Document 32      Filed 07/25/23     Page 12 of 16 PageID #:\n<pageID>13 \n was inapplicable where “liability under the state law claims pres ented . . . [did] not depend on the \nviolation of any federal standard or statute,” despite the fact the state statute incorporated a  \nfederally created definition.  See 511 F. Supp. 2d 576, 581 (E.D. Penn. June 27, 2007).  It is helpful \nto contrast these de cisions with instances in which Grable  did apply, like in Wullschleger v. Royal \nCanine U.S.A., Inc.   See  953 F.3d 519, 522 (8th Cir. 2020)  (finding Grable  applicable where \n“plaintiffs explicitly claim[ed]  that defendants violated the [ Food Drug and Cosmetic Act ], were \nnon-compliant with [United State s Food and Drug A dministration  (FDA)] guidance, and that [the \ndefendants’]  refusal to submit the prescription pet food to FDA  review was improper ”). \nHere, TikTok cites several  generalized  interests that the federal government allegedly has \nin TikTok’s relat ionship with the United States and its citizens.  H owever,  this is insufficient to \nwarrant the application of Grable .  See, e.g., Stout , 2009 WL 4576130, at *4.  TikTok ’s liability \nunder the Arkansas D eceptive Trade and Practices Act does not depend  on any federal standard or \nstatute.   Stated differently, no federal issue is necessarily raised by the State’s claims, and the first \nelem ent of Grable  is not satisfied.  See  Minn . by Ellison , 63 F.4th at 711.  For these reasons, the \nCourt finds that Grable  is inapplicable here.  \nC. Federal Common Law  \n TikTok alternatively argues that this Court has jurisdiction because the State’s claims arise \nunder federal common law.   That is, because the federal government has an interest in uniformity \non matters of foreign affairs and national security and because the federal government has \nexclusive control over national security, the State’s claims are of t he sort appropriate for a federal \ncourt’s consideration.  See  ECF No. 25, at 25 -29.   \nIn addition to cases arising under federal positive law, federal courts also have jurisdiction \nover ‘claims founded upon federal common law.’”  Minn. by Ellison, 63 F.4th at 709 (citation Case 1:23-cv-01038-SOH     Document 32      Filed 07/25/23     Page 13 of 16 PageID #:\n<pageID>14 \n omitted).  “[A]bsent some congressional authorization to formulate s ubstantive rules of decision, \nfederal common law exists only in such narrow areas as those concerned with the rights and \nobligations of the United States, interstate and international disputes implicating the conflicting rights of States or our relations w ith foreign nations, and admiralty cases.”  Texas In dus., Inc. v. \nRadcliff Materials, Inc. , 451 U.S. 630, 641 (1981).   \nAlthough TikTok does not characterize it as such, TikTok’s  federal common law argument  \nis, essentially, a  complete preemption argument.  See Minn. by Ellison, 63 F.4th at 709- 10 \n(considering “federal common law” within the context of complete preemption).  That is, where \nCongress intends for federal law to “preempt a field of law so completely,” then any corresponding “state law claims are considered to be converted into federal causes of action.” Gaming Corp. of \nAm. v. Dorsey & Whitney , 88 F.3d 536, 543 (8th Cir. 1996).\n5F6  Where “[t]here is no substitute \nfederal cause of action for the state- law causes of action [that the state- plaintiff]  brings, . . . [the \nEighth Circuit] appl[ies] the strong presumption against  complete preemption.”  Minn. by Ellison, \n63 F.4th at 710 (emphasis added) .   \nHere, as discussed  above, TikTok does not  direct the Court to any federal law on which the \nState ’s claims turn .  See supra Secti on II.B.  It follows that TikTok also does not identify any are a \nof federal law that covers the subject matter of the State’s claims  “so completely ” that those  claims \nmust be “conver ted into federal causes of action. ”  See Gaming Corp. of Am. , 88 F.3d at 543.  This \nis fatal to TikTok ’s federal common law argument .  See Minn. by Ellison, 63 F.4th at 710 \n(“Because Congress has not acted, the presence of federal common law here does not express \nCongressional intent of any kind—much less intent to completely displace any particular state -law \n \n6The doctrine of preemption is extensive and complex, and the Court need not wade into its murky waters , especially \nwhere the party advocating for its application —here, TikTok—does not discuss the doctrine of preemption at all.  \nAccordingly , the Court simply note s that  the nature of TikTok’s argument is one of preemption.  Case 1:23-cv-01038-SOH     Document 32      Filed 07/25/23     Page 14 of 16 PageID #:\n<pageID>15 \n claim. ”).   \nThe Court again considers Indiana v. TikTok, Inc.   See 2023 WL 3596369.  Ther e, the \ndistrict court rejected TikTok ’s argument that federal common law gave ri se to fed eral juris diction, \nexplain ing that because “the Court [could find]  no fundamental federal issue”  at play, the State of \nIndiana’s consumer protection claims did not “implicate[] any of the ‘ narrow  areas ’ in which \nfederal common law exists .”  Id.  Similarly, here, TikTok provides nothing demo nstrating that the  \nState ’s claims fall within one “of the ‘ narrow areas ’ in which  federal common law exists. ”  Id.  \nAccordin gly, the Court declines to exercise subject matter jurisdiction based on TikTok’s federal \ncommon law argument.   \nIII. MOTION FOR ORAL ARGUMENT  \nFinally, th e Court chooses to resolve the State’s motion to remand on the parties’ briefing, \nand oral arguments at a motion’ s hearing is unnecessary.  See  Fed. R. Civ. P. 78(b) (“ By rule or \norder, the court may provide for submitting and determining motions on briefs, without oral \nhearings.”) ; see also Rouse v. Caruso, No. 06 -10961, 2007 WL 5528385, at *1 (E.D. Mich. Apr. \n17, 2007) (“ [T]here is no requirement that the Court . . . hold oral arguments on motions.”).  \nAccordingly, the Court finds that TikTok’s motion for oral argument (ECF No. 26) should be \ndenied.  \n \n     Case 1:23-cv-01038-SOH     Document 32      Filed 07/25/23     Page 15 of 16 PageID #:\n<pageID>16 \n IV. CONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court finds that the State’s motion to remand (ECF No. 23) \nshould be and hereby is GRANTED.  Having resolved the State’s remand motion on the parties’ \nbriefings, TikTok’s motion for leave to present oral argument (ECF  No. 26) is DENIED.  This \nmatter is immediately REMANDED to the Circuit Court of Union County, Arkansas.   \nIT IS SO ORDERED, this 25th  day of July, 2023. \n/s/ Susan O. Hickey                       \nSusan O.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: This court case involves TruGreen Limited Partnership suing Allegis Global Solutions (AGS) for breach of contract, and AGS counterclaiming against TruGreen. TruGreen alleged that AGS failed to fulfill its recruitment obligations under their Recruitment Process Outsourcing Agreement, specifically citing failure to recruit the promised number of employees and issues with AGS's AI chatbot \"Olivia.\" The court dismissed four of TruGreen’s five claims, but allowed the breach of contract claim to move forward.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether AGS breached its contractual obligations under the Recruitment Process Outsourcing Agreement with TruGreen, and if TruGreen is entitled to damages based on said breach.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court granted AGS's motion to dismiss Counts II through V of TruGreen’s amended complaint, which included claims for negligent misrepresentation and promissory estoppel, among others. However, it permitted TruGreen's breach of contract claim (Count I) to proceed. The court declined to issue a declaratory judgment or address damages at this stage beyond recognizing that some damages could be allowable under the agreement.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: TruGreen hired AGS to help recruit new workers but wasn't happy with the results, especially with AGS’s chatbot that was supposed to help arrange interviews. TruGreen sued AGS saying they hadn’t done their job right. The court said TruGreen can argue that AGS broke their agreement, but a lot of TruGreen's other complaints can't go forward in court. The part about AI? That's the chatbot TruGreen says didn’t live up to its promises, which was supposed to be part of AGS's service.",

(“AGS” \nor “Defendant”)  alleging breach of contract as well as other state law torts and  seeking  this \nCourt’s determination of its entitlement to certain remedies .  (See ECF Nos. 1, 32 *SEALED*.)   \nOn March 13, 2020, AGS asserted its own claim for breach of contract against TruGreen with \na filing o f a single -count Counterclaim.  ( See ECF No. 16.)  On February 18, 2021, this Court \nheld an audio motions hearing1 in which it heard argumen ts of counsel related to two pending \nmotions: Defendant AGS’s Motion to Strike Plaintiff’s Affirmative Defenses (ECF No. 25) \nand Defendant AGS’s Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff’s Amended Complaint (ECF No. 38).  \nHaving reviewed the submissions of the Parties a nd heard arguments of counsel, this Court \nGRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART Defendant AGS’s Motion to Strike (ECF \n \n1 This audio hearing was conducted pursuant to Standing Orders 2021 -01 and 2021-04 in light of the reduction in \noperations due to the COVID -19 pandemic.  Case 1:20-cv-00335-RDB   Document 74   Filed 02/23/21   Page 1 of 182 \n No. 25).  This Court also GRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART Defendant AGS’s \nMotion to Dismiss (ECF No. 38) , specifically DENYING the motion with respect to Count \nI and GRANTING that motion as to Counts II -V.  These rulings were confirmed in a Letter \nOrder (ECF No. 71)  immediately following that hearing on February 18, 2021 .  At the hearing, \nthis Court stated it would provide this supplemental Memorandum Opinion to elaborate on its rulings with respect to the Motion to Dismiss (ECF No. 38).  \nBACKGROUND  \n In ruling on a motion to dismiss, this Court “accept[s] as true all well -pleaded facts in \na complaint and construe[s] them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.”  Wikimedia Found. \nv. Nat’l Sec. Agency , 857 F.3d 193, 208 (4th Cir. 2017) (citing SD3,  LLC v. Black & Decker (U.S.) \nInc., 801 F.3d 412, 422 (4th Cir. 2015)).  Plaintiff TruGreen is a Delaware limited liability \npartnership in the business of law n care and pest control with its principal place of business \nin Memphis, Tennessee.  (ECF No. 32 ¶  1 *SEALED*.)  Due to the nature of its business, \nTruGreen purportedly must hire thousands of employees to prepare for the growing season.  \n(Id. ¶ 6 *SEALED*.)  These workers are predominantly high- volume, field -based employees \nranging from law n technician s, to branch sales employees, to call center employees.  ( Id.)  As \nTruGreen planned for the 2019 growing season, it decided t o employ  Recruitment Process \nOutsourcing (“RPO”), seeking to transfer most of its high -volume, field -based employee \nrecruiting to a n external provider, Defendant AGS.   (Id. ¶ 7 *SEALED*.)   \nAGS  is a Maryland corporation with its principal place of business in Hanover, \nMaryland and a  purported leader in “global talent solutions.”  ( Id. ¶ 2 *SEALED*.)  TruGreen \nclaims that AGS was selected from a field of five different  RPO  firms to which it sent requests Case 1:20-cv-00335-RDB   Document 74   Filed 02/23/21   Page 2 of 183 \n for proposal.  ( Id. ¶ 11 *SEALED*.)  TruGreen alleges that it picked AGS on the basis of \ncertain express and/or implied promises made by AGS throughout the selection process, \nincluding that (i) AGS could meet all of TruGreen’s recruitment and other needs at a \nsignificantly lower cost than any of the other participants in the request for proposal process; (ii) AGS would conduct enough and sufficient advertising to meet TruGreen’s stated recruitment needs and goals; (iii) AGS would assign the necessary personnel to accomplish TruGreen’s objectives; and (iv) AGS made representations consistent with the statements on \nits website to induce TruGreen to contract with it .  (Id.  ¶ 13 *SEALED*.)  AGS further \nrepresented that because it was larger and employed multiple centers, it could accomplish the \nobjectives of the contract with less cost within the time constraints TruGreen specified.  ( Id. \n*SEALED*.)  Finally, AGS also made representations rega rding its available technology, \nincluding an artificial intelligence system known as “Olivia.”  ( Id. *SEALED*.)   \nUpon selecting AGS as its RPO, TruGreen and AGS entered into a contract pursuant \nto which AGS undertook to provide talent procurement services  for TruGreen.  ( Id. ¶ 2 \n*SEALED* .)  The contract between the Parties is the Recruitment Processing Outsourcing \nAgreement, dated November 1, 2018 (“RPOA” or the “Agreement”, filed as ECF No. 1 4-1 \n*SEALED*).  (ECF No. 32 ¶ 5 *SEALED*.)  TruGreen asserts tha t throughout the course \nof the RPOA, AGS continued to provide TruGreen with express assurances and promises that AGS could and would meet TruGreen’s recruitment and other needs.  ( Id. ¶ 15 \n*SEALED*.)  For example, in response to early complaints regarding AGS’s performance due to lack of applicants/interviews and insufficient advertising, AGS purportedly promised it would take steps to correct the problems and continued to maintain it could successfully Case 1:20-cv-00335-RDB   Document 74   Filed 02/23/21   Page 3 of 184 \n provide its agreed- upon services.  ( Id. *SEALED*.)  In  particular, TruGreen claims that AGS \npromised it would add more recruiters, increase advertising, and adjust strategy in \nunderperforming markets to meet candidate demand.  ( Id. *SEALED*.)  The Amended \nComplaint provides summaries of emails from individuals at each company in support of these allegations.  ( Id. *SEALED*.)   \nOverall, TruGreen asserts that AGS “failed miserably” to perform under the terms of \nthe RPOA.  ( Id. ¶ 18 *SEALED*.)  TruGreen further asserts that AGS promised to recruit \nand place between 15,000 and 19,000 employees but failed to recruit and place even half of that number.  ( Id. *SEALED*.)  TruGreen complains that for long periods of time, some of \nits branches received no applicants for employment.  ( Id. *SEALED*.)  It addition ally asserts \nthat the “chatbot” Olivia was ineffective, failed to work as promised, and failed to schedule \ninterviews in sufficient numbers.  ( Id. *SEALED*.)  Further, while AGS agreed to perform \nthe contract for $6.2 million, AGS asked for and TruGreen ag reed to increase the amount of \nthe contract price to just over $7 million.  ( Id. *SEALED*.)  TruGreen claims that AGS knew \nor should have known that it was not performing as the RPOA required, yet  it failed to take \nactions to improve its performance or oth erwise meet its obligations under the contract.  ( Id. \n¶ 20. *SEALED*.)   \nTruGreen asserts  that as a result of AGS’s material breach of the RPOA, it  has suffered \nincidental and compensatory damages arising from AGS’s contractual failures, including failed recruiting, interference with TruGreen’s business processes and profitability, AGS’s \nacceptance of payment of almost $5 million for services that were not provided as promised, and that TruGreen’s profits also suffered.  ( Id. ¶ 21 *SEALED*.)  TruGreen also claims that Case 1:20-cv-00335-RDB   Document 74   Filed 02/23/21   Page 4 of 185 \n due to the nature of TruGreen’s business, AGS’s breaches of the RPOA could not be fully \nrectified or the lost sales recaptured, and  that when it became clear that AGS was not going \nto be able to fully perform, TruGreen exercised its duty to mit igate damages by performing \nAGS’s own contractual duties.  ( Id. ¶ 22 *SEALED*.)  TruGreen alleges that the cost of that \neffort was approximately $2.5 million.  ( Id. *SEALED*.)  \nTruGreen filed suit against AGS on February 7, 2020.  (ECF No. 1.)  It  amended that \nComplaint on July 2, 2020.  (ECF No. 32 *SEALED*.)  The Amended Complaint asserts five \nseparate claims against Defendant AGS.  Count I of TruGreen’s Amended Complaint alleg es \nbreach of contract, pointing to specific provisions of the RPOA which AGS allegedly \nbreached.  ( Id. ¶¶ 25 -35 *SEALED*.)   \nCount II of the Amended Complaint alleges negligent misrepresentation.  ( Id. ¶¶ 36 -\n45.)  Specifically, TruGreen alleges that by virtue of the business and contractual relationship between TruGreen and AGS, AGS had a duty of care to TruGreen requiring AGS to transmit \naccurate information to TruGreen.  ( Id. ¶ 38.)  AGS made represen tations that it  had expertise \nin recruiting and placing employees, could perform at a certain cost, would be able to recruit \nand place between 15,000 and 19,000 employees, and would generally deliver results better \nthan anyone else.  ( Id. ¶ 39.)  Such representations were allegedly either intentional or negligent \nmisrepresentations of AGS’s ability to perform in TruGreen’s industry.  ( Id.) \n In Count III, TruGreen alleges promissory estoppel/detrimental reliance, claiming  that \nAGS made multiple clear and def inite promises to TruGreen, including post -contractual \npromises to take active steps to improve its recruitment and placement of employees.  ( Id. ¶¶ \n47-48.)  TruGreen further alleges that AGS reasonably expected its promises would induce Case 1:20-cv-00335-RDB   Document 74   Filed 02/23/21   Page 5 of 186 \n action or forbeara nce on TruGreen’s part, and that such promises did in fact induce such \nreliance.  ( Id. ¶¶ 49 -50.)   \n Count IV alleges that AGS has improperly continued to demand payments under the \nRPOA that are either unearned or unrecoverable based on the terms of the RP OA, or subject \nto recoupment/setoff from amounts claimed by TruGreen.  ( Id. ¶ 55.)  TruGreen seeks a \ndeclaratory judgment that states that TruGreen owes no further funds to AGS pursuant to the \nRPOA.  ( Id. ¶ 56.)  In Count V, TruGreen also asks this Court to hold that TruGreen is entitled \nto recoupment and/or setoff from AGS any amounts it would otherwise owe under the RPOA in lieu of the damages caused to it by AGS’s breach of the RPOA and other misconduct. ( Id. \n¶ 61.)  \nOn March 13, 2020, Defendant AGS filed  a single -count Counterclaim against \nTruGreen.  (ECF. No. 16.)  AGS alleges that TruGreen materially breached its duty to cooperate in the implementation and performance of the RPOA in several ways.  On April 6, \n2020, TruGreen filed an Answer to the Counterclaim in which the Plaintiff assert ed twenty-\nsix affirmative defenses labeled A through Z.  (ECF No. 20.)   \nOn April 27, 2020, Defendant AGS filed a Motion to Strike Plaintiff’s Affirmative \nDefenses (ECF No. 25), challenging 22 of the 26 asserted defenses .  On August 20, 2020, the \nDefendant also filed a Motion to Dismiss the Plaintiff’s Amended Complaint (ECF No. 38), seeking dismissal of all five counts asserted by TruGreen  and an order foreclosing TruGreen \nfrom recovery of any damages for any of its clai ms.  On February 1 8, 2021, this Court held an \naudio motions hearing in which this Court heard arguments of counsel related to both  pending \nmotions.  As confirmed by Letter Order (ECF No. 71), this Court ruled on the record granting Case 1:20-cv-00335-RDB   Document 74   Filed 02/23/21   Page 6 of 187 \n in part and denying in part both motions.   Specifically, this Court GRANTED the Defendant’s \nMotion to Dismiss with respect to Counts II through V of the Amended Complaint and \nDENIED that motion with respect to Count I of the Amended Complaint  as well as with \nrespect to the Defendant’s request that this Court should enter an order barring TruGreen from recovering any damages.   \nSTANDARD OF REVIEW  \nRule 8(a)(2) of the Federal Ru les of Civil Procedure provides that a complaint must \ncontain a “short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.” Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure authorizes the dismissal of a complaint if it fai ls to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.  The purpose of Rule 12(b)(6) is \n“to test the sufficiency of a complaint and not to resolve contests surrounding the facts, the \nmerits of a claim, or the applicability of defenses.”  Presley v. City of Charlottesville , 464 F.3d 480, \n483 (4th Cir. 2006).   \nThe United States Supreme Court’s opinions in Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly , 550 U.S. \n544 (2007), and Ashcroft v. Iqbal , 556 U.S. 662 (2009), “require that complaints in civil actions \nbe alleged with g reater specificity than previously was required.”  Walters v. McMahen , 684 F.3d \n435, 439 (4th Cir. 2012) (citation omitted).  In Twombly , the Supreme Court articulated “[t]wo \nworking principles” that courts must employ when ruling on Rule 12(b)(6) motions to dismiss. \nIqbal, 556 U.S. at 678.  First, while a court must accept as true all factual allegations contained \nin the complaint, legal conclusions drawn from those facts are not afforded such deference.  Id. (stating that “[t]hreadbare recitals of the ele ments of a cause of action, supported by mere \nconclusory statements, do not suffice.”); see also Wag More Dogs, LLC v. Cozart , 680 F.3d 359, Case 1:20-cv-00335-RDB   Document 74   Filed 02/23/21   Page 7 of 188 \n 365 (4th Cir. 2012) (“Although we are constrained to take the facts in the light most favorable \nto the plaintiff, w e need not accept legal conclusions couched as facts or unwarranted \ninferences, unreasonable conclusions, or arguments.” (internal quotation marks omitted)).  \nSecond, a complaint must be dismissed if it does not allege “a plausible claim for relief.”  Iqbal , \n556 U.S. at 679.  \nWhile ruling on a motion to dismiss, a court’s evaluation is generally limited to \nallegations contained in the complaint.  Goines v. Calley Cmty. Servs. Bd. , 822 F.3d 159, 166 -67 \n(4th Cir. 2016).  However, courts may also consider documents explicitly incorporated into \nthe complaint by reference.  Id.  at 166 (citing Tellabs, Inc. v. Makor Issues & Rights, Ltd. , 551 U.S. \n308, 322 (2007)).  In addition, a court may “consider a document submitted by the movant \nthat was not attached to or expressly incorporated in a complaint, so long as the document \nwas integral to the complaint and there is no dispute about the document’s authenticity.”  Id. \n(citing Sec'y of Sta te for Defence v. Trimble Nav. Ltd. , 484 F.3d 700, 705 (4th Cir. 2007)).  A \ndocument is “integral” when “its ‘very existence, and not the mere information it contains, \ngives rise to the legal rights asserted.’”  Chesapeake Bay Found., Inc. v. Severstal Sparrows Point, \nLLC , 794 F.Supp.2d 602, 611 (D. Md. 2011) (citation omitted) (emphasis omitted).  \nConsidering such documents does not convert a motion to dismiss to one for summary \njudgment.  Goldfarb v. Mayor & City Council of Baltimore , 791 F.3d 500, 508 (4 th Cir. 2015).  \nANALYSIS  \nDefendant AGS move d to dismiss all five counts of Plaintiff TruGreen’s Amended \nComplaint, arguing that each count fai led to state a plausible claim for relief.  ( See ECF No. \n38-1.)  As the basis of this Court’s jurisdiction lies in diversity of citizenship, under 28 U.S.C. Case 1:20-cv-00335-RDB   Document 74   Filed 02/23/21   Page 8 of 189 \n § 1332(a), Maryland law applies.  Hartford Fire Ins. Co. v. Harleysville Mut. Ins. Co. , 736 F.3d 255, \n261 n. 3 (4th Cir. 2013) (citing Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins , 304 U.S. 64 (1938)).   At the hearing of \nFebruary 18, 2021, this Court denied the Defendant’s Motion with respect to Count I, for the \nreasons set forth on the record, holding  that the Amended Complaint stated a plausible claim \nfor relief for breach of contract under Maryland law.  The remainder of th is Court’s rulings in \nGRANTING the Motion to Dismiss (ECF No. 38) as to Counts II through V were also set \nforth on the record but are supplemented as follows.  \nA. Negligent Misrepresentation (Count II)  \nTo state a claim for negligent misrepresentation under Maryland law, a plaintiff must \nallege: (1) “ defendant, owing a duty of care to the plaintiff, negligently assert [ed] a false \nstatement;” (2) “the defendant intend [ed] that his statement [would]  be acted upon by the \nplaintiff;” (3) “ the defendant ha [d] the knowledge that the plaintiff [would]  probably rely on \nthe statement, which, if erroneous, [would]  cause loss or injury;” (4) “ the plaintiff, justifiably, \n[took]  action in reliance on the statem ent;” and, (5) “ the plaintiff suffer [ed] damage \nproximately caused by the defendant’s negligence. ”  Cooper v. Berkshire Life, Ins. Co. , 810 A.2d \n1045, 1053 -54 (Md. Ct. Spec. App. 2002) (citing Martens Chevrolet, Inc v. Seney , 439 A.2d 534 \n(Md. 1982) (inter nal citations omitted)).  To determine whether a defendant owes a duty under \nthe first element, courts look to the nature of the harm likely to result from a failure to exercise \ndue care and the relationship between the parties.  Chubb & Son v. C & C Compl ete Servs., LLC,  \n919 F. Supp. 2d 666, 674 (D. Md. 2013).   \nIn this case, Plaintiff TruGreen specifically alleges that AGS’s tort duty arises from “the \nbusiness and contractual relationship between TruGreen and [AGS]” and seeks recovery of Case 1:20-cv-00335-RDB   Document 74   Filed 02/23/21   Page 9 of 1810 \n “lost profits and  . . . $2.5 million” in monetary damages.  (ECF No. 32 ¶¶ 37, 45 *SEALED*.)  \nThis is insufficient to state a claim for negligent misrepresentation.  It is well -established under \nMaryland law that “[t]he mere negligent breach of a contract, absent a duty or obligation \nimposed by law independent of that arising out of the contract itself, is not enough to sustain \nan action sounding in tort.”  Jacques v. First Nat’l Bank , 515 A.2d 756, 759 (Md. 1986).  “A bsent \nspecial circumstances, the court is reluctant to ‘transform an ordinary contractual relationship .  . . into a fiduciary relationship.’”  Spaulding v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. , 920 F. Supp. \n2d 614, 620 (D. Md. 2012) (citing Parker v. Columbia Bank , 604 A.2d 521, 532 (Md. Ct. Spec. \nApp. 1992)).  Such “special circumstances” include contracts between ordinary consumers and professionals with a high degree of skill such as physicians, attorneys, architects, and public accounts.  See Jacques , 515 A.2d at 763 .  No such circumstances exist in this case.  “U nder \nMaryland law, a claim for negligent misrepresentation is improper when the only relationship between the parties is contractual, both parties are sophisticated, and the contract does not \ncreate an expres s duty of care in making representations.”  CapitalSource Fin ., LLC v. Pittsfield \nWeaving, Co., Inc. , 571 F. Supp. 2d 668, 674 (D. Md. 2006).  \nThis principle of Maryland law is often called the “economic loss doctrine. ”  Under \nthis doctrine, “‘courts in thi s district have attempted to limit remedies to contract law where \nthe loss is purely economic  and the parties engaged in arms -length commercial bargaining.’”  \nChubb & Son , 919 F. Supp. 2d 666 at 675 (quoting Gruppo Essenziero Italiano, S.p.A. v. Aromi \nD'Italia, Inc. , No. CCB -08-65, 2011 WL 3207555, at *8 (D. Md. July 27, 2011) (collecting  \ncases)); see also Steven B. Snyder, M.D., P.A. v. Cynosure, Inc.,  No. RDB -18-2049, 2019 WL \n1386727, at *4 (D. Md. Mar. 27, 2019).  The doctrine “serves as a boundary b etween contract Case 1:20-cv-00335-RDB   Document 74   Filed 02/23/21   Page 10 of 1811 \n law, the purpose of which is to enforce the expectations of the parties to an agreement, and \ntort law, the purpose of which is to protect people and property from foreseeable risks of harm by imposing upon others a duty of reasonable care.”   Cash & Carry Am. Inc. v. Roof \nSolutions, Inc. , 117 A.3d 52, 61 (Md.  Ct. Spec. App. 2015).   As this Court has previously noted , \nwhen  “the failure to exercise due care creates a risk of economic loss only, courts have \ngenerally required an intimate nexus b etween the parties as a condition to the imposition of \ntort liability .”  Chubb & Son , 919 F. Supp. 2d at 674 (quoting Jacques , 515 A.2d at 759)).  As \nTruGreen’s only alleged harm with respect to this Count is economic, TruGreen cannot bring a claim for neg ligent misrepresentation on such basis.  \nFinally, TruGreen’s claim for negligent misrepresentation would also seemingly be \nbarred by the Agreement .  The Plaintiff’s arguments with respect to Count II center on \nrepresentations allegedly made by Defendant AGS during the request for proposal process, as \nwell as after the signing of the agreement in November 2018.  ( See ECF No. 32 ¶¶ 36 -45 \n*SEALED*.)   The RPOA contains three contractual provisions which would prevent \nTruGreen’s reliance on these sort s of extracontractual provisions not found within the text of \nthe RPOA itself.  First, the RPOA contains a Warranty Disclaimer, disclaiming both express \nand implied warranties which are not included in the text of the RPOA.  ( See RPOA, § 7.4, \nECF No. 14 -1 *SEALED *.)  Second, the RPOA also contains  an integration clause , which \nprovides that the RPOA “supersedes all prior oral or written communications concerning the \nsubject matter of the Agreement . . . .”  ( See id.  § 13.13  *SEALED*.)  Third , the contract \nprovides that any amendments, modifications, or supplements to the RPOA must be “in \nwriting.”  ( See id.  § 13.15  *SEALED*.)  Maryland law recognizes the validity of these types  of Case 1:20-cv-00335-RDB   Document 74   Filed 02/23/21   Page 11 of 1812 \n contractual provisions.  See Cynosure, Inc. , 2019 WL 1386727, at *7  (upholding validity of \nwarranty disclaimer); Hovnanian Land Inv. Grp ., LLC. v . Annapolis Towne Ctr. at Parole, LLC , 25 \nA.3d 967, 985 -86 (Md. 2011) (upholding validity of integration and non -modification clause) .   \nEven if such provisions would not directl y bar TruGreen’s claims on the basis of \nextracontractual representations, TruGreen’s reliance on such representations in the face of \nthese provisions would be unreasonable.  As provided above, a plaintiff may only prevail on a claim for negligent misrepres entation where “ the plaintiff, justifiably, [took]  action in reliance ” \non the challenge d statement.  Cooper , 810 A.2d at 1053 -54 (citing Martens Chevrolet , 439 A.2d \n534 (internal citations omitted)).  As the Maryland Court of Appeals explained in Parker , “[t]he \nterms of a written contract can, of course, be used as evidence of the reasonableness of the [party’s] reliance upon alleged misrepresentations contrary to those terms.”  604 A.2d at 530.  \n“[A] p erson cannot reasonably rely upon . . . allegedly fraudulent statements made in the face \nof plainly contradictory contractual language.”  Id.  For all these reasons, Plaintiff TruGreen \nhas failed to state a plausible claim for relief under Count II.   Count  II of the Amended \nComplaint is DISMISSED. \nB. Promissory Estoppel (Count III)  \nTo state a claim for promissory estoppel/detrimental reliance under Maryland law, a \nperson must allege: (1) the existence of “a clear and definite promise”; (2) where the promisor \nhas a reasonable expectation that the offer will induce action or forbearance on the part of the \npromisee;” (3) “which does induce actual and reasonable action or forbearance by the promisee”; and (4) “causes a detriment which can only be avoided by enforce ment of the \npromise.”  Pavel Enters., Inc. v. A.S. Johnson Co. , 674 A.2d 521, 532 (Md. 1996).   Promissory  Case 1:20-cv-00335-RDB   Document 74   Filed 02/23/21   Page 12 of 1813 \n estoppel is a quasi -contractual  claim, meaning  “it is an  equitable remedy that permits recovery \n‘where, in fact, there is no contract , but where circumstances are such that justice warrants a \nrecovery as though there had been a promise.’”  Odyssey Travel Ctr., Inc. v. RO Cruises, Inc. , 262 \nF. Supp. 2d 618, 626 (D. Md. 2003) (emphasis added) (quoting S wedish Civil Aviation Admin v. \nProject Mgmt. Enters., Inc. , 190 F. Supp. 2d 785, 792 (D. Md. 2002) (internal quotations and \ncitations omitted)).   Under Maryland law, no quasi -contractual claim  may rise “when a contr act \nexists . . . concerning the same subject matter on which the quasi -contractual claim rests . . . .”  \nSwedish Civil, 190 F. Supp. 2d at 792 (internal citations omitted).  The general rule does not \napply “when the express contract does not fully address a subject matter.”  Cty. Comm’rs of Caroline Cty. v . J. Roland Dashiell & Sons, Inc. , 747 A.2d 600, 609 (Md. 2000).  \nIn this case there is no dispute that the parties are bound by the Agreement , which \ndeals with the Defendant AGS’s obligations with respect to performing recruiting services for \nTruGreen.  ( See ECF No. 32 ¶ 5  *SEALED*.)  TruGreen does not argue that the contract is \ninvalid or unenforceable.  Instead TruGreen argues that the RPOA does not fully address the \nsubject matter of its claims.  (ECF No. 45 at 35 *SEALED*.)  TruGreens asserts its claim for \npromissory estoppel on the basis of claims made both “[i]n order to become TruGreen’s \nservice prov ider” and “[a]fter the parties entered into the RPOA.”  (ECF No. 32 ¶¶ 47 -48 \n*SEALED*.)  Yet, even if TruGreen’s claim for promissory estoppel is based on such \nextracontractual representations , it is unclear to this Court how claims  regarding the services \nperformed or not performed by AGS related to its recruitment services for TruGreen would \nfall outside the subject matter of the RPOA .  Maryland law allows a plaintiff to bring a claim \nfor promissory estoppel as “an alternative means of obtaining contractua l relief .”  Md. Transp. Case 1:20-cv-00335-RDB   Document 74   Filed 02/23/21   Page 13 of 1814 \n Auth. Police Lodge No. 34 Fraternal Order of Police v. Md. Trans. Author,  5 A.3d 1174, 1227 (Md. \nCt. Spec. App. 2010), rev’d in part on other grounds , 21 A.3d 1098 (Md. 2011).  However, given \nthis Court’s denial of the Defendant’s M otion to Dismiss TruGreen’s breach of contract claim \nin Count I,  TruGreen need not seek promissory estoppel as an alternative remedy in this case.  \nTruGreen is seeking recovery under Count III in addition to  its claims in Count I.  This is the \nsort of clai m Maryland law flatly prohibits.  See Odyssey Travel , 262 F. Supp. 2d at 262.  Count \nIII of the Amended Complaint is DISMISSED.  \nC. Declaratory Judgment (Count IV)  \nIn Count IV, TruGreen seeks a Declaratory Judgment that states that it owes no further \nfunds to Defendant AGS pursuant to the Agreement.  The Declaratory Judgment Act \nprovides, in pertinent part, that “[i]n a case of actual controversy within its jurisdict ion . . . any \ncourt of the United States, upon the filing of an appropriate pleading, may declare the rights \nand other legal relations of any interested party seeking such declaration, whether or not \nfurther relief is or could be sought.”  28 U.S.C. §  2201 (a).  The Act is “‘an enabling [statute], \nwhich confers a discretion on the courts rather than an absolute right upon the litigant.’” Wilton \nv. Seven Falls Co. , 515 U.S. 277, 287 (1995) (quoting Public Serv. Comm'n of Utah v. Wycoff Co. , 344 \nU.S. 237, 241 (1952)).  District courts have “great latitude in determining whether to assert \njurisdiction over declaratory judgment actions.”  United Capitol Ins. Co. v. Kapiloff , 155 F.3d 488, \n493 (4th Cir. 1998) (quoting Aetna Cas. & Sur. Co. v. Ind -Com Elec. Co. , 139 F.3d 419, 422 (4th \nCir. 1998)).  Discretion to decline to exercise jurisdiction exists “even when the suit otherwise \nsatisfies subject matter jurisdiction prerequisites.” Wilton , 515 U.S. at 282.  Case 1:20-cv-00335-RDB   Document 74   Filed 02/23/21   Page 14 of 1815 \n Generally, a declaratory judgment action is appropriate “when the judgment will serve \na useful purpose in clarifying and settling the legal relations in issue, and . . . when it will \nterminate and afford relief from uncertainty, insecurity, and controversy giving rise to the \nproceeding.” Centennial Life Ins. Co. v. Poston , 88 F.3d 255, 256 (4th Cir. 1996) (quoting Aetna \nCas. & Sur. Co. v. Quarles, 92 F.2d 321, 325 (4th Cir. 1937)).  A proper declaratory judgment \nsuit must involve “a controversy admitting of specific relief through a decree of conclusive character,  as distinguished from an opinion advising what the law would be upon a \nhypothetical state of facts.”  Pa. Nat'l Mutual Cas. Ins. Co. v. Alliance Roofing & Sheet Metal, Inc. , \nNo. WDQ- 12-1427, 2013 WL 1120587, at *3 (D. Md. Mar. 14, 2013) (quoting White v. Nat'l \nUnion Fire Ins. Co. of Pittsburgh , 913 F.2d 165, 167 (4th Cir. 1990)).  Additionally, the courts’ \npower to hear declaratory judgment claims “should not be exercised for the purposes of trying \nissued involved in cases already pending, . . . or for the purpose of anticipating the trial of an \nissue in a court of co -ordinate jurisdiction.”  Quarles , 92 F.2d at 324.  As the United States \nCourt of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit stated in Quarles , “The object of the statute is to afford \na new form of relief where needed, not to furnish a new choice of tribunals or to draw into the federal courts the adjudication of causes properly cognizable by the courts of the states.”  \nId. \nIn this case, TruGree n claims that AGS has improperly continued to demand payments \nunder the RPOA for what TruGreen alleges to be unearned or unrecoverable fees.  (ECF No. \n32 ¶ 55 *SEALED*.)  TruGreen seeks a declaratory judgment that states that TruGreen owes \nno further funds  to AGS pursuant to the RPOA.  ( Id. ¶ 56 *SEALED*.)  Given that this case \ninvolves two competing claims for breach of the Agreement , adjudicating this claim in the Case 1:20-cv-00335-RDB   Document 74   Filed 02/23/21   Page 15 of 1816 \n context of a Declaratory Judgment would not serve any useful  purpose.  What , if any , damages  \nare due to either party will become relevant upon the resolution of those competing claims.  \nUntil that time, this Court’s opinion with respect to Count IV would be merely advisory .  This \nCourt in the exercise of its discretion declines to consider the Plaintiff’s claim for Declaratory \nJudgment , and Count IV is DISMISSED.  \nD. Recoupment/Setoff (Count V)  \nIn Count V, TruGreen asks this Court to hold that TruGreen is entitled to recoupment \nand/or setoff from AGS any amounts it would otherwise owe under the Agreement  in lieu of \nthe damages caused to it by AGS’s breach of the RPOA and other misconduct.  (ECF No. 32  \n¶ 61 *SEALED*. )  Maryland law recognizes both recoupment and setoff as viable legal \ntheories.  See  Pines Plaza Ltd. P’ship v. Berkley Trace, LLC , 66 A.3d 720, 733 n.22 (Md. 2013) \n(quoting Imbesi v. Carpenter Realty Corp. , 744 A.2d 549 (Md. 2000 )).  However, the  Fourth Circuit \nhas held that under Maryland law, “plaintiffs may not bring affirmative actions for \nrecoupment.”  Carter v. Mortg. Elec. Re gistration Sys., Inc. , 680 F. App’x 178, 180 (4th Cir. 2017) \n(citing Bull v. United States , 295 U.S. 247, 262 (1935)).  In Carter, the Court  affirmed the district \ncourt’s dismissal of the plaintiff’s claim for recoupment alleged as a “stand -alone cause of \naction.”  Id.   The proper vehicle for a claim for recoupment or setoff is an affirmative defense.  \nId. (citing Bull v. United States , 295 U.S. 247, 262 (1935)).  TruGreen asserts recoupment /setoff \nas an affirmative defense in its Answer to AGS’s Countercla im.  ( See Affirmative Defense Y, \nECF No.  20.)  In accordance with Fourth Circuit precedent, Count V is DISMISSED.  \nE. Damages  Case 1:20-cv-00335-RDB   Document 74   Filed 02/23/21   Page 16 of 1817 \n In its Motion to Dismiss, AGS not only sought dismissal of all five counts of the \nAmended Complaint, but also that this Court enter an order foreclosing TruGreen from \nrecovering  any damages for any of its claims, or in the alternative, an order barring TruGreen \nfrom recovering anything other than legitimate compensatory damages arising directly from \nbreach of the RPOA.  ( See ECF No. 38 -1 at 16.)  AGS pointed to Section 11.1 of the RPOA, \nentitled “Exclusion of Damages,” which provides that “in no event,” either AGS or TruGreen shall recover “indirect, incidental, punitive, exemplary, reliance or special or consequential \ndamages, including damages for lost profits, loss of use, busi ness interruption, or loss of data \nin connection with or arising out of [the RPOA].”  ( See RPOA § 11.1 , ECF No. 14 -1 \n*SEALED*.)  While this section is entitled “Exclusion of Damages,” the inclusion of such \nprovision does not mean that all damages must be e xcluded.  Section 11.1 must be read in the \ncontext of the entire RPOA.  See Jones v. Hubbard, 740 A.2d 1004, 1016 (Md. 1999).  Section \n11.2 imposes a damages cap of $8 million, implying some form of damages is permitted.  ( See \nRPOA § 11.2 , ECF No. 14 -1 *SEALED*.)  However, this Court does not believe that an \norder related to the availability of certain damages for either party is appropriate at this stage \nof this case .  This is an issue that may be addressed at trial.  The Defendant’s Motion to \nDismiss with respect to damages is DENIED.  \nCONCLUSION  \n For these  aforegoing  reasons, and the reasons stated on the record at the hearing of \nFebruary 18, 2021 , the Defendant AGS’s  Motion to Dismiss (ECF No. 38) was DENIED IN \nPART and GRANTED IN PART.  Specifically, this Court GRANTED the Motion with \nrespect to Counts II, III, IV, and V of the Plaintiff TruGreen’s Amended Complaint and such Case 1:20-cv-00335-RDB   Document 74   Filed 02/23/21   Page 17 of 1818 \n counts are DISMISSED.  This Court DENIED t he Motion with respect to Count I and the \nDefendant’s request to enter an order determining the availability of damages.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: In United States v. Juan Carlos Reynoso, the court granted the government's motion for Reynoso's detention pending trial due to a serious risk of flight. Reynoso is charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud and money laundering related to a cryptocurrency scheme that raised $650 million. The case involves AI and automated systems with regard to the defendant's alleged involvement in business ventures utilizing commission-based marketing plans and cryptocurrency transactions, which include dealings with companies like Thrive99X that have AI components.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether there are any conditions of pretrial release that would reasonably assure Mr. Reynoso's appearance in court and the safety of the community.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court found that no conditions of release could reasonably assure Reynoso's appearance due to his significant financial resources, international ties, dual citizenship, and previous conduct, and therefore ordered his detention pending trial.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Juan Reynoso is in big trouble for allegedly tricking people into a bad cryptocurrency deal. The court decided he should stay in jail until his trial because they worry he might run away to another country, thanks to his passports and lots of money hidden online. They couldn't think of any rules to ensure he'd stay put in the U.S. for his trial.",
    "full_text": "IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF PUERTO RICO \n \nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA,  \nPlaintiff, \nv. \nJUAN CARLOS REYNOSO [2], \n \nDefendant.  \n \n  CRIM. NO. 25-284 (RAM)            \n \nOPINION AND ORDER \nRAÚL M. ARIAS-MARXUACH, United States District Judge  \nPending before the Court is the Government’s Motion for \nDetention Pending Trial (“Motion”). (Docket No. 6). For the reasons \nset forth below, the Court GRANTS the Government’s Motion. \nI. BACKGROUND \nOn June 25, 2025, a federal Indictment was filed against \nDefendant Juan Carlos Reynoso (“Mr. Reynoso” or “Defendant”) and \nanother defendant, charging them with one count of conspiracy to \ncommit wire fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1349, and one count \nof conspiracy to commit money laundering, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1956(h). (Docket No. 3). The Indictment was issued due to \nDefendant’s involvement in OmegaPro, a cryptocurrency investment scheme that allegedly raised over $650 million from thousands of \ninvestors between July 2019 and November 2022 before its collapse and subsequent loss of all investment funds. (Docket Nos. 3 and 6 at 4). An arrest warrant was issued the same day, and Mr. Reynoso Case 3:25-cr-00284-RAM     Document 46     Filed 07/30/25     Page 1 of 24Criminal No. 25-284 (RAM) 2 \n \nwas arrested in the Southern District of Florida on July 1, 2025. \n(Docket Nos. 5 and 6). \nOn July 2, 2025, the Government filed the Motion  requesting \nthat Mr. Reynoso be detained pending trial because he poses a \nserious risk of flight. (Docket No. 6). Namely, the Government \nargues that his history of violating a court order, substantial \ntime he spends abroad, and his access to sizable funds overseas \nwould enable Mr. Reynoso to live overseas rather than remain in the United States and face his ongoing criminal case. Id. at 2. On \nJuly 3, 2025, the United States filed an Emergency Motion to Stay Release after a Magistrate Judge in the Southern District of \nFlorida set conditions of release allowing Mr. Reynoso to travel to Puerto Rico on his own accord. (Docket No. 7). The Court granted \nthe stay the same day. (Docket No. 8). A de novo detention hearing \nwas held before this Court on July 23, 2025, with both Defendant and the Government appearing. (Docket No. 37). \nII. FINDINGS OF FACT \nThe Bail Reform Act directs the judicial officer to include \nwritten findings of fact in a detention order. See 18 U.S.C. \n§ 3142(i)(1). The below findings of fact are drawn only from the information, exhibits, and testimony presented at the de novo \nhearing conducted on July 23, 2025, as well as accompanying court documents. These findings of fact have been made solely for the \npurpose of deciding the pending Motion. See 18 U.S.C. § 3142(j). Case 3:25-cr-00284-RAM     Document 46     Filed 07/30/25     Page 2 of 24Criminal No. 25-284 (RAM) 3 \n \nA. Proffer by the Government \n \nThe Government proffered that Mr. Reynoso poses both a risk \nof flight and a danger to the community. In support of its \narguments, the Government presented various exhibits, including \nthe following: \n1. A series of screenshots of Instagram posts by a company called Thrive99X. One post discusses a recent company event in June \n2025 in Panama and was liked by an account associated with Mr. Reynoso. Another post includes a group photograph with a \nman who appears to be Mr. Reynoso. \n2. A series of screenshots of Thrive99X’s website, which advertises itself as “an escape plan to freedom” offering \nvarious educational opportunities and artificial intelligence \nsection through a commission-based multilevel marketing \nbusiness plan that offers daily pay-outs to participants. The \nfront page of the website also claims that Thrive99X has been featured on CNN, the New York Times, BBC, Entrepreneur, USA Today, and Forbes; the Government asserts it has found no \nmention of Thrive99X on any of these websites. There is no \ncontact information for Thrive99X. \n3. A printout of a real estate website showing Mr. Reynoso’s Miami property listed for sale and a composite of Google real \nestate listings that appear when the property’s address is \nsearched, including a listing that states “seller motivated.” Case 3:25-cr-00284-RAM     Document 46     Filed 07/30/25     Page 3 of 24Criminal No. 25-284 (RAM) 4 \n \n4. A series of financial statements involving payments between \nReyFer Digital (“ReyFer”), a company owned by Mr. Reynoso, \nand various third parties. The statements show that Mr. \nReynoso sent money to third parties, then billed third parties \nthrough ReyFer, who later paid Mr. Reynoso that same amount. For example, a series of February 2025 transactions show: (i) \nReyFer billing a Mexican construction company for $35,000; \n(ii) Mr. Reynoso sending the construction company $35,534; (iii) the construction company sending the money to Conduit \nFinancial; (iv) Conduit Financial sending $35,000 to ReyFer; \nand (v) Mr. Reynoso billing ReyFer Digital, who then pays Mr. \nReynoso that same amount. \nFirst, Government argued Mr. Reynoso presents a financial \ndanger to the community because Mr. Reynoso is engaging in similar \nactivities as those that are the subject of the Indictment. Both \nThrive99X and OmegaPro used affiliate-based marketing models, \ninvolved recruitment-based commissions, promised significant \nreturns on investments, and had marketing materials in both English \nand Spanish. Given the similarities between Thrive99X and OmegaPro \nand Mr. Reynoso’s apparent involvement in both companies, the \nGovernment asserts that Mr. Reynoso is willing and able to defraud \nothers through his participation in Thrive99X. The Government also \npoints to Mr. Reynoso’s involvement in AirBit Club, a Ponzi scheme \nthat promised investors returns on cryptocurrency investments; Case 3:25-cr-00284-RAM     Document 46     Filed 07/30/25     Page 4 of 24Criminal No. 25-284 (RAM) 5 \n \nCrypto World Evolution, “which allegedly used a trading bot linked \nto [a] cyptocurrency exchange that went out of business; IcomTech, \na Ponzi scheme that promised profits from cryptocurrency trading \nand mining; and “a scheme called T-Minor.” All of these schemes \nwere active within the last decade, and Mr. Reynoso has \nacknowledged that both AirBit Club and IcomTech were Ponzi Schemes. \nThe Government argues his pattern of involvement in these types of \nenterprises signals a willingness to continue similar behavior in the future, such as through Thrive99X. As Thrive99X is a web-based \nbusiness, the Government believes that Mr. Reynoso can cause \nfinancial harm to others as long as he has access to the Internet, \neven if under home detention. Consequently, the Government asserts \nMr. Reynoso poses a financial danger to the community that \njustifies continued detention. \nSecond, Government asserts that Mr. Reynoso poses a serious \nrisk of flight such that his appearance in court could not be \nguaranteed without continued detention.  \nAccording to the Government, Mr. Reynoso has continually \nshown a lack of candor to the Government during its investigation and to the Probation Office in his pretrial services report. In \nthe pretrial services report, he refused to disclose the amount of \ncryptocurrency he has access to. He also reported having only one \nbank account with the Bank of America, but he was arrested with a \ndebit card from the Spanish Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria Case 3:25-cr-00284-RAM     Document 46     Filed 07/30/25     Page 5 of 24Criminal No. 25-284 (RAM) 6 \n \n(“BBVA”) and a debit card in someone else’s name from the \nPanamanian bank Banesco. He has a Peruvian bank account and his \ncompany, ReyFer, has an account at the South Korean KEB Hana Bank. \nReyFer is listed as Mr. Reynoso’s source of employment in the pretrial services report, but he does not disclose his involvement \nin Thrive99X, despite his appearances on social media promoting \nit. As described above, ReyFer has been involved in a serious of \nsuspect transactions involving Mr. Reynoso and various third \nparties that the Government characterizes as money laundering. \nConsequently, the Government argues that Mr. Reynoso has not \nprovided a legitimate source of income and instead showed a lack \nof candor as to his source income and business activities in his \npretrial services report. The Government is also concerned about \nthe extensive liquid and potential undisclosed assets Mr. Reynoso holds. Mr. Reynoso has access to significant liquid assets, as \nbetween February 2021 and December 2023, more than $21.4 million \nwas deposited into Mr. Reynoso’s Binance account. The Government \nnotes that Mr. Reynoso has noncustodial cryptocurrency wallets \nthat only he has the private keys for, meaning that no government \ncan access or evaluate any assets held in those wallets. \nThe Government next points to Mr. Reynoso’s status as a dual \nnational with extensive foreign travel and ties outside the United \nStates. Mr. Reynoso previously listed his Florida property on the \nmarket; at least one real estate listing for the property states Case 3:25-cr-00284-RAM     Document 46     Filed 07/30/25     Page 6 of 24Criminal No. 25-284 (RAM) 7 \n \n“seller motivated.” The only other property he holds equity in is \na Peruvian house that he has 20 percent interest in. The remaining \ninterest in the house is held by his family members in Peru. Mr. Reynoso holds a Peruvian passport and has family in Peru, including \na sibling. Between 2020 and June 2025, he has taken sixty-eight \ntrips to twenty-one unique destinations, some months spending more \ntime outside the United States than within. Mr. Reynoso has also \nengaged with human smugglers to transport a girlfriend from the Bahamas into the United States.  \nThe Government notes that there is an ongoing civil contempt \nproceeding against Mr. Reynoso in the District of Puerto Rico for \nhis failure to comply with another District Court Judge’s order \nissued March 4, 2025. (See Misc. Case No. 25-0068, Docket No. 20). \nDefendant was held in civil contempt for violating a warrant to \nseize property subject to forfeiture (the “Warrant”) in the amount \nof 119.65 Bitcoin (BTC)\n1 and was ordered to turn over the 119.65 \nBTC to the Government. Mr. Reynoso been fined $10,000.00 for each day he violates the seizure warrant after March 4, 2024; as of the \nde novo hearing, he owed more than $1.4 million in fines. Id. While \nthe contempt ruling is on appeal, the Government argues that Mr. \nReynoso’s failure to comply with the order shows a lack of respect \n \n1 At the time the order in Misc. Case No. 25- 0068 was issued, 119.65 BTC was \nworth approximately $12,650,785.94 USD. The Government and Defendant refer to  \n124 BTC at the de novo hearing, not 119.65 BTC. The Court proceeds using the \n119.65 BTC figure, as was used by the District Judge in Misc. Case No. 25- 0068. Case 3:25-cr-00284-RAM     Document 46     Filed 07/30/25     Page 7 of 24Criminal No. 25-284 (RAM) 8 \n \nfor court rulings and indicates Mr. Reynoso may refuse to comply \nwith future court orders. \nThe Government’s argument is bolstered by Mr. Reynoso’s \nconduct that resulted in the contempt ruling: the Warrant was \nserved to Mr. Reynoso’s lawyer during the afternoon of Friday, \nJanuary 31, 2025, after the Government called the lawyer to see if \nhe would accept service on behalf of Defendant. The lawyer claimed \nthat he did not open the Warrant or give it to Mr. Reynoso until Sunday, February 2, 2025, but within two hours of the Warrant being \nserved to his counsel, Mr. Reynoso transferred the 119.65 BTC \nsubject to the Warrant to another Bitcoin wallet. (See Misc. Case \nNo. 25-0068, Docket No. 20 at 6-8). Within twenty-four hours, Mr. \nReynoso had moved the Bitcoin into five different wallets. Id. at \n7. The Government argues this indicates Mr. Reynoso deliberately \ndisregarded the Warrant by moving the subject assets out of the \nGovernment’s reach. The Government moved to hold Mr. Reynoso in \ncontempt on February 7, 2025, but Defendant did not move to quash the warrant until February 18, 2025— over two weeks after the \nWarrant was served and the Bitcoin dissipated. Id. At the de novo \nhearing, the Government stated that less than $2 million of Mr. \nReynoso’s Bitcoin has been recovered by the Government, leaving \nmillions of dollars outstanding. \nThird, considering the potential danger to the community and \nrisk of flight posed by Defendant, the Government argues no Case 3:25-cr-00284-RAM     Document 46     Filed 07/30/25     Page 8 of 24Criminal No. 25-284 (RAM) 9 \n \nconditions of release could protect the community and ensure Mr. \nReynoso’s appearance before the Court. Requiring Mr. Reynoso to \nremain at his house and submit to electronic monitoring would not \nstop him from continuing to engage in business ventures such as \nThrive99X, potentially harming customers and investors. The \nGovernment —and other governments— lack the ability to control and \nmonitor cryptocurrency, making it difficult to know how many assets Mr. Reynoso has and how he is interacting with them. This is shown \nby the millions of dollars from OmegaPro investments that remain \nhidden from the Government. \nB. Proffer by Defendant \n \nMr. Reynoso’s counsel argued that  no statutory presumption of \ndetention applies, Defendant does not pose a serious risk of flight \nor danger to the community, and adequate conditions for his release \ncan be fashioned. \nFirst, Mr. Reynoso disputed the Government’s arguments that \nhe poses a flight risk, arguing he has strong ties to the United \nStates. He is fifty-seven years old and has lived in the United \nStates without a criminal record  since he was twenty, virtually \nthe entirety of his adult life. His four children live in the \nUnited States and are American citizens, as are his grandchildren. \nMr. Reynoso maintains close ties with these family members. While \nhe has travelled extensively for his job, he has always returned \nto the United States. This was true even when he was aware that Case 3:25-cr-00284-RAM     Document 46     Filed 07/30/25     Page 9 of 24Criminal No. 25-284 (RAM) 10 \n \nthe Government was investigating OmegaPro and that he was a target \nof that investigation; during that period, he entered the United \nStates ten different times. While Mr. Reynoso does hold a Peruvian \npassport, he is willing to surrender it while on release. His \nprevious refusals to disclose his cryptocurrency assets were made \non the advice of his attorney and were not meant to show a lack of \ncounsel to the Court. \nDefendant notes that Mr. Reynoso’s Florida property was taken \noff the market upon request of the Magistrate Judge in the Southern \nDistrict of Florida, but at least some of the listings have \nremained up due to the sheer number of realtors interested in \nselling the property. The property had originally been purchased \nfor Mr. Reynoso, his wife, and his two youngest daughters to live \nin; however, as the daughters ultimately remained in New Jersey, \nthe house did not become a family home and Mr. Reynoso has been \ntrying to sell it for some time. He is also willing to provide the \nhouse to the Court as collateral to demonstrate he will remain in the United States. The Peruvian house is a family home and only \nworth $300,000, so there is no indication Mr. Reynoso would flee Peru or otherwise rely on any Peruvian assets for support. \nMr. Reynoso notes that the contempt order against him is \ncurrently on appeal, and reiterated arguments made before the \nDistrict Judge that held him in contempt. Namely, he argues that \nhe was unaware of the Warrant when he moved the Bitcoin, the Case 3:25-cr-00284-RAM     Document 46     Filed 07/30/25     Page 10 of 24Criminal No. 25-284 (RAM) 11 \n \nWarrant was issued only after (and because) Bitcoins had started \nto move from the accounts, service of the Warrant was improper, \nthere is no indication he has control over those assets, and his \nprevious counsel that allegedly failed to timely check the contents \nof the Warrant has since been replaced with his current counsel. \nMr. Reynoso questioned whether the Government’s decision to seek \ncontinued detention was punitive due to the contempt ruling, and \nclaimed that he was not the principal in this case, merely the least culpable of the four individuals involved in managing \nOmegaPro. \nDefendant argues that his affiliation with human smugglers \nwas a one-time relationship he used to bring a girlfriend into the \nUnited States (purportedly “the flavor of the month”). He is \ncurrently a witness in the prosecution of those smugglers and has \nnot been indicted in that case. The different bank accounts and \ndebit cards he possesses are for family members and a girlfriend \nin Panama, and the South Korean bank account has been closed for an “extensive period” of time. \nSecond, Mr. Reynoso argues that he does not pose a risk of \ndanger to the community. Importantly, there is no evidence that \nThrive99X is illegal or involved in any type of illegal activity. \nMr. Reynoso’s role in the company is similar to an inspirational \nspeaker and as his social media ties him to Thrive99X, he is not \ntrying to hide his business activity. His previous Case 3:25-cr-00284-RAM     Document 46     Filed 07/30/25     Page 11 of 24Criminal No. 25-284 (RAM) 12 \n \nacknowledgements that prior business ventures were Ponzi schemes \nare immaterial here as he was not a principal in these matters nor \nwas he charged by the Government for his activities. Furthermore, \nMr. Reynoso’s activities with ReyFer were related to consulting \nactivities he engages in and do not show he participated in money \nlaundering. \nDefendant also noted that the Court has previously expressed \nskepticism that the Government can prove “clear and convincing \nevidence of dangerousness” through proffer and has not found \nsufficient indica of dangerousness in previous cases through \nproffer. Mr. Reynoso’s potential dangerousness was not brought up \nin proceedings in the Southern District of Florida and was not at \nissue until the instant de novo hearing. \nThird, Defendant’s daughter, Vivian Reynoso, appeared to \nspeak on his behalf. Ms. Reynoso is a fulltime student who also \nworks as a health and fitness coach and has obtained a degree of \nfinancial assistance from her father. She has one grandchild, and \nlives in New Jersey. She stated she is close with her siblings and \nthat her family is very close due to her father, as her siblings \nshare the same father, albeit different mothers. Ms. Reynoso is \nwilling to sign any bond issued for Mr. Reynoso, cares for and \ntrusts her father, and believes he would stay in the country if \ngranted release. She was unsure what her father did for a living \nor how much time he spends out of the country. Case 3:25-cr-00284-RAM     Document 46     Filed 07/30/25     Page 12 of 24Criminal No. 25-284 (RAM) 13 \n \nFourth, Defendant proposed various conditions of pretrial \nrelease. (Docket No. 42). His daughter and two other family members \nare willing to put up a $500,000 bond for him. He would surrender \nhis American and Peruvian passports and submit his Florida \nresidence as collateral. He would also be willing to submit to home detention, electronic monitoring, stop travelling, and \nrefrain from participating in any sort of cryptocurrency business. Mr. Reynoso argued that the amount of money he can access should not be held against him for purposes of release. \nIII. LEGAL STANDARD \nA. Standard of review for a detention or release order \n \nA district court reviews a magistrate judge's order of \ndetention or release under a de novo standard and “need not defer \nto the magistrate judge’s findings or give specific reasons for \nrejecting them.” United States v. Cidraz-Santiago, 18 F.Supp. 3d \n124, 126 (D.P.R. 2014) (citations omitted). A district court may “take additional evidence or conduct a new evidentiary hearing” when “the defendant has placed relevant facts at issue.” Id. \nB. The Bail Reform Act \n \nPursuant to the Bail Reform Act of 1984 (the “Act”), a \njudicial officer must determine whether a person charged with an offense shall be detained or released pending trial. See 18 U.S.C. \n§ 3142(a). Section 3142(e) of the Act provides that if, after conducting a hearing, “the judicial officer finds that no condition Case 3:25-cr-00284-RAM     Document 46     Filed 07/30/25     Page 13 of 24Criminal No. 25-284 (RAM) 14 \n \nor combination of conditions will reasonably assure the appearance \nof the person as required and the safety of any other person and \nthe community, such judicial officer shall order the detention of \nthe person before trial.” Id. § 3142(e). \nSection 3142(f) of the Act establishes the instances in which \nan accused individual is eligible for detention and therefore a \ndetention hearing is proper. See 18 U.S.C. § 3142(f). Specifically, \n§ 3142(f)(2)(A)-(B) authorizes the court to hold a detention \nhearing upon government motion or sua sponte in cases that involve \n“a serious risk that such person will flee” or “a serious risk \nthat such person will obstruct or attempt to obstruct justice, or \nthreaten, injure, or intimidate, or attempt to threaten, injure, \nor intimidate, a prospective witness or juror.” \nThe standard of proof for detention due to dangerousness is \nclear and convincing evidence, while the standard of proof for \ndetention due to risk of flight is preponderance of the evidence. \nId.; see United States v. Patriarca, 948 F.2d 789, 793 (1st Cir. \n1991); United States v. Berríos-Aquino, Crim. No. 22-473, 2022 WL \n17075919, at *1 (D.P.R. Nov. 18, 2022). Clear and convincing \nevidence is “more than preponderance of the evidence but less than \nbeyond a reasonable doubt.” United States v. Acevedo-Ramos, 600 \nF.Supp. 501, 509 (D.P.R. 1984) (citations omitted), aff’d, 744 F.2d 203 (1st Cir. 1985) (Breyer, J.). This standard requires “a \nhigh degree of certainty that the information presented supports Case 3:25-cr-00284-RAM     Document 46     Filed 07/30/25     Page 14 of 24Criminal No. 25-284 (RAM) 15 \n \nthe conclusion of dangerousness or risk to the obstruction of \njustice.” Id.  \nTo determine whether there are conditions of release that \nassure a defendant’s appearance and the safety of the community, \njudicial officers must consider the following factors: (1) the \nnature and circumstances of the offense charged; (2) the weight of \nthe evidence against the defendant; (3) the defendant’s personal \nhistory and characteristics; and (4) the nature and seriousness of \nthe danger to any person or the community that would be posed by \nthe defendant’s release. 18 U.S.C. § 3142(g).  \nIV. DISCUSSION \nAfter considering the proffers of counsel, the arguments of \nthe parties, and the transcript of the de novo detention hearing, the Court finds that the Government has proven by a preponderance \nof the evidence that no conditions of release could reasonably \nassure Defendant’s appearance as required. \nA. The nature and circumstances of the offense charged \n \nAs stated above, Mr. Reynoso was charged with one count of \nconspiracy to commit wire fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1349, \nand one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering, in \nviolation of 18 U.S.C. § 1956(h). (Docket No. 3). Both counts carry \na statutory maximum sentence of twenty years. See 18 U.S.C. §§ \n1343, 1956(a). Both offenses are serious, particularly given the \nsignificant amount of money at stake: $650 million, over half a Case 3:25-cr-00284-RAM     Document 46     Filed 07/30/25     Page 15 of 24Criminal No. 25-284 (RAM) 16 \n \nbillion dollars. A significant amount of these funds remains \nunrecovered, representing potentially devastating financial losses \nto middle class investors, pensioners, retirees, and public \nservice employees. The severity of the offenses favors detention. \nB. The weight of the evidence against Defendant \n \nIn addition to its Motion and proffer, the  Government \npresented various Exhibits throughout the de novo hearing that \nrelated to the charged offenses and his more recent activities. The Government establishes a detailed summary of Mr. Reynoso’s  \ninvolvement in OmegaPro, describing numerous claims he made about \nOmegaPro to potential investors, the flow of investor funds to Mr. \nReynoso’s accounts, his lavish lifestyle while at OmegaPro, his \nparticipation in other defunct cryptocurrency enterprises (some of \nwhich he admits to be Ponzi schemes), the outstanding civil contempt order against him, and his evasiveness and refusal to \nanswer or withhold information in response to various questions in \nhis pretrial services report. (Docket No. 6 at 7-20). It is \nindisputable that Mr. Reynoso was involved in OmegaPro prior to \nits collapse, and Government’s proffer and Motion ties Mr. Reynoso \nto the charged offenses. The Court concludes the weight of the evidence against Mr. Reynoso is strong and favors detention. \nRegardless of the import or weight of the evidence proffered \nby the Government, the Court is not concerned with \nMr. Reynoso’s guilt or innocence at this time. See 18 U.S.C. § Case 3:25-cr-00284-RAM     Document 46     Filed 07/30/25     Page 16 of 24Criminal No. 25-284 (RAM) 17 \n \n3142(j) (“Nothing in this section shall be construed as modifying \nor limiting the presumption of innocence.”). The Court’s task is \nto assess whether there is a set of conditions that “will \nreasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and the safety of any other person and the community.” 18 U.S.C. § 3142(c).  \nC. Defendant’s personal history and characteristics \n \nRelevant factors in assessing the risk of flight are that \nDefendant’s residence, family and community ties, employment, \nfinancial resources, and past conduct. See 18 U.S.C. § 3142(c); \nUnited States v. Torres-Rosario, 600 F.Supp. 2d 327, 335 (D.P.R. \n2009). Mr. Reynoso is a dual Peruvian-American citizen, holding \npassports from both countries. He has an extensive history of work-related foreign travel, such that his own children may not be aware \nwhen and for how long their father is out of the country. However, \nMr. Reynoso has always returned to the United States and has made \nhis home in United States for the past thirty-seven years. He owns \none property in Miami, Florida, albeit a house that he has tried to sell in the past. He also holds a 20 percent interest in a \nfamily home in Peru, providing Defendant with a potential place to \nstay outside the United States. \nThe bulk of Mr. Reynoso’s family have strong ties to the \nUnited States. Three of his children were born in the United States  \nand all four children are American citizens, as were his \ngrandchildren. His two youngest children are minors who have firmly Case 3:25-cr-00284-RAM     Document 46     Filed 07/30/25     Page 17 of 24Criminal No. 25-284 (RAM) 20 \n \ncarrying the equivalent of more than $5,000 USD in American and \nPeruvian currencies. Id. The Motion and proffer further detail \nvarious cryptocurrency and wire transfers involving Mr. Reynoso and ReyFer that appear to lack a legitimate financial purpose and, \nat the very least, hint at an effort to conceal of the relevant \nfunds. In short, Mr. Reynoso has sophisticated knowledge of various \ncryptocurrencies; the capability to rapidly transfer and access large amounts of money with minimal, if any, oversight; and a pattern of suspicious financial behavior. \nFinally, the Court turns to Mr. Reynoso’s past conduct, which \nis\n— in a word— concerning. Mr. Reynoso has accumulated over $1.4 \nmillion dollars in fines from a March 2025 contempt order issued by another District Judge after he failed to comply with the \nWarrant’s order that he turn millions of dollars in Bitcoin over to the Government. While Defendant later sought to quash the \nWarrant and disputes both the timing of the transfer and whether \nMr. Reynoso maintains control over the assets, the contempt order \nis still standing. The Government correctly notes that a party \ncannot choose to violate a court order instead of challenging it. \nRegardless of a party’s motives or righteousness of his cause, “no \nman can be the judge in his own case.” See Walker v. City of \nBirmingham, 388 U.S. 307, 321 (1967) (affirming a contempt \nconviction against petitioners who violated an injunction instead \nof challenging it). Furthermore, even assuming Mr. Reynoso’s Case 3:25-cr-00284-RAM     Document 46     Filed 07/30/25     Page 20 of 24Criminal No. 25-284 (RAM) 21 \n \nattorney did err by failing to timely open and inform Mr. Reynoso \nof the Warrant, “as a general rule an attorney’s blunder binds her \nclient.” Rosario-Diaz v. Gonzalez, 140 F.3d 312, 315 (1st Cir. \n1998). In addition to the civil contempt order, Mr. Reynoso’s \nresponses to the pretrial services report are deficient, failing \nto disclose various bank accounts and his work at Thrive99X. He \nhas been in contact with human smugglers to bring his girlfriend \nand a cousin into the United States illegally. (Docket No. 6 at 2). He has also failed to disclose the extent of his cryptocurrency \nassets, alluding to a Fifth Amendment issue. Viewing Mr. Reynoso’s \npast conduct in its totality, the Court concludes Defendant has \ndemonstrated a marked lack of candor and respect for Court orders. \nHis personal history and characteristics are sufficient to show \nthat he poses a serious risk of flight to justify detention.  \nThe Court briefly reaches Defendant’s argument that Mr. \nReynoso’s wealth should not be held against him and used to justify\n \ncontinued detention. He points to this Court’s opinion in United \nStates v. Ramos-Domínguez to argue that Mr. Reynoso’s strong family \nties justify release even if he has access to significant financial assets. See 698 F.Supp. 3d 224 (D.P.R. 2023). In Ramos-Domínguez, \nmuch like Mr. Reynoso, the Defendant had access “to vast wealth” from his father’s business and his own drug trafficking, but strong \nfamily and business connections in Puerto Rico. Id. at 230. \nHowever, in that case, the Government’s argument about the Case 3:25-cr-00284-RAM     Document 46     Filed 07/30/25     Page 21 of 24Criminal No. 25-284 (RAM) 22 \n \ndefendant’s foreign contacts was underdeveloped, some of the \nDefendant’s wealth came from his family, and the Government had \npreviously acknowledged that an electronic monitoring device could \naddress concerns about the defendant’s risk of flight. Id. This \nstands in sharp contrast to Mr. Reynoso’s situation, where the extent of Defendant’s foreign travel is dizzying and the Government \nhas emphatically asserted that Mr. Reynoso poses a serious risk of \nflight such that detention is the only way to guarantee his appearance before the Court. Although Mr. Reynoso has strong family \nties to the United States, the Government has sufficiently \nestablished that Defendant has foreign contacts and significant \nassets that render him at risk of flight. Continued detention is \nnot justified only because of Mr. Reynoso’s financial resources, \nbut also because of his dual nationality status, history of international travel, family and property located outside the \nUnited States, previous conduct before the Court, and involvement \nwith human smugglers. \nD. The nature and seriousness of the danger to any person or the \ncommunity that would be posed by Defendant’s release \n \nThere are no allegations or information indicating Mr. \nReynoso poses a physical danger to any person or community. The \nGovernment asserts that Mr. Reynoso still poses a financial danger \nto others due to his pattern of past behavior in cryptocurrency \nschemes and current work with ReyFer and Thrive99X. Ultimately, Case 3:25-cr-00284-RAM     Document 46     Filed 07/30/25     Page 22 of 24Criminal No. 25-284 (RAM) 23 \n \nthe Court does not find the Government’s arguments to be \nsufficiently developed as to show Mr. Reynoso poses a danger to \nany person or the community through clear and convincing evidence. There is insufficient evidence to show Thrive99X is engaged in \nillegal activity or that Mr. Reynoso’s work at Thrive99X or ReyFer \nthreatens the financial security of others. \nFurthermore, the Court reiterates its skepticism that 18 \nU.S.C. § 3142 entitles the Government to “establish dangerousness by clear and convincing evidence solely through a proffer” as the \nplain text of the Act “contains no language permitting prosecutors \nto proceed by proffer alone.” Ramos-Domínguez, 698 F.Supp. 3d at \n231. As the Government has not sufficiently established that Mr. \nReynoso poses a danger to any person or community, this factor \nfavors release. \nV. CONCLUSION \nDefendant offers various conditions of supervised release to \nensure his appearance before the Court. However, upon considering \nthe four § 3142(g) factors when reviewing the parties’ proffers, \nexhibits, and motions, the Court concludes that the Government has shown by a preponderance of the evidence that Mr. Reynoso poses a \nrisk of flight such that no conditions proposed by the parties or \nweighed by the Court would be sufficient to reasonably assure Mr. \nReynoso’s appearance in future proceedings.

    "summary": "1. **Summary:**\n   In *Jeffery Battle v. Microsoft Corporation*, the court ruled on a motion by Microsoft to compel arbitration based on a pre-existing Microsoft Services Agreement (MSA), which included an arbitration clause. The plaintiff, Jeffery Battle, claimed defamation and harm due to Microsoft's Bing search engine and its AI-driven chatbot, Microsoft Copilot, conflating his identity with that of a convicted terrorist. The court granted Microsoft's motion to compel arbitration and stayed the proceedings, acknowledging the arbitration agreement binding.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue:**\n   Whether the court should compel arbitration and stay or dismiss the case based on the arbitration agreement within Microsoft's Services Agreement, and whether the plaintiff's claims fall within the scope of that agreement.\n\n3. **Court's Holding:**\n   The court held that the arbitration agreement within the Microsoft Services Agreement was valid and enforceable and that the plaintiff's claims fell within its scope. Therefore, the court granted Microsoft's motion to compel arbitration and stayed the case pending the outcome of the arbitration.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation:**\n   Microsoft and the plaintiff, Jeffery, had an agreement that if any disputes arose, they would try to work it out with the help of an arbitrator instead of a court. When Jeffery claimed Microsoft's AI wrongly labeled him a terrorist, Microsoft asked the court to make Jeffery stick to that agreement to use arbitration instead. The court agreed with Microsoft and paused Jeffery's lawsuit so that the dispute could be handled by an arbitrator.",

INTRODUCTION \nThe Defendant, Microsoft Corporation (“Microsoft”), has moved to compel arbitration \nand to either stay or dismiss this matter, pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(3) and the Federal \nArbitration Act (“FAA”), 9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16.  See generally ECF No. 40.  Plaintiff pro se , Jeffery \nBattle, has also filed a motion for injunction.  ECF No. 35.  These motions are fully briefed.  ECF Nos. 35, 40, 41, 42, 43, 46.  No hearing is necessary to resolve the motions.  See L.R. 105.6 \n(D. Md. 2023).  For the reasons that follow, the Court: (1) GRANTS  Microsoft’s  motion to \ncompel arbitration; (2) STAYS  this matter, pending the resolution of the parties’ arbitration; and \n(3) DENIES -AS-MOOT  the Plaintiff’s motion for injunction . \nII. FACTUAL BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n1 \nA. Factual Background \nIn this civil action, Plaintiff pro se , Jeffery Battle, alleges that Microsoft has defamed and \nharmed him, because internet searches on Microsoft’s Bing search engine and its generative artificial intelligence chatbot, Microsoft Copilot, yield results that “conflat[e] Mr. Battle with a \nperson of a similar name . . . who is a convicted terrorist.”  ECF No. 1 at 1.  The Plaintiff asserts \n \n1 The facts recited in this memorandum opinion are derived from the complaint; the  supplements there to; \nMicrosoft’s motion to compel arbitration ; and the exhibits attached thereto .  ECF Nos. 1, 5, 7, 8, 19, 40.   \nUnless otherwise stated herein, the facts are undisputed.  Case 1:23-cv-01822-LKG   Document 48   Filed 10/23/24   Page 1 of 132 \n claims against Microsoft for: (1) Assault (Count I), (2) Libel—Defamation (Count II); (3) \nNegligence (Count III); (4) Gross Negligence (Count IV); (5) Intentional Disregard (Count V); \n(6) Strict Product Liability (Count VI); and (7) Product Liability (Count VII).  See ECF Nos. 1, \n8.  As relief, the Plaintiff seeks, among other things, certain injunctive relief, and to recover \nmonetary damages  and attorneys’ fees.  ECF No. 1 at 5-6; see also  ECF No. 35. \nThe Parties  \nPlaintiff pro se  Jeffery  Battle is a resident of Laurel, Maryland.  ECF No. 1 at 1.  \nDefendant Microsoft Corporation is a corporation organized under the laws of \nWashington State, with its principal place of business located in Redmond, Washington.  Id . \nThe Plaintiff’s Microsoft Account And The MSA \nAs background, the Plaintiff  registered for a Microsoft account in December 2003, and it \nis undisputed that his Microsoft account has remain ed active since that time .  ECF No. 40-1 at 6; \nECF No. 40- 2 at ¶ ¶ 3, 6; ECF No. 1.  The Microsoft Services Agreement (“MSA”) governs the \nuse of Microsoft’s online consumer products and services, which include Bing and Microsoft Copilot.  ECF No. 40-1 at 5; see also  ECF No. 40-2 at ¶ 2.  Pursuant to the MSA, Microsoft \nrequires that all accountholders accept and agree to be bound by the terms of the MSA.  ECF No. 40-1 at 5; ECF No. 40-2 at ¶ 2.  And so, as Microsoft explains in the sworn declaration from its  \nSenior Product Manager of Identity and Network Access, Suzanne Fogerty, the Plaintiff would have “had to agree to the then -operative terms of use” contained in the MSA to create his \nMicrosoft account.  ECF No. 40- 2 at ¶ 3.   \nThe terms of the MSA are periodically updated every 12 to 18 months.  ECF No. 40- 1 at \n5; ECF No. 40-2 at ¶ 2.  Given this, the versions of the MSA that were in effect during the time period relevant to this case are the August 2022 and September 2023 versions of the MSA.  ECF \nNo. 40-1 at 5.  Microsoft states that it notifie s its accountholders of the new terms of service in \nthe MSA  via email and “interrupt notices,” which  are found in windows that appear on users’ \nscreens and require action before the users may proceed.  Id . at 5-6.  Microsoft also states that, \nwhen prompted by the interrupt notices, users are “required to accept the MSA updates that now governed their use of the services, by clicking a button labeled ‘Next.’”  Id . at 6; see also  ECF \nNo. 40-7.  And so, Microsoft maintains that its accountholders could not access their accounts or Case 1:23-cv-01822-LKG   Document 48   Filed 10/23/24   Page 2 of 133 \n Microsoft online products and services without first acknowledging the updates to the MSA.  \nECF No. 40-1 at 6. \nMicrosoft also maintains that the Plaintiff accepted and agreed to the MSA’s updated \nterms of service, after receiving an interrupt notice, because he was required to do so to continue \nusing Microsoft products and services.  Id .; ECF No. 40-2 at ¶ 5.  And so, Microsoft further \nmaintains that Plaintiff clicked to acknowledge the updates to the MSA ’s terms of service that \nare relevant to this dispute, on October 12, 2023.  ECF No. 40-2 at ¶ 7.   \nThe MSA’s Arbitration Provision \nRelevant to the pending motion to compel arbitration, Section 15 of the MSA contains an \narbitration provision, which provides that:  \nBinding Arbitration and Class Action Waiver If You Live In \n(or, If a Business, Your Principal Place of Business Is In) the United States.   We hope we never have a dispute, but if we do, \nyou and we agree to try for 60 days, upon receipt of a Notice of Dispute, to resolve it informally.  If we can’t, you and we agree to binding individual arbitration before the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) under the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”), and not to sue in court in front of a judge or jury.  Instead, a neutral arbitrator will decide and the arbitrator’s decision will be final except for a limited right of review under the FAA.   \nECF No. 40-3 at 23-24 (August 2022 MSA) (emphasis in original) ; ECF No. 40-4 at 25-26 \n(September 2023 MSA) (emphasis in original).\n2  In this regard, the arbitration provision in the \nMSA defines a “dispute” to be “as broad as it can be,” and  to include “any claim or controversy . \n. . concerning the Services [defined to include Bing and Microsoft Copilot] . . . under any legal \ntheory including contract, warranty, tort, statute, or regulation, except disputes relating to the \nenforcement or validity of your, your licensors’, our, or our licensors’ intellectual property \nrights.”  ECF No. 40-3 at 24; ECF No. 40-4 at 26; see also  ECF No. 40-1 at 8.   \nThe arbitration provision also provides that: \n \n2 The arbitration provisions contained in the August 2022 and September 2023 versions of the MSA are \nidentical in all materials respects.  Compare  ECF No. 40 -3, with  ECF No. 40 -4.   Case 1:23-cv-01822-LKG   Document 48   Filed 10/23/24   Page 3 of 134 \n The arbitrator may award the same damages to you individually as \na court could.  The arbitrator may award declaratory or \ninjunctive relief only to you individually to satisfy your \nindividual claim, but not relief that would affect non- parties.  \nECF No. 40- 3 at 2 4 (emphasis in original) ; ECF No. 40- 4 at 2 6 (emphasis in original) .  In \naddition, the MSA contains a provision that allows a Microsoft accountholder to reject future \nchanges to its arbitration provision.  In this regard, the MSA provides that “[y]ou may reject any \nchange we make to [S]ection 15 (except address changes) by personally signing and sending us \nnotice within 30 days of the change by U.S. mail . . . .”  ECF No. 40- 3 at 2 5; ECF No. 40- 4 at 2 7.   \nLastly, the MSA contains the following notice to Microsoft accountholders regarding the \narbitration provision:   \nIF YOU LIVE IN (OR YOUR PRINCIPAL PLACE OF \nBUSINESS IS IN) THE UNITED STATES, PLEASE READ \nTHE BINDING ARBITRATION CLAUSE AND CLASS \nACTION WAIVER IN SECTION 15.  IT AFFECTS HOW \nDISPUTES ARE RESOLVED.  \nECF No. 40- 3 at 2 (emphasis in original); ECF No. 40- 4 at 2 (emphasis in original).   \nMicrosoft maintains in this action that the parties have entered into a valid arbitration \nagreement that requires the Plaintiff to arbitrate his claims in this case , because he accepted and \nagreed to the MSA and the August 2022 and September 2023 updates to that agreement .  ECF \nNo. 40- 1 at 8, 11- 12.  And so, Microsoft  requests that the Court order Plaintiff to arbitrate his \nclaims  and either dismiss or stay this matter , pending the resolution of the parties’ arbitration.  \nId. at 13.     \nB. Procedural History  \nThe Plaintiff commenced this action on July 7, 2023, and he subsequently filed \nsupplements to the complaint on July 26, 2023, August 14, 2023, August 21, 2023 and \nNovember 27, 2023, respectively .  ECF Nos. 1, 5, 7, 8, 19.   \nOn May 2, 2024, the Plaintiff filed a motion for injunction.  ECF No. 35.   \nOn June 10, 2024, Microsoft filed a motion to compel arbitration and a response in \nopposition to the Plaintiff’s motion for injunction.  ECF Nos . 40, 41.  Case 1:23-cv-01822-LKG   Document 48   Filed 10/23/24   Page 4 of 135 \n On June 11, 2024, the Plaintiff filed a response in opposition to Microsoft’s motion to \ncompel arbitration  and a reply in support of his motion for injunction.  ECF Nos . 42, 43.  \nOn July 2, 2024, Microsoft filed a reply in support of its  motion to compel arbitration.  \nECF No. 46.  \nThese motions having been fully briefed, the Court resolves the pending motions.   \nIII. LEGAL STANDARDS  \nA. Pro Se  Litigation  \nThe Plaintiff is proceeding in this matter without the assistance of counsel.  And so, the \nCourt must construe the complaint liberally.  See Hughes v. Rowe , 449 U.S. 5, 9- 10 (1980).  But, \nin doing so, the Court cannot disregard a clear failure to allege facts setting forth a cognizable \nclaim.  See United States v. Wilson, 699 F.3d 787, 797 (4th Cir. 2012); see also  Bell v. Bank of \nAm., N.A., 2013 WL 6528966, at *1 (D. Md. Dec. 11, 2013) (“Although a pro se  plaintiff is \ngeneral[ly] given more leeway than a party represented by counsel . . . a district court is not \nobliged to ferret through a [c]omplaint . . . that is so confused, ambiguous, vague [,] or otherwise \nunintelligible that its true substance, if any, is well disguised.”) (quotations omitted).  And s o, if \na plaintiff fails to allege sufficient facts setting forth a cognizable claim, the Court must dismiss \nthe complaint . \nB. Motions To Compel Arbitration  \nThis Court treats motions to compel arbitration as motions for summary judgment , \npursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 56.  See, e.g., Cherdak v. ACT, Inc ., 437 F. Supp. 3d 442, 454 (D. \nMd. 2020) (holding that “[t]reating a motion to compel as a motion for summary judgment is \nproper where the formation or validity of the arbitration agreement is in dispute, . . . or where \ndocuments outside the pleadings mus t be considered”) (internal citations omitted); Owen v. \nCBRE, Inc ., No. 16- 773, 2016 WL 7033973, at *2 (D. Md. Dec. 2, 2016) (citations omitted).  \nUnder Rule 56(a), the Court grants summary judgment if the moving party demonstrates that \nthere is no genuine issue as to any material fact, and that the moving party is entitled to judgment \nas a matter of law.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a); Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 250 \n(1986); Celotex Corp. v. Catrett , 477 U.S. 317, 322 (1986).  In this regard, a fact is “material” if \nit “might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law.”  Anderson , 477 U.S. at 248.  A Case 1:23-cv-01822-LKG   Document 48   Filed 10/23/24   Page 5 of 136 \n dispute of material fact is only “genuine” if sufficient evidence favoring the nonmoving party \nexists for the trier of fact to return a verdict for that party.  Id.   When considering a motion for \nsummary judgment, the Court views the facts in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, with all justifiable inferences drawn in that party’s favor.  Id.  at 255 (citation omitted).  But, the \nCourt may rely only on facts supported in the record.  See Bouchat v. Balt. Ravens Football Club, Inc ., 346 F.3d 514,  522 (4th Cir. 2003).  And so, the Court may not rely upon \nunsubstantiated assertions that are provided in the pleadings.  See id.  \nC. The Federal Arbitration Act  \nThe FAA “requires courts to enforce covered arbitration agreements according to their \nterms.”  Lamps Plus, Inc. v. Varela, 587 U.S. 176, 178 (2019) (citations omitted).  Under Section \n2 of the FAA, an arbitration agreement is “valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, save upon such \ngrounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.”  9 U.S.C. § 2.  And so, \nthe FAA “establishes  ‘a liberal federal policy favoring arbitration agreements.’ ”  Epis Sys. Corp. \nv. Lewis , 584 U.S. 497, 505- 06 (2018) (quoting Moses H. Cone Mem’l Hosp. v. Mercury Constr. \nCorp., 460 U.S. 1, 24 (1983)).   \nThe FAA permits a party to an arbitration agreement to seek to compel another party to \nsubmit  its claims to arbitration.  See 9 U.S.C. § 4.  In this regard, Section 4 of the FAA provides \nthat a “party aggrieved by the alleged failure, neglect, or refusal of another to arbitrate under a \nwritten agreement for arbitration may petition . . . [a] district court . . . for an order dire cting that \nsuch arbitration proceed in the manner provided for in such agreement.”  Id.  The statute also \nprovides that, when pres ented with such a petition, a court “shall hear the parties, and upon being \nsatisfied that the making of the agreement for arbitration . . . is not in issue, the court shall make an order directing the parties to proceed to arbitration in accordance with t he terms of the \nagreement.”  Id.   But, if the “making of the arbitration agreement” is at issue, “the court shall \nproceed summarily to the trial thereof.”   Id. \nIn addition, Section 3 of the FAA provides that:   \nIf any suit or proceeding be brought in any of the courts of the \nUnited States upon any issue referable to arbitration under an agreement in writing for such arbitration, the court in which such \nsuit is pending, upon being satisfied that the issue involved in such \nsuit or proceeding is referable to arbitration under such an Case 1:23-cv-01822-LKG   Document 48   Filed 10/23/24   Page 6 of 137 \n agreement, shall on application of one of the parties stay the trial \nof the action until such arbitration has been had in accordance with \nthe terms of the agreement, providing the applicant for the stay is \nnot in default in proceeding with such arbitration.  \nId. § 3.  And so, the FAA provides two parallel methods for enforcing an arbitration agreement: a \nstay of litigation in any case raising a dispute referable to arbitration under Section 3, and an \naffirmative order to engage in arbitration under Section 4.  See, e.g., Galloway v. Santander \nConsumer USA, Inc., 819 F.3d 79, 84 (4th Cir. 2016) (quoting Chorley Enters. v. Dickey's \nBarbecue Rests., Inc., 807 F.3d 553, 563 (4th Cir. 2015)); Brito v. Major Energy Elec. Servs., \nLLC, 526 F. Supp. 3d. 95, 106 (D. Md. 2021).  \nThe Fourth Circuit has also held that the question of “[w]hether a party has agreed to \narbitrate an issue is a matter of contract interpretation: ‘[A] party cannot be required to submit to \narbitration any dispute which he has not agreed so to submit.’”   Levin v. Alms and Assocs., Inc., \n634 F.3d 260, 266 (4th Cir. 2011) (quoting Am. Recovery Corp. v. Computerized Thermal \nImaging, 96 F.3d 88, 92 (4th Cir. 1996) (citation omitted)) (brackets existing).  And so, “ where \nthe dispute at issue concerns contract for mation, the dispute is generally for courts to decide.”   \nGranite Rock Co. v. Int’l Bhd. Of Teamsters , 561 U.S. 287, 296 (2010); see also Berkeley Cnty. \nSch. Dist. v. Hub Int’l Ltd., 944 F.3d 225, 234 (4th Cir. 2019) (stating that Section 4 of the FAA “requires that the district court—rather than the arbitrator —decide whether the parties have \nformed an agreement to arbitrate”) .  In this regard, “[a] district court . . . has no choice but to \ngrant a motion to compel arbitration where a valid arbitration agree ment exists and the issues in a \ncase fall within its purview.”   Adkins v. Labor Ready, Inc., 303 F.3d 496, 500 (4th Cir. 2002) \n(citing United States v. Bankers Ins. Co., 245 F.3d 315, 319 (4th Cir. 2001)).  And so, the Court \n“engage[s] in a limited review to ensure that the dispute is arbitrable —i.e. , that a valid agreement \nto arbitrate exists between the parties and that the specific dispute falls within the substantive scope of that agreement.”   Murray v. United Food & Commercial Workers Int’l Union, 289 F.3d \n297, 302 (4th Cir. 2002) (citation omitted).\n3 \n \n3 The Fourth Circuit has also held that “[a]ny uncertainty regarding the scope of arbitrable issues agreed \nto by the parties must be resolved in favor of arbitration.”  Muriithi v. Shuttle Exp., Inc ., 712 F.3d 173, \n179 (4th Cir. 2013) (citations omitted); see also  Levin  v. Alms and Assocs., Inc. , 634 F.3d 260, 266 (4th \nCir. 2011)  (quoting Peoples Sec. Life Ins. Co. v. Monumental Life Ins. Co., 867 F.2d 809, 812 (4th Cir. Case 1:23-cv-01822-LKG   Document 48   Filed 10/23/24   Page 7 of 138 \n The Fourth Circuit has held that , when an arbitration agreement is valid and enforceable, \nthe Court must “stay ‘any suit or proceeding’ pending arbitration of ‘any issue referable to \narbitration.’”  Adkins , 303 F.3d at 500.  The Fourth Circuit has also recently held that the Court \nmust stay a case pending arbitration, when the case involves an arbitrable dispute and the party \nopposing a motion to compel arbitration requests a stay of the case if the case is sent to \narbitration.  See Smith v. Spizzirri , 601 U.S. 472, 475- 76 (2024); SZY Holds., LLC v. Garcia, \n2024 WL 3983944, at *2 (4th Cir. Aug. 29, 2024) (quoting Henry Schein, Inc. v. Archer & White \nSales, Inc., 586 U.S. 63, 69 (2019) (“Section 3 of the FAA provides that a court must stay \nlitigation upon being satisfied that the issue is referable to arbitration under the agreement,’ so \nlong as ‘the applicant for the stay is not in default in proceeding with suc h arbitration.’”).   \nD. Applicable Maryland Law  \nLastly, w hen determining whether there is a valid arbitration agreement, courts in the \nFourth Circuit “apply ordinary state -law principles governing the formation of contracts” and \n“the federal substantive law of arbitrability.”   Muriithi v. Shuttle Exp., Inc ., 712 F.3d 173, 179 \n(4th Cir. 2013)  (citations omitted) ; see also  Ngamby v Manor Care of Potomac MD, LLC , 2024 \nWL 3013161, at *5 (D. Md. June 14, 2024)  (“To determine the validity of the arbitration \nagreement, Maryland courts look at the four corners of an arbitration provision.”).  In this regard, \nMaryland courts have held that, “[t]o be binding and enforceable, contracts ordinarily require \nconsideration.”  Cheek v. United Healthcare, 835 A.2d 656, 661 (Md. 2003) (citations omitted); \nsee also Chernick v. Chernick, 610 A.2d 770, 774 (Md. 1992) (binding contracts “must be \nsupported by consideration”) (citation omitted).  Under Maryland law, “consideration may be \nestablished by showing ‘a benefit to the promisor or a detriment to the promisee.’”  Cheek, 835 \nA.2d at 661 (quoting Harford C nty. v. Town of Bel Air , 704 A.2d 421, 430 (Md. 1998)).  And so, \nthe forbearance to exercise a right or pursue a claim can constitute sufficient consideration to \nsupport a contract under Maryland law.  Id. (citing Chernick, 610 A.2d at 774) .   \n \n \n \n1989) (“The ‘heavy presumption of arbitrability requires that when the scope of the arbitration clause is \nopen to question, a court must decide the question in favor of arbitration.’”).  Case 1:23-cv-01822-LKG   Document 48   Filed 10/23/24   Page 8 of 139 \n IV. ANALYSIS  \nMicrosoft has moved to compel arbitration and to either stay or dismiss this matter, upon \nthe grounds that : (1) a valid arbitration agreement exists between the parties and (2) the \nPlaintiff’s claims fall within the scope of the arbitration agreement.  ECF No. 40 -1.  And so, \nMicrosoft requests that the Court order the Plaintiff to arbitrate his claims and either dismiss or \ndismiss this matter , pending the resolution of the parties’ arbitration.  Id . at 13. \nIn his response in opposition to Microsoft’s motion, the Plaintiff does not substantively \nrespond to Microsoft’s arguments.  See generally ECF No. 42.  But, he generally argues that the \nCourt should deny Microsoft’s  motion, because  Microsoft has made “continued false and \nmisleading statements concerning arbitration mandates,” and his claims in this civil action do not \nfall within the scope of the MSA’s arbitration provision.  Id . at 2 -6.   \nFor the reasons that follow, a plain  reading of the MSA shows that the parties have \nentered into a valid arbitration agreement that covers the Plaintiff’s claims in this case.  And so, \nthe Court: (1) GRANTS Microsoft’s motion to compel arbitration; (2)  STAYS this matter, \npending the resolution of the parties’ arbitration; and (3) DENIES -AS-MOOT the Plaintiff’s \nmotion for injunction. \nA. The Parties Have Entered Into A Valid Arbitration Agreement  \nAs an initial matter, Microsoft persuasively argues that the parties have entered into a \nvalid and enforceable arbitration agreement  for several reasons.  \nFirst, the unrebutted evidence before the Court shows that the Plaintiff accepted and \nagreed to the terms of the MSA when he first  created his Microsoft account in 2003, and that he \nalso agreed to the August 2022 and September 2023 updates to the MSA.  When determining \nwhether there is a valid arbitration agreement  in this case , the Court  “appl [ies] ordinary state -law \nprinciples governing the formation of contracts” and “the federal substantive law of \narbitrability.”   Muriithi v. Shuttle Exp., Inc ., 712 F.3d 173, 179 (4th Cir. 2013)  (citations \nomitted); see also  Ngamby v Manor Care of Potomac MD, LLC , 2024 WL 3013161, at *5 (D. \nMd. June 14, 2024) (“To determine the validity of the arbitration agreement, Maryland courts \nlook at the four corners of an arbitration provision.”).  And so, the Court first considers whether \nthe evidence shows that the partie s entered into the MSA . Case 1:23-cv-01822-LKG   Document 48   Filed 10/23/24   Page 9 of 1310 \n In this case, the unrebutted evidence before the Court shows that the parties entered into \nthe MSA , because the Plaintiff accepted and agreed to the MSA when he first created his \nMicrosoft account.  In this regard, it is undisputed that the Plaintiff registered for a Microsoft \naccount in December 2003, and that Microsoft requires that its accountholder s accept and agree \nto be bound by the terms of the MSA.  ECF No. 40- 1 at 5 -6; ECF No. 40 -2 at ¶¶ 3, 6.  And so, as \nMicrosoft explains in the sworn declaration from its Senior Product Manager of Identity and \nNetwork Access, Suzanne Fogerty, the Plaintiff would have “had to agree to the then- operative \nterms of use” contained in the MSA to create his Microsoft account.  ECF No. 40- 2 at ¶ 3.  \nThe unrebutted evidence before the Court also shows that the Plaintiff accepted and \nagreed to the relevant updates to the MSA , when these updates were issued by Microsoft in \nAugust 2022 and September 2023.  Again, it  is undisputed that the Plaintiff has continued to use \nhis Microsoft account since he initially created the account in 2003, and that he was using this account when the claims in this action arose.  ECF No. 40- 1 at 6 -7; ECF No. 40- 2 at ¶¶ 3, 6- 7; \nECF No. 1.  It is also undisputed that Microsoft periodically notified the Plaintiff and other \nMicrosoft accountholders about its updates to the terms of service  contained in the MSA , and \nthat Microsoft accountholders could not access their accounts or Microsoft online products and \nservices without first acknowledging these updates .  ECF No. 40- 1 at 5 -6.  Given this, the \nevidence before the Court shows that the Plaintiff accepted and agreed to the MSA’s terms of \nservice when he created his Microsoft account and that he also accepted and agreed to the \nupda tes to the MSA that occurred in August 2022 and September 2023.  ECF No. 40- 2 at ¶ 7; see  \nO’Neil v. Hilton Head Hosp., 115 F.3d 272, 275 (4th Cir. 1997) (holding that a mutual \nagreement to arbitrate establishes consideration on both sides).    \nSecond, a plain reading of the MSA makes clear that this agreement contains a valid and \nenforceable arbitration provision.  Notably, Section 15 of the MSA provides that:  \nBinding Arbitration and Class Action Waiver If You Live In \n(or, If a Business, Your Principal Place of Business Is In) the \nUnited States.   We hope we never have a dispute, but if we do, \nyou and we agree to try for 60 days, upon receipt of a Notice of Dispute, to resolve it informally.  If we can’t, you and we agree to binding individual arbitration before the American \nArbitration Association (“AAA”) under the Federal \nArbitration Act (“FAA”), and not to sue in court in front of a \njudge or jury.  Instead, a neutral arbitrator will decide and the Case 1:23-cv-01822-LKG   Document 48   Filed 10/23/24   Page 10 of 1311 \n arbitrator’s decision will be final except for a limited right of \nreview under the FAA.   \nECF No. 40- 3 at 23- 24 (emphasis in original); ECF No. 40- 4 at 25- 26 (emphasis in original).  \nAnd so, the Court reads this provision of the MSA to require that the parties to the MSA agree to \nbinding individual arbitration, pursuant to the FAA, if they are unable to informally resolve a \ndispute  covered by the arbitration provision.   \nThe plain language of the MSA’s arbitration provision also makes clear that it s scope is  \nquite broad.  Notably, the MSA defines a “dispute” under the arbitration provision to be “as \nbroad as it can be,” and to include “any claim or controversy . . . concerning the Services \n[defined to include Bing and Microsoft Copilot] . . . under any legal theory including contract, \nwarranty, tort, statute, or regulation, except disputes relating to the enforcement or validity of \nyour, your licensors’, our, or our licensors’ intellectual property rights.”  ECF No. 40- 3 at 24; \nECF No. 40- 4 at 26; see also  ECF No. 40- 1 at 8.  Given this language, the Court reads the \nMSA’s arbitration provision to cover a broad range of disputes and to exclude only those claims \ninvolving intellectual property disputes from its scope. \nRelevant here, the plain terms of the MSA’s arbitration provision also  contemplate claims \nseeking injunctive relief.  See, e.g., ECF No. 40- 3 at 24 ( providing that “[t] he arbitrator may \naward declaratory or injunctive relief only to you individually to satisfy your individual claim, \nbut not relief that would affect non- parties. ”).  And so, the parties’ agreement permits the \narbitrator to award injunctive relief  as well as monetary damages . \nIn addition, a  careful reading of the MSA and the complaint in this matter also make clear \nthat the Plaintiff’s claims fall within the scope of the parties’ arbitration agreement.  As discussed above, the MSA’s arbitration provision provides that the disputes covered by the \nagreement include: “any claim or controversy . . . concerning the Services  [defined to include \nBing and Microsoft Copilot] . . . under any legal theory including contract, warranty, tort, statute, \nor regulation . . . .”  Id . (emphasis ad ded); ECF No. 40- 4 at 26 (emphasis added); see also  ECF \nNo. 40- 1 at 8.  As also discussed above, t he complaint makes clear that the Plaintiff’s various \nclaims in this civil action arise from his use of Microsoft services, namely Bing and Microsoft \nCopilot.  ECF Nos . 1, 8.  Given this, Plaintiff’s claims clearly fall within the scope of the MSA’s \narbitration provision.   Case 1:23-cv-01822-LKG   Document 48   Filed 10/23/24   Page 11 of 1312 \n The Court observes as a final matter that  the Plaintiff’s arguments to show t hat the MSA \nand its arbitration provision are invalid and unenforceable are unpersuasive.  In this regard, t he \nPlaintiff first argues that Microsoft is “falsely manipulat[ing] the civil process in hopes of \ngaining favor,” “attempt[ing] to mislead the [C]ourt . . . by falsely putting new arbitration \nagreements in place after” he filed the complaint.  ECF No. 42 at 2.  But, he puts forward no \nevidence to show that Microsoft has engaged in any fraudulent conduc t with regards to the MSA, \nor the specific claims in this case.  See generally  ECF Nos. 1,  5, 7, 8, 19, 42.  The Plaintiff’s \nargument that his assault claim is not subject to arbitration is also contradicted by a plain reading \nof the complaint and the MSA , because the complaint makes clear that this  claim arises out of \nthe Plaintiff’s  use of Microsoft’s Bing and Microsoft Copilot services.  ECF No. 42 at 3, 6- 7.  \nLastly, t he Plaintiff’s argument that Microsoft has waived the right to enforce the parties’ \narbitration agreement is equally unavailing.  The Plaintiff contends that Microsoft has waived the \nright to arbitrate this dispute, because Microsoft “changed [its] position” and waived the right to \narbitrate this dispute, during the course of his communications with the company in an attempt to \ninformally resolve this dispute.  ECF No. 42 at 4- 6.  But the communications described by the \nPlaintiff neither show that Microsoft acted inconsistent with its right to arbitrate this dispute, nor \nthat Microsoft waived the requirements of the MSA’s arbitration provision.  See Ford v. UHG I \nLLC, 2023 WL 2185751, at *6 (D. Md. Feb. 23, 2023) (holding that a defendant “must (1) know \nof an existing right to arbitration; and (2) act inconsistently with that right,” to waive the right to enforce and arbitration agreement.  \nIn sum, the unrebutted evidence before the Court shows that the parties entered into a \nvalid and enforceable arbitration agreement with regards to the Plaintiff’s Microsoft account, and \nthat this agreement  requires that the Plaintiff arbitrate his claims in this action.  For this reason, \nthe Court must GRANT Microsoft’s motion to compel arbitration.  \nB. The Court Will Stay This Matter  \nHaving determined that the Plaintiff must arbitrate his claims, the Court next  considers \nwhether to stay or dismiss this matter.  The Fourth Circuit has held that , when an arbitration \nagreement is valid and enforceable, the Court must “stay ‘any suit or proceeding’ pending arbitration of ‘any issue referable to arbitration.’”  Adkins v Lab. Ready, Inc., 303 F.3d 496, 500 \n(4th Cir. 2002).  The Fourth Circuit has also recently held that the Court must stay a case Case 1:23-cv-01822-LKG   Document 48   Filed 10/23/24   Page 12 of 1313 \n pending arbitration, when the case involves an arbitrable dispute and the party opposing a motion \nto compel arbitration requests a stay of the case if  the case is  sent to arbitration.  See S mith v. \nSpizzirri , 601 U.S. 472, 475-76 (2024); SZY Holds., LLC v. Garcia, 2024 WL 3983944, at *2 \n(4th Cir. Aug. 29, 2024) (quoting Henry Schein, Inc. v. Archer & White Sales, Inc. , 586 U.S. 63, \n69 (2019) (“Section 3 of the FAA provides that a court must stay litigation upon being satisfied that the issue is referable to arbitration under the agreement,’ so long as ‘the applicant for the \nstay is not in default in proceeding with suc h arbitration.’”).  Because the Plaintiff’s claims here \nare subject to arbitration, the Court STAYS this matter , pending the resolution of the partie s’ \narbitration.\n4 \nV. CONCLUSION  \nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court: \n(1) GRANTS  Microsoft’s  motion to compel arbitration (ECF No. 40); \n(2) STAYS  this matter, pending the resolution of the parties’ arbitration; and \n(3) DENIES -AS-MOOT  the Plaintiff’s motion for injunction (ECF No. 35) ;  \nA separate Order shall issue.  \n \nIT IS SO ORDERED.  \n s/Lydia Kay Griggsby                        \nLYDIA KAY GRIGGSBY \nUnited States District Judge  \n \n \n4 Because the Court has determined that the Plaintiff’s  claims are subject to arbitration, the Court denies \nhis motion for injunction as moot.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**:\n   The court case involved the Association of American Universities and other institutions challenging the National Science Foundation's (NSF) policy capping the reimbursement of indirect costs at 15% for grants awarded to Institutions of Higher Education (IHEs). The plaintiffs argued that this policy was unlawful as it undermined existing negotiated indirect cost rates that are often significantly higher than 15% and was arbitrary and capricious. The court sided with the plaintiffs, vacating the policy.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: The main legal issue was whether the NSF's implementation of a 15% cap on indirect cost rates for new grants was lawful under existing statutes and regulations governing federal research grants.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court held that NSF's 15% Indirect Cost Rate policy was arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law. The court granted summary judgment in favor of the plaintiffs, vacating the policy and declaring it invalid.\n\n4. **ELI5 (Explain Like I'm 5)**: Imagine you have a job babysitting where you agree to spend your paycheck on specific toys and snacks for the kids. Then someone suddenly tells you that you can't spend more than a very small limit on snacks, which makes it hard to buy enough snacks. The court told that someone they couldn't just change the rules like that because it wasn't fair or sensible under the agreed terms.",

For the reasons set forth below, Plaintiffs ’ request for Summary Judgment is GRANTED , \nDefendants’ Motion for Summary Judgment is DENIED , and Plaintiffs’  request for a \nPreliminary Injunction is DENIED as moot.  \nI. Background  \nA. The National Science Foundation and Grant -Supported Research  \nThe National Science Foundation Act of 1950, 42 U.S.C. §§ 1861, et seq. (“NSF Act”), \nestablished the National Science Foundation (“NSF”) . Congress has authorized and directed \nNSF: \nto initiate and support basic scientific research  and programs to strengthen scientific \nresearch potential and science education programs  at all levels in the mathematical, \nphysical, medical, biological, social, and other sciences , and to initiate and support \nresearch fundamental to the engineering process ” and programs to strengthen such \nresearch , by making contracts or other arrangements (including grants . . . ) to \nsupport such scientific, engineering, and educational activities  . . .  \n42 U.S.C. § 1862(a)(1). Congress has also specifically authorized NSF “ to initiate and support \nscientific and engineering research  . . . at academic . . . institutions. ” Id. § 1862( c). Almost \nseventy years later , Congress reaffirmed the essential nature of federal research grants , including \n“the sense of Congress that  . . . sustained, predictable Federal funding of basic research is \nessential to United States leadership in science and technology[ .]” American Innovation and \nCompetitiveness Act, Pub. L. No. 114- 329, § 101(a)(1) 130 Stat. 2969, 2970 (2017) . \n Under the NSF Act , NSF has statutory authority “ to enter into contracts or other \narrangements, or modifications thereof, for the carrying on, by organizations or individuals in the \nUnited States and foreign countries, . . . of such scientific or engineering activities as [NSF] deems necessary to carry out the purposes of this chapter [.]” 42 U.S.C. § 1870(c). Further, “[i]n \nmaking contracts or other arrangements for scientific or engineering research,” Congress has directed NSF to:  Case 1:25-cv-11231-IT     Document 77     Filed 06/20/25     Page 2 of 523 \n utilize appropriations available therefor in such manner as will in its discretion best \nrealize the objectives of (1) having the work performed by organizations, agencies, and institutions, or individuals in the United States or foreign countries, including Government agencies of the United States and of foreign countries, qualified by training and experience to achieve the results desired, (2) strengthening the research staff of organizations, particularly nonprofit organizations, in the United States, (3)  \nadding institutions, agencies, or organizations which, if aided, will advance scientific or engineering research, and (4) encouraging independent scientific or engineering research by individuals.  \n42 U.S.C. § 1873(e).  \nB. Statutory Provisions Related to Public Contracts  \n The relevant statutory scheme also includes a general ly-applicable  provision related to \npublic contracts, codified at Title 41 of the United States Code. Under 41 U.S.C. § 4708, “ [a] \ncost-type research and development contract (including a grant) with a university, college, or \nother educational institution may provide for payment of reimbursable indirect costs on the basis \nof predetermined fixed -percentage rates applied to the total o f the reimbursable direct costs \nincurred or to an element of the total of  the reimbursable direct costs incurred. ” \n According to the Senate Report accompanying the proposed legislation, the bill allow ed \nindirect cost rates to be set in advance as estimates of future costs , as had been the practice prior \nto a 1956 decision of the Comptroller General, rather than be retroactively adjusted after the fact \nbased on actual costs , as had been the practice following that decision. S. Rep. No. 87- 1826, at 1  \n(1962) .   \nC. The Regulatory Schem e for Federal Grants  \nUnder regulations promulgated by the Office of Management and Budget (“OMB”), \nagencies initiate a competitive grantmaking process by issuing a notice of funding opportunity (“NOFO”)  for a specific research program. See 2 C.F.R. § 200.204. The agency receives \napplications for a period specified in the NOFO , which is typically at least 60 days. Id. \n§ 200.204(b). The agency then conducts a “merit review process” to select grant recipients who Case 1:25-cv-11231-IT     Document 77     Filed 06/20/25     Page 3 of 524 \n are “most likely to be successful in delivering results based on the program objectives  . . . .” Id. \n§ 200.205. After an agency selects a grant recipient, it issues a Notice of Award (“NOA”)  \nindicating the amount of funds awarded to the recipient. Id.  § 200.211(c)(1)(iv).  \nThe regulations provide for detailed cost accounting for grants. S ee 2 C.F.R. P t. 200, \nApp. III (“Indirect (F & A) Costs Identification and Assignment, and Rate Determination f or \nInstitutions Of Higher Education (IHEs)”) (“Appendix III to Part 200”); 2 C.F.R. §§ 200.1, \n200.414, 200.501(b), 200.504, 200.514. The regulations provide for two categories of costs: “allowable direct and allocable indirect costs [.]” 2 C.F.R. § 200.402.  \nDirect costs are those “that can be identified specifically with a particular final cost \nobjective, such as a Federal award . . . or that can be directly assigned to such activities relatively easily with a high degree of accuracy.” 200 C.F.R. § 200.413(a). Indirect cost s are those \n“incurred for a common or joint purpose benefit ting more than one cost objective and not readily \nassignable ” to a specific project.  2 C.F.R. § 200.1.  Indirect costs must be designated as either \n“facilities” or “administration .” 2 C.F.R. § 200.414. “‘ Facilities ’ is defined as depreciation on \nbuildings, equipment and capital improvements, interest on debt associated with certain buildings, equipment and capital improvements, and operations and maintenance expenses. ” Id. \n“‘Administration ’ is defined as general administration and general expenses such as the \ndirector ’s office, accounting, personnel, and all other types of expenditures not listed speci fically \nunder one of the subcategories of ‘ Facilities .’” Id. Whether direct or indirect, to be reimbursed, \ncosts must “[b]e necessary and reasonable for the performance of the Federal award” and must be adequately documented. 2 C.F.R. § 200.403. \n“The total cost of a [f]ederal award is the sum of the allowable direct and allocable \nindirect costs minus any applicable credits .” See 2 C.F.R. § 200.402. Generally, an institution  Case 1:25-cv-11231-IT     Document 77     Filed 06/20/25     Page 4 of 525 \n negotiate s a pre-determined  indirect cost rate with a federal agency . 2 C.F.R. Pt. 200, App. III  \n(C)(4) ( “[N]egotiation of predetermined rates for indirect (F & A) costs for a period of two to \nfour years should be the norm . . . where the cost experience and other pertinent facts available \nare deemed sufficient to enable the parties involved to reach an informed judgment as to the probable level of indirect (F & A) costs during the ensuing accounting periods.”)  Federal \nregulations prescribe procedures and methodology for negotiating and determining the indirect cost rate.  See generally  2 C.F.R. Pt. 200, App. III (C). An IHE negotiate s its indirect cost rate \nwith the Department of Health and Human Services ( “HHS ”) or the Department of Defense’ s \n(“DOD”) Office of Naval Research  (“ONR”) , normally depending on which of the two agencies \nhas provide d more funds directly to the educational institution for the most recent three years. 2 \nC.F.R. Pt. 200, App. III (C)(11)(a)(1).  Where neither HHS nor ONR  provides f ederal funding \ndirectly to an IHE, the cognizant agency for indirect costs assignment to that IHE  default s to \nHHS.  Id. IHEs do not negotiate indirect cost rates with NSF. \nNegotiated rates are effective for a specified period, often (but not always) between two \nand four years. See 2 C.F.R. Pt. 200, App. III  (C)(4). E ntities  that expend more than $1,000,000 \nin federal awards  must be audited. 2 C.F.R. §§ 200.501, 200.504, 200.514. An institution’s  \ncovered  indirect  costs  may be adjusted if an audit indicates that an institution has received \nfunding in excess of its actual costs. See 2 C.F.R. Pt. 200, App. III (C)(11)(d) (“ The cognizant \nagency for indirect costs must conduct any necessary negotiations with an educational institution regarding amounts questioned by audit that are due the Federal government related to costs covered by a negotiated agreement.”) . \nWhere an indirect cost rate has not been negotiated, an IHE may elect to cover indirect \ncosts by charging a de minimis  indirect cost rate of up to 15% . 2 C.F.R. § 200.414(f). The de Case 1:25-cv-11231-IT     Document 77     Filed 06/20/25     Page 5 of 526 \n minim is rate does not require documentation by the IHE to justify the costs. Id.  Use of a de \nminimis rate for indirect costs is at the election of the IHE , and f ederal agencies “ may not require \nrecipients . . . to use a de minimis  rate lower than the negotiated indirect cost rate . . . unless \nrequired by Federal statute or regulation.” Id. \nThe regulations detail federal agency acceptance of negotiated cost rates. See 2 C.F.R. § \n200.414(c). Subsection (c)(1) provides first that “[n]egotiated indirect cost rates must  be \naccepted by all Federal agencies. ” (Emphasis added ). The regulation then allows federal agencies \ncertain deviations from the accepted, negotiated rates “ for either a class of Federal awards or a \nsingle Federal award ” in two circumstances: when a different rate is required by f ederal statute \nor regulation, or when the awarding f ederal agency approve s a different rate  in accordance with \nspecific procedures , see i d., as discussed in detail below.  \nD. NSF Awards  \nThe grant review process at NSF typically takes six months for technical review plus one \nmonth for final administrative review. Coughlin- Piester Decl. ¶  8 [Doc. No. 61]. Over 80% of \nNSF research grants are awarded to IHEs and about 5% are awarded to other nonprofit \norganizations. See id. ¶ 6 [Doc. No. 61] (stating NSF awarded approximately 9,400 of 11,000 \ncompetitive new and renewal grant awards to IHEs); Nat’l Ctr. for Sci. & Eng’g Statistics, Survey of Federal Funds for Research and Development (2023- 2024), Table 7, \nhttps://ncses.nsf.gov/surveys/federal -funds -research -development/2023- 2024# tableCtr13393 \n(last accessed June 20, 2025) .\n2 In Fiscal Year 2024, the average approval rate for grant proposals \n \n \n2 About 7% of funds are awarded to businesses, and less than 1% to state and local governments \nand non- U.S. performers. A pproximately 6% of funds are awarded to federal agencies and \nfederally -funded research and development centers. Id. Case 1:25-cv-11231-IT     Document 77     Filed 06/20/25     Page 6 of 527 \n from Institutions of Higher Education (“IHE”)3 was 27%. Coughlin- Piester Decl. ¶  9. [Doc. No. \n61] \nNSF grant recipients generally do not receive lump sum funding. Instead, recipients first \nincur expenses and then, using cost -based accounting systems , recover their actual, documented \ncosts for conducting research. See id. ¶ 10 (explaining NSF grants “ reimburse . . . costs on an as -\nneeded basis based on costs a grantee incurs or expects to incur during a given period”). \nGenerally, NSF has paid indirect costs in grants to IHEs based on indirect cost rates that those institutions negotiate with ONR or HHS. See id. ¶  13; 2 C.F.R. Pt. 200, App. III (C)(11)(a)(1).  \nE. Plaintiffs and Member Institutions’  Federally- Funded Research  \nPlaintiffs are the Association of American Universities (“AAU”), the Association of \nPublic and Land -Grant Universities (“APLU”), the American Council on Education (“ACE ”) \n(collectively “Organizational Plaintiffs”), and 13 research universities: Arizona Board of Regents on behalf of Arizona State University (“A rizona S tate”), Brown University (“Brown”), \nCalifornia Institute of Technology (“Caltech”), The Regents of the University of California (“UC”), Carnegie Mellon University (“ Carnegie Mellon ”), Universit y of Chicago (“UChicago”), \nCornell University (“Cornell”), Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois (“ Illinois ”), \nMassachusetts Institute of Technology (“MIT”), Regents of the University of Michigan (“Michigan”), Regents of the University of Minnesota (“Minnesota”), Trustees of the University of Pennsylvania (“Penn”), and T he Trustees of Princeton University (“Princeton”)  (collectively \n“University Plaintiffs”).  \n \n \n3 Institutions of Higher Education are de fined at 2 C.F.R. § 200.1, with a reference to 20 U.S.C. \n1001.

NSF’s Indirect Cost Policies and the Policy Notice  \nNSF has included on its website its “Indirect Cost Rate Policies” explaining indirect \ncosts. See NSF’s Indirect Cost Rate Policies [Doc. No. 40- 42]. The website explains that indirect \ncosts are “those costs which are not readily identifiable with a particular cost objective . . . but \nnevertheless are necessary for the general operation of an organization.” Id. at 3–4. The website \nexplains further that “[o]rganizations generally charge indirect costs to federal awards by developing and applying an indirect c ost rate, which is used consistently across an organization’s \nawards.” Id. at 4. The website states further that “[a] predetermined indirect cost rate is a fixed \nrate established for a future fiscal period, based on the actual costs from a representative prior period.” Id. at 5. \nAdditionally , NSF’s Proposal and Award Policies and Procedures Guide  specifies that “it \nis NSF policy that recipients are entitled to reimbursement from award funds for indirect costs ,” \nwhich is “ generally based upon a recipient’s current Federally negotiated indirect cost rate \nagreement.” NSF, Proposal and Award Policies and Procedures Guide X -5 (effective May 20, \n2024), https://nsfgov- resources.nsf.gov/files/nsf24_1.pdf ?

Case 1:25-cv-11231-IT     Document 77     Filed 06/20/25     Page 11 of 5212 \n On May 2, 2025, NSF issued its Policy Notice: Implementation of Standard 15% Indirect \nCost Rate , NSF 25 -034.4 The Policy Notice’s subject is: “Adoption of Standard 15% Indirect \nCost Rate for NSF Grants and Cooperative Agreements awarded to Institutions of Higher \nEducation (IHEs).” Id. at 1. The Policy Notice states  that a 15 % cap on indirect costs w ill apply \nto new awards made to IHEs on or after May 5, 2025. Id.  The Policy Notice also assert s that \nNOFOs NSF issues after the effective date w ill include notice of the 15%  cap on indirect cost \nrates. Id. \nThe Policy Notice acknowledge s that the 15% Indirect Cost Rate  is a change to NSF’s \npolicy regarding reimbursement of indirect costs, and state s that the change “is intended to \nstreamline funding practices, increase transparency, and ensure that more resources are directed toward direct scientific and engineering research activities.” Id. at 2. The Policy Notice state s \nthat it “serves as public notification of the policies, procedures and general decision- making \ncriteria that NSF has used to justify deviati on from negotiated rates for all awards[.]” Id. at 2. As \nthe rationale for the deviation, the Policy Notice state s that the 15% Indirect Cost Rate  supports \nNSF’s commitment to efficiency, consistency, and effectiveness. Id. at 2. \nII. Procedural History  \nPlaintiffs filed this action against the NSF and its Acting Director Brian Stone on May 5, \n2025, challenging the Policy Notice and the 15% Indirect Cost Rate  under the APA.  See Compl. \n \n \n4 See https://www.nsf.gov/policies/document/indirect -cost-rate (accessed May 6, 2025, at 3:59 \np.m.). Plaintiffs state that a copy of this Policy Notice is attached as Exhibit A to the Complaint , \nsee Compl. ¶ 8 [Doc. No. 1], but the Complaint includes no Exhibit A. Defendants state that \nExhibit 1 to the Declaration of Janis Coughlin- Piester  [Doc. No. 61] is a true and correct copy of \nthe May 2, 2025 Policy Notice, s ee [Doc. No. 61 -1]. That version appears to have been accessed \nfrom the website on May 27, 2025, after the policy was stayed in connection with this lawsuit . \nSee id. at 1 ( noting that “NSF is temporarily pa using implementation of the [Policy Notice]” ).  Case 1:25-cv-11231-IT     Document 77     Filed 06/20/25     Page 12 of 5213 \n ¶¶ 72–105 [Doc. No. 1]. Specifically, Plaintiffs allege that the 15% Indirect Cost Rate  violates \nauthorizing statutes (Count I), departs from negotiated indirect cost rates in violation of 2 C.F.R. \n§ 200.414 (Count II), departs from cost recovery regulations (Count III), and is arbitrary and capricious (Count IV). Id. On May 8, Plaintiffs filed a combined Motion for a Preliminary \nInjunction and for Summary Judgment  [Doc. No. 40] supported by declarations from \nrepresentatives of the Organizational Plaintiffs  and their members,  and from the University \nPlaintiffs.  \nDefendants subsequently filed their own Motion for Summary Judgment  [Doc. No. 60] , \narguing that Plaintiffs have not demonstrated standing to sue, that this court lacks jurisdiction because NSF’s grant -related decisions are committed to agency discretion by law and are not \nreviewable under the APA, and that the 15% Indirect Cost Rate  is authorized by statute and \nsupported by reasoned explanation. Defendants’ Motion is supported by a declaration from the \nNSF’s Chief Financial Officer and Head of the Office of  Budget, Finance, and Award \nManagement . \nDefendants have agreed to voluntar ily stay  implementation of the 15% Indirect Cost Rate  \nthrough June 20, 2025. See Defs. ’ Notice [Doc. No. 50]; Mem. ISO Defs.’ Mot. 42 n.30 [Doc. \nNo. 62].  \nIII. Standard of Review  \nIn the administrative law context, a motion for summary judgment is “ simply a vehicle to \ntee up a case for judicial review .” Bos. Redevelopment Auth. v. Nat ’l Park Serv. , 838 F.3d 42, \n47 (1st Cir. 2016) . Therefore, “ an inquiring court must review an agency action not to determine \nwhether a dispute of fact remains but, rather, to determine whether the agency action was arbitrary and capricious ” or otherwise unlawful. Id.; see Associated Fisheries of Maine, Inc. v. \nDaley , 127 F.3d 104, 109  (1st Cir. 1997)  (explaining court’s task on summary judgment in Case 1:25-cv-11231-IT     Document 77     Filed 06/20/25     Page 13 of 5214 \n administrative law context “is only to determine” whether agency’s action was “consonant with \n[its] statutory powers, reasoned, and supported by substantial evidence in the record”).  \nIV. Discussion  \nA. Jurisdiction  \n1. Standing \nDefendant s argue that Plaintiffs lack standing because they have not established that any \nPlaintiff has suffered an injury in fact. Mem. ISO Defs.’ Mot. 12 [Doc. No. 62]. Defendants \ncontend that because the 15% Indirect Cost Rate  applies only to new awards, any injury \nPlaintiffs can identify stems from potentially being offered a grant award at the 15%  indirect cost \nrate (which they would have discretion to accept or reject), submitting proposals at that rate in the future, or deciding not to submit grant proposals at that rate. Id. at 13. Defendants assert that \nclaims concerning hypothetical, future grants that Plaintiffs may or may not receive constitute \ngeneralized grievances about NSF’s policy, which are not sufficient to confer standing. Id. \nThe doctrine of standing is rooted in Article III of the Constitution, which confines \nfederal courts to the adjudication of actual “cases” and “controversies.” See  U.S. Const. a rt. III, § \n2, cl. 1; TransUnion LLC v. Ramirez , 594 U.S. 413, 423 (2021) . “For a legal dispute to qualify \nas a genuine case or controversy, at least one plaintiff must have standing to sue.” Dep ’t of Com. \nv. New York , 588 U.S. 752, 766 (2019) .  \nEstablish ing standing requires a showing that a plaintiff “ has suffered, or will suffer, an \ninjury that is ‘[1] concrete, particularized, and actual or imminent; [2] fairly traceable to the challenged action; and [3] redressable by a favorable ruling.’ ” Murthy v. Missouri , 603 U.S. 43, \n57 (2024)  (quoting Clapper v. Amnesty Int ’l USA, 568 U.S. 398, 409 (2013) ).  \n“[A]n association may have standing solely as the representative of its members even in \nthe absence of injury to itself [.]” Camel Hair & Cashmere Inst. of Am., Inc. v. Associated Dry Case 1:25-cv-11231-IT     Document 77     Filed 06/20/25     Page 14 of 5215 \n Goods Corp., 799 F.2d 6,  10 (1st Cir. 1986) . “[A] n association has standing to bring suit on \nbehalf of its members when: (a) its members would otherwise have standing to sue in their own \nright; (b) the interests it seeks to protect are germane to the organization ’s purpose; and (c) \nneither the claim asserted nor the relief requested requires the participation of individual members in the lawsuit. ” Hunt v. Washington State Apple Advert. Comm ’n, 432 U.S. 333, 343 \n(1977) ; see also  Warth v. Seldin , 422 U.S. 490, 511 (1975) (“The association must allege that its \nmembers, or any one of them, are suffering immediate or threatened injury as a result of the challenged action of the sort that would make out a justiciable case had the members themselves brought suit.” ). \nWhether an association has standing to sue  on behalf of its members “ depends in \nsubstantial measure on the nature of the relief sought.”  Int’l Union, United Auto., Aerospace & \nAgr. Implement Workers of Am. v. Brock, 477 U.S. 274, 287 (1986)  (quoting Warth , 422 U.S. at  \n515). Actions seeking  prospective relief are generally “ particularly suited to group \nrepresentation .” Camel Hair & Cashmere Inst. , 799 F.2d at 12.  \nTo establish the first element of standing, an injury- in-fact, a plaintiff must demonstrate \n“an invasion of a legally protected interest” that is “not conjectural or hypothetical.” Lujan  v. \nDefenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560 (1992) . “[A] person exposed to a risk of future harm \nmay pursue forward -looking, injunctive relief to prevent the harm from occurring, at least so \nlong as the risk of harm is sufficiently imminent and substantial .” TransUnion, 594 U.S. at 435.  \nHere, P laintiffs have  sufficiently  demonstrated that University Plaintiffs  and the \nOrganizational Plaintiffs have standing based on an imminent and substantial future injury to \nIHEs . Qualifying for less federal funding is a “future injur[y]” that is sufficient to confer \nstanding where “t he threatened injury is certainly impending, or there is a substantial risk that the Case 1:25-cv-11231-IT     Document 77     Filed 06/20/25     Page 15 of 5216 \n harm will occur .” Dep ’t of Com ., 588 U.S. at 767; accord  New Jersey v. Trump, 131 F.4th 27, 37 \n(1st Cir. 2025) ; cf. Sherley v. Sebelius , 610 F.3d 69, 74 (D.C. Cir. 2010)  (concluding plaintiffs \nhad standing where agency action increased competition for federal grants such that plaintiffs \n“face[d] a substantial enough probability [of losing funding] to deem the injury to them \nimminent”) . Under the 15% Indirect Cost Rate , Organizational Plaintiffs  and member \ninstitutions , including the University Plaintiffs, w ill have to cover a significant portion of their \nindirect costs for NSF research  despite ONR  and HHS’s recognition of thos e actual,  indirect \ncosts, as reflected in the negotiated indirect  cost rates. Defendants  provide an example that  \nillustrates: If NSF awards $100 in direct costs to an institution with whom ONR  or HHS has \nnegotiated a 30 % indirect cost rate, the total award is $130. Mem. ISO Defs.’ Mot. 29 [Doc. No. \n62]. But if NSF caps  the indirect cost rate at 15 %, the institution can only receive $15 in indirect \ncosts  from the same grant award , for a total award of $115, with the institution responsible for \ncovering the remaining $15. See id. \nPlaintiffs  have also demonstrated that this  injury is sufficiently imminent. Even though \nthe 15% Indirect Cost Rate  only c uts indirect costs as to future grants that NSF has not yet \nawarded , any IHE that has negotiated an indirect cost rate with HHS or ONR  above 15% \nbecomes eligible  for less federal funding if NSF implements  the 15% Indirect Cost Rate .  \nNor is  it merely hypothetical that at least some University Plaintiffs and members of the \nOrganizational Plaintiffs institutions will receive less indirect cost funding from NSF under the 15% Indirect Cost Rate . Although no university is guaranteed to receive any grant award for \nwhich it applies, some University Plaintiffs (who are also members of the Organizational Plaintiffs ) each have dozens of proposals pending, and NSFs average approval rate for grant \nproposals from IHEs was 27% . Coughlin- Piester Decl.  ¶ 9 [Doc. No. 61]. Such institutions are Case 1:25-cv-11231-IT     Document 77     Filed 06/20/25     Page 16 of 5217 \n highly likely to receive at least a portion of the awards for which they have applied. Further, \nwhere members of the Organizational Plaintiffs received approximately $14.4 billion in awards in 2023, and where IHEs have received 80% of grants historically, the suggestion that no University Plaintiff or member of an Organizational Plaintiff would be awarded any grant  in the \nfuture is fanciful. Indeed, Defendants themselves point out that “[r]eview of awards from 2024 \ncan illustrate the impact of the policy on  future awards . . . . If indirect  costs had been limited to \n15% for IHEs in FY24, then, at the time of award, the budgeted indirect costs would have been $432,298,644 less.” Id. ¶ 18. Given the magnitude of awards to members of the Organizational \nPlaintiffs, it is highly likely that some members would be among the institutions affected.  \nFurther , Plaintiffs have demonstrated that the 15% Indirect Cost Rate  will cause  a host of \nadditional injuries, beginning with a disruption to ongoing research. Although the 15% Indirect Cost Rate  does not affect existing or continuing grant awards, Plaintiffs and member institutions \ncollectively have thousands of proposals pending before NSF, which they submitted in reliance on their negotiated indirect cost rates.

These grants are forthcoming to IHEs because, unless the \nDOE intends to stop funding this type of research, they must be. The [15% Indirect \nCost Rate]  itself manife sts an intent on the [agency’s]  part to continue funding \nIHEs; all that has changed is that the [agency]  now wants IHEs to foot more of the \nbill, without regard to the individual circumstances and overhead costs of each IHE, which Plaintiffs have adequately established they cannot do.  \nDep’t of E nergy, 2025 WL 1414135, at *19. Here, Plaintiffs and member institutions have \nlongstanding funding relationships with NSF, and the agency has long accepted their negotiated \nindirect cost rates. IHEs have made long -term financial commitments, developed research \ninfrastructure, a nd engaged in multi -year budgeting processes in reliance on that relationship. \nSee, e.g., Caltech Decl. ¶  17 [Doc. No. 40- 8]; Dartmouth Decl. ¶  10 [Doc. No. 40- 15]; Florida \nDecl. ¶  17 [Doc. No. 40 -16]; UIC Decl. ¶  18 [ Doc. No. 40- 17]; Michigan Decl. ¶  16 [Doc. No. \n40-20]; UNR Decl. ¶  17 [Doc. No. 40- 22]; UNH Decl. ¶  16 [Doc. No. 40- 23]. Given that NSF \nhas long accepted IHEs’ negotiated indirect cost rates, it is reasonable for Plaintiffs and member institutions to rely on that policy in research planning and development. And because those institutions have developed infrastructure to support NSF res earch, they can expect to receive \nNSF funding in the future, even if they are not guaranteed a particular award.  \nNor are Plaintiffs’ injuries merely “downstream consequences ” of the 15% Indirect Cost \nRate. See Mem. ISO Defs.’ Mot . 38 [Doc. No. 62]. Instead, the lost opportunities and disruption \noccurs with the implementation of the 15% Indirect Cost Rate. Plaintiffs have thus demonstrated irreparable harm without an adequate remedy at law.   \nPlaintiffs have also shown that the balance of hardships and the public interest weigh in \nfavor of awarding equitable relief. Plaintiffs and member institutions engage in research aimed at improving human health and quality of life in addition to advancing this country’s energy, Case 1:25-cv-11231-IT     Document 77     Filed 06/20/25     Page 48 of 5249 \n economic, and national security. See, e.g. , AAU Decl. ¶  4 [Doc. No. 40 -1]; ACE Decl. ¶  7 [Doc. \nNo. 40- 2]; APLU Decl. ¶  6 [Doc. No. 40- 3]. Whatever the Executive’s views may be about what  \nsort of research advances the United States’ economic or national security interests, Defendants \ndo not suggest that diminishing or discontinuing NSF -funded research at IHEs is in the public \ninterest, particularly where the 15% Indirect Cost Rate’s stated  goals to “[i]ncreas[e] the \nproportion of federal funds allocated to direct research costs” and allow “NSF and its awardees to focus more on scientific progress [.]” NSF Policy Notice: Implementation of Standard 15% \nIndirect Cost Rate , NSF 25 -034. And where IHEs —through their NSF -funded research —impact \ntheir local and regional communities via employment and innovation that attracts additional spending and investment, halting or disrupting such research will have negative impacts on those communities. See, e.g. , APLU Decl. ¶  14 [Doc. No. 40- 3]; UC Decl. ¶  15 [Doc. No. 40- 7]; \nMinnesota Decl. ¶  19 [Doc. No. 40- 21]; Vanderbilt Decl. ¶  17 [Doc. No. 40- 37].  \nDefendants argue that injunctive relief is not in the public interest where an injunction \nwould force the United States to pay out funds that it may not be able to recover. Mem. ISO Defs.’ Mot. 42 [Doc. No. 62]. Defendants cite Department of Education v. California , which \nconcerned a temporary restraining order enjoining the government from terminating grants and requiring it to pay out past -due grant obligations. 604 U.S. __, 145 S. Ct. 966, 968 (2025) . In \ncontrast, where the court’s determination is a fin al judgment, not a preliminary injunction, and \nwhere NSF has not terminated or reduced the amount of any existing or continuing grants, equitable relief merely prevents NSF from continuing an unlawful policy. “T here is generally no \npublic interest in the perpetuation of unlawful agency action.” League of Women Voters of \nUnited States v. Newby, 838 F.3d 1, 12 (D.C. Cir. 2016) . Relatedly, “[i] t is well established that \nthe Government ‘ cannot suffer harm from an injunction that merely ends an unlawful practice.’” Case 1:25-cv-11231-IT     Document 77     Filed 06/20/25     Page 49 of 5250 \n See C.G.B. v. Wolf , 464 F. Supp. 3d 174, 218 (D.D.C. 2020)  (quoting Open Cmties. Alliance v. \nCarson , 286 F. Supp. 3d 148, 179 (D.D.C. 2017) ). Accordingly, the public interest and balance \nof hardships favor equitable relief.  \nMoreover, nationwide relief is necessary. Associations may pursue relief that “will inure \nto the benefit of those members of the association actually injured[ .]”Int’l Union, United Auto., \nAerospace & Agr. Implement Workers of Am. v. Brock, 477 U.S. 274, 288 (1986)  (quoting \nWarth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 515 (1975) ). Where two of the Organizational Plaintiffs represent \ninstitutions in every state, APLU Decl. ¶ ¶ 3, 5 [Doc. No. 40- 3]; ACE Decl. ¶  3 [Doc. No. 40 -2], \nnationwide relief is necessary to prevent mem ber institutions from suffering harm. Relatedly, \nwhere Plaintiffs and member institutions are dispersed throughout the United States, nationwide \nrelief avoids the “‘ chaos and confusion’ of a patchwork of [relief],” which impacts NSF as well \nas IHEs. See NIH , 770 F. Supp. 3d at 327 (quoting Florida v. Dep’ t of Health & Hum. Servs., 19 \nF.4th 1271, 1281–82 (11th Cir. 2021) ); id. at 328–29 (explaining a “ patchwork of injunctions \nwould cause administrability problems, not only for the institutions relying on consistency to prevent the harm discussed above but also for NIH as it attempts to comply with varying injunctions across the country”) . \nNonetheless, Plaintiffs have not established that injunctive relief is necessary. “ An \ninjunction is a drastic and extraordinary remedy, which should not be granted as a matter of course. ” Monsanto, 561 U.S. 139 at  166 (citations omitted). “If a less drastic remedy (such as \npartial or complete . . . vacatur of [the agency’s ] decision) [is] sufficient to redress respondents’ \ninjury, no recourse to the additional and extraordinary relief of an injunction [is] warranted.” Id. \n165–66 (internal citations omitted) . Case 1:25-cv-11231-IT     Document 77     Filed 06/20/25     Page 50 of 5251 \n Here, vacatur of the 15% Indirect Cost Rate and a judgment declaring it unlawful will \nprovide the Plaintiffs complete relief.8 Where the 15% Indirect Cost Rate causes Plaintiffs to \nsuffer the harms described above, vacating the Policy redresses those injuries. See Action on \nSmoking & Health v. C.A.B., 713 F.2d 795, 797 (D.C. Cir. 1983) (“ To ‘vacate []’ . . . means ‘ to \nannul; to cancel or rescind; to declare, to make, or to render, void; to defeat; to deprive of force; \nto make of no authority or validity; to set aside.’”) (quoting 91 C.J.S. Vacate (1955) ). And \nbecause vacatur voids and rescinds the Policy itself, it provides nationwide relief that redresses injuries suffered by members of the Organizational Plaintiffs. Enjoining Defendants from implementing or enforcing a policy that has been vacated would be duplicative.  \nA declaratory judgment obviates the need to enjoin defendants from reimplementing a \nsubstantively identical policy where a declaratory judgment declares the rights and obligations of the parties and has “the force and effect of a final judgment or decree.” 28 U.S.C. § 2201( a); \nUnion de Empleados de Muelles de Puerto Rico, Inc. v. Int ’l Longshoremen’ s Ass’ n, 884 F.3d \n48, 58 (1st Cir. 2018)  (explaining purpose of declaratory judgment “ is to determine the rights \nand obligations of the parties so that they can act in accordance with the law ”). Indeed, \n“[b]ecause ‘[a] declaratory judgment is binding on the parties before the court and is res judicata \nin subsequent proceedings as to the matters declared,’  it can be used by a party to later obtain \nfurther relief. ” Id. (quoting Am. Airlines, Inc. v. Cardoza -Rodriguez , 133 F.3d 111, 122 n.11 (1st \nCir. 1998) ). To the extent Plaintiffs seek to ensure Defendants do not otherwise unlawfully \n \n \n8 To be clear, a permanent injunction would be warranted, if despite foregoing the argument \nhere, Defendants successfully contend on appeal that vacatur is not available under the APA. See  \nUnited States v. Texas , 599 U.S. 670, 693 (2023) (“The federal government vigorously disputes \n[that vacatur is available under the APA], arguing that the law does not contemplate this form of \nrelief. The reasons the government offers are plenty and serious enough to warrant car eful \nconsideration”) (Gorsuch, J. concurring).

If Defendants \nmodify negotiated indirect cost rates in a manner contrary to this court’s findings, the Declaratory Judgment and principles of res judicata will ensure that Plaintiffs “ will have ample \nopportunity to challenge [such an action] , and to seek appropriate preliminary relief .” Monsanto, \n561 U.S. at  164. \nV. Conclusion  \nFor the foregoing reasons, Plaintiffs’ Motion for a Preliminary Injunction and for \nSummary Judgment  [Doc.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: In \"United States v. Santos Rene Soto and Santos Moises Soto,\" the defendants, involved with AI company GoldenSpear and its subsidiary AI Health, were charged with multiple fraud schemes, including wire fraud and bank fraud, related to false representations about their companies. They attempted to dismiss or sever charges, arguing violations like duplicity (distinct offenses charged in a single count) and vagueness, and sought severance of certain counts for separate trials. The court mostly denied their motions except to strike vague language from one count, emphasizing that the charges could be construed as a single conspiracy related to AI and healthcare false claims.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the indictment's fraud-related charges are appropriately joined as part of a single conspiracy without being impermissibly duplicative or vague, and whether certain counts should be severed for trial fairness.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court denied most of the defendants' motions, upholding the indictment's structure as suitable for trial, save for striking unspecified \"among other things\" terms for lack of clarity, indicating possible reconsideration on severance closer to trial.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine two people run companies that make a big deal about developing cool AI tech for fashion and healthcare but are really just faking it to get money from investors and banks. They are caught and say the charges against them are unfair because they mix up different schemes and aren't clear enough. The judge mostly disagrees, saying the charges are fine to try together because it's all really one big fake scheme story, but does tell the government to be clearer on one part, and might let them re-address having separate trials later.",

Nos. 72, 73, 75, 76, 77, 79, 80, 83, \n86, 87, 89  \n \n \n Defendants Santos Rene Soto (“Santos Soto” or “father”) and Santos Moises “Saints” Soto \nIII (“Saints Soto” or “son\") bring three motions against the United States in their ongoing criminal \nwire fraud case.  They first move to dismiss Counts One and Two of  their indictment (the \n“Indictment”) because they believe these counts violate the Rule Against Duplicity  and are \nimpermissibly vague .  They also seek to strike the non -disclosure theory of fraud from Counts \nOne through Five of the Indictment on the basis that they are inadequately pleaded , and the \n“among other things” language in Count One for vagueness .  Finally, they seek to sever Counts \nSix and Seven from this case, as well as from each other, so that Santos Soto can provide \npotentially exculpatory testimony at Saints Soto’s trial.  \n The defendants ’ motions are DENIED , except for the motion to strike the “among other \nthings” language in Count One, which is GRANTED .  Their motion to dismiss claim fails because \nconspiracy charges are routinely found not to violate the Rule Against Duplicity.  The ir motion to \nstrike the non -disclosure theory of fraud similarly  fails, as the government provides enough facts \nin the Indictment to properly support their theory .  As for the motion to sever, I believe the record \nneeds to be further developed before deciding this matter.  I decline to sever the defendants’ \nclaims at this time but will reconsider this issue closer to trial .

Indictment (“Indict.”) [Dkt. No. 1] ¶ 1.  He is also the CEO of AI Health, “a \nsubsidiary of GoldenSpear that purports to be an AI technology company focused on healthcare \nand founded in approximately 2021.”  Id. ¶ 3.  Santos Soto is the father of Saints Soto and serves \non the board of directors for GoldenSpear.  Id. ¶ 2.  Both defendants hold “joint ownership of and \ncontrol over, and [are] signatories for,” bank accounts belonging to GoldenSpear and AI Health.  \nId. ¶¶ 4–5. \nThe government alleges that the Sotos conspired to defraud investors and banks by making \nfalse representations about their companies, resulting in three fraudulent events —the \n“GoldenSpear” incident, occurring from March 2017 to May 2019; the “AI Health” in cident, \noccurring from March 2021 to April 2022; and the “PPP loan” incident, occurring from April \n2020 to May 2020 (together, the “three schemes”).  See Indict. ¶¶ 34 –50. Counts One and Two of \nthe Indictment are related to all three schemes, while Counts Three through Seven are each only \nconnected to one of the three schemes.  See id.   The schem es as alleged in the Indictment are \nsummarized below.  \n1. The GoldenSpear Fraud  \nIn 2017, defendants told investors and potential investors that GoldenSpear was an “AI \ncompany with a focus on fashion and retail,” and that the company had created an “AI Fashion \nAssistant that used visual and textual algorithms to help retailers identify  specific fashion brands \nand types of clothing that potential customers might want to purchase .”  Id. ¶ 13 ( internal \nquotations omitted ).  To induce potential investors to finance GoldenSpear, Saints Soto allegedly \nmade misrepresentations that the company “entered into contracts with, had discussed investments \nfrom or acquisitions by, or was otherwise working with numerous established entities.”  Id. ¶ 14.  \nOne investor Saints Soto communicated with was “T.G.”  Id. ¶ 15.  In January 2018, Saints \nSoto told T.G. that “GoldenSpear was ‘selected’ by a prominent car manufacturer to power a \nglobal intelligent Dealership Network,” despite never having been selected to perform work for Case 3:22-cr-00378-WHO     Document 93     Filed 10/30/25     Page 2 of 23 \n3 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  the company.  Id. (cleaned up).  He also represented to T.G. that a “prominent financial firm” took \nGoldenSpear on a “roadshow” to meet with prominent technology companies, who offered to \ninvest in GoldenSpear.  Id. ¶ 16.  But the roadshow and offers were allegedly a lie made up by \nSaints Soto.  Id.  Influenced by these misrepresentations, T.G. invested approximately $300,000 in \nGoldenSpear between February 2018 and May 2019.  Id. ¶ 17.  \n2. The AI Health Fraud  \nWhen the COVID -19 pandemic exploded in March 2020, the “purported business model of \nGoldenSpear, which the defendants told investors involved brick -and-mortar stores, became \nuntenable.”  United States’ Opposition to Motions to Strike, Dismiss, and Sever (“ Oppo.”) [Dkt. \nNo. 83] at 6.  As a result, defendants “began to represent to potential investors that GoldenSpear \nwas moving from the fashion sector to the health sector.”  Indict. ¶ 18.  Such representations \nincluded that AI Health developed a “wearable de vice that, using artificial intelligence, could \ndetect the presence of the COVID -19 virus in the wearer of the device.”  Id. \nAround March 2021, Saints Soto sent to investor J.B. a presentation that stated AI Health \n“gifted” its technology to a high school in Los Angeles, California, despite never sending such \nitems.  Id. ¶ 19.  At the same time, Saints Soto told J.B. that a “prominent accounting and violation \nfirm had conducted a valuation of AI Health and . . . valued the company at more than $100 \nmillion.”  Id. (cleaned up).   He also represented that he was collaborating with a children’s \nhospital in Los Angeles to study patient health data in connection with the COVID -19 pandemic.  \nId.  Both of these claims were false.  Id.  Influenced by these misrepresentations, J.B. invested \napproximately $250,000 in AI Health in May 2021.   Id. ¶ 21.  \nSaints Soto made the same misrepresentations to potential investor E.C. in 2022, along \nwith new claims that AI Health entered a contract with a prominent medical device company to \nassist with a diabetes prevention study being conducted in Guam.  Id. ¶¶ 23 –24.  As a result, E.C. \ninvested approximately $2.67 million in AI Health.  Id. ¶ 25.  \n3. The PPP Loan Fraud  \nIn March 2020, Congress passed the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security \n(“CARES”) Act, which created an emergency loan system called the Paycheck Protection Case 3:22-cr-00378-WHO     Document 93     Filed 10/30/25     Page 3 of 23 \n4 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  Program (“PPP”).  Id. ¶ 7.  The PPP sought to provide $300 billion to “small businesses for job \nretention and certain other expenses” during the COVID -19 pandemic.  Id. ¶ 7.  To qualify for a \nPPP loan, businesses were required to submit a form application stating their (1) monthly payroll \nexpenses and (2) number of employees.  Id. ¶ 8.  Loans would then be calculated based on these \nnumbers, and proceeds were required to be spent on “certain permissible expenses,” including \n“payroll costs, interest on mortga ges, rent, and utilities.”  Id. ¶¶ 8, 11.  \nOn April 20, 2020, GoldenSpear applied for an PPP loan.  Id. ¶ 27.  On its application, \nGoldenSpear listed the person submitting the application as “Santos Soto.”1  Id. ¶ 28.  The form \nincluded Santos Soto’s email and home addresses but listed Saint s Soto’s social security number \nand birthdate.  Id. ¶¶ 28, 33.  In the application, defendants indicated that the monthly payroll for \nGoldenSpear was $267,899.16, and that GoldenSpear had thirty -three employees working in the \nUnited States.  Id. ¶ 29.  Defendants certified that the information they provided was true and \naccurate.  Id.  In reality, GoldenSpear only had seven or eight employees working in the United \nStates, and their average monthly payroll was between $57,000 to $67,000.  Id. ¶ 32.  Based on  the \nnumbers they provided, defendants received a loan for $669,700, which was later wired to the \nGoldenSpear bank account.  Id. ¶ 30. \nDefendants also stated in their application that the PPP loan would be used to pay \nGoldenSpear’s $18,000 per month commercial lease.  Id. ¶ 33.  However, the address the \ndefendants provided was Santos Sotos’ private residence; the loan was never used to pay for a \ncommercial lease.  Id.   \n    PROCEDURAL HISTORY  \nOn September 28, 2022, the United States filed the Indictment against defendants in the \nNorthern District of California, bringing seven charges against them: (1) Conspiracy, in violation \nof 18 U.S.C. § 371; (2) Wire Fraud Conspiracy, in violation of 18 U.S .C. § 1349; (3) Wire Fraud, \nin violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1343 (GoldenSpear fraud  with victim “T.G.”); (4) bank fraud under 18 \nU.S.C. § 1343 (AI Health fraud  with victim “J.B.”); (5) Wire Fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § \n \n1 Because both defendants have “Santos Soto” in their names —Santos Moises Soto III and Santos \nRenee Soto —the Indictment does not identify which defendant submitted the application.  Case 3:22-cr-00378-WHO     Document 93     Filed 10/30/25     Page 4 of 23 \n5 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  1343 (AI Health fraud  with victim “E.C.”); (6) Bank Fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1344(2) \n(PPP Fraud); and (7) False Statement on a Loan Application, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 10104 \n(PPP Fraud).  See Indict.  \nIn response to the Indictment, defendants filed three motions.  Saints Soto filed a motion \nseeking to dismiss Counts One and Two of the Indictment for violating the Rule of Duplicity, or, \nin the alternative, a motion requesting a bill of particulars for Count Two.  See Defendant Soto \nIII’s Motion  to Dismiss Counts One and Two of Indictment, and as to Count Two in the \nAlternative for a Bill of Particulars (“Dismiss Mot.”) [Dkt. 72].2  He also  filed a second motion \nseeking to strike the “non -disclosure” theory of prosecution from Counts One through Five of the \nIndictment.  See Defendant Soto III’s Motion to Strike “Non -Disclosure” Theory of Prosecution \n(“Strike Mot.”) [Dkt. 73].  Santos Soto filed two motions , requesting that he be joined to Saints \nSoto’s respective motions.  See Dkt. Nos. 75, 76.  \nA few days later , Saints Soto filed a third motion to sever Counts Six and Seven  from th eo \nother counts , as well as from each other .  See Motion to Sever Defendant on Counts Six and Seven \nfrom Trial and All Other Counts (“Sever Mot.”) [Dkt. No. 79].  Santos Soto filed a declaration in \nsupport of Saints Soto’s motion to sever.  See Administrative Motion to File Under Seal (“Sealed \nMot.”) [Dkt. No. 78] Declaration of Santos Moises Soto, III (“Saints Soto Decl.”) [Dkt. No. 78 -1].  \nHe then filed a request to join Saints Soto’s severance motion .  See Dkt. No. 80.  \nThe United States responded to all three motions in a single opposition.  See Oppo.   \nDefendants subsequently filed three replies.  They filed two responses regarding the motion to \ndismiss and motion to strike claims.  See Defendants’ Reply on Motion to Dismiss (“Dismiss \nRepl.”) [Dkt. No. 86]; Defendants’ Reply on Motion to Strike (“Strike Repl.”) [Dkt. No. 87].  \nThree days later, they  filed their reply in support of the severance motion.  See Reply Brief in \nSupport of Motion to Sever Trial (“Sever Repl.”) [Dkt. No. 89].  \n \n \n \n2 Defendants withdrew their request for a bill of particulars at oral argument , as the government \nclarified that the scope of Count Two is the same as Count One.  Case 3:22-cr-00378-WHO     Document 93     Filed 10/30/25     Page 5 of 23 \n6 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  LEGAL STANDARD  \nMotion to Dismiss ; Motion to Strike  \nReview of an indictment on a motion to challenge the sufficiency of the pleading is \ngoverned by Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 7(c), which provides that an indictment must \ncontain a “plain, concise, and definite written statement of the essential facts  constituting the \noffense charged.”  Fed. R. Crim. P. 7(c)(1).  In considering a motion to dismiss an indictment, \ndistrict courts are limited to the “four corners of the indictment ” in analyzing whether a cognizable \noffense has been charged.  United States  v. Boren , 278 F.3d 911, 914 (9th Cir. 2002).  An \nindictment “should be read in its entirety, construed according to common sense, and interpreted \nto include facts which are necessarily implied.”  United States v. Berger , 473 F.3d 1080, 1103 (9th \nCir. 2007) (quotation and citation omitted).   \n“Because it is a drastic step, dismissing an indictment is a disfavored remedy.”  United \nStates v. Rogers , 751 F.2d 1074, 1076 (9th Cir. 1985).  As a result, an indictment will withstand a \ndefendant’s motion to dismiss so long as it “contains the elements of the charged offense in \nsufficient detail (1) to enable the defendant to prepare his defense; (2) to en sure him that he is \nbeing prosecuted on the basis of the facts presented to the grand jury; (3) to enable him to plead \ndouble jeopardy; and (4) to info rm the court of the alleged facts so that it can determine the \nsufficiency of the charge.”  United States v. Rosi , 27 F.3d 409, 414 (9th Cir. 1994) (citation \nomitted).  \nMotion to Sever  \nUnder Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 8(a), joinder of two or more offenses may occur \nwhen the offenses charged are “of the same or similar character, or are based on the same act or \ntransaction, or are connected with or constitute parts of a common sch eme or plan.”  Fed. R. Crim. \nP. 8(a).  Only one of the three prongs must be met for joinder to be proper.  See id. ; United States \nv. Jawara , 474 F.3d 565, 578 (9th Cir. 2007).  That is because joinder “is the rule, severance the \nexception.”  United States v. Free , 841 F.2d 321, 324 n.1 (9th Cir. 1988).  But these factors are \n“not infinitely elastic,” and there must be a “valid basis for joinder . . . discernible from the face of \nthe indictment.”  Jawara , 474 F.3d at 473 (citing United States v.

R. Crim. P. 14(a).  In general, courts \nprefer that “defendants who are indicted together” are also trie d jointly.  Zafiro v. United States , \n506 U.S. 534, 537 (1993).  But severance is appropriate under Rule 14(a) “if there is a serious risk \nthat a joint trial would compromise a specific trial right of one of the defendants, or [would] \nprevent the jury from making a reliable judgment about guilt or innocence.”  United States v. \nStinson , 647 F.3d 1196, 1205 (9th Cir. 2011) (quoting Zafiro , 506 U.S. at 539).  “When the reason \nfor severance is the need for a codefendant’s testimony, the threshold showing required of the \ndefendant is (1) that he would call the defendant at a severed trial, (2) that the codefendant would \nin fact testify, and (3) that the t estimony would be favorable to the moving party.”  United States \nv. Reese , 2 F.3d 870, 892 (9th Cir. 1993) (cit ing United States v. Hernandez , 952 F.2d 1110, 1115 \n(9th Cir. 199 1), cert. denied , 506 U.S. 920 (1992)) (cleaned up).   \nDISCUSSION  \nI. MOTION TO DISMISS  \nDefendants seek to dismiss Counts One and Two on the grounds that they violate the Rule \nAgainst Duplicity and are impermissibly vague.   Under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 8(a), \nan indictment may charge a defendant with two or more offenses in a singular count only “if the \noffenses charged —whether felonies or misdemeanors or both —are of the same or similar \ncharacter, or are based on the same act or transaction, or are connected with or constitute parts of a \ncommon scheme or plan.”  Fed. R. Crim. P. 8(a ).  An indictment does not violate the Rule Against \nDuplicity if a one count charges a “conspiracy to commit more than one offense.”  United States v. \nSmith , 891 F.2d 703, 713 (9th Cir. 1989), as amended , 906 F.2d 385 (9th Cir. 1990) (citing \nBraverman v. United States , 317 U.S. 49, 54 (1942)).  But a conspiracy does violate the Rule if a \nsingle count charges multiple, distinct conspiracies.  See United States v. Gordon , 844 F.2d 1397, \n1401 (9th Cir. 1988).  \nThe parties primarily dispute whether the GoldenSpear, AI Health, and PPP loan schemes \nshould be considered as one conspiracy or three distinct conspiracies.  They agree that if the three Case 3:22-cr-00378-WHO     Document 93     Filed 10/30/25     Page 7 of 23 \n8 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  schemes are considered independent conspiracies, Counts One and Two would violate the Rule \nAgainst Duplicity.  Conversely, should I find that the schemes are part of one conspiracy, the Rule \nAgainst Duplicity would not apply, and Counts One and Two would b e properly alleged.  \na. Count One Does Not Violate the Rule Against Duplicity.  \nCount One charges the Sotos with conspiracy under 18 U.S.C. § 371.  Indict. ¶¶ 34 –37.  \nSpecifically, the Indictment alleges:  \n35. Beginning no later than in or about March 2017, and continuing \nuntil at least in or about May 2022, in the Northern District of \nCalifornia and elsewhere, [defendants] did knowingly conspire to \ncommit offenses against the United States, namely devising and \nintending to devise a scheme and artifice to defraud as to a material \nmatter and to obtain money and property by means of materially \nfalse and fraudulent pretenses, representations, and promises, and \nby concealment of material facts, and, for the purpo se of executing \nsuch scheme and artifice and attempting to do so, did transmit and \ncause to be transmitted, by means of wire communication in \ninterstate and foreign commerce, certain writings, signs, signals, \npictures, and sounds, in violation of Title 18,  United States Code, \nSection 1343.  \n \n36. The objectives of the conspiracy were, among other things, (a) \nto obtain investment funds in GoldenSpear and AI Health from \ninvestors using false and misleading statements, and omissions of \nmaterial facts; (b) to obtain funds from a PPP loan to Lender 1 using \nfalse and misleading statements, and omissions of material facts.  \n \n37. In furtherance of the conspiracy and to effect the objects thereof, \nin the Northern District of California and elsewhere, [defendants] \nand others committed the following overt acts:  \n \na. On or about January 17, 2018, SAINTS SOTO wrote an \nemail to T.G. that contained false and misleading statements, \nincluding falsely stating that GoldenSpear had been “selected” by \nCar Manufacturer 1 to “power a global intelligent Dealership \nNetwork” and fal sely stat ing that Financial Firm 1 had taken \nGoldenSpear on a “roadshow” to meet prominent technology \ncompanies in 2017 and that many of the technology companies \n“made known their interest to make an acquisition and/or an \ninvestment.”  \n \nb. On or about April 20, 2020, SANTOS SOTO and SAINTS \nSOTO submitted a PPP loan application to Lender 1 that included \nfalse statements including, but not limited to, the number of Case 3:22-cr-00378-WHO     Document 93     Filed 10/30/25     Page 8 of 23 \n9 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  GoldenSpear employees based in the United States, how much \nGoldenSpear paid its United States -based employees, and \nGoldenSpear’s commercial office space expenditures.  \n \nc. On or about January 6, 2022, SANTOS SOTO wrote an \nemail to E.C. that contained false and misleading statements, \nincluding  providing  a contract purporting to be a finalized \nagreement between Medical Device Company 1 and AI Health that \nwas not.  \nId. ¶¶ 35 –37.   \nDefendants contend that the text and structure of Count One suggest that the three alleged \nschemes are independent conspiracies violating the Rule Against Duplicity.  See Dismiss Mot. at \n4.  They point out that Count One “expressly admits two distinct objectives” in Paragraph 36 —\nfirst, to “obtain investment funds in GoldenSpear and AI Health from investors”; and second, to \n“obtain funds from a PPP loan to Lender 1.”  See id. ; Indict. ¶ 36.  This, along with the \nincorporated introductory paragraphs “expressly distinguish[ing]” between the three schemes, \nsuggests to defendants that the Indictment understood these schemes as separate conspiracies.  \nDismiss Mot. at 4; see Indict. ¶¶ 13 –17 (discussing only the GoldenSpear incident); ¶¶ 18 –26 \n(discussing only the AI Health incident); ¶¶ 27 –33 (discussing only the PPP loan incident).  \nDefendants primarily rely on United States v. Gordon  to frame their analysis.  844 F.2d \n1397 (9th Cir. 1988).  In Gordon , the defendants were charged with one count of conspiracy to \ndefraud the United States  premised on two separate incidents —first, an agreement to “use inside \ninformation to secure government contracts . . . in return for payoffs”; and second, “to conceal, \ncover up; and obstruct an investigation . . . into that wrongdoing.”  844 F.2d at 1401.   The Ninth \nCircuit concluded that these two incidents were separate incidents, as no evidence suggested the \ndefendants “contemplated or discussed any plans for a coverup.”  Id.  Rather, it was only until one \nco-defendant was subpoenaed by a grand jury tha t the conspiracy to obstruct justice began.  See id.   \nIn so holding, the Ninth Circuit held that the “relevant factors in determining the existence of [one \nversus multiple circumstances] are [1] the nature of the scheme, [2] the identity of the participants, \n[3] the quality, frequency, and duration of each conspirator’s transactions, and [4] the \ncommonality of times and goals.”  Id. \nApplying Gordon ’s “relevant factors” analysis to this case, defendants assert  that Count Case 3:22-cr-00378-WHO     Document 93     Filed 10/30/25     Page 9 of 23 \n10 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  One is duplicative.  With respect to the “nature of the scheme” factor, they argue:  \n[I]t could not possibly have been anticipated at the time of the \ncommencement of the alleged GoldenSpear investor fraud scheme \nin March 2017 that three years later there would be a global COVID -\n19 pandemic starting in March 2020, let alone that a Paycheck \nProtection Program would subsequently be instituted to provide \nemergency financial assistance to those suffering the economic \neffects of that pandemic.  \nDismiss Mot. at 5.  They similarly assert that the “quality, frequency, and duration” and \n“commonality of time and goals” factors weigh against finding one single conspiracy, as each \nscheme involved “non -overlapping dates and distinct unrelated victims.”  Id. at 4–6.  Finally, \nwhile defendants were allegedly both involved in all three schemes, they claim this fact is \ninconclusive, as “involvement of identical conspirators in both conspiracies does not compel a \nfinding that a single conspiracy existed.”  Id. at 6 (citing United States v. Ziskin , 360 F.3d 934, 945 \n(9th Cir. 2003)).  \n Defendants’ reliance on Gordon  now is likely  misplaced.  As the  court  noted in United \nStates v. W.R. Grace : \nThe Gordon  court expressly stated that it was not considering an \nobjection to the form of the indictment, and made clear that \nobjections to the form were to be resolved pursuant to the “limited \nreview” test. Instead, the  Gordon  court was assessing whether the \ndefendants were subjected to the risk of a non -unanimous jury \nverdict. The relevant factors test it employed in making that \nassessment is markedly of a different character than the limited \nreview test associated with pretri al challenges for duplicity. This  \ndistinction is apparent from the  Gordon  court ’s application of the \nrelevant factors test, for which the court relied upon a review of the \nevidence at trial.  844 F.2d at 1401  (“The evidence does not show \nthat the parties contemplated or discussed any plans for a coverup.”). \nAt the pretrial stage, during which a challenge to the form of the \nindictment must be raised under  Rule 12(b)(2) , it is impossible for \nthe court to consider the evidence heard at trial.  \n429 F. Supp. 2d 1207, 1218 (D. Mont. 2006).  \n The “relevant factors” test, the court in W.R. Grace  concluded, applies in cases where the \ngovernment charges a single conspiracy but the defendant “alleges a variance between the charge \nand the proof at trial  because the proof has shown that the conduct charged constitutes more than Case 3:22-cr-00378-WHO     Document 93     Filed 10/30/25     Page 10 of 23 \n11 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  one conspiracy.”  Id. (emphasis added).  By contrast, the court in W.R. Grace  found that a “limited \nreview” test applies to duplicity challenges for indictments at the pre -trial stage.  See id.   This \n“limited review” test requires district courts to “solely . . . assess whether the indictment itself can \nbe read to charge only one violation in each count.”  Id. at 1219 (citing United States v. Martin , 4 \nF.3d 757, 759 (9th Cir. 1993)).  \n I agree with the W.R. Grace  court that a “limited review” test likely applies at this stage of \nthe proceeding.  The Gordon  test appears more applicable for post -trial considerations of the \nindictment, as more evidence has been presented and could be considered under the higher \nstandard of review.  At the pre -trial stage, however, less evidence is present for me to consider \nwhether the Indictment is duplicative .   \nApplying W.R. Grace to the Indictment , Count One would not be duplicative.  To start, the \nnamed conspirators remain the same in each overt act.  When “read in its entirety [and] construed \naccording to common sense,” the Indictment plausibly alleges that the COVID -19 pandemic did \nnot “discontinue [the conspiracy’s] initially agreed upon objective,” but rather allowed defendants \nto adapt the tools an d means by which they engaged in fraud.  Id.; Berger , 473 F.3d at 1103.  The \nIndictment explains defendants’ co nnections to GoldenSpear, as well as the purported incidents of \nfraud that spanned between 2017 and March 2020.  See Indict. ¶¶ 1 –4, 13 –17.  It then details how \n“after the onset of the COVID -19 pandemic, [defendants] began to represent to potential investors \nthat GoldenSpear was moving from the fashion sector to the health sector,” and created AI Health \nas a result.  See id.  ¶ 18.  Accordingly, the Indictment sufficiently tracks how the purported \nGoldenSpear fraud evolved into the AI Health scheme.  See id.  \n There also is a clear connection between the GoldenSpear and PPP loan incident s.  The \nIndictment explains that the PPP scheme was directly connected to GoldenSpear, as without the \ncompany, defendants could not apply for the loan.  See Indict. ¶¶ 27 –33.  By using false \ninformation about the state of GoldenSpear in 2020, defendants were able to successfully receive \n$669,770 in emergency loans that were ultimately wired to their jointly -held GoldenSpear bank \naccount.  Id. ¶ 31.  Count One then explains that d efendants are charged with a conspiracy to \ndefraud both investors and lenders due to their false representations and statements.  Id. ¶¶ 35 –37.  Case 3:22-cr-00378-WHO     Document 93     Filed 10/30/25     Page 11 of 23 \n12 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  With this information, the Indictment could reasonably be understood as charging only one \nconspiracy.  See Martin , 4 F.3d at 759.  \n Even assuming defendants are correct that Gordon  applies, Count One would not be \nduplicative .  Their  arguments are largely premised on the fact that the three schemes occurred in \ndistinct time periods and with distinct victims, and that defendants could not have anticipated the \nCOVID -19 pandemic —and thus the AI Health and PPP loan schemes —when entering t he \npurported GoldenSpear conspiracy in 2017.  See id.   I do not disagree that defendants could not \nhave anticipated the COVID -19 pandemic.  But a “single o verall agreement need not be \nmanifested by continuous activity,” and a “suspension of activities” does not necessarily “divide a \nconspiracy into more than one.”  United States v. Bloch , 696 F.2d 1213, 1215 (9th Cir. 1982) , \nabrogated on other grounds , United States v. Jimenez Recio , 537 U.S. 270, 277 (2003).   Rather, \nconspiracies are “presumed to continue unless there is affirmative evidence that the defendant \nabandoned, withdrew from, or disavowed the conspiracy or defeated its purpose.”  United States v. \nKrasn, 614 F.2d 1229, 1236 (9th Cir. 1980).  I agree with the government that the Indictment does \nnot suggest abandonment or withdrawal from the GoldenSpear conspiracy —rather, it shows \n“defendants were . . . committed to using misrepresentations about their bus iness enterprises to \nobtain money by means of wire communication.”  See Oppo. at 10.  While the tools and \ncircumstances admittedly changed, the “underlying objects of the agreement” plausibly appear to \nremain the same.  Id.  Accordingly, any temporal “ gaps” between the three schemes does not \nautomatically support finding duplicity.  \n Defendants also argue that the three schemes each had “different goals and distinct types of \ntransactions,” considering the GoldenSpear and AI Health schemes allegedly involved wire fraud, \nwhile the PPP loan scheme involved bank fraud.  Dismiss Mot. at 6;  see Indict. ¶ 36.  They claim \nthat this appears on the face of Count One, which divides the bank and wire fraud schemes into \n“two distinct objectives” of the conspiracy.  Dismiss Mot. at 4.  But again, while the means of the \nconspiracy may have differed o ver time, the overall goal —for defendants to obtain funds by using \nfalse and misleading statements about their companies —appears the same throughout the \nIndictment.  Count One can plausibly be read as alleging one conspiracy and is not duplicative.  Case 3:22-cr-00378-WHO     Document 93     Filed 10/30/25     Page 12 of 23 \n13 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  b. Count Two Does Not Violate the Rule Against Duplicity.  \nCount Two charges defendants with conspiracy to commit wire fraud.  See Indict. ¶¶ 38 –\n39.  Unlike Count One, Count Two provides a “bare -bones recitation of the charged statute” and \n“incorporates by reference” the introductory paragraphs and Count One.  See Dismiss Mot. at 8 –9.  \nBecause Count Two is largely coextensive with Count One, defendants conclude that if Count One \nis found duplicative, so must Count Two.  Id. at 9. \nAs explained above, the three alleged schemes are plausibly alleged as one conspiracy, \nmeaning Count One does not violate the Rule Against Duplicity.  Because Count Two directly \nincorporates Count One  and addresses the same scheme, it also does not violate the Rule Against \nDuplicity.  \n II.   MOTION TO STRIKE  \nA. Non-Disclosure Theory  \nDefendants request that I strike the “non -disclosure” theory of wire fraud from Counts One \nthrough Five of the Indictment.  I decline to do so.  The government has provided sufficient facts \nin their Indictment to support a prosecution under this theory.  \nTo begin, the parties agree that a wire fraud charge may be premised on either a theory of \naffirmative representation or of “non -disclosure.”  United States v. Shields , 844 F.3d 819, 822 (9th \nCir. 2016); see Strike Mot. at 2; Oppo. at 21.  They also agree that a “non -disclosure” theory can \nonly support a wire fraud charge “when there exists an independent duty that has been breached by \nthe person so charged.”  Eller v. Equi Trust Life Ins. Co. , 778 F.3d 1089, 1092 (9th Cir. 2015) \n(quoting United States v. Dowling , 739 F.2d 1445, 1449 (9th Cir. 1984), rev’d on other grounds , \n473 U.S. 207 (1985)).   Where the y disagree is whether the duty to disclose is an implied necessary \nelement of a wire fraud charge.   \nDefendants claim that when the government premises a wire fraud charge on a theory of \nnon-disclosure, it must include in the charges the “implied essential element of a duty to disclose.”  \nStrike Mot. at 1 –2; Eller , 778 F.3d at 1092.  T hey cite a string of cases striking down wire fraud \ncharges under a non -disclosure theory for a failure to plead a duty to disclose.  Id. at 2–3; see, e.g. , \nUnited States v. Lonich , No. 14 -cr-00139 -SI-1, 2016 WL 324039, at *6 –*8 (N.D. Cal. Jan. 27, Case 3:22-cr-00378-WHO     Document 93     Filed 10/30/25     Page 13 of 23 \n14 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  2016); United States v. Sullivan , No. 20 -cr-0037 -WHO -1, 2022 WL 2317441, at *7 –*8 (N.D. Cal. \nJune 28, 2022); United States v. Galloway , No. CR 14 -607 PJH, 2016 WL 4269961, at *2 –*4 \n(N.D. Cal. Aug. 15, 2016).  And because the Indictment “fails to allege” this duty, defendants \nargue, charges under the non -disclosure theory must be dismissed.   Strike Mot. at 2; United States \nv. Du Bo , 186 F.3d 1177, 1179 (9th Cir. 1999).  \nIn response, the government claims that it is not necessary to allege a duty to disclose to \nprosecute a non -disclosure theory of wire fraud.  See Oppo. at 22 –23. They contend that the Ninth \nCircuit has not opined on the issue, and that defendants lack circuit authority supporting their \nclaim.  See id.   Assuming it is required, however, the government maintains that it has met its \nburden.  See id.  \nDefendants are correct that many courts require the government to assert a duty to disclose \nin wire fraud charges premised on a non -disclosure theory.  See Lonich , 2016 WL 324039, at *7 –\n*8.  In Lonich , for example, the defendants —the CEO and President of Sonoma Valley Bank \n(“SVB”), the Senior Vice President and Chief Loan Officer of SVB, and an attorney —were \naccused of conspiracy to commit wire fraud after convincing SVB to approve a loan that violated  \nthe bank’s legal lending limit.  Id. at *2.  The govern ment’s wire fraud claims were premised in \npart on a theory of non -disclosure.  See id.  at *7.  However, the “only specific omission alleged in \nthe indictment” was that the defendants “omitted the material fact” to SVB that the parties seeking \nthe loan were subjects of a criminal investigation.  Id.  Despite the specific allegations of non -\ndisclosure, the court concluded that the indictment failed to sufficiently allege that the defendants \nowed a duty to disclose information to the SVB.  See id.  at *8.  \nBut the government is also correct  that courts should construe indictments broadly when \ndetermining whether a duty to disclose has been included.  See United States v. Milovanovic , 678 \nF.3d 713, 723 –24 (9th Cir. 2012); United States v. Losch , 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 103425, *7 (D. \nAriz. June 9, 2022); see also United States v. Shields , 844 F.3d 819, 822 –23 (9th Cir. 2016) \n(adopting Milovanovic to wire fraud charges).  In Losch , an indictment charging a CEO with wire \nfraud alleged that the defendant “was central to solicitation pitches,” “spoke directly and often \nwith potential investors,” and was “instrumental in soliciting investments into [his company].”  Case 3:22-cr-00378-WHO     Document 93     Filed 10/30/25     Page 14 of 23 \n15 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 103425, at *7  (cleaned up) .  Applying Milovanovic , the court  concluded \nthat these allegations alone were sufficient to support a duty to disclose theory, as the indictment \ndemonstrated  that the defendant had a “trusting relationship” with the victims, which caused them \nto “relax the care and vigilance [they] would ordinarily exercise.”  Id.3 \nAssuming that there is a duty to disclose, when reading the indictment “in its entirety, \nconstrued according to common sense, and interpreted to include facts which are necessarily \nimplied,” the government has met its burden.  United States v. Given s, 767 F.2d 574, 584 (9th Cir. \n1985).4  The Indictment alleges that defendants held influential positions within GoldenSpear and \nAI Health , just  like the CEO in Losch .  See Indict. ¶¶ 1, 3.  It also claims that the pair began using \ntheir statuses as “leaders in the company” to make false representations to multiple investors, who \nin turn relied on their claims as being “credible.”  Oppo. at 24; see Indict. ¶¶ 14 –26, 30 –32, 35, 39, \n41, 43, 45 –47.  As a result, the Indictment concludes that defendants built a “trusting relationship” \nwith the alleged victims, causing them to “relax the care and vigilance [they] would ordinarily \nexercise.”  See i d.; 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 103425, at *6 (cleaned up).  Accordingly, under Losch \nand Milovanovic , the Indictment properly pleads enough facts to support a non -disclosure theory \nof wire fraud.  See id.   Defendants’ motion to strike the non -disclosure theory is DENIED.  \nc. “Among Other Things”  \nDefendants also request that I strike the “vague phrase ‘among other things’ from Count \nOne (paragraph 36) because it permits the prosecution to achieve a conviction based on facts and \n \n3 Defendants argue that Losch  is not controlling because it does “not cite authority from any \njurisdiction in support of its conclusion that the element of a duty to disclose need not be pleaded \nin an indictment charging wire fraud under a non -disclosure theory.”  Strike Repl. at 3 n. 3.  To the \ncontrary, Losch directly cites the holding in Milovanovic  that evidence of an informal, “trusting \nrelationship” where the defendant “induces the trusting party to relax the care and vigilance which \nit would ordinarily exercise” is enough to support a non -disclosure theory under Federal Rule of \nCriminal Procedure  7(c)(1).  See 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 103425, at *6 –*7; 678 F.3d at 724; Fed. \nR. Crim. P. 7(c)(1).  \n  \n4 Defendants maintain that Givens  is superseded by United States v. Du Bo , which held that “an \nindictment’s complete failure to recite an essential element of the charged offense is not a minor or \ntechnical flaw subject to harmless error analysis, but a fatal flaw requiring dismissal of the \nindictment.”  See Strike Repl. at 2 n.2; 186 F.3d 1177, 1179 (9th Cir. 1999).  I do not read these \ncases to be mutually exclusive.  While Du Bo focuses on when  courts may dismiss an improperly \nalleged indictment, Givens  explains how an indictment should be read to determine the sufficiency \nof the claims.  Givens is good law and must be followed.  Case 3:22-cr-00378-WHO     Document 93     Filed 10/30/25     Page 15 of 23 \n16 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  theories not found by the grand jury, which would violate the Fifth Amendment.”  Dismiss  Mot. at \n8.  The government d id not squarely address this issue in its opposition.  \nTo support their argument, defendants  cite to Lonich , which concluded that the language \n“among other things” in an indictment “adds nothing to the charges, gives the defendants no \nfurther information with respect to them, and creates the danger that the prosecutor at trial may \nimpermissibly enlarge the char ges in the Indictment returned by the grand jury.”  2016 WL \n324039, at *6 (quoting United States v. DePalma , 461 F. Supp. 778, 798 –99 (S.D.N.Y. 1978)).   I \nagree with the defendants that Lonich  controls he re, and that the “among other things” language is \nsurplusage.  See id.   The government’s theory of conspiracy can reasonably be understood even \nwhen limiting the scope of the charge to the two listed objectives in Paragraph 36.  Therefore, \ndefendants’ motion to strike the “among other things” language is GRANTED.  \nIII. MOTION TO SEVER  \nDefendants finally request that Counts Six and Seven be severed from the remainder of the \nIndictment, and that those counts be tried separately as to each defendant.  I agree with the \ngovernment that joinder of the counts does not appear prejudicial.  Howe ver, with respect to \nseverance of the defendants’ trials, I do not currently have enough information to decide whether \nseverance is warranted.  As I explain below, there are significant concerns about both prejudice \nand judicial economy that remain unresol ved.  Accordingly, I DENY defendants’ motion at this \ntime but will reconsider this issue closer to trial . \nA.  Severance of Counts Six and Seven from the Indictment is Unnecessary.  \nUnder Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 8(a), joinder of two or more offenses is proper \nwhen the offenses charged are “of the same or similar character, or are based on the same acts or \ntransaction, or are connected with or constitute parts of a common sc heme or plan.”  Fed. R. Crim. \nP. 8(a).  Only one of these three prongs must be found for joinder to be proper.  See United States \nv. Jawara , 474 F.3d 565, 578 (9th Cir. 2007).  This liberal standard applies because joinder “is the \nrule, severance the excep tion.”  United States v. Free , 841 F.2d 321, 324 n.1 (9th Cir. 1988).  But \nthese factors are “not infinitely elastic,” and there must be a “valid basis for joinder . . . discernible \nfrom the face of the indictment.”  Jawara , 474 F.3d at 473 (citing United States v. Randazzo , 80 Case 3:22-cr-00378-WHO     Document 93     Filed 10/30/25     Page 16 of 23 \n17 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  F.3d 623, 627 (1st Cir. 1996)).  \nHere, the government invokes two of the three bases for joinder —that Counts Six and \nSeven are “of the same or similar character” as the other counts, and that all seven counts are \n“connected with or constitute parts of a common scheme or plan.”  \ni. Same or Similar Character  \nBoth parties agree that Jawara  sets forth  the standard for determining whether two claims \nare of a “same or similar character” under Rule 8(a).  See Strike Mot. at 4; Oppo. at 15 –16.  In \nJawara , the Ninth Circuit held that in determining whether two or more claims are “same or \nsimilar in character,” district courts must consider “[1] the elements of the statutory offenses, [2] \nthe temporal proximity of the acts, [3] the likelihood and extent of evidentiary overlap, [4] the \nphysical location of the acts, [5]  the modus operandi of the crimes, and [6] the identity of the \nvictims.”  474 F.3d at 577.  \nDefendants maintain that none of the facts in Jawara  support joinder.  Sever Mot. at 10.  \nFirst, they point out that the victims in Counts Six and Seven —the United States —are different \nfrom the investor victims in Counts One through Five.  Id.  Each scheme also occurred at different \ntimes.  Id.  They further allege that the use of a computer in the PPP loan scheme, but “puffery” in \nthe GoldenSpear and AI Health schemes, suggests that the modus operandi of the crimes are \ndistinct.  Id.  And because the facts  defendants allegedly used to defraud in Counts Six and \nSeven —incorrect statistics about GoldenSpear’s payroll and number of U.S. -based workers —were \nnever used in Counts One through Five, no evidentiary overlap exists between the claims.  Id. \nThe government conversely argues that enough similarities exist between the claims to \nsupport joinder.  See Oppo. at 15 –16.  For example, Count Six (bank fraud) includes many of the \nsame elements as Counts Three through Five (wire fraud), such as “a materially false statement, an \nintent to defraud and intent to deceive and cheat, and the obtaining of money or property throu gh \nthe false statements.”  Id. at 16.  Similarly, the time frames of the schemes are “relatively close” to \neach other, despite not overl apping.  Id.  The “modus operandi” of each scheme revolves around \ndefendants making “materially false statements about the nature, operations, and technology of \nGoldenSpear and AI Health.”  Id.  And much of the evidence supporting Counts Six and Seven Case 3:22-cr-00378-WHO     Document 93     Filed 10/30/25     Page 17 of 23 \n19 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  F.2d 422, 429 (2d Cir. 1978) (citation modified)).  \nWith respect to this factor, defendants contend that Counts Six and Seven “allege an \nisolated wrongdoing,” and that the “sole connection” between these counts with the rest of the \nindictment is that GoldenSpear “is the entity that the PPP loan relates to.”   Sever Mot. at 7.  \nBecause the Indictment does not allege “any connection whatsoever [between] this loan \napplication and any of the Soto’s dealings with GoldenSpear or AI Health investors,” defendants \nconclude, no nexus exists to prove a common scheme or plan.  Id. \nTo support their argument, defendants cite United States v. Halper , 590 F.2d 422 (2d Cir. \n1978).  In Halper , the Second Circuit found that the defendant’s tax evasion and Medicaid fraud \ncharges were improperly joined because their connection was “entirely too speculative to justify \njoinder.”  590 F.2d at 429.  But Halper  is readily distinguishable.   It does not procedurally address \nthe issue in this case: whether joinder is proper under Rule 8(a).  See id. ; United States v. Krug , \n198 F. Supp. 3d 235, 249 n. 5 (W.D.N.Y. 2016).  Rather, “ Halper  concerned whether two \nindictments, each charging distinct conduct, were properly joined under Rule 13.”  Krug , 198 F. \nSupp. 3d at 24 8 n.5.5   \nMoreover , the facts of Halper  are distinguishable .  In Harper , the government alleged that \nthe defendant’s Medicaid fraud “produced the income” he later used to commit tax evasion, but it \nultimately conceded that it could not prove this connection.  See 590 F.2d at 429.  Here, by \ncontrast, Counts Six and Seven charge conduct so closely connected to that in Counts One through \nFive that they can be deemed part of the same scheme —“obtaining money through false \nrepresentations about the GoldenSpear business.”   See id. ; Oppo. at 17.  \nDefendants’ reliance on United States v. Sarkisian , 197 F.3d 966 (9th Cir. 1999), is also \nmisplaced.  In Sarkisian , the Ninth Circuit found that the joinder of an extortion and auto part \ntrafficking charge was improper because there were no “meaningful connections” between the \ncharges.  197 F.3d at 9 76.  However, joinder in Sarkisian  was challenged under Federal Rule of \n \n5 While Rule 13 is “informed by Rule 8,” the two rules apply different standards that may not \nalways reflect one another.  Id.; see, e.g. , Halper , 590 F.2d at 428 (“[E]ven if the offenses could \nhave been joined in a single indictment under Rule 8(a), the trial court is not automatically free to \norder the indictments tried together under Rule 13.”).  Case 3:22-cr-00378-WHO     Document 93     Filed 10/30/25     Page 19 of 23 \n20 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  Criminal Procedure 8(b) —governing joinder of multiple defendants —not Rule 8(a).  Id. at 975.  \nRule 8(b) contains no similar language concerning a “common scheme or plan,” making \ndefendants’ use of this case inapposite.  See Fed. R. Crim. P. 8(b).  \nFinding the case law cited by defendants unpersuasive, I turn again to Jawara .  For joinder \nto be proper under a “common scheme or plan,” the government must show  that the counts “grow \nout of related transactions.” Id. 474 F.3d at 574.  Such connections must go “beyond mere \nthematic similarity.”  Id. \nThe government has met its burden here.  First, as described above, the Indictment \nsufficiently alleges that the GoldenSpear and AI Health schemes were “logically and factually \nentwined, as AI Health is the direct offshoot of GoldenSpear.”  Oppo. at 17; see Indict. ¶ 18.  The \nIndictment similarly explains how the PPP loan scheme “gr[e]w out of” the GoldenSpear fraud, as \ndefendants provided false information about GoldenSpear in the PPP application and received \nimproper funding in GoldenSpear’s bank account.   Jawara , 474 F.3d at 574; see Indict. ¶¶ 29 –30.  \nFinally, the Indictment indicates that the AI Health and PPP loan schemes “gr[e]w out of related \ntransactions” because they reflect a shift by defendants to take advantage of the COVID -19 \npandemic to continue their original GoldenSpear conspiracy.  Jawara , 474 F.3d at 574; see Indict. \n¶¶ 18, 27.   \nThis evidence suggests more than a “mere thematic similarity” —it shows a detailed \nconspiracy connecting the three schemes together.  Jawara , 474 F.3d at 574.  Accordingly, a \n“common scheme or plan” can be inferred from the Indictment.  The claims were properly joined \nunder Rule 8(a).  \nB. It is Unclear Whether Severance Under Rule 14(a) is Warranted.  \nThe parties finally dispute whether severance of the defendants’ cases for Counts Six and \nSeven is required under Rule 14(a).  Sever Mot. at 11; see Reese , 2 F.3d at 892.  Defendants argue \nthat severance is necessary because “one of the defendants ( “Santos” ) is prepared to offer \nsubstantially exculpatory testimony on behalf of defendant Saints at a separate trial on Counts 6 -\n7.”  Sever Mot. at 11.  Without severance, they conclude, a joint trial on Counts Six and Seven \nwould be unfairly prejudicial.  See id . Case 3:22-cr-00378-WHO     Document 93     Filed 10/30/25     Page 20 of 23 \n21 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  To support their argument, defendants rely on United States v. Reese .  Id. at 2; 2 F.3d 870  \n(9th Cir. 1993).  In Reese , the Ninth Circuit affirmed that “[w]hen the reason for severance is the \nneed for a codefendant’s testimony,” the defendant must show “(1) that he would call the \n[co]defendant at a severed trial , (2) that the codefendant would in fact testify , and (3) that the \ntestimony would be favorable to the moving party.”  Id. at 892 (citing United States v. Hernandez , \n952 F.2d 1110, 1115 (9th Cir. 199 2), cert. denied , 506 U.S. 920 (1992)).  \nApplying Reese , defendants conclude that all three factors are met.  First, counsel for \ndefendants submitted a declaration confirming that she would, in fact, call Santos Soto as a \nwitness in Saints Soto’s trial, should they be severed.  See Declaration of Elizabeth Falk in \nSupport of Motion to Sever (“Falk Decl.”) [Dkt. No. 77] at 1.  Additionally , Santos Soto submitted \nhis own declaration which defendants claim contains evidence of “significant, substantial  and \nimportant exculpatory information” that should be heard at  Saints Soto’s severed trial.  See Sever \nMot. at 12 ; Declaration of Santos Rene Soto in Support of Motion to Sever (“Santos Soto Decl.”) \n[Dkt. No. 78 -1].6 \nIn response, the government calls defendants’ efforts to sever a prejudicial, “antagonistic \ndefense strategy.”  Oppo. at 17.  It claims that “Saints Soto plans to blame Santos Soto for the \ncrime, and Santos Soto wants to preserve his ability, at a separate trial, to argue that Saints Soto \nsubmitted the false application.”  Id.  This alone is insufficient to warrant severance, the \ngovernment argues —if it were, severance would be allowed whenever a defendant “raises the \npossibility that a co -defendant would t estify in a manner helpful to that defendant.”  Id. \nThe government maintains that join der of defendants’ trials may not be prejudicial under \nRule 14.  Rather than sever the cases, the government argues that “careful and frequent limiting \ninstructions to the jury, explaining how and against whom certain evidence may be considered,” \ncan reduce o r eliminate any possibility of prejudice from a joint trial.  Id. at 18; United States v. \nFernandez , 388 F.3d 1199, 124 3 (9th Cir. 2004), amended on other grounds , 425 F.3d 1248 (9th \nCir. 2005).  As an example, it point s to the Ninth Circuit model jury instructions.  See Oppo. at 18;  \n \n6 This information is currently filed ex parte and under seal; the government has not reviewed the \ndeclaration.  See Oppo. at 19.  Case 3:22-cr-00378-WHO     Document 93     Filed 10/30/25     Page 21 of 23 \n22 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  Ninth Circuit Model Criminal Jury Instruction No. 6.11 (“A separate crime is charged against the \ndefendant in each count.  You must decide each count separately.  Your verdict on one count \nshould not control your verdict on any other count.”).  \nAfter reviewing Santos Soto’s declaration, I agree with defendants that the Reese  factors \nare met.  But this is not the end of my inquiry.  I must also consider the questions of judicial \neconomy and prejudice, which currently pull in opposite directions.  With respect to prejudice, it \nappears that the testimony Santos Soto seeks to present in a separate trial may be exculpatory; as a \nresult, it would be p rejudicial to exclude such testimony, should a joint trial occur.  This certainly \nweighs strongly in fav or of severance.  \nWhere I have difficulty is  how to evaluate  the question of judicial economy , which also \nimplicates prejudice to the government .  Defendants claim that the “costs of severed trials on the \nPPP allegations will be fairly modest as the factual and legal issues . . . are straightforward and \ndiscrete.”  Sever Mot. at 12.  They also argue  that the “documentary evidence regarding this single \nloan is not voluminous,” and that a separate trial on these issues “should only last a few days, at \nmost.”  Id. at 12 –13.  Finally, they cite to authority suggesting that judicial economy “cannot \nbecome a talisman in the severance analysis,” as “judicial economy will always weigh against a \nseverance because one trial is always more economical than two.”  Id. at 6 (citing United States v. \nMcCord , No. CR 16 -00984 -TUC -RM(EJM), 2016 WL 8669900, at * 8 (D. Ariz. Sept. 23, 2016)).  \nI need to better understand the evidence that will be presented at trial on this claim and the \neffect on the trial plan if I grant severance.  It would seem that at least three trials would be \nrequired  in that  event —one jointly trying Counts One through Five, one for Saints Soto on Counts \nSix and Seven, and one for Santos Soto on Counts Six and Seven.  Would the trials on Counts Six \nand Seven precede the trial on Counts One through Five?  How would the verdicts on Counts Six \nand Seven impact the trial on the other counts?  Or vice versa?  Is defendants’  current  \ncharacterization of the severed trials accurate?   Is there a risk of inconsistent verdicts if three trials \noccur?  \nThese questions were not discussed in the motion or at the hearing.  At this point, \ndiscovery has not concluded, and more  factual and legal questions may arise with respect to the Case 3:22-cr-00378-WHO     Document 93     Filed 10/30/25     Page 22 of 23 \n23 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  PPP loan applications.  What may seem to be a “straightforward and discrete” issue now may not \nbe in light of all the evidence .  See Sever Mot. at 12.  These are serious concerns, and I do not \nthink they are merely  a “talisman in the severance analysis.”  See Sever Mot. at 6.  \nBecause of these issues , I will not  resolve the Rule 14(a) issue until a more developed  \nrecord is available to weigh the prejudicial effects of joinder  versus the prejudicial effects and \ncomplications the severed trials would bring.  Defendants should raise this issue again when the \ntrial(s) schedule is discussed after discovery is complete.   \nCONCLUSION  \n Defendants’ motions to dismiss, sever, and strike the non -disclosure theory of fraud are \nDENIED .  Their motion to strike the “among other things” language in Count Two  is GRANTED.  \nIT IS SO ORDERED.  \nDated:  October 30, 2025  \n \n  \nWilliam H.

    "summary": "1. **Summary:** Dr. Andrew Forrest, an Australian businessman, filed a lawsuit against Meta Platforms, Inc. after discovering that ads on Facebook falsely used his likeness to endorse fraudulent cryptocurrency products. He alleges Meta's automated ad tools, including those powered by artificial intelligence, contributed to the creation and distribution of these scam ads. While Meta's motion to dismiss some of the claims was granted by the court, other claims, including negligence and misappropriation of likeness, were allowed to proceed.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue:** Whether Meta, in operating its advertising platform, can be held liable for the creation and dissemination of allegedly fraudulent advertisements that misuse Dr. Forrest's likeness, particularly considering Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act which typically protects online platforms from liability for user-generated content.\n\n3. **Court's Holding:** The court denied Meta's motion to dismiss some of Dr. Forrest's claims, notably for negligence and misappropriation, acknowledging the potential involvement of Meta's automated systems in the creation of the challenged ads. However, other claims, such as negligent failure to warn, unjust enrichment, and a request for a declaratory judgment, were dismissed, the last one without leave to amend.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation:** Imagine if someone took your photo and used it in fake ads to sell scammy investments online, and these ads kept popping up on everyone's social media feeds. You'd be upset and want the social media company to stop this. Dr. Forrest is in a similar situation, accusing Facebook's parent company, Meta, of not doing enough to stop these fake ads. The court told him he can continue with some parts of his lawsuit, especially those saying Meta's automated systems might have helped make or spread these ads, but other parts need to be clarified or can't proceed.",

No. 104  \n \n \nDr. Andrew Forrest brings this action against Meta Platforms, Inc. arising from Facebook \nads that allegedly show him endorsing fraudulent cryptocurrency and other investment products. \nDr. Forrest seeks damages and an injunction on several common law claims. For the reasons that \nfollow, Meta’s motion to dismiss is denied in part and granted in part . \nI. Background  \nThe following facts from the complaint are accepted as true in resolving Meta’s motion.  \nDr. Forrest is a prominent Australian businessman and philanthropist. He is the founder \nand executive chairman of Fortescue Metals Group and has donated more than $7 billion AUD to \ncharity. He has received many honors and is widely recognized in Australia.  \nDr. Forrest did not use social media before 2014 , when  he discovered that his image had \nbeen used to create “imposter ” pages on Facebook (the social media platform operated by Meta) \nthat purported to belong to him.1 Dr. Forrest investigated and learned that these pages w ere created \nby scammers using false identities . He then brought the matter to Meta’s attention. Meta assured \n \n1 Meta was previously known as Facebook, Inc. For clarity, this order follows the convention of \nthe complaint : “Meta” refers to the company and “Facebook” refers to its social media platform.  Case 5:22-cv-03699-PCP     Document 121     Filed 06/17/24     Page 1 of 14 \n2 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  him it would take steps to stop the imposter pages. Dr. Forrest did not want to be on social media \nbut at Meta’s urging he set up a “verified” Face book page. Meta then took down some but not all \nof the imposter pages.  \nBeginning in 2019, Dr. Forrest learned that ads using his name and likeness to endorse \ncryptocurrency and other fraudulent investment products  were appearing on Facebook . Some were  \naccompanied by fake testimonials from investors who said they turned $250 into millions in a \nmatter of months. Others  included doctored “deepfake” videos of Dr. Forrest. Dr. Forrest learned \nabout these scam ads from victims. He paid for  an investigation of these ads and determined that \nthe advertisers were  located outside the United States, including in Eastern Europe and Southeast \nAsia. Many Australian Facebook users have fallen prey to the ads featuring Dr. Forrest. The \ncomplaint includes several examples of victims who lost tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars.  \nIn May 2019 , Dr. Forrest communicated with a senior Meta executive in Australia. Dr. \nForrest demanded that Meta prevent further dissemination of the ads. The executive emailed  Dr. \nForrest to offer a “direct line” for reporting content “so that we can move quickly to take down \nthese scam ads.” First Amd. Compl. , Dkt. No. 101,  ¶ 72. Meta’s attorneys later wrote to Dr. \nForrest saying that Meta had “adjusted their detection mechanisms” to ferret out mis leading ads \nthat featured him . In November 2019, after scam ads continue d, Dr. Forrest wrote an open letter to \nCEO Mark Zuckerberg.  \nDr. Forrest alleges that scam ads continue to appear on Meta’s platforms in Australia.  \nA big  part of Meta’s business is selling ads. Meta sells ads not only on its own platforms  \nbut also on other channels like third -party websites and apps.  Advertisers and social media users \ninteract with Meta differently. The two groups must agree to different terms, for example.  \nMeta offers a suite of tools for producing ads. Advertisers access these tools  from  a \nseparate platform. The tools prompt advertisers for input. Advertisers must first create a business \npage and supply payment and contact information. They  can then select the goal for an ad and an \naudience to target. Meta also offers tools that can improve the look of ads to increase their appeal. \nMeta does not review ads before they are completed and paid for.  Case 5:22-cv-03699-PCP     Document 121     Filed 06/17/24     Page 2 of 14 \n3 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  Dr. Forrest alleges that Meta’s software ultimate ly determines what completed ads look \nlike and who sees them. One tool, for example, takes the images, videos, text, and audio that the \nadvertiser supplies  and “mixes and matches them” to change how the ad looks and improve \nperformance. Compl. ¶ 120. This tool is enabled by default. It can adjust  the appearance  of an ad \nbased on how likely each viewer  is to respond.  The software can create videos from images and \ncan highlight key phrases from text. Dr. Forrest alleges that at least some of the scam ads he i s \nchallenging were created  using this tool. Another tool use s generative artificial intelligence to \nautomatically optimize an ad so that the audience will be more likely to interact with it. This AI \ntool can add music, fine -tune visuals, and even add 3 -D animation. In addition to determining the \nappearance of an ad, Meta’s software also determines which users are eventually shown the ad.  \nDr. Forrest filed this lawsuit against Meta in September 2021 in California state court. He \nasserts six California state law claims. Meta removed the case to this Court in June 2022. Dr. \nForrest is separately pursuing  a private criminal prosecution against Facebook in Australia. This \ncase was stayed until November 2023 while the Australian proceeding progressed. Dr. Forrest \nthen filed the operative amended complaint, which Meta has moved to dismiss.  \nII. Legal Standard  \nA complaint that does not state a plausible claim upon which relief can be granted can be \ndismissed under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). “A claim has fac ial plausibility when \nthe plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the \ndefendant is liable.” Ashcroft v. Iqbal , 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009). Legal conclusions “must be \nsupported by factual allegations.” Id. at 679. The Court must “accept all factual allegations in the \ncomplaint as true and construe the pleadings in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.” \nRowe v. Educ. Credit Mgmt. Corp. , 559 F.3d 1028, 1029 –30 (9th Cir. 2009).  \nIII. On this Rule 12(b)(6)  Motion, Section 230 Does Not Bar Dr. Forrest’s  Claims . \nSection 230(c)(1) of the Communications Decency Act provides that “[n]o provider … of \nan interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information \nprovided by anothe r information content provider.” 47 U.S.C. § 230. An “interactive computer \nservice” is “any information service, system, or access software provider that provides or enables Case 5:22-cv-03699-PCP     Document 121     Filed 06/17/24     Page 3 of 14 \n4 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  computer access by multiple users to a computer server .” Id. § 230(f). An “informa tion content \nprovider” is “any person or entity that is responsible, in whole or in part, for the creation or \ndevelopment of information provided through the Internet or any other interactive computer \nservice. ” Id. \n“Section 230 (c)(1)  is an affirmative defe nse.” Calise v. Meta Platforms, Inc. , –– F.4th –––, \n2024 WL 2826231, at *3 (9th Cir. 2024).  Meta thus bears t he “burden of showing that § 230(c)(1) \napplies.” Id. To survive a motion to dismiss , plaintiffs “simply need to plead facts demonstrating a \npotential factual dispute that could affect whether the defense applies.” Rabin v. Google LLC , ––– \nF. Supp. 3d –––– , 2024 WL 1269313, at *2 (N.D. Cal. 2024) . “Only when the plaintiff pleads \nitself out of court —that is, admits all the ingredients of an impenetrable defense —may a \ncomplaint that otherwise states a claim be dismissed under Rule 12(b)(6).” Durnford v. \nMusclePharm Corp. , 907 F.3d 595, 604 (9th Cir. 2018) . \nMeta argues that Section 230 bars all  of Dr. Forrest’s claims. But as  explained below, Meta \nhas not established beyond dispute that Section 230 provides an airtight affirmative defense to all \nof Dr. Forrest’s claims. Meta’s motion to dismiss based on Section 230  is therefore denied.  \nA. Section 2 30 Limits Liability in U.S. Courts for Actions Taken Abroad.  \nDr. Forrest first argues that the Section 230 defense is not available to Meta at all in this \ncase because all of the conduct giving rise to his claims took place outside of the United States.  \nThis argument fails because Section 230 establishes a liability rule for litigation in U.S. courts \nrather than a conduct rule that applies to actions taken outside the United States.  \nCourts presume that  U.S. law does not apply extraterritorially. “It is a ba sic premise of our \nlegal system that, in general, United States law governs domestically but does not rule the world.” \nRJR Nabisco, Inc. v. European Cmty. , 579 U.S. 325, 335 (2016) (cleaned up). The Supreme Court \n“has established a two -step framework for d eciding questions of extraterritoriality”:  \n \nThe first step asks whether the presumption against extraterritoriality \nhas been rebutted. It can be rebutted only if the text provides a clear \nindication of an extraterritorial application. If the presumption against \nextraterritoriality has not been rebut ted, the second step … asks \nwhether the case involves a domestic application of the statute . Courts \nmake this determination by identifying the statute ’s focus and asking Case 5:22-cv-03699-PCP     Document 121     Filed 06/17/24     Page 4 of 14 \n5 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  whether the conduct relevant to that focus occurred in United States \nterritory. If it did, then the case involves a permissible domestic \napplication of the statute.   \nWesternGeco LLC v. ION Geophysical Corp. , 585 U.S. 407, 413 (2018) (cleaned up).  \nThe text of Section 230 does not clearly indicate that it applies extraterritorially. \nAccording ly, the question is whether this case involves a domestic application of the statute. As \nthe Ninth Circuit recently reasoned in Gonzalez  v. Google, LLC , Section 230 limits  liability  rather \nthan directly governing behavior . See 2 F.4th 871, 888 (2021) , vacated , 598 U.S. 617 (2023) .2 And \n“because § 230(c)(1) focuses on limiting liability, the relevant conduct occurs where immunity is \nimposed, which is where Congress intended the limit ation of liability to have an effect, rather than \nthe place where the claims principally arose.” Id. This case is being litigated in the United States, \nso applying Section 230 as a defense to liability involves a domestic application of Section 230, \neven i f the actions  that might  otherwise create liability occurred elsewhere.  See id.  Meta is \ntherefore not foreclosed from invoking  Section 230 as a defense  to Dr. Forrest’s allegations.  \nB. Meta Has Not  Establish ed its Section 230 Immunity Beyond Factual  Dispute.  \nMeta argues that Section 230 provides a defense to all of Dr. Forrest’s claims. To invoke \nthis affirmative defense at the pleading stage , Meta must show that Dr. Forrest’s allegations \nestablish beyond disput e: \n(1) that Meta is a “provider … of an  interactive computer service”;  \n(2) that the challenged content is “information provided by another information content \nprovider”; and  \n(3) that Dr. Forrest’s claims “treat” Meta as the “publisher or speaker” of that information.  \nSee Calise , –– F.4th at –––– , 2024 WL 2826231, at *5.  \nAs explained below, Dr. Forrest’s allegations establish that Meta acted as an interactive \ncomputer service provider. But the allegations leave a potential factual dispute as to whether the \n \n2 Because Gonzalez was vacated  (albeit on other grounds ), it is cited only for the persuasivene ss of \nits reasoning . See, e.g ., United States v. Carrillo -Lopez , 68 F.4th 1133, 1142 n.4 (9th Cir. 2023).  Case 5:22-cv-03699-PCP     Document 121     Filed 06/17/24     Page 5 of 14 \n6 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  challenge d ads are provided entirely by another information content provider. Accordingly, Meta \ncannot  establish  based on the pleadings alone that Section 230 provides an impenetrable defense . \n1. The Complaint Establishes that Meta ’s Ad Business Functioned  as an \nInter active Computer Service Provider.  \n \nThe first question  is whether Dr. Forrest’s complaint establishes that Meta is acting as a \n“provider … of an interactive computer service.” Meta argues that courts have “uniformly held \nthat Meta meets Section 230’s ‘inter active computer service provider’ definition.” Motion, Dkt. \nNo. 104, at 15.  In several of the cases Meta relies on, however, this question had been conceded. \nSee, e.g. , Sikhs for Justice  “SFJ”, Inc. v. Facebook, Inc. , 144 F. Supp. 3d 1088, 1093 (N.D. Cal. \n2015). More importantly, whether an entity is an interactive computer service provider depends on \ncontext ; there is no  permanent  all-encompassing “provider” status that indefinitely immunizes any \nentity deemed in a particular  case to be one. As the language of Section 230 and opinions \ninterpreting it make clear , an entity is shielded from liability only in its “ capacity as a provider of \nan interactive computer service.” Rigsby v. GoDaddy Inc. , 59 F.4th 998, 1008 (9th Cir. 2023) \n(emphasis added). That Meta may have been acting in  an interactive -computer -service -provider \ncapacity in the context of one case —or that the parties conceded as much —does not establish that \nMeta is always acting in that capacity in all other contexts. Here, Dr. Forrest disputes whether  \nMeta was acting as an interactive  computer  service  provider  in operating its ad business .3 So Meta \ncan only succeed on its Section 230 defense if Dr. Forrest’s allegations establish beyond dispute \nthat Meta, in the context of these  allegations, was in fact acting as such a provider.  \nThey do so. The complaint alleges that “Meta Ads” “market[s] a nd sell[s] advertising to \nadvertisers targeting the user community.” Compl. ¶ 86. Through Meta’s “Audience Network ,” \naccording to the complaint, advertisers can pay to run ads even on “non -Facebook channels, \nincluding ‘partner’ sites, and third -party affil iated websites or mobile applications.” Compl. ¶ 90.  \n \n3 Dr. Forrest refers to this part of the business as “Meta Ads” for short. Compl. ¶¶ 4, 7. Meta takes \nissue with this shorthand, arguing that “Meta Ad s” is not a distinct entity. Terminology is not what \nmatters, though. Even if Meta Ads may not be a distinct legal entity, Dr. Forrest alleges that it is at \nleast a distinct business  from the other platforms operated by Meta.  Case 5:22-cv-03699-PCP     Document 121     Filed 06/17/24     Page 6 of 14 \n7 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  The complaint specifically alleges that Meta Ads makes it possible for multiple “[c]ustomers \nadvertising in Australia” to “run” ads on Meta’s own social media platforms as well as third -party \nwebsites an d mobile applications. Compl. ¶ ¶ 88–90. These allegations establish that Meta \n“provide [d] or enable [d] computer access by multiple users to a computer server ” in operating its \nad business, making it an interactive computer service for the purposes of Secti on 230.4 \nAs the Ninth Circuit has noted, the definition of “interactive computer service” is \n“relatively expansive.” Rigsby , 59 F.4th at 1007. The Ninth Circuit has recognized that this term \n“has been construed broadly to effectuate the statute’s speech -protective purpose.” Id. (quoting \nRicci v. Teamsters Union Local 456 , 781 F.3d 25 , 28 (2d Cir. 2015) ). Ultimately, e ven interpreting \nDr. Forrest’s allegations in the light most favorable to him, the complaint’s allegations  are \nsufficient to establish beyond any factual dispute that Meta is acting in an interactive -computer -\nservice -provider capacity in operating its advertising business. Meta can therefore establish the \nfirst element of a Section 230 defense.  \n2. The Complaint Does Not Establish that the Challenged Ads Were \nProvided Exclusively b y Another Information Content Provider.  \n \nThe next question is whether the challenged ads are limited to “information provided by \nanother  information co ntent provider .” 47 U.S.C. §  230(c) (emphasis added).  An “information \ncontent provider” is any entity “ responsible, in whole or in part, for the creation or development of \ninformation provided through … any other interactive computer service .” Id. § 230(f) . “[A]n \n‘interactive computer service’ qualifies for immunity” only for statements or publications for \nwhich the service “does not also function as an ‘information content provider.’” Rigsby , 59 F.4th \nat 1007. A provider “may lose immunity … by making a ma terial contribution to the creation or \ndevelopment of content.” Kimzey v. Yelp! Inc. , 836 F.3d 1263, 1269 (9th Cir. 2016).  Meta \ntherefore cannot invoke Section 230 to protect it from  claims that “treat it as the publisher or \nspeaker of its own content —or content that it created or developed in whole or in part —rather than \n \n4 The complaint asserts that Meta Ads does not “provide or enable computer access by multiple \nusers to a computer  server within the meaning of 47 U.S.C. § 203(f)(2) ,” Compl. ¶ 91, but this is a \nlegal conclusion which the Court can ignore at this stage.  Case 5:22-cv-03699-PCP     Document 121     Filed 06/17/24     Page 7 of 14 \n8 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  the publisher or speaker of entirely third -party content.” Calise , –– F.4th at –––, 2024 WL \n2826231, at *9.  \nDr. Forrest’s complaint does not allege that the scam ads are Meta’s “own conten t” or that \nMeta created them entirely on its o wn, but he does allege that Meta contributed to their \nproduction. The important question , however,  is whether he sufficiently alleges that Meta \n“materially  contributed” to the creation of the ads. Calise , –– F.4th at –––, 2024 WL 2826231, at \n*9 (emphasis added). The Ninth Circuit has “interpreted the phrase ‘creation or development in \nwhole or in part’ in § 230(f)(3) to mean that a website helps to develop u nlawful content if it \ncontributes materially to the alleged illegality of the conduct.” Id. (cleaned up).  In other words, the \nservice  must specifically contribute to the aspect of the content that is allegedly illegal.  \nHere, Dr. Forrest’s complaint allege s that Meta “produces … ads using basic material \nsupplied by criminal scammers to its automated Ads Manager application.” Compl. ¶ 4. It alleges \nthat “Meta’s Ads Manager software drives and ultimately determines what the completed, paid -for \nads will look l ike.” Compl. ¶ 119. The complaint also alleges that Meta offers several additional \ntools that can automatically adjust the appearance and content of an ad, including by “mix[ing] \nand match[ing]” ad components like images, videos, text, and audio and by using generative \nartificial intelligence to “automatically optimize[] ads to versions the audience is more likely to \ninteract with.” Compl. ¶ ¶ 120–23 (cleaned up).  \nMeta counters that these allegations are “erroneous[].” Motion at 16, and argues that many \nof Dr. Forrest’s allegations do not establish that Meta develops the ads it publishes.  But t his is a \nquintessential factual disagreement , and the Court must at this stage draw all reasonable inferences \nin Dr. Forrest’s favor.  Although Dr. Forrest does not cle arly allege how Meta’s ad tools work or \ncontribute to the challenged ads, he does allege that the tools affect ad content in a manner that \ncould at least potentially contribute to their illegality.  Dr. Forrest  alleges  not simply that Meta \nprovided “neutral  tools” which may have been used by other parties for “unlawful purposes ,” cf. \nCalise , –– F.4th at –––, 2024 WL 2826231, at *9 –10, but that  Meta  has “active involvement” in \ndeciding what ads look like and who they are shown to and that its automated tools “supercharge \nMeta’s ability to produce and drive the Scam Ads to vulnerable viewers,” which has “been a Case 5:22-cv-03699-PCP     Document 121     Filed 06/17/24     Page 8 of 14 \n9 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  substantial factor in the continuing product ion, dissemination, and success” of the challenged ads. \nCompl. ¶¶  126, 135. These allegations present a factual dispute regarding whether Meta’s ad \nsystems were neutral tools that anyone could use (or misuse) or whether the tools themselves \ncontributed to the content of the ads, including to the aspects of the content that are allegedly \nillegal. M eta has not demonstrated that there can be no dispute, based on the allegations in the \ncomplaint, that all of the scam ads are in fact exclusively provided by anot her information content \nprovider  or that Meta’s only contributions to the ads are entirely unrelated to the aspects of the ads \nthat allegedly make them illegal . Meta has therefore failed to meet its burden of establishing a \nSection 230 affirmative defense for purposes of this Rule 12(b)(6) motion . \nIV. Dr. Forrest Has Adequately Pleaded Some of  His Claims.  \nDr. Forrest asserts six California state law claims against Meta. The parties do not dispute \nthat California law governs each of these claims. Dr. Forrest has agreed to dismiss his promissory \nestoppel claim voluntarily without prejudice subject to a tolling agreement. Meta has moved to \ndismiss the five remaining claims. For the following reasons, Meta’s motion to dismiss the \nmisappropriation and negligence clai ms is denied, but its motion to dismiss the negligent failure to \nwarn, unjust enrichment, and declaratory judgment claims is granted.  \nA. The Misappropriation Claim Is Adequately Pleaded.  \nDr. Forrest’s first cause of action is a California common law claim for  misappropriation \nof his name and likeness.  Under California law, a “ common law misappropriation claim is pleaded \nby alleging: (1) the defendant’s use of the plaintiff’s identity; (2) the appropriation of plaintiff’s \nname or likeness to defendant ’s advanta ge, commercially or otherwise; (3) lack of consent; and (4) \nresulting injury.” Maxwell v. Dolezal , 231 Cal. App. 4th 93, 97 (2014).  Meta argues that Dr. \nForrest has failed to adequately plead the first two elements.  \nFirst, Meta argues that Dr. Forrest has not alleged facts showing that Meta , as opposed to \nthe users  who created the ads at issue,  ever “used” Dr. Forrest’s identity. This argument parallels \nMeta’s claim that the ads were provided entirely by other information content providers. This is \nagain  a factual dispute that the Court cannot resolve in Meta’s favor at this stage.  Case 5:22-cv-03699-PCP     Document 121     Filed 06/17/24     Page 9 of 14 \n10 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  The cases Meta relies on are distinguishable. In Cross v. Facebook, Inc. , for example, the \nCalifornia Court of Appeal considered a complaint alleging that Facebook displayed  ads alongside  \nFacebook pages that had been created by third parties. 14 Cal. App. 5th 190, 209 (2017). The \ncourt concluded that the allegation that Facebook “displayed advertisements next to pages created \nby third parties who were using [plaintif f’s] name and likeness to critique his business practices” \nwas not sufficient to establish that Facebook, rather than these third parties, had used the \nplaintiff’s identity. Id. Here, though, the allegations are not just that Meta “displayed unrelated ads \n… adjacent to … content that allegedly used [plaintiff’s] name and likeness” and that  was “created \nby third -party users.” See id. Instead, Dr. Forrest claims that Meta itself played a role in producing \nthe ads —ads which themselves allegedly misappropriated  Dr. Forrest’s identity. At this stage, Dr. \nForrest has adequately pleaded the use element of his misappropriation claim.  \n Second, Meta argues that Dr. Forrest has failed to allege that Meta misappropriated his \nidentity to its own advantage. Obviously , Meta derives some benefit when it is paid to display ads. \nBut the question is whether specifically including Dr. Forrest’s likeness in the content of an ad \nprovided any additional benefit to Meta, or whether the “benefit … received —payment for the \nadvertising  space —was unrelated to the contents of the advertisement.” See Newcombe v. Adolf \nCoors Co. , 157 F.3d 686, 693 (9th Cir. 1998).  Dr. Forrest asserts that “Meta gained a commercial \nadvantage through its misappropriation because the Scam Ads kept its users en gaged due to public \ninterest in Dr. Forrest.” Compl. ¶  218. Dr. Forrest distinguishes digital advertising from traditional \nprint ads or billboards, asserting that “Meta profits from engagement,” and that because “Dr. \nForrest is a well -known public figure, … ads featuring him and his image generate engagement.” \nCompl. ¶  118. In other words, Dr. Forrest claims that Meta profited more  from ads that included \nhis likeness than it would have if the ads had not . This is enough to adequately plead that the \nalleged misappropriation was to Meta’s advantage.  \nSeparately, Meta argues that Dr. Forrest’s misappropriation claim, which has a two -year \nstatute of limitations, is time barred because it accrued in 2014 when it first came to Dr. Forrest’s \nattention that his image  was being used on Facebook. This argument fails. Although the complaint \nalleges that Dr. Forrest’s learned beginning in 2014 that his image was being used by scammers Case 5:22-cv-03699-PCP     Document 121     Filed 06/17/24     Page 10 of 14 \n11 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  setting up “imposter” pages purporting to belong to Dr. Forrest, that is not the alleged  \nmisappropriation  that underl ies this claim. Instead, Dr. Forrest’s claim is based on the alleged use \nof his identity in ads  as opposed to pages , and the complaint alleges that Dr. Forrest learned about \nthese ads around March 2019. Although under the “sing le-publication rule” a plaintiff is limited to \na single potential action “for any single edition” of a publication,  “[t]he rule does not address the \nissue of repeated publications of the same … material over a substantial period of time.” See \nChristoff v. Nestle USA, Inc. , 47 Cal. 4th 468, 478, 481 (2009). And here, while Dr. Forrest does \nassert that both imposter pages and scam ads on Facebook misappropriated his identity, the \nallegations do not suggest that these various uses of his likeness constituted e ven repeated \npublications of the same material as opposed to different material. Accordingly, the complaint \ndoes not establish that Dr. Forrest’s misappropriation claim is time barred.  \n Because each of its challenges fail s at this stage, Meta’s motion to d ismiss the \nmisappropriation claim is denied.  \nB. The Negligence  Claim Is Adequately Pleaded.  \nDr. Forrest’s next claim is for negligence. He asserts that Meta breached its duty to the \ngeneral public, including Dr. Forrest, to design and run its ad business in a “commercially \nreasonable manner,” a duty it breached in several ways, including producin g the challenged ads, \noperating  in a way that facilitated scam ads, and using  defective screening and review procedures.  \n“To state a claim for negligence in California, a plaintiff must establish the following \nelements: (1) the defendant had a duty, or an obligation to conform to a certain standard of \nconduct for the protection of others against unreasonable risks, (2) the defendant breached that \nduty, (3) that breach proximately caused the plaintiff’s injuries, and (4) damages.” Dent v. Nat ’l \nFootball Lea gue, 902 F.3d 1109, 1117 (9th Cir. 2018).  \nThere is a “statutory presumption of duty” in California. Modisette v. Apple Inc. , 30 Cal. \nApp. 5th 136, 144 (2018). “The general rule in California is that everyone is responsible for an \ninjury occasioned to another by his or her want of ordinary care or skill in the management of his \nor her property or person. In other words, each pe rson has a duty to use ordinary care and is liable \nfor injuries caused by his failure to exercise reasonable care in the circumstances.” Cabral v. Case 5:22-cv-03699-PCP     Document 121     Filed 06/17/24     Page 11 of 14 \n12 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  Ralphs Grocery Co. , 51 Cal. 4th 764, 771 (2011) (cleaned up). The rule is codified in Section \n1714 of the Civ il Code, which provides: “Everyone is responsible, not only for the result of his or \nher willful acts, but also for an injury occasioned to another by his or her want of ordinary care or \nskill in the management of his or her property or person.”  \n“The court  may depart from the general rule of duty ... if other policy considerations \nclearly require an exception.” Regents of Univ. of Cal. v. Super. Ct. , 4 Cal. 5th 607, 628 (2018). \nFactors that can “justify excusing or limiting a defendant’s duty of care” inclu de “the \nforeseeability of harm to the plaintiff, the degree of certainty that the plaintiff suffered injury, the \ncloseness of the connection between the defendant’s conduct and the injury suffered, the moral \nblame attached to the defendant’s conduct, the p olicy of preventing future harm, the extent of the \nburden to the defendant and consequences to the community of imposing a duty to exercise care \nwith resulting liability for breach, and the availability, cost, and prevalence of insurance for the \nrisk invol ved.” Id. (quoting Rowland v. Christian , 69 Cal. 2d 108, 113 (Cal. 1968)).  \nMeta does not argue that an exception from the general presumption of duty is warranted \nhere under the Rowland factors. Instead, Meta again argues that the complaint establishes tha t the \nchallenged ads were entirely created by third parties, and that Meta is under no duty to control the \nconduct of third parties except in the presence of a special relationship.  But this is again a \npremature factual retort to Dr. Forrest’s allegation t hat Meta did play an active role in creating the \nads he challenges. Meta provides no other basis for dismissing Dr. Forrest’s general negligence \nclaim, so its motion to dismiss this claim is denied. And because Dr. Forrest has plausibly alleged \nthat Meta played  an active role in creating the ads at issue, the Court need not at this stage decide \nwhether Dr. Forrest has alleged a relationship between Meta and its users sufficient to impose \nupon Meta a duty to control third -party advertisers  even if it did not  help create the ads . \nC. The Negligent Failure To Warn  Claim Is Dismissed with Leave To Amend.  \nDr. Forrest next claims that Meta negligently failed to warn its Australian users that the \nchallenged ads were fraudulent. Dr. Forrest asserts that because Meta failed to warn its users about \nthe ads, Dr. Forrest (and not just the unwarned users) suffered monetary and other harms.  Case 5:22-cv-03699-PCP     Document 121     Filed 06/17/24     Page 12 of 14 \n13 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  As an initial matter, to the exten t Dr. Forrest challenges Meta’s failure to warn based on \nMeta’s own involvement in producing the challenged ads, this claim merges with his general \nnegligence claim against Meta.  Although the com plaint is not entirely clear, the Court therefore \ninterprets the failure -to-warn claim as challenging only Meta’s failure to warn its users about \ncontent provided by third parties.  \n“[A]s a general rule, one person owe[s] no duty to control the conduc t of another, nor to \nwarn those endangered by such conduct, ” but “ the courts have carved out an exception to this rule \nin cases in which the defendant stands in some special relationship to either the person whose \nconduct needs to be controlled or in a rel ationship to the foreseeable victim of that conduct.” \nTarasoff v. Regents of Univ. of Cal., 17 Cal. 3d 425, 435 (1976)  (cleaned up) . \nAs alleged here , the people “whose conduct needs to be controlled” are the third -party \nadvertisers, and the primary “forese eable victim[s] of that conduct” are Meta’s Australian users. \nAt most, Dr. Forrest is a secondary victim, harmed only indirectly based on  the direct injury to \nmisled Meta users. Although Dr. Forrest argues that there was a sufficient “special relationship”  \nbetween himself and Meta, the question under Tarasoff is whether there was a special relationship \nbetween either Meta and third -party advertisers or between Meta and its users that would place it \nunder a duty to warn  users about actions taken by advertise rs. On this question Dr. Forrest’s \nallegations as now formulated are not clear, nor is the chain of causation between Meta’s alleged \nfailure to warn users and any harm to Dr. Forrest himself. The negligent failure to warn claim is \ntherefore dismissed with leave to amend.  \nD. The Unjust Enrichment  Claim Is Dismissed With Leave To Amend.  \nDr. Forrest next asserts a claim for unjust enrichment and seeks disgorgement of Meta’s  \nrevenue from the challenged ads . Meta argues that this claim merely duplicates Dr. Forrest ’s legal \nclaims.  Meta is wrong that restitutionary claims must be dismissed at the pleading stage whenever \nthey parallel tort or other legal claims . See Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(d)(2). But to state a claim  Dr. Forrest \nmust assert that the remedies available for his legal claims will be inadequate. See In re Meta Pixel \nTax Filing Cases , ––– F. Supp. 3d –––– , 2024 WL 1251350, at *9 (N.D. Cal. 2024)  (discussing Case 5:22-cv-03699-PCP     Document 121     Filed 06/17/24     Page 13 of 14 \n14 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  Sonner  v. Premier Nutrition Corp. , 971 F.3d 834 , 844 (9th Cir. 2020)) . Because he has not done \nso, the unjust enrichment claim is dismissed with leave to amend.  \nE. The Declaratory Judgment  Is Dismissed Without Leave To Amend.  \nDr. Forrest’s final claim seeks a declaratory judgment that Meta cannot assert a  Section \n230 defense to his other claims. This question will necessarily be litigated in resolving those other \nclaims. Accordingly, the declaratory judgment claim is duplicative  and will be dismissed . This \ndismissal is without leave to amend and without pr ejudice to any arguments either party might \nraise regarding Section 230 defense at a later stage.  \nV. Conclusion  \nFor the foregoing reasons, Meta’s motion to dismiss is granted in part . An amended \ncomplaint, should Dr. Forrest wish to file one  addressing the cl aims that have been dismissed with \nleave to amend , will be due July 11, 2024.  \nBoth discovery and Meta’s deadline to answer Dr. Forrest’s complaint are currently stayed. \nBy July 1 , 2024 , Meta may file a motion of up to five pages requesting that this stay b e extended \nand indicating the status of the Australian proceedings. If no motion is filed by that date, the stay \nwill be lifted in full and Meta’s answer to the present complaint (or response to any amended \ncomplaint, if  one is  filed) will be due  July 25, 2024.  \n \nIT IS SO ORDERED.  \nDated:  June 17, 2024  \n  \nP.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: The court denied Defendant Estes Carter Thompson III's motion to dismiss charges related to child sexual exploitation and possession of child pornography. The case involved the alleged use of Thompson’s cellphone to secretly record minors in airplane bathrooms and the possession of AI-generated images of child pornography discovered in Thompson's iCloud account. The court found the indictment sufficiently specific and held that venue was proper in Massachusetts where the plane landed, not just where the acts were initiated.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the indictment was sufficiently specific and stated a valid offense, whether the venue was proper in the District of Massachusetts, and the nature of the alleged conduct regarding the use of AI-generated images.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court held that the indictment was sufficiently specific and stated a valid offense by adequately apprising Thompson of the charges against him. The venue in the District of Massachusetts was proper as the crime involved interstate transportation, making the landing district suitable for trial. The allegations about AI images did not form the basis of the charges and thus did not affect the indictment's validity.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine you're on an airplane, and a staff member uses hidden cameras to record people in the bathroom—that’s what the defendant is accused of, along with having creepy computer-made child pictures. He argued that the court papers weren’t clear about what he's being accused of, and that the case shouldn't be tried in Massachusetts because the plane only landed there. The judge said no to both points because the papers were clear enough, and since the plane landed in Massachusetts, it's a good place for the trial.",

The government alleges that, while working as a flight attendant, \nThompson escorted a fourteen- year-old passenger  from the main cabin to a first- class bathroom of \nthe airplane and, utilizing  a cellphone that he had attached to the toilet seat  lid, sought to secretly \nrecord her using the toilet. It also alleges that a subsequent search of Thompson’s iCloud account \nuncovered videos of other minors using airplane  bathrooms , as a well as  sexually explicit images \nof children  apparently created through an artificial intelligence (“AI”) website.  \nPending before the Court is Thompson’s motion  to dismiss the indictment. He contends  \nthat the indictment lacks sufficient specificity  and fails to state an offense, and that venue in the Case 1:24-cr-10107-JEK     Document 63     Filed 12/18/24     Page 1 of 192 District of Massachusetts is improper . For the reasons that follow , the Court disagrees and will \ndeny his motion  to dismiss.  \nBACKGROUND \nThe f\nollowing facts, drawn from “the allegations of the indictment and the unchallenged \nstatement of proof of the prosecutor ,” are “accepted as true ” for purposes of the motion to dismiss. \nUnited States v. Ferris , 807 F.2d 269, 271 (1st Cir. 1986). \nOn September 2, 2023, Thompson was working as an American Airlines flight attendant \non a flight from Charlotte, North Carolina to Boston, Massachusetts. ECF 4- 1, ¶ 6. About halfway \nthrough the flight, a fourteen -year-old girl, “Minor A,” was waiting to use the bathroom in the \nmain cabin. Id.  ¶¶ 6, 7(a). A male flight attendant, later identified as Thompson, approached her, \ntold her that she could use the first -class bathroom , and escorted her there. Id.  ¶ 7(a). He then  \nexplained that the toilet seat was broken and that he had to wash his hands in the bathroom before \nshe could use it. Id.  Once Thompson finished using the bathroom , Minor A  entered and  observed \nred stickers on the underside of the open lid of the toilet seat. Id. ¶¶ 7(a) -(b). The stickers  read \n“INOPE RATIVE CATERING EQUIPMENT” and “REMOVE FROM SERVICE ,” and one of \nthe stickers bore a handwritten note stating , “SEAT BROKEN.” Id. ¶¶ 7(a), (b), (f). Minor A  \nremoved or pulled down her shorts and underwear to use the toilet. Id.  ¶ 7(b). When Minor A was \ndone, she got dressed, flushed the toilet, and then noticed an iPhone that was illuminated and \nprotruding from underneath the stickers. Id.  ¶¶ 7(c), (f). She took a picture of the scene on her \nphone. Id. After Minor A exited, Thompson jumped in front of a waiting first-class passenger and \nreentered the bathroom. Id. ¶¶ 7(d), 11 -12. \nWhen Minor A returned to her seat, she showed her mother  the photograph of the toilet \nseat and explained what had happened. Id. ¶ 7(d). Minor A’s mother told a flight attendant and Case 1:24-cr-10107-JEK     Document 63     Filed 12/18/24     Page 2 of 193 Minor A’s father about the incident. Id. ¶¶ 13- 15. Minor A’s father approached the other three \nflight attendants, including Thompson, who was the only male  flight attendant  on board, and \ndemanded to see Thompson’s phone. Id. ¶¶ 7(e), 15-16. Thompson retrieved his iPhone from his \nsuitcase in the overhead bin and scrolled through it for ten to fifteen seconds before Minor A’s \nfather grab bed it. Id. ¶ 16. Once Thompson unlocked his iPhone, another flight attendant reviewed \nhis photos app and observed content in it, but was unable to determine what was  displayed in the \nimages.  Id. ¶¶ 17- 18. She and one of  the other flight attendant s notified the captain about the \nsituation , which was conveyed to law enforcement on the ground. Id. ¶ 19. Thompson then locked \nhimself in the first- class bathroom for three to five minutes and exited as the flight was beginning \nits descent. Id. ¶ 20.       \nTroopers from the Massachusetts State Polic e spoke with Thompson when the plane \nlanded. Id. ¶ 21. Thompson consented to an initial search of his iPhone. Id.  One of the  troopers \nfound that Thompson’s iPhone contained no  photos, videos, text messages, or phone calls , and it \nappeared to  have been restored to  its factory settings. Id.  The phone did display Thompson’s name \nand was actively linked to an Apple iCloud account with an Apple ID email address. Id. The \nFederal Bureau of Investigation ( “FBI”) retained Thompson’s iPhone and suitcase in its  custody \npending its application s for a search warrant. Id.  ¶ 22. \nSeventeen days later, o n September 19, 2023, the FBI obtained search warrant s for \nThompson’s iPhone, suitcase, and iCloud account. Id.  ¶¶ 23 -25. Upon executing the search \nwarrants, officers  discovered eleven red stickers in Thompson’s suitcase, like the ones that Minor \nA had observed in the first -class bathroom. Id. ¶ 23. O fficers  also confirmed that , while connected \nto the airplane’s Wi -Fi, Thompson’s iPhone had been reset to factory settings  by the Apple ID \nlinked with Thompson’s iCloud account  approximately thirty  minutes after Minor A took a picture Case 1:24-cr-10107-JEK     Document 63     Filed 12/18/24     Page 3 of 194 of the upturned toilet seat. Id. ¶ 24. The search of Thompson’s iCloud account revealed, among \nother things, recordings and pictures of four additional  minors in air plane bathrooms , with the ir \nbuttocks and genital ia visible . Id. ¶¶ 26 -45. The iCloud account also contained sexually explicit \nimages of children  that appeared to have been AI generated. Id.  ¶ 47. \nIn January 2024, Thompson was arrested in the Western District of Virginia and charged \nby criminal complaint in the District of Massachusetts with two counts: sexual exploitation and  \nattempted exploitation of children , in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 2251(a) and (e) (Count One ), and \npossession and attempted possession of child pornography depicting a prepubescent minor , in \nviolation of 18 U.S.C. § § 2252A(a)(5)(B)  and (b)(2 ) (Count Two) . ECF 4, 6, 7. Thompson was \nindicted on the same charges on April 25, 2024. ECF 16, 19. On October 11, 2024, Thompson \nmoved to dismiss the indictment. ECF 48. After receiving the government ’s oppos ition and \nThompson’s reply, the Court held a hearing on the motion on November 20, 2024. ECF 51, 54, \n57. \nDISCUSSION  \nI. Sufficiency of the Indictment . \n Thompson contends that the indictment’s lack of specificity violates Federal Rule of \nCriminal Procedure 7(c)(1), his Fifth Amendment protection against double jeopardy, and his \nSixth Amendment right to notice of “ the nature and cause of the accusation” against him. Under \nRule 7(c)(1 ), which effectuates th ose constitutional protections, a n indictment  must contain “a \nplain, concise, and definite written statement of the essential facts constituting the offense charged.” Fed. R. Crim. P. 7(c)(1). To satisfy these requirement s, the indictment “ need only outline \n‘the elements of the crime and the nature of the charge so that the defendant can prepare a defense \nand plead double jeopardy in any future prosecution for the same offense.’” United States v. Case 1:24-cr-10107-JEK     Document 63     Filed 12/18/24     Page 4 of 195 Stepanets , 879 F.3d 367, 372 (1st Cir. 2018)  (quoting United States v. Guerrier , 669 F.3d 1, 3 (1st \nCir. 2011)). Instructive here, the First Circuit held  in United States v. Cameron that a sixteen -count \nindictment charging child pornography- related offenses  was “sufficient ” because “each count of \nthe indictment included . . . a description of the offense that tracks the language of the relevant \nstatute, the date of the offense, the type of child pornography involved (digital images), and the \nmeans by which [the defendant ] either transported (for example, by uploading to a specified \nYahoo! Photos album), received, or possessed the child pornography in question.” 699 F.3d 621, \n635 (1st Cir. 2012).  The indictment in this case is sufficiently specific about the two charges  against Thompson. \nCount One  describes  the alleged  sexual exploitation or attempted exploitation of children offense \nin language that tracks  the language of 18 U.S.C. § 2251(a); provides the date of the offense  as \n“[o]n or about September 2, 2023”;  specifies the location of  the offense as  “the District of \nMassachusetts, and elsewhere”; and identifies the  victim as “‘Minor A’ (YOB 2009) .” ECF 19, at \n1-2; see United States v. Poulin, 588 F. Supp. 2d 64, 66- 67 (D. Me. 2008)  (upholding a similar \nindictment charging a violation of 18 U.S.C. § 225 1(a)). Thompson nonetheless maintains that \nCount One  improperly repeats generic statutory language without any supporting factual \nallegations about, for example, what he did to employ, use, persuade, induce, entice, or  coerce \nMinor A  under 18 U.S.C. § 2251(a) . Rule 7(c)(1) do es not require  such specificity.  An indictment \nneed only “ ‘apprise the defendant of the charged offense, ’” not force “ ‘the government [to] \npresen [t] enough evidence to support the charge.’ ” United States v. Ngige , 780 F.3d 497, 502 (1st \nCir. 2015) ( quoting United States v. Savarese , 686 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir.  2012) ). Count One  is “legally \nsufficient ” because it “tracks [the]  statute ’s terms ” and “ gives [Thompson] adequate notice of the \ncharg [e]” against him.  Stepanets , 879 F.3d at 372. Case 1:24-cr-10107-JEK     Document 63     Filed 12/18/24     Page 5 of 196 Count Two likewise  describes  the possession or attempted possession of child pornography \noffense in language that tracks  18 U.S.C. § 2252A(a)(5)(B) ; identifies the date of the offense as \n“[o]n or about September 2, 2023”; states  that the offense occurred in “Massachusetts, and \nelsewhere”; and explains that the offense “involved a prepubescent minor and a minor who had \nnot attained 12 years of age .” ECF 19, at 3. In Thompson’s view, Count Two is insufficiently \nspecific because it does not identify the means by which he allegedly possessed child pornography. \nIn Cameron, the indictment additional ly specified  that the defendant possessed “digital images ” in \na “Yahoo! Photos album .” 699 F.3d at 635. But Cameron he ld that these details were  “sufficient,” \nnot necessary, to apprise the defendant of the nature of the charge  pending against him. See id. \nNor, contrary to Thompson’s argument, does Rule 7(c)(1) require the indictment to identify the specific images of child p ornography he allegedly possessed or attempted to possess. See id.  \n(rejecting the argument that Rule 7(c)(1) “ requires such specificity ” about “ the specific images \nthat [the]  offense was based on ”). Count Two, like Count One , provides Thompson with adequate  \nnotice of the time, place, and manner of the charged offense , such that he “‘can prepare a defense \nand plead double jeopardy in any future prosecution for the same offense.’ ” United States v. \nRodríguez- Rivera , 918 F.3d 32, 34 (1st Cir. 2019) (quoting Stepanets , 879 F.3d at  372).   \nThompson separately  contends that the indictment fails to  specify whether Count Two is \npremised on photos and videos of minor children taken on airplanes , or instead on AI -generated \nchild pornography. But the indictment refers specifically to “ one and more images of . . . a \nprepubescent minor and a minor who had not attained 12 years of age.” ECF 19, at 3. The relevant statute, in turn, defines “minor” as “ any person  under the age of eighteen years .” 18 U .S.C. \n§ 2256(1) (emphasis added). T he indictment  thus gives Thompson adequate notice that the images \nin question involve a real minor, not one generated by artificial intelligence . Indeed, settled case Case 1:24-cr-10107-JEK     Document 63     Filed 12/18/24     Page 6 of 197 law establish es that, in a prosecution for a child pornography offense, the government “must prove \nbeyond a reasonable doubt that the image is of an actual child in order to establish guilt.”  United \nStates v. Rodriguez -Pacheco , 475 F.3d 434, 439 (1st Cir. 2007); see also Ashcroft v. Free Speech \nCoal., 535 U.S. 234, 250 (2002); United States v. LaFortune , 520 F.3d 50, 53- 54 (1st Cir. 2008). \nAnd c onsistent with the indictment, the government asserts in opposing the motion to dismiss  that \nCount Two is not based on any AI-generated images. ECF 51, at 7 n.4. \nThompson alternatively requests that , even if the indictment is sufficient,  the government \nbe ordered to produce a bill of particulars. Under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 7(f), “[t]he \ncourt may direct the government to file a bill of particulars.” Fed. R. Crim. P. 7(f). A motion for a bill of particulars should “be granted only if the accused, in the absence of a more detailed specification, will be disabled from preparing a defense, caught by unfair surprise at trial, or hampered in seeking the shelter of the Double Jeopardy Clause.” United States v. Sepulveda, 15 F.3d 1161, 1192- 93 (1st Cir. 1993). In determining whether to grant a request for a bill of \nparticulars , courts can consider what the government has produced beyond the indictment itself. \nSee United States v. Nelson-Rodriguez , 319 F.3d 12, 30-31 (1st Cir. 2003). \nThompson seeks a bill of particulars that provides specific factual allegations about which \nof his actions form the basis for the two charged offenses and what conduct occurred in Massachusetts. But, as explained, the indictment adequately apprises Thompson of the nature of \nthe charges. He has also been able to review the criminal complaint and accompanying affidavit, the discovery provided, and the government’s brief on this motion. In light of these materials, Thompson is “not lack[ing] a fair opportunity to prepare a defense absent a bill of particulars.” Id.  \nat 31. Given that more information is not “necessary to enable him to prepare his defense, to avoid Case 1:24-cr-10107-JEK     Document 63     Filed 12/18/24     Page 7 of 198 surprise at trial, [or] to protect against double jeopardy,” Thompson’s request for a bill of \nparticulars is denied. United States v. Paiva, 892 F.2d 148, 154 (1st Cir. 1989).  \nII. Failure to State an Offense.  \n Thompson next contends that the indictment fails to state an offense because, as a matter \nof law, surreptitious recordings of children using the toilet do not  involve “sexually explicit \nconduct.” The statute under which Thompson is charged in Count One  provides, in relevant part, \nthat “[a] ny person who employs, uses, persuades, induces, entices, or coerces any minor to engage \nin . . . any sexually explicit conduct for the purpose of producing any visual depiction of such \nconduct or for the purpose of transmitting a live visual depiction of such conduct, shall be punished \nas provided under subsection (e).” 18 U.S.C. § 2251(a). The statute under which Thompson is \ncharged in  Count Two criminalizes knowing possession of , or knowing access with intent to view , \n“child pornography.” Id. § 2252A(a)(5)(B). “Child pornography”  is, in turn, defined as “any visual \ndepiction, including any photograph, film, video, picture, or computer or computer -generated \nimage or picture, . . . of sexually explicit conduct, where . . . the production of such visual depiction involves the use of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct.” Id.  § 2256(8)(A). \nBoth counts thus require the images or recordings at issue to depict “sexually explicit conduct.”\n1  \n T he term “sexually explicit conduct” is  defined, in relevant part , as “lascivious exhibition \nof the anus, genitals, or pubic area of any person.” Id.  § 2256(2)(A) (v). The phrase “lascivious \nexhibition” is not itself defined by statute, but the First Circuit has described it as a “commonsensical term.” United States v. Charriez -Rolón, 923 F.3d 45, 52 (1st Cir. 2019)  \n \n1 Both counts also charge attempt under 18 U.S.C. § 2251(e) and 18 U.S.C. § 2252A(b)(2), \nrespectively. “‘To prove attempt, the government must establish both an intent to commit  the \nsubstantive offense and a substantial step towards its commission.’” United  States v. Turner , 501 \nF.3d 59, 68 (1st  Cir. 2007) (quoting United  States v.  Burgos , 254 F.3d 8, 12  (1st Cir. 2001) ). Case 1:24-cr-10107-JEK     Document 63     Filed 12/18/24     Page 8 of 199 (quotation marks omitted) . Although “there is no exclusive list of factors . . . that must be met for \nan image (or a film) to be lascivious,” the following factors, dubbed the “ Dost -factors” based on \nthe case that first enumerated them,2 are generally relevant:  \n(1) whether the genitals or pubic area are the focal point of the image; (2) whether \nthe setting of the image is sexually suggestive (i.e., a location generally associated \nwith sexual activity); (3) whether the child is depicted in an unnatural pose or \ninappropriate attire considering her [or his] age; (4) whether the child is fully or \npartially clothed, or nude; (5) whether the image suggests sexual coyness or \nwillingness to engage in sexual activity; and (6) whether the image is intended or \ndesigned to elicit a sexual response in the viewer. \n \nId. (quotation marks omitted). These factors are not, however, “ comprehensive [o]r necessarily \napplicable in every situation.” United States v. Amirault , 173 F.3d 28, 32 (1st Cir. 1999). N ot every \nfactor must be present for a depiction to be lascivious, see United States v. Frabizio, 459 F.3d 80, \n90 (1st Cir. 2006), and “there may be other factors that are equally if not more important ,” \nAmirault , 173 F.3d at 32. In all instances, the inquiry is case- specific.  \n Thompson’s contention that the indictment fails to charge lascivious exhibition relies on \nthe D.C. Circuit’s decision in United States v. Hillie , 14 F.4th 677 (D.C. Cir. 2021). The Court in \nHillie  construed the statutory phrase “lascivious exhibition” against the backdrop of a string of \nSupreme Court decisions —New York v. Ferber , 458 U.S. 747 (1982), United States v. X -Citement \nVideo, Inc., 513 U.S. 64 (1994), and United States v. Williams , 553 U.S. 285 (2008) —involving \nFirst Amendment overbreadth and other challenges to statutes that regulate child pornography. See  \nHillie , 14 F.4th at 684 -88. As the D.C. Circuit understood those decisions, to avoid an overbreadth \nproblem, statutes criminalizing possession of images depicting “lascivious exhibition” must \nregulate only the “‘the hard core of child pornography.’” Id.  at 686 (quoting Ferber , 458 U.S. at \n \n2 See United States v. Dost , 636 F. Supp. 828, 832 (S.D. Cal. 1986), aff’d sub nom. United \nStates v. Wiegand, 812 F.2d 1239, 1244 (9th Cir. 1987). Case 1:24-cr-10107-JEK     Document 63     Filed 12/18/24     Page 9 of 1910 764-65). In accordance with that understanding, the majority opinion in Hillie  construed the phrase \n“lascivious exhibition” to “cover visual depictions in which a minor, or someone interacting with \na minor, engages in conduct displaying their anus, genitalia, or pubic area in a lustful manner that \nconnotes the commission of sexual i ntercourse, bestiality, masturbation, or sadistic or masochistic \nabuse.” Id. at 687. And it determined that because the Dost  factors did not align with its statutory \nconstruction, trial courts should not instruct the jury on the Dost factors as a matter of course, but \nthat evidence pertaining to the Dost factors may be relevant and admissible at trial. Id.  at 691 -93. \nApplying its statutory construction, the Hillie majority  then vacated convictions for sexual \nexploitation of a minor and possession of images of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct, \nwhere the defendant had secretly recorded videos of children using the toilet and undressing in a \nbedroom, with genitalia exposed, because the images did not depict “any sexual conduct \nwhatsoever, or any activity connoting a sex act.” Id. at 688-89, 692-95. \nThompson’s reliance on Hillie to attack the indictment in this case falters for procedural \nand substantive reasons. Procedurally, his argument is premature. The First Circuit has held that \n“it is up to the jury ” to determine whether a particular image or video depicts sexually explicit \nconduct, including lascivious exhibition. Frabizio, 459 F.3d at 85 (emphasis in original). In \nFrabizio, the Court reversed a judge’s pretrial determination that three images did not depict \n“lascivious exhibition” of the genitals or pubic area. 459 F.3d at 83-91. The record presently before \nthis Court —which does not contain the images and video recordings discovered in Thompson’s \niCloud account —is even more limited than the record before the trial judge in Frabizio. And even \nthough the trial judge there had reviewed the images in dispute, the First Circuit emphasized that \n“whether a given depiction is lascivious is a question of fact for the jury.” Id. at 85. Indeed, to the \nFirst Circuit’s knowledge  at the time , no court of appeals had “ever approved the use of the Dost Case 1:24-cr-10107-JEK     Document 63     Filed 12/18/24     Page 10 of 1911 factors in a pretrial proceeding to remove the consideration of the lasciviousness of an image from \nthe jury.” Id.  at 88. As in Frabizio, it will be for the jury to determine whether the government can \nmeet its burden to prove beyond a reasonable doubt  that the images and videos  in Thompson’s \niCloud account involve lascivious exhibition. \nSubstantively, even if it were proper for the Court to consider at this juncture whether, as \na matter of law, secretly recorded depictions of a child using the toilet can be lascivious, \nThompson’s reliance on Hillie  runs up against  First Circuit precedent.  Recall that the majority in \nHillie  construed “lascivious exhibition” to require the display of genitalia “in a lustful manner that \nconnotes the commission of sexual intercourse.” 14 F.4th at 687. And even though the majority \nrejected the wholesale application of the Dost  factors, it explained that “evidence pertaining to the \nfifth Dost  factor, that the visual depiction suggest s sexual coyness or a willingness to engage in \nsexual activity, may substantially overlap with the [statutory] construction” it  had adopted. Id. at \n692 (quotation marks and citation omitted). The dissenting opinion, in contrast , “emphatically \ndisagree[d]” that “the statute requires  the minor victim to exhibit a ‘lustful manner.’” Id. at 702 \n(Henderson, J., dissenting) (emphasis in original). Such a construction, the dissent  argued, \nundercuts Congress’s aim to protect children from the psychological, emotional, and dignitary \nharms inflicted by sexual exploitation. See id.  \n The First Circuit, like the dissenting opinion in Hillie , does  not read  “lascivious exhibition” \nto require that the visual depiction involve the display of genitalia in a lustful manner or suggest \nsexual coyness or a willingness to engage in sexual activity. In Frabizio, the First Circuit rejected the proposition that the fifth Dost  factor —whether  the depiction of the  minor suggest s sexual \ncoyness or a willingness to engage in sexual activity—was necessary to sustain a conviction \ninvolving lascivious exhibition. See 459 F.3d at 88- 89. “The absence of a sexual come- on,” the Case 1:24-cr-10107-JEK     Document 63     Filed 12/18/24     Page 11 of 1912 First Circuit explained, “does not mean that an image is not lascivious.” Id. at 89. Frabizio, like \nHillie , engaged with the Supreme Court’s reasoning in Ferber and X-Citement Video . Id. at 83-85. \nBut Frabizio concluded that  “‘a sexually exploitative photograph of a child need not portray the \nvictim in a pose that depicts lust, wantonness, sexual coyness or other inappropriate precocity.’” \nId. at 89 (quoting United States v. Wolf , 890 F.2d 241, 247 (10th Cir. 1989)) (quotation marks \nomitted); see also United States v. Goodman, 971 F.3d 16, 18- 19 (1st Cir. 2020) (concluding, on \nplain error review, that images depicting a child’s genitalia while she entered and exited the shower supplied a sufficient factual foundation for the defendant’s guilty plea under 18 U.S.C. § 2251(a) for sexual exploitation of a minor). Thus, the First Circuit’s decision in Frabizio forecloses \nThompson’s argument that this Court should embrace Hillie ’s statutory construction and hold, as \na matter of law, that depictions of a child’s genitalia while using the toilet cannot constitute “lascivious exhibition.”  Thompson’s request that the indictment be dismissed for failure to state \nan offense is denied. III. Venue.  \n Thompson’s final  conten tion is  that venue in the District of Massachusetts, the district in \nwhich the airplane landed, is improper. The parties agree, based on discovery provided by the government , that the airplane was flying over New Jersey airspace when Thompson escorted \nMinor A to the first -class bathroom and Minor A  noticed  the iPhone taped to the upturned lid of \nthe toilet seat. Based on that discovery, Thompson argues that the venue clauses of Article III and \nthe Sixth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, as well as Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 18, require any charges to be brought against him in the District of New Jersey, not the District of Massachusetts. The government maintains that its decision to bring charges in the District of \nMassachusetts, the landing jurisdiction, is consistent with the Constitution and Rule 18, and is Case 1:24-cr-10107-JEK     Document 63     Filed 12/18/24     Page 12 of 1913 specifically authorized by 18 U.S.C. § 3237(a). The government bears the burden to prove, by a \npreponderance of the evidence, that venue is proper as to each count in the indictment. See United \nStates v. Salinas , 373 F.3d 161, 163 (1st Cir. 2004).  \nA. Const itutio nal Provisions. \n The Court begins with the question whether, in a case involving an alleged crime on a \ncommercial  aircraft, the Constitution requires the government to charge the defendant only in the \ndistrict whose airspace bears the closest nexus to the conduct underlying the crime, rather than the \ndistrict in which the airplane lands. The Constitution twice protects a criminal defendant’s right to  \nbe tried in an appropriate venue . Article II I, Section 2 provides that a criminal tria l “shall be held \nin the State where the said Crimes shall have been committed; but when not committed within any \nState, the Trial shall be at such Place or Places as the Congress may by Law have directed.” U.S. \nCONST . art. III, § 2, cl. 3. The Si xth Amendment further provides that “[i]n all criminal \nprosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury of \nthe State and district wherein the crime shall have been committed, which district shall have been \npreviously ascertained by law.” U.S. C ONST . amend. VI. Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 18 \nechoes  those rights , providing that “[u]nless a statute or these rules permit otherwise, the \ngovernment must prosecute an offense in a district where the offense was committed. The court \nmust set the place of trial within the district with due regard for the convenience of the defendant, \nany victim, and the witnesses, and the prompt administration of justice.” \n Thompson’s argument that any charges against him must be brought in the flyover district, \nnot the landing district, cannot be squared with the text, history, and purpose of these provisions. \nConstruing the text of Article III and the Sixth Amendment, as well as English common law and \nFounding- era historical sources, the Supreme Court has long held that the Constitution does not Case 1:24-cr-10107-JEK     Document 63     Filed 12/18/24     Page 13 of 1914 insist on only one district as the proper venue for a criminal trial. See Palliser v. United States , 136 \nU.S. 257, 265-66 (1890).  In Palliser  v. United States , the Supreme Court explained that:  \nWhere a crime is committed partly in one district and partly in another it must, in \nord\ner to prevent an absolute failure of justice, be tried in either district, or in that \none which the legislature may designate; and congress has accordingly provided that, “when any offense against the United States is begun in one judicial district \nand completed in any other, it shall be deemed to have been committed in either, and may be dealt with, inquired of, tried, determined, and punished in either district, in the same manner as if it had been actually and wholly committed therein.”  \nId. at 266 (quoting Rev. St at. § 731 (1878) , 28 U.S.C. § 103 (1890) (now codified at 18 U.S.C. \n§ 3237(a) )). The Court has  also recognized the constitutionality of a continuing violation theory, \n“where a crime consists of distinct parts which have different localities,” or “where it may be said \nthere is a continuously moving act, commencing with the offender and hence ultimately consummated through him, as the mailing of a letter; or where there is a confederation in purpose between two or more persons, its execution being by acts elsewhere, as in conspiracy.” United  \nStates v.  Lombardo, 241 U.S. 73, 77 (1916). In such circumstances, the defendant may  be tried in \nany district in which part of the crime occurred. Id. at 78 ; accord Salinas , 373 F.3d at 164. The \nConstitution does not require that venue be set in only one district.  T he text and Founding- era history of Article III and the Sixth Amendment have less to say \nabout the context in which this case arises: involving a commercial aircraft, flying miles over Earth  \nat a high speed while en route from one state to another. See United States v. Lozoya, 982 F.3d 648, 651 (9th Cir. 2020) (en banc) (“The Constitution does not discuss the airspace over the several states.”). But the purpose of the constitutional provisions bear s directly on Thompson’s argument \nthat the District of New Jersey is the constitutionally mandated  venue. The Framers safeguarded \nvenue rights in Article III and the Sixth Amendment in reaction to the  colonial- era practice \n“permit t[ing] Americans, charged with a crime on colonial soil, to be moved to England or another Case 1:24-cr-10107-JEK     Document 63     Filed 12/18/24     Page 14 of 1915 colony for trial.” United  States v. Muhammad, 502 F.3d 646, 651 (7th Cir. 2007) (citing D. \nKershen, Vicinage , 29 O KLA. L. REV. 803, 805 (1976)); see also United States v. Cabrales , 524 \nU.S. 1, 6 (1998) (noting that the Founders’ “complaints against the King of Great Britain, listed in \nthe Declaration of Independence, included his transportation of colonists ‘beyond Seas to be \ntried’”).  They sought to “‘secure the party accused from being dragged to a trial in some distant \nstate, away from his friends, witnesses, and neighborhood.’” Muhammad, 502 F.3d at 652 (quoting J. Story, C\nOMMENTARIES ON THE CONSTITUTION  § 925 (Carolina Academic Press reprint 1987) \n(1833)); accord Lozoya, 982 F.3d at 651 (majority op inion) ; id. at 659 (Ikuta, J., dissenting in part \nand concurring in the judgment). P rotection against trial in an arbitrary location —one lacking any \nconnection to the defendant, witnesses, or victims of a crime —sits at the heart of the constitutional \nprovisions and Rule 18.   Holding that these provisions require venue in this case to be set in the flyover District of \nNew Jersey, and do not permit venue in the landing District of Massachusetts, would frustrate \nthese aims. The conduct underlying the indictment took place on an airplane traveling from North Carolina to Massachusetts, and Thompson was first questioned by law enforcement officials in Massachuse tts. Under the circumstances, the defendant, victims, and witnesses are more likely to \nhave a connection to the departure  and landing S tates than the S tate over which the airplane \nhappened to be traveling when the crimes allegedly occurred. New Jersey has no apparent connection to Thompson, Minor A, any of the other alleged victims, or the witnesses to the case. The rule Thompson urges —that venue in the flyover district is required by the Constitution and  \nRule 18—would undermine, rather than support, the protections he invokes. See Lozoya , 982 F.3d \nat 652.  Case 1:24-cr-10107-JEK     Document 63     Filed 12/18/24     Page 15 of 1916 The Court thus concludes that the Constitution does not require venue in this case to be set \nin the District of New Jersey .3 The constitutional command that the trial “shall be held in the State \nwhere the said Crimes shall have been committed ” is broad enough to encompass the landing \njurisdiction when a crime is committed on a  commercial  aircraft . U.S. C ONST . art. III, § 2, cl. 3 ; \nsee also U.S. C ONST . amend. VI  (trial in the “district wherein the crime shall have been \ncommitted ”). T he government’s choice to bring charges in the District of Massachusetts, the \nlanding district, is compatible with Article III, the Sixth Amendment, and Rule 18 of the Federal \nRules of Criminal Procedure.  \nB. Statutory Provisions. \n The question remains whether venue in the District of Massachusetts is permissible under \nthe relevant venue statutes. The statutes Thompson is charged with violating—18 U.S.C. §§ 2251(a) and (e) and 18 U.S.C. §§ 2252A(a)(5)(B) and (b)(2 )—do not have their own venue \nprovisions. Venue for the prosecution must  therefore  be determined “‘from the nature of the crime \nalleged and the location of the act or acts constituting it.’” United  States v. Seward, 967 F.3d 57, \n60 (1st Cir. 2020) (quoting United  States v. Anderson, 328 U.S. 699, 703 (1946)); see also United  \nStates v. Rodriguez-Moreno, 526 U.S. 275, 279 (1999). The parties point to different statutes that, \nthey say, set the proper venue: the government contends that the second paragraph  of 18 U.S.C. \n§ 3237(a) applies, while Thompson argues that 18 U.S.C. § 3238 applies.  \n The statute Thompson relies on, s ection 3238, provides, in relevant part, that “[t] he trial of \nall offenses begun or committed upon the high seas, or elsewhere out of the jurisdiction of any \nparticular State or district, shall be in the district in which the offender  . . . is arrested or is first \n \n3 In so holding, the Court does not conclude that venue in the District of New Jersey would be \nconstitutionally impermissible. It holds only that venue in the District of New Jersey is not \nconstitutionally required. Case 1:24-cr-10107-JEK     Document 63     Filed 12/18/24     Page 16 of 1917 brought.” 18 U.S.C. § 3238. Under section 3238, Thompson contends, he cannot be tried in the \nDistrict of Massachusetts because he was not first arrested in this district. But by its plain terms, \nsection 3238 applies only to trials for “offenses begun or committed upon the high seas, or \nelsewhere out of the jurisdiction of any particular State or district .” Id. The statute does not apply \nto crimes committed within the borders of, and by extension in the airspace above, the S tates and \nUnited States . See Unite d States v. Ghanem , 993 F.3d 1113, 1119 (9th Cir. 2021) (“[F]or crimes \ncommitted outside the country , the Constitution vests Congress with the power to determine the \nvenue for trial. U.S.  CONST . art. III, § 2, cl. 3. In turn, Congress has determined that the trial for \nsuch a crime ‘ shall be in the district in which the offender . . . is arrested or is first brought.’ ” \n(emphasis  added)  (quoting 18 U.S.C. § 3238)). Section 3238 functions instead to implement the \nportion of Article III, Section 2 providing that when offenses are “ not committed within any State, \nthe Trial shall be at such Place or Places as the Congress may by Law have directed.” U.S. C ONST . \nart. III, § 2, cl. 3; see Reid v. Covert , 354 U.S. 1, 7- 8 & n.9 (1957) (citing section 3238 in explaining \nthat “[f] rom the very first Congress, federal statutes have implemented the provisio[n]” of Article \nIII, Section 2 covering offenses “not committed within any State”).  \n Section 3237(a), in contrast, authorizes venue in the District of Massachusetts. It provides \nthat “[a] ny offense involving the use of the mails, transportation in interstate or foreign commerce, \nor the importation of an object or person into the United States is a continuing offense and, except \nas otherwise expressly provided by enactment of  Congress, may be inquired of and prosecuted in \nany district from, through, or into which such commerce, mail matter, or imported object or person \nmoves.” 18 U.S.C. § 323 7(a). Three  Courts of Appeals  have concluded  that this provision “applies  \nto in-flight crimes  because the crimes  took place on a form  of transportation in interstate  \ncommerce.” Lozoya, 982 F.3d at 653 (quotation marks  omitted); accord  United  States v. Cope , Case 1:24-cr-10107-JEK     Document 63     Filed 12/18/24     Page 17 of 1918 676 F.3d 1219, 1225 (10th  Cir. 2012);  United  States v. Breitweiser , 357 F.3d 1249, 1253 (11th \nCir. 2004). The Court agrees  with the analyses  in these cases.  Thompson’s alleged  crimes  \n“involv[e]” transportation in interstate  commerce  because the indictment is premised  on conduct \nthat took place on a form  of transportation, an aircraft,  that moved in interstate  commerce.  18 \nU.S.C. § 3237(a).  Moreover,  the conduct in this case relates  to that transportation. By virtue of his \nemployment as a flight attendant  on a commercial  airline,  Thompson had the means  and allegedly  \nused his position of authority  (1) to  “emplo[y] , us[e], persuad [e], induc [e], entic [e], or coerc [e]” \nMinor A to use a bathroom in a different  part of the aircraft  before seeking  to make a sexually \nexplicit recording  of her with his iPhone camera,  id. § 2251(a) , and  (2) to possess or attempt to \npossess sexually explicit images and videos of children using airplane bathrooms, id. \n§ 2252A(a)(5)(B) ; cf. Cameron, 699 F.3d at 636 (transporting and receiving child pornography via \nthe internet are continuing offenses under the second paragraph  of § 3237(a)).  But for the interstate  \ntransportation, the conduct that underlies the charges  against  Thompson could  not have occurred.  \nSee Lozoya, 982 F.3d at 653.4  \nBecause the charged  offenses  in this case involve transportation in interstate  commerce,  \nthe offenses  “may be inquired of and prosecuted in any district from, through, or into which such \ncommerce . . . moves ,” including the landing district. 18 U.S.C. § 3237(a). The Court thus \nconcludes the venue is  proper in  the District of Massachusetts for both offenses.5  \n \n4 Thompson contends that the second  paragraph  in section  3237(a) should be construed  as a \nsubset of the first paragraph  in section  3237(a), which  involves “ any offense against the United \nStates begun in one district and completed in another, or committed in more than one district.” But \nthere is  no indication in the text, structure, or  legislative  history of section 3237(a) that Congress \nintended to make the second paragraph  a subset of , or limited by,  the first, and the Court is aware \nof no case that so holds. See Lozoya , 982 F.3d at 652 (“ 18 U.S.C. § 3237(a) contains two \nparagraphs, each  covering  a different  type of offense.”).  \n5 Because the Court concludes that venue in the District of Massachusetts is proper for both \ncounts of the indictment under the second paragraph  of 18 U.S.C. § 3237(a), it need not reach the Case 1:24-cr-10107-JEK     Document 63     Filed 12/18/24     Page 18 of 1919 CONCLUSION AND ORDER \nFor the foregoing reasons, Thompson’s motion  to dismiss the indictment, ECF 4 8, is \nDENIED.  \nSO ORDERED.  \n/s/ Julia E.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: The Federal Circuit Court dealt with an appeal by Dr. Ahmad Aljindi regarding the dismissal of his lawsuit by the U.S. Court of Federal Claims. Dr. Aljindi sought $32.7 million for claims including employment discrimination, intellectual property and copyright violations, negligence, and torts, but the Court of Federal Claims dismissed the case due to lack of jurisdiction. The appellate court affirmed most of the dismissal but vacated and remanded the copyright claim for further consideration. The case involves AI, as Dr. Aljindi claimed his intellectual property related to AI was stolen by the Department of Defense.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the Court of Federal Claims had jurisdiction over Dr. Aljindi's claims, including employment discrimination, intellectual property theft, negligence, torts, and judicial misconduct.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The Federal Circuit affirmed the Court of Federal Claims' dismissal of Dr. Aljindi's claims due to lack of jurisdiction, except for the possible copyright infringement claim. The appellate court vacated this part of the dismissal and remanded it for the trial court to determine if Dr. Aljindi's complaint adequately stated a claim of copyright infringement.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Dr. Ahmad Aljindi tried to sue the U.S. government for a lot of money, claiming they did things like stealing his ideas and discriminating against him. The special court he went to, called the Court of Federal Claims, said they couldn't even look at most of his claims because they don't have that power; it's kind of like going to a car mechanic to fix a computer—it doesn't work. An important court agreed with that, but they told the lower court to take one more look at whether Dr. Aljindi might actually have a case for someone copying his creations, sort of like a homework assignment not being graded because it might belong somewhere else.",

For the reasons below, we affirm -in-part, \nvacate -in-part, and rem and.   \nBACKGROUND  \nOn April 28, 2021, Dr. Aljindi filed a complaint pro se \nat the Court of Federal Claims.  Dr. Aljindi sought $32.7 million in damages for employment discrimination in \naddition to relief for “intellectual property and copyright [] \nlaw[] violations, negligence, and tort.”  SAppx.  9.\n1  The \nGovernment moved to dismiss Dr.  Aljindi’s complaint for \nlack of subject matter jurisdiction and failure to state a claim.   \nThe Court of Federal Claims agreed with the Govern-\nment and dismissed Dr. Aljindi’s complaint.   See Aljindi \nv. United States, No. 21 -1295C, 2021 WL 4807205 (Fed.  Cl. \nOct. 15, 2021); SAppx. 1– 3.  The court interpreted \nDr. Aljindi’s complaint as alleging three claims:   (1) em-\nployment discrimination; (2)  theft of his intellectual prop-\nerty;\n2 and (3)  negligence and tort based on the conduct \ndescribed in his complaint for the first two claims .  \nSAppx.  1.  Additionally , after reviewing Dr.  Aljindi’s brief \nin response to the Government’s motion to dismiss, the court noted that Dr. Aljindi’s lawsuit was really focused on  \nhis allegations of “ judicial misconduct”  in the U.S. District \n \n1  Citations to “SAppx.” r efer to the Supplemental \nAppendix attached to the Government’s brief.  \n2  D r. Aljindi’s complaint does not mention patent in-\nfringement .  As for  a claim under federal copyright  law, \nDr. Aljindi’s complaint states that he seeks “$32.7 [m]illion \nfor [e]mployment [d]iscrimination [and  m]aximum mone-\ntary [c]onstitutional [r]elief for the intellectual property \nand copyright [] law[] violations, negligence, and tort.”   \nSAppx.  9.  There is no othe r mention of copyright law . Case: 22-1117      Document: 25     Page: 2     Filed: 05/10/2022ALJINDI  v. US 3 \nCourt for the Central District of California and the U.S. \nCourt of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.   SAppx. 2; see also  \nSAppx.  8 (requesting the court “take formal notice of the \nongoing judicial corruption, abuse, and torture in addition to [the Government’s] abuse and torture”).  The court thus \nconsidered those claims as well.  \nRegarding the first claim, employment discrimination, \nthe trial court explained that the Court of Federal Claims \ndoes not have jurisdiction over  federal employment dis-\ncrimination cases , i.e., it does not have the power to decide \nthose cases .  Rather, as the court explained, on ly federal \ndistrict courts  have jurisdiction  over those claims.  \nSAppx.  3 (quoting Taylor v. United States, 310 F.  App’x \n390, 393 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (“Because Title VII vests jurisdic-tion over discrimination claims exclusively in the district \ncourt, the Cour t of Federal Claims cannot exercise jurisdic-\ntion over those claims.”)).  \nThe trial court explained that Dr. Aljindi’s  second and \nthird claims —intellectual property theft  (not including \nclaims of patent infringement or copyright infringement) and negligence  and tort,  respectively —are tort claims, a \ntype of claim over which the court also lacks jurisdiction .  \nSAppx.  2–3 (citing 28  U.S.C. §  1491(a)(1) (“The United \nStates Court of Federal Claims shall have jurisdiction to \nrender judgment upon any claim against the United States \n. . . for .  . . damages in cases not sounding in tort .” (empha-\nsis added))).  The court also construed Dr. Aljindi’s intellec-\ntual property theft claim as a Fifth Amendment takings \nclaim but determined that Dr. Aljindi had not provided suf-ficient facts in his complaint to support such a claim .  Spe-\ncifically, the court determined that Dr. Aljindi  failed to \nspecify in his complaint “what the property consisted of, how it was taken, and what the [G]overnment did with it.”  SAppx.  3.   \nFinally, regarding Dr. Aljindi’s judicial misconduct al-\nlegations, the court explained that it “lacks authority to Case: 22-1117      Document: 25     Page: 3     Filed: 05/10/2022ALJINDI  v. US 4 \nreview allegations of misconduct by judges on another \ncourt.”  SAppx.  2 (citing 28 U.S.C. §§ 351, 363).  It also con-\nsidered Dr.  Aljindi’s alle gations that he had been denied \nrelief in the Central District of California and Ninth Cir-cuit.  Citing our prior decision holding that the Court of \nFederal Claims “does not have jurisdiction to review the decisions of district courts .  . . relating to proceedings be-\nfore those courts,” Joshua v.  United States , 17 F.3d 378, \n380 (Fed. Cir. 1994), the court explained that it likewise does not “have the power [i.e., jurisdiction] to review deci-\nsions” of either of these courts.  SAppx.  2.  And, in consid-\nering Dr. Aljindi’s allegations that the judicial misconduct \ninvolved criminal conduct or torts, the court explained that it lacks “jurisdiction over criminal matters,” SAppx. 2 –3 \n(quoting Jones v.  United States, 440 F. App’x 916, 918 (Fed. \nCir. 2011)), as well as  claims sounding in tort.   \nDr. Aljindi appeals.  We have jurisdiction under \n28 U.S.C. §  1295(a)(3).   \nD\nISCUSSION  \nOn appeal, Dr. Aljindi continues to seek $32.7 million \nfor employment discrimination, as well as  constitutional  \nrelief for the alleged intellectual property and copyright law violations, negligence, and tort.  A ppellant’s Br.  3.\n3  \nThe Court of Federal Claims dismissed these for lack of ju-\nrisdiction  or, in the alternative, for failure to state a claim .  \nWe review the Court of Federal Claims’ dis missal for lack \nof jurisdiction  de novo, i.e., without deference to the trial \ncourt .  Creative Mgmt. Servs., LLC v. United States, \n989 F.3d 955, 961 (Fed. Cir. 2021).   We also review dismis-\nsal for failure to state a claim de novo.  Id.  And while w e \nconstrue pro se filings like Dr. Aljindi’s  liberally, that does \n \n3  Because Dr. Aljindi’s opening brief on appeal in-\ncludes numerous attachments, we use the pagination pro-\nvided in the header of his brief.   Case: 22-1117      Document: 25     Page: 4     Filed: 05/10/2022ALJINDI  v. US 5 \nnot alleviate Dr. Aljindi’s  burden to establish jurisdiction.  \nHenke v.  United States , 60 F.3d 795, 799 (Fed. Cir. 1995) .   \nAs the trial court correctly explained, its jurisdiction “is \nlimited to specific types of claims against the federal gov-\nernment, most commonly claims for money as provided by \nthe Tucker Act.”  SAppx. 1 (citing 28 U.S.C. §  1491(a)(1)).  \nSpecifically, the Tu cker Act provides the Court of Federal \nClaims with “ jurisdiction to render judgment upon any \nclaim against the United States founded either upon the \nConstitution, or any Act of Congress or any regulation of an executive department, or upon any express or i mplied \ncontract with the United States, or for liquidated or unliquidated damages in cases not sounding in tort. ”  \n§ 1491(a)(1).   \nHere, the Court of Federal Claims properly determined \nthat it lacks jurisdiction over Dr. Aljindi’s employment dis-crimination , tort (including negligence and intellectual \nproperty theft), and judicial misconduct claims .  Regarding \nhis employment discrimination  claim , we have previously \nexplained that only the district courts —which do not in-\nclude the Court of Federal Claims —have jurisdiction over \nemployment discrimination claims.  See Taylor, 310 F. App’x at 393 (“Title  VII vests jurisdiction over dis-\ncrimination claims exclusively in the district court, [and] \nthe Court of Federal Claims cannot exercise jurisdiction \nover those clai ms.”).   We therefore affirm the trial court’s \ndetermination that it lacks jurisdiction to review Dr. Aljindi’s employment discrimination claim.  \nRegarding Dr. Aljindi’s tort claims , including his negli-\ngence and intellectual property theft  claims , the Tucke r \nAct specifically states that the Court of Federal Claims \nonly has jurisdiction over claims against the United States \nin cases “ not sounding in tort .”  § 14 91(a)(1); see Brown \nv. United States, 105 F.3d 621, 623 (Fed. Cir. 1997) (“ The \nCourt of Federal Cla ims is a court of limited jurisdiction.  \nIt lacks jurisdiction over tort actions against the United Case: 22-1117      Document: 25     Page: 5     Filed: 05/10/2022ALJINDI  v. US 6 \nStates. ”).  As with employment discrimination claim s, only \nthe district courts have jurisdiction over tort claims against \nthe United States.  See Awad v.  United States, 301 F.3d \n1367, 1372 (Fed.  Cir. 2002) (explaining that the “ district \ncourts have jurisdiction in suits against the United States for” tort claims under the Federal Tort Claims Act); see also  \n28 U.S.C. §  1346(b)(1).   We therefore affirm the tr ial court’s \ndetermination that it lacks jurisdiction to review Dr. Aljindi’s tort claims, including negligence and intellec-\ntual property theft.  \nIn its motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, the \nGovernment explained that Dr.  Aljindi’s complaint could \nbe liberally construed as alleging “either a takings claim; a claim of patent or copyright infringement; or a trade se-\ncrets claim” over which  the Court of Federal Claims would \nhave jurisdiction.  Appellant’s Br. 40 (reproducing Govern-\nment’s motion to dismiss at the Court of Federal Claims).  \nThe Government argued that Dr. Aljindi’s complaint did \nnot provide the minimum required factual allegati ons in \nhis complaint to support these claims.   \nThe trial court  agreed regarding Dr.  Aljindi’s Fifth \nAmendment takings claim, determining that he did not  \nprovide the minimum required factual allegations in his \ncomplaint to support  this claim.   See SAppx. 8 .  Dr. Aljindi \nargues on appeal, as he did in his complaint, that the De-\npartment of Defense “has stolen illegally and without giv-ing him credit” his intellectual property related to \ninformation security, artificial intelligence, and legacy in-\nformation syst ems, thus “invok[ing] the Fifth Amend-\nment .”  Appellant’s Br.  9.  While we must accept all “non-\nconclusory allegations of fact” in Dr.  Aljindi’s complaint as \ntrue, Samish Indian Nation v.  United States, 419 F.3d \n1355, 1364 (Fed. Cir. 2005), here, Dr.  Aljind i’s one-sen-\ntence factual allegation regarding his  intellectual property \ntheft  is too conclusory to support a Fifth Amendment tak-\nings claim .  We agree with the trial court that Dr.  Aljindi’s \n“allegations are not facially plausible without factual Case: 22-1117      Document: 25     Page: 6     Filed: 05/10/2022ALJINDI  v. US 7 \nallegation s about what the property consisted of, how it \nwas taken, and what the government did with it.”  \nSAppx.  3.4 \nWe note, however, that Dr. Aljindi mentioned “copy-\nrights law[] violations” in the relief section of his complaint.  \nSAppx.  9.  As the Government stated in its trial brief, and \nwe agree, this can be liberally construed as a copyright in-\nfringement claim over which the Court of Federal Claims \nwould have jurisdiction.  See 28 U.S.C. §  1498(b) (“[W]hen-\never the copyright in any work protected under the copy-\nright laws of the United States shall be infringed by the \nUnited States, .  . . the exclusive action which may be \nbrought for such infringement shall be an action by the cop-\nyright owner against the United States in the Court of Fed-\neral Claims[.]”).  Because the trial court has jurisdiction \nover this claim, we vacate -in-part the court’s dismissal.  We \nremand for the court to consider the Government’s position \nthat Dr.  Aljin di’s complaint fails to state a claim for copy-\nright infringement, that is, that he has failed to identify \nsufficient facts in his complaint supporting this claim.   \nNext, we consider Dr. Aljindi’s claims of judicial mis-\nconduct, which the Court of Federal C laims dismissed for \nlack of jurisdiction.  As the trial court correctly explained, it does not have the authority to review allegations of mis-\nconduct by judges from  a different  court  (e.g., the Central \n \n4  We note that even if Dr. Aljindi’s complaint alleged \nadditional facts, the Court of Federal Claims would lack ju-risdiction to decide  his Fifth Amendment takings claim \nbased on his continued  assertion that the Government stole \nhis intellectual property “without his permission.”  Appel-lant’s Br. 9 .  As we explained in Shelden v. United States , \nthe Court of Federal Claims “ lacks jurisdiction over takings \nclaims in which the petitioner asserts the subject taking was not authorized. ”  742 F. App’x 496, 50 1 (Fed.  Cir. \n2018).  Case: 22-1117      Document: 25     Page: 7     Filed: 05/10/2022ALJINDI  v.

Appellant’s \nBr. 4.  H e provides numerous allegations concerning retal-\niation by various federal agencies (as well as the Govern-ment’s attorneys) in his reply brief .  See, e.g., Appellant’s \nReply Br.  6–10.  Dr. Aljindi did not identify retaliation as \none of his causes of action in his complaint.  “[E]ven with the leniency afforded to pro se litigants, issues not raised before the [Court of Federal Claims] are waived on appeal.”  \nMone v.  United States , 766 F. App’x 979, 986 (Fed.  Cir. \n2019).  Dr. Aljindi’s claims of retaliation are therefore \nwaived because he failed to raise them at the trial court .   \nC\nONCLUSION  \nFor these reasons, we affirm -in-part and vacate -in-part \nthe decision of the Court of Federal Claims.6  On remand, \n \n5  https://www.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/judi-\ncial_con duct_and_disability_rules_effective_march_12_2 \n019.pdf . \n6  On January 10, 2022, Dr. Aljindi filed a motion to \nexpedite his appeal.  ECF No. 14.  We denied that motion \non February 1, 2022, informing Dr. Aljindi that he “may \nself-expedite his appeal by filin g his reply brief early,” ECF \nNo. 16.  Dr. Aljindi filed a second motion to expedite his \nappeal on Mach 21, 2022.  ECF No. 23.  We deny this sec-ond motion to expedite as moot  because this opinion and Case: 22-1117      Document: 25     Page: 8     Filed: 05/10/2022ALJINDI  v.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: The United States District Court for the Northern District of California transferred the case of John R. Fouts, a resident of Kentucky, and his minor child, to the Western District of Kentucky. The case involved numerous claims related to alleged failures by Kentucky and federal agencies impacting Fouts, such as not receiving social security checks and prescription drugs, and being subjected to a Child Protective Services investigation. Notably, Fouts included a “Notification of Use of Artificial Intelligence in Document Drafting” as part of his filings, but the court did not address these due to the decision to transfer the case based on improper venue.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: The key legal issue was whether the Northern District of California was the appropriate venue for the case.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court held that the Northern District of California was not the proper venue under 28 U.S.C. § 1391, as neither the parties involved nor the events related to the claims had any connection to this district. Consequently, the court ordered the transfer of the case to the Western District of Kentucky, which is a more appropriate venue given that the parties reside there and the events in question occurred there.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine you have a big problem and want to talk to someone about it, but you accidentally go to the wrong office where people can't help you because your problem has nothing to do with them. This court decided that was the case here. John Fouts brought his problems to a court in California, but they all happened in Kentucky. So, the court said, \"Hey, this isn't the right place to talk about your problem. Let's send it to the Kentucky office where it belongs, so they can really help you out.\" They noticed he used some cool writing computer stuff (AI) to help file his paperwork, but since they aren’t handling his case, they didn’t get into the details of it.",

Nos. 1 , 4 \n \n \n \nBefore the Court are pro se  Plaintiff John R. Fouts  and his minor child ’s complaint , motion \nfor preliminary injunction, permanent restraining order, and permanent protective order  \n(“Motion”) , and several other filings and requests .1  ECF 1, 4.  Fouts  and his child are residents of \nKentucky who suffer from multiple medical conditions.  ECF 4  at 3.  Fouts alleges dozens of \nstatutory and constitutional violations against myriad Kentucky and federal agencies apparently \narising from, among other things, alleged failure to receive social security checks and prescription \ndrugs by mail, exposure to mold and other hazardous conditions in Fouts’s dwelling and \nsubsequent inability to obtain adequate medical care, as well as being subje ct to an improper Child \nProtective Services investigation, all in Kentucky.  See id.  at 8-35.  Having read Fouts’s papers \nand carefully considered the arguments therein, as well as the relevant legal authority, the Court \nhereby TRANSFERS  this action to the Western District of Kentucky pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § \n1406, or alternatively, 28 U.S.C. § 1404(a),  for the following reasons.   \n \n1 Since initiating this lawsuit, Fouts has filed a series of additional documents, including a \n“Motion to Compel Compliance with ADA Accommodations,” ECF 14, “Ophthalmological \nRecords Highlighting Critical Unmet Medical Needs,” ECF 16,  “HUD Correspondence \nHighlighting Systemic Failures, Discrimination, ADA Violations, and Neglect,” ECF 17 , and \n“Notification of Use of Artificial Intelligence in Document Drafting,” ECF 19, among others .  \nBecause the Court finds it appropriate to transfer the case, it does not address these filings.   Case 3:24-cv-09325-AMO     Document 41     Filed 01/15/25     Page 1 of 4 \n2 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  On December 23, 2024, the Court issued an order to show cause why the complaint should \nnot be dismissed or transferred for improper venue, as no party or event described in Fouts’s \npapers had any apparent connection to the Northern District of California.  ECF 12.  Venue is \nproper in a judicial district in which (1) any defendant resides, if all defendants are residents of the \nstate in which the district is located; (2) a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to \nthe claim occurred, or a su bstantial part of property that is the subject of the action is situated; or \n(3) if there is no district in which an action may otherwise be brought as provided in this section, \nany judicial district in which any defendant is subject to the court’s persona l jurisdiction with \nrespect to such action.  28 U.S.C. § 1391(b).  Similarly, w here a defendant is an agency of the \nUnited States, venue is proper “in any judicial district in which (A) a defendant in the action \nresides, (B) a substantial part of the event s or omissions giving rise to the claim occurred, or a \nsubstantial part of property that is the subject of the action is situated, or (C) the plaintiff resides if \nno real property is involved in the action. ”  28 U.S.C. § 1391(e)(1).   \nA district court, in its discretion, “shall dismiss , or if it be in the interest of justice, \ntransfer ” an action under 28 U.S.C. § 1406(a) if venue is improper.  See King v. Russell , 963 F.2d \n1301, 1304 (9th Cir. 1992).  Courts may sua sponte  raise improper venue if, as here, the defendant \nhas not filed a responsive pleading and the parties are provided with an opportunity to respond to \nthe issue.  Costlow v. Weeks , 790 F.2d 1486, 1488 (9th Cir. 1986).  Even where venue is proper \nunder § 1391, a district court may transfer the case to another district for the convenience of the \nparties and witnesses.  See 28 U.S.C. § 1404(a) (“For the convenience of parties and witnesses, in \nthe interest of justice, a district court may transfer any civil action to any other district or division \nwhere it might have been brought.”).  The purpose of such transfer  is to “prevent the waste of \n‘time, energy and money’ and to ‘protect litigants, witnesses, and the public against unnecessary \ninconvenience and expense.’ ”  Van Dusen v. Barrack , 376 U.S. 612 (1964).  Courts may  also \ntransfer cases under § 1404(a) sua sponte . \n// \n// \n// Case 3:24-cv-09325-AMO     Document 41     Filed 01/15/25     Page 2 of 4 \n3 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  Venue is not proper in this District.  Fouts and his child reside in Louisville,  Kentucky, as \ndo many  Defendants.2  Moreover, as far as the Court can discern from Fouts’s submissions , all \nrelevant events and omissions occurred in Kentucky.   See, e.g. , ECF 4 at 14 ( stating  that Fouts  and \nhis child suffered significant harm due to hazardous living conditions at an apartment with a \nLouisville, Kentucky address); id. at 22 -25 (describing  inadequate care by medical care providers \nat Baptist Health Louisville and University of Louisville).   In his response to the Court’s Order , \nFouts  does not assert that any Plaintiff or Kentucky agency  or individual establishes proper venue \nin this District , nor does he state that  any events or omissions occurred in this District.  To the  \nextent  Fouts sugg ests that venue is proper here because some Defendants are federal agencies , that \nis not so .  “Venue does not lie in every judicial district where a federal agency has a regional \noffice,” Williams v. United States , No. C -01-0024 EDL, 2001 WL 1352885, at *1 (N.D. Cal. Oct. \n23, 2001)  (citing Reuben H. Donnelly Corp. v. Federal Trade Comm ’n, 580 F.2d 264, 267 (7th \nCir. 1978)), and c ourts in the Ninth Circuit  have often found that  federal agencies are deemed \nresidents of the District of Columbia, regardless of where any regional offices may be located .  \nSee, e.g. , Al Hada v.

While Fouts states that “[n]ationwide programs are directly \nimplicated, and their administration in California is relevant to this case,” ECF 15 at 1, Fouts’s  \nsubmissions do  not allege  any such relevance, and the Court cannot discern any.

While the \nresidence of each Defendant is not expressly alleged in Fouts’s complaint or otherwise listed in \nFouts’s submissions, Fouts lists Louisville, Kentucky addresses for many Defendants.  See id. at \n19-20.  Indeed, every address listed for a Defendant is an address outside of California, and as to \nthose Defendants for whom no address is listed, there is no discernable connection to California.      \n Case 3:24-cv-09325-AMO     Document 41     Filed 01/15/25     Page 3 of 4 \n4 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  do not establish proper venue here.  Plaintiffs and many Defendants reside in Louisville, \nKentucky , which is also where the relevant events occurred.  Because no party resides in this \nDistrict, and because the events giving rise to Fouts’s claims did not occur here, t he Court thus \ndetermines that under 28 U.S.C. § 1391, venue is not  proper .   \nThe Court must next determine i f it would be in the interest of justice to transfer the case .  \nSee 28 U.S.C. § 1406(a).   “[T]ransfer will generally be in the interest of justice .”  Amity \nRubberized Pen Co. v.

Inc. , 793 F.3d 991, 996 (9th Cir. 2015) (internal quotations \nomitted) (noting the Ninth Circuit has “rarely found that transfer would not serve the interests of \njustice,” and that the determination of whether transfer is in the interest of justice is “a low bar” \nthat “will usually involve a very limited inquiry by the transferring court” ).  The Court concludes \nfrom its limited inquiry that transfer is in the interest of justice so that  Fouts ’s case  may be \nscreened pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1915 .  Accordingly, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1406(a), the Court \nTRANSFERS  this action to the Western  District of Kentucky , the proper venue for Loui sville, \nKentucky .  Even if venue were proper in this District, because most parties reside in the Western \nDistrict of Kentucky  and the events at issue occurred there, it is clear that the Western  District of \nKentucky is a more convenient forum  under 28 U.S.C. § 1404(a) .    \n \nIT IS SO ORDERED.  \nDated:  January 1 5, 2025   \n \n  \nARACELI MARTÍNEZ -OLGUÍN  \nUnited States District Judge  \nCase 3:24-cv-09325-AMO     Document 41     Filed 01/15/25     Page 4 of 4",

    "summary": "1. Summary:\nThe court case involves Phi Theta Kappa Honor Society (PTK) and HonorSociety.org, competing honor societies, wherein PTK obtained a preliminary injunction against HonorSociety.org for disseminating misleading information, partially using generative artificial intelligence to create misleading content online. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit vacated the injunction issued by the district court, as it was deemed overbroad and a violation of the First Amendment by compelling speech and constituting a prior restraint.\n\n2. Key Legal Issue:\nThe key legal issue is whether the district court's injunction against HonorSociety.org constituted an overbroad prior restraint on free speech and whether it impermissibly compelled speech in violation of the First Amendment.\n\n3. Court's Holding:\nThe Court of Appeals held that the district court's injunction was overbroad and constituted an impermissible compelled speech, violating the First Amendment. Consequently, the injunction was vacated and the case remanded to the district court.\n\n4. ELI5 Explanation:\nImagine two clubs at your college, Club A and Club B, that both want to have as many members as possible. Club A told the court that Club B was spreading lies about them online to get more members, even using computer programs to create tons of fake info. Club A got a judge to order Club B not to do this, but another judge higher up said, \"Wait! That order was too strict and violated Club B's rights to free speech.\" So, they sent the case back to the first judge to think about again.",

Cayce  \nClerk  Case: 24-60452      Document: 111-1     Page: 1     Date Filed: 04/07/2025No. 24- 60452 \n2 preliminary injunction that prohibits them from engaging in several forms of \nonline speech  and compels them to include a “disclaimer” in its future online \nposts that reference this litigation .  Because we agree with HonorSociety that \nthe injunction is overbroad and compels speech in violation of the First Amendment, we VACATE  the injunction and REMAND  to the district \ncourt.   \nI \nThis case involves two honor societies that compete in the \ncommunity- college honor -society market.  Phi Theta Kappa Honor Society \n(“PTK”), founded in 1918, provides academic - and professional -focused \nmembership services to community college students across  the county.  \nHonorSociety, founded in 2014 by Michael Moradian, has a similar mission, and has become PTK’s largest competitor.   \nIn 2022, PTK sued HonorSociety asserting claims under the Lanham \nAct for trademark and trade -dress infringement  and Mississippi state -law \nclaims for  unfair competition  and trade -dress infringement.  It later added \nseveral claims, including Mississippi state -law claims for tortious \ninterference with contract and with prospective business advantage.  HonorSociety asserted several counterclaims against PTK  and third -party \nclaims against Dr. Lynn Tincher -Ladner, PTK’s chief executive officer.\n1   \nIn March  2024, PTK obtained a preliminary injunction that enjoined  \nHonorSociety from circulating six survey questions that contained \n“misleading” information to PTK members and from soliciting  information \non PTK from college campuses.   \n_____________________  \n1 Because Dr. Tincher -Ladner joined PTK’s request for the preliminary injunction \nthat is at issue here, any reference to PTK in this opinion refers to both PTK and Dr. \nTincher -Ladner.   Case: 24-60452      Document: 111-1     Page: 2     Date Filed: 04/07/2025No. 24- 60452 \n3 A few months later, PTK again requested a preliminary injunction, \nthis time  on the basis that HonorSociety had continued to disseminate \nmisleading claims against PTK, albeit in new ways.  PTK claimed that \nHonorSociety had used generative artificial intelligence to create approximately 5,000 website s and articles to “mislead readers about the \nlawsuit” ; spread misinformation about a former PTK chapter advisor and the \norganization’s former executive director,  Rod Risley;  created a “Directory” \nof PTK chapters t hat actually redirected users to HonorSociety’s websites ; \nedited PTK’s Wikipedia page ; and circulated a cartoon image of an “East \nAsian woman,” which, according to the district court’s findings, depicted Dr. Tincher- Ladner.  The district court later held an evidentiary hearing on \nthe motion in June 2024 and granted the motion two months later , finding \nthat PTK was likely to succeed on its Mississippi state law claim for tortious \ninterference .   \nThe district court’s injunction was sweeping .  It prohibited  \nHonorSociety from engaging in several forms of online speech targeted at \nPTK  and ordered it to include a disclaimer on any website or social media \npost that referenced the pending litigation .  The injunction states:  \n1) Immediately cease edits to PTK’s Wikipedia page, and subject \nitself to discovery  on Wikipedia edits it may have made or caused \nduring this litigation.  \n2) Remove all images of the cartoon East Asian woman vendor from its webpages  and social media posts.  \n3) Remove all false subject matter from its webpages and social media \nposts  regarding the Itawamba Community College chapter \nadvisor’s arrest.  \n4) Limit its reporting on the sexual harassment allegations against \nRisley to existing media articles only, rather than articles of its own \ncreation.  \n5) Add the actual contact information for every PTK chapter into the \n“Directory,” or  delete the “Directory.”   Case: 24-60452      Document: 111-1     Page: 3     Date Filed: 04/07/2025No. 24- 60452 \n4 6) Add the following disclaimer, in 12 point or larger size font, to the \ntop of all remaining webpages and social media posts that concern \nor reference this  litigation:  \nDisclaimer: The author of this article is not a neutral party in \nthe referenced litigation. HonorSociety.org Inc., Honor \nSociety Foundation  Inc., and its president Michael Moradian \nwere sued in federal court by  PTK on April 20, 2022 for False \nDesignation of Origin, Trade Dress  Infringement, and Unfair \nCompetition. Honor Society and Michael  Moradian \ncountersued and are presently defendants/counter -plaintiffs  in \nthis litigation. Litigation is still ongoing and all claims made  \nregarding this case are just alle gations against the parties.  \n HonorSociety then timely appealed the second injunction.  On appeal, \nit argues  that:  (1) the district court erred in concluding that PTK was \nsubstantially likely to succeed on the merits of its claims for tortious \ninterference , (2) the injunction is an overbroad and vague prior restraint, and \n(3) the injunction compels speech in violation of the First Amendment.  \nBecause we conclude that this injunction is both overbroad and impermissibl y compels speech, we pretermit discussion of HonorSociety’s \nlikelihoo d of success on the merits . \nII \nCourt orders that forbid speech activities are “classic examples of \nprior restraints.”   Alexander v. United States , 509 U.S. 544, 550  (1993) .  Prior \nrestraints  “face a well -established presumption against their \nconstitutionality. ”  United States v. Brown , 218 F.3d 415, 424 –25 (5th Cir. \n2000) ).  “The first step in assessing the constitutionality of a prior restraint \nrequires considering whether the harm the court seeks to prevent justifies the restraint on speech. ”  Marceaux v. Lafayette City- Par. Consol. Gov ’t, 731 F.3d \n488, 493 (5th Cir. 2013) .  Further, t he restriction “must be narrowly tailored Case: 24-60452      Document: 111-1     Page: 4     Date Filed: 04/07/2025No. 24- 60452 \n5 and employ the least restrictive means of preventing the prejudice.”  Id. \nat 492.   \nNeither party disputes that this injunction constitutes a prior \nrestraint.  PTK asserts, however, that the prior restraint is justified  because \nthe district court concluded that HonorSociety’s speech constitute s false \ncommercial speech , which does not enjoy the First Amendment’s full \nprotections .   \nTrue, the  First Amendment  “accords a lesser protection to \ncommercial speech than to other  constitutionally guaranteed expression.”  \nCentral Hudson Gas & Elec. Corp. v. Pub. Serv. Comm’n of N.Y., 447 U.S. 557, \n563 (1980).  But at its core , commercial speech is speech that “does no more \nthan propose a commercial transaction.”  Bolger v. Youngs Drug Prods.  Corp. , \n463 U.S. 60, 66 (1983)  (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).2 \nEdits to PTK’s Wikipedia page cannot, in any sense, be viewed as \n“propos[ing] a commercial transaction.”  Id.   Nor can the cartoon image in \nquestion, which is protected under the First Amendment.  See Bailey v. Iles , \n87 F.4th 275, 283 (5th Cir. 2023) (“The First Amendment’s protections \n_____________________  \n2 Our commercial -speech analysis is guided by the Bolger  factors: “(i) whether the \ncommunication is an advertisement, (ii) whether the communication refers to a specific \nproduct or service, and (iii) whether the speaker has an economic motivation for the \nspeech. ”  Procter & Gamble Co. v. Amway Corp. , 242 F.3d 539, 552 (5th Cir. 2001) (citing \nBolger , 463 U.S. at 67 (internal quotation marks omitted)).   We note that the distinction \nbetween commercial and noncommercial speech is a “matter of degree,” City of Cincinnati \nv. Discovery Network, Inc. , 507 U.S. 410, 423  (1993) , which is ill- suited to a generalized, one -\nsize-fits-all approach.  The record is replete with discrete instances of speech, including \nsocial media posts on LinkedIn and X (formerly Twitter), AI -generated websites and \narticles on myriad topics, Wikipedia edits, cartoons, the PTK chapter “Directory,” and more.  Here, the district court concluded that HonorSociety’s “online postings” collectively constituted commercial speech.  On remand, we urge the district court to \nanalyze commercial speech with an increa sed level of granularity.  Case: 24-60452      Document: 111-1     Page: 5     Date Filed: 04/07/2025No. 24- 60452 \n6 apply to jokes, parodies, satire, and the like, whether clever or in poor \ntaste.”).  \nAssuming arguendo that some of the enjoined speech constitutes \ncommercial speech, the injunction’s sweeping prohibitions are overbroad  \nbecause the injunction also prohibits non -commercial speech and instances \nof speech not found to be prejudicial to PTK .  For example, the district court \nenjoined HonorSociety from making any future edits to PTK’s Wikipedia page —whether true or untrue, prejudicial or innocuous .  It also did not \nidentify any harmful or untrue reporting in HonorSociety’s reporting on Risley.  An injunction must be “ ‘narrowly tailored ’ to excis[e]” only those \nexamples of speech with a sufficient potential for prejudice.  Marceaux , 731 \nF.3d at 494 (vacating injunction that ordered the “takedown” of a website \nwhere only some of the website’s contents caused prejudice).   Because this \ninjunction prohibits speech irrespective of its potential for prejudice, it is \noverbroad.  \nFinally, we conclude that the disclaimer constitutes impermissible \ncompelled speech.  Generally, the government may not compel a person to \nspeak the government’s preferred message.  303 Creative LLC v. Elenis , 600 \nU.S. 570, 586 (2023).  In the context of commercial speech, the government \nmay compel speech if the disclosure is:  (1) purely factual, (2) \nuncontroversial, (3) justified by a legitimate state interest, and (4) not unduly burdensome.  R J Reynolds Tobacco Co. v. FDA, 96 F.4th 863, 877 (5th Cir. 2024) (citing Zauderer v. Off.  of Disciplinary Counsel of Sup.  Ct. of Ohio , 471 \nU.S. 626, 651 (1985)) .  The district court did not analyze whether this \ndisclaimer was uncontroversial, justified by a state interest, or posed undue burdens on HonorSociety.  Further, while PTK asserts that there is a state interest in ensuring an unbiased jury pool, the district court specifically disclaimed any concerns over tainting the jury pool.  Case: 24-60452      Document: 111-1     Page: 6     Date Filed: 04/07/2025No. 24- 60452 \n7 * * * \nIn conclusion, the district court’s injunction is an overbroad prior \nrestraint and impermissibly compels speech.  Accordingly, we VACATE  the \ninjunction and REMAND  to the district court.     Case: 24-60452      Document: 111-1     Page: 7     Date Filed: 04/07/2025",

The case involved AI as Doe questioned the effectiveness of Spider Labs’ claim of using AI to detect ad fraud.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether Spider Labs demonstrated a prima facie case of defamation that would justify revealing John Doe's identity, thereby overcoming Doe's First Amendment right to anonymous speech.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court held that Spider Labs failed to provide competent evidence to prove a prima facie case of defamation.

Having \nconsidered the parties’ papers and the arguments presented  at the hearing, the Co urt grants  Doe’s  \nmotion to quash  and denies his request for attorneys’ fees and costs .  \nI. BACKGROUND  \nThis proceeding arises out of an action Spider Labs filed against Doe  in the Southern \nDistrict of New York, Spider Labs, Ltd. v. Doe , No. 1:20-cv-05457 -LAP  (S.D.N.Y. ).  Spider Labs \nis a Japanese company  that offers products and services intended to combat Internet advertising \nfraud —specifically, activity that artificially inflates the number of “clicks” that online \nadvertisements receive in a pay -per-click advertising arrangement (“Ad Fraud”) .  Dkt. No. 20 -1 ¶¶ \n3, 10.  SpiderAF is Spider Labs’ primary anti -Ad Fraud offering .  Id. ¶ 12.    \nDoe’s true identity is unknown.

Dkt. No. 19 -1 ¶¶ 4 -5.  Sometime before February 2020, Doe  says he  \ndecided to start a blog to educate  the public about Ad Fraud and misleading advertising practices.  \nDkt. No. 19 -1 ¶¶ 6 -7.  On February 25, 2020, Doe registe red a domain name for the blog and set \nup a Google G Suite Business email subscription using his true identity.  Id. ¶¶ 7-8.  Doe then \nassumed a pseudonym, “Jeff Katzenberg,” for purposes of  his blogging activities , purportedly  to \nprotect  his privacy , to avoid having his activities associated with his employer , and to enhance his \ncredibility as a blogger .  Id. ¶ 9.   \nIn March and April 2020, Doe says he began investigating and preparing potential blog \narticles.  Id. ¶ 11.  On June 10, 2020 , Doe discovered a press release from Spider Labs, then \noperating as Phybbit Ltd. (“Phybbit”).  Id. ¶ 12.  The press release stated, among other things: that \nPhybbit was “the only Asian vendor certified by the international Trustworthy Accountability \nGroup  (TAG)”; that Phybbit was “accredited by the US -based Media Rating Council (MRC)”; and \nthat the SpiderAF product uses artificial intelligence or (“AI”) to detect online advertising fraud.  \nId. ¶ 13, Ex. 3.  Doe was aware of other TAG -certified Asian vendor s besides Phybbit, and he \nbelieved that the statement in the press release that Phybbit was the only one was false and \nmisleading.  Id. ¶ 14.  Based on that belief, he decided to investigate Phybbit’s other claims \nconcerning MRC accreditation and SpiderAF’ s use of AI.  Id. ¶ 15.  \nAccording to Doe, he first searched the MRC’s website and found that Phybbit was not \nlisted as an accredited company.  Id. ¶ 17.  He therefore concluded that Phybbit’s claim about \nMRC accreditation was also false and misleading.  Id.  With respect to Phybbit’s claims about \nSpiderAF, Doe says he contacted a Japanese source in the anti -Ad Fraud industry, who informed \nDoe that the source  understood that Phybbit used a “blacklist”  of IP addresses  to attempt to \nidentify fraud  as opposed t o more sophisticated AI or machine learning techniques.  Id. ¶ 19.  Doe \nthen decided to test the efficacy of SpiderAF by visiting the websites of Phybbit’s customers.  Id. \n¶¶ 19 -29.  Doe says he ran  tests designed to mimic  behavior commonly considered  suspicious  in \nthe anti -Ad Fraud industry, such as using a virtual private network to mask his IP address and an \nemulator to misrepresent the type  of device  being used.  Id. ¶¶ 20, 27 -29.  Even while mimicking \nsuspicious behavior, Doe  found he  was able to continue viewing and clicking on advertisements.

Believing  that any effective  anti-Ad Fraud service should have been able to detect \nhis suspicious behavior a nd block him from accessing the ads, Doe concluded that Phybbit’s \nfailure to do so meant Spider AF  did not work as advertised and could not be “AI-driven.”  Id. ¶¶ \n29-30.   \nDoe says he decided to write a blog article about what he believed were false and \nmisleading statements from  Phybbit .  Id. ¶ 31.  As part of the writing process, he used his Jeff \nKatzenberg  Google  email  account  to contact 13 Phybbit customers on June 14, 2020.1  Id. ¶¶ 31 -\n32, 34.  The emails, which were substantially similar  to one another , stated:  \n \nDear [Phybbit customer contact],  \n \nMy name is Jeff, and I run a new blog about preventing ad fraud.  \nI’m currently running an article about a fraudulent Japanese \ncompany c alled Phybbit/SpiderAF that I believe might have \ncommitted fraud against you and [Phybbit customer name].  \n \nIn my article, I talk about how they tell customers that they are \nMRC accredited, even though they aren’t, and how they claim their \ntechnology is art ificial intelligence based (which it isn’t).  I’m also \ntalking about how they are defrauding their clients, like you guys, \nand how all of their clients aren’t actually protected from fraud. We \nhired a team of engineers to test it out and discovered there’s  \nnothing behind their platform, and ran a bunch of campaigns with \ntheir clients (SSPs and DSPs) and discovered that it couldn’t detect \nfraud.  \n \nI saw a press release saying that you guys are their clients and I \nwanted to interview you, like other people, on  whether or not you \nknew that they aren’t actually MRC accredited even though they \nclaim they are.  \n \nFurthermore, we’re looking to do a massive press release in Japan, \nin Japanese, to expose them.  \n \nAre you perhaps free this week to have a call and provide a  quote \nfor the article?  \n \nBest,  \n \nJeff \n \nId. ¶ 33, Exs. 10 -11; see also Dkt.

No. 20 (D. Ariz. Nov. 30, 2020 ).   \nII. LEGAL STANDARD  \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 45 governs discovery of non -parties.  The scope of  \nallowable  discovery under  Rule 45 is the s ame as the scope of discovery permitted under Rule \n26(b).  Beaver Cty. Employers Ret. Fund v. Tile Shop Holdings, Inc. , No. 3:16 -mc-80062 -JSC, \n2016 WL 3162218, at *2 (N.D. Cal. June 7, 2016) (citing Fed. R. Civ. P. 45 advisory comm ’s note \n(1970); Fed. R.  Civ. P. 34(a)).  Rule 26 permits discovery “regarding any non -privileged matter \nthat is relevant to any party’s claim or defense and proportional to the needs of the case \nconsidering the importance of the issues at stake in the action, the amount in contr oversy, the \nparties’ relative access to relevant information, the parties’ resources, the importance of the \ndiscovery in resolving the issues, and whether the burden or expense of the proposed discovery \noutweighs its likely benefit.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b) (1).  \nThe Court must limit the frequency or extent of discovery if it determines that: “(i) the \ndiscovery sought is unreasonably cumulative or duplicative, or can be obtained from some other \nsource that is more convenient, less burdensome, or less expensiv e; (ii) the party seeking \ndiscovery has had ample opportunity to obtain the information by discovery in the action; or (iii) \nthe proposed discovery is outside the scope permitted by Rule 26(b)(1).”  Fed. R. Civ. P. \n26(b)(2)(C).  Rule 45 further provides th at “the court for the district where compliance is required \nmust quash or modify a subpoena that: (i) fails to allow a reasonable time to comply; (ii) requires \na person to comply beyond the geographical limits specified in Rule 45(c); (iii) requires disclo sure \nof privileged or other protected matter, if no exception or waiver applies; or (iv) subjects a person \nto undue burden.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 45(d)(3)(A).  \nGenerally, “a party has no standing to seek to quash a subpoena issued to someone who is \nnot a party  to the action, unless the objecting party claims some personal right or privilege with \nregard to the documents sought.”  Drummond Co., Inc. v. Collingsworth , Nos. 13–mc–80169 –JST \n(JCS ), 13–mc–80171 –JST (JCS) , 2013 WL 6074157, at *15 (N.D. Cal. Nov. 18, 2013) (quoting \n9A Charles A. Wright & Arthur R. Miller, Fed. Prac. & Proc. § 2459 (3d ed. 2008)).  If good \ncause is shown, a court may “issue an order to protect a party or person from annoyance, Case 5:20-mc-80141-VKD   Document 33   Filed 12/07/20   Page 6 of 18 \n7 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  embarrassment, o ppression, or undue burden or expense, including . . . forbidding the disclosure \nor discovery.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(c)(1)(A).  \nThe moving party bears the burden of persuasion on a motion to quash, but the party \nissuing the subpoena must demonstrate that th e discovery is relevant .  See Chevron Corp. v. \nDonziger , No. 3:12 -mc-80237 -CRB, 2013 WL 4536808, at *4 (N.D. Cal. Aug. 22, 2013) (citation \nomitted); see also Optimize Tech. Solutions, LLC v. Staples, Inc. , No. 5:14 -mc-80095 -LHK, 2014 \nWL 1477651, at *2 (N.D . Cal. Apr. 14, 2014).  \nIII. DISCUSSION  \nDoe advances several  arguments as to why the Court should quash Spider Labs’ s \nsubpoenas to Google and LinkedIn.  First, Doe contends that the subpoenas should be quashed for \nfailure to comply with Rule 45(d)(3)(A).  Second , Doe says the subpoena s violate the Stored \nCommunications Act.  Third, Doe argues  that because  the subpoenas seek documents revealing his \nidentity , they  violate his First Amendment right to anonymous speech , and that this Court is \ncollaterally estopped by  the District of Arizona’s order quashing the GoDaddy subpoena from \nfinding otherwise .   \nThe Court addresses each argument in turn.  In addition, the Court considers Doe’s request \nfor attorneys’ fees and costs pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure  § 1987.2(c).    \nA. Rule 45(d)(3)  \nDoe argues that the  Court should quash the  subpoenas for failure to comply with Rule \n45(d)(3)(A).  Dkt. No. 19 at 5 n.1.  Rule 45(d)(3)(A)(ii) provides that the Court must quash or \nmodify a subpoena that requires compliance be yond the geographical limits specified in Rule \n45(c) —i.e., 100 miles from where the subpoenaed party lives or transacts business.  The \nsubpoenas here are directed to Google and LinkedIn .  Google is headquartered in  Mountain View, \nCalifornia, and LinkedIn i s headquartered in Sunnyvale, California, but the subpoena s require \nproduction of documents in Denver, Colorado , well outside the permissible geographic limits .  \nDkt. No. 2, Exs. C -D.   \nSpider Labs does not address this defect in its opposition.  See Dkt. No. 20.  However, at \nthe hearing, Spider Labs conceded that the subpoenas were deficient in this respect  and stated that Case 5:20-mc-80141-VKD   Document 33   Filed 12/07/20   Page 7 of 18 \n8 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  although neither Google nor LinkedIn had objected on this basis, it would stipulate to a place of \nproduction within this District instead .  Dkt. No. 28 at 6:5 –7:25.  Based on this representation, the \nCourt will not quash the subpoenas for failure to comply with Rule 45(d)(3)(A).  \nB. Stored Communications Act  \nDoe also argues  briefly in a footnote  that the  Court should quash the  subpoenas because \nthe disclosures they require would violate  the Stored Communications Act.  Dkt. No. 19 at 5 n.1.  \nDoe does not explain this objection .  As the subpoenas do not seek the content s of any stored \ncommunications associated with the accounts at issue , they do not implicate the prohibitions of the \nStored Communications Act .  See, e.g., Optiver Australia Pty. Ltd. v. Tibra Trading Pty. Ltd. , No. \nC 12 -80242 EJD (PSG), 2013 WL 256771, at *2 –3 (N.D. Cal. Jan. 23, 2013) (discussing \nprohibitions of Stored Communications Act, 18 U.S.C. § 2701 et seq. ).  The Court denies Doe’s \nmotion to quash on this ground.  \nC. First Amendment Right to Anonymous Speech  \nThe First Amendment protects the rights of individuals to speak anonymously.  \nWatchtower  Bible & Tract Soc’y of New York v. Village of Stratton , 536 U.S. 150, 166 –67 (2002); \nMcIntyre v. Ohio Elections Comm’n , 514 U.S. 334, 341 –42 (1995).  But that right does not protect \ntortious, defamatory, or libelous speech.  USA Tech s., Inc. v. Doe , 713 F. Supp. 2d 901, 906 (N.D. \nCal. 2010); see also In re Anonymous Online Speakers , 661 F.3d 1168, 1173 (9th Cir. 2011)  (“The \nright to speak, whether anonymously or otherwise, is not unlimited, however, and the degree of \nscrutiny varies depending on the  circumstances and the type of speech at issue.”).    \nHere, Doe contends that his First Amendment right to anonymous speech requires \nquashing of the subpoenas.  Dkt. No. 19 at 5 –17.  Spider Labs responds  that First Amendment \nprotection does not bar its cla ims against Doe for defamatory and tortious  speech .  Dkt. No. 20 at \n8–10.  The parties also dispute whether the District of Arizona’s order quashing the subpoena to \nGoDaddy  (which also seeks documents revealing Doe’s true identity)  compels a similar order \nfrom this Court  under the doctrine of collateral estoppel.   \nThe Court first considers  whether and to what extent collateral estoppel applies  to this \ndispute . Case 5:20-mc-80141-VKD   Document 33   Filed 12/07/20   Page 8 of 18 \n9 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  1. Application of collateral estoppel  \nOn October 23, 2020, the District of Arizona granted Doe’s motion to quash Spider Labs’s \nsubpoena to GoDaddy.  Spider Labs , 2020 WL 6262397 .  The Arizona court found that Spider \nLabs failed to make a prima facie showing on all elements of its defamation cl aim and that this \nfailure extended to all of other claims in the complaint .2  Id. at *2.  Spider Labs’s subsequent \nmotion to reconsider that ruling was denied.   \nCollateral estoppel , or issue preclusion, “bars  successive litigation of an issue of fact or \nlaw actually litigated and resolved in a valid court  determination,” where resolution of the issue \nwas “essential to the prior judgment.”   Taylor v. Sturgell , 553 U.S. 880, 892 (2008) .  Estoppel \napplies when the following four conditions are  met: “(1) the issue at stake was identical in both \nproceedings; (2) the issue was actually litigated and decided in the prior proceedings; (3) there was \na full and fair opportunity to litigate the issue; and (4) the issue was necessary to decide the \nmerits.”   Janjua v. Neufeld , 933 F.3d 1061, 1065 (9th Cir. 2019) (quoting  Oyeniran v. Holder , 672 \nF.3d 800, 806 (9th Cir. 2012), as amended  (May 3, 2012)) (internal quotation marks omitted).   \nDoe asserts that all conditions necessary for collateral estoppel are met.  Dkt. No . 29 at 2 –3.  \nSpider Labs contends that (1) the issues at stake are not identical between the two proceedings , \nand (2) the issue of Doe’s standing to assert First Amendment protection was not actually litigated \nbefore  or decided by  the Arizona court.3  Dkt. No. 30 at 8 –10.   \nThe Court agrees , in part,  with Doe.  With respect to the question of whether Spider Labs \nsatisfie d its burden to come forward with competent evidence showing a prima facie case of \ndefamation, the Court finds that collateral estoppel applies .  First, t he principal issue presented to \n \n2 Spider Labs acknowledged at the hearing before this Court that all its other claims derived from \nits defamation claim.  Dkt. No. 28 at 38:20 –39:7.   \n \n3 Spider Labs further argues that the issue of falsity as to its defa mation claim was not fully \nlitigated before the Arizona court because that court did not have the same evidence before it: a \nsupplemental declaration from Spider Labs Chief Technology Officer Eurico Doraido, which \nSpider Labs submitted together with its su pplemental brief.  Dkt. No. 30 -2.  Doe objects to this \ndeclaration as violating Civil Local Rule 7 -3(d) and requests that the Court strike it.  Dkt. No. 31.  \nDoe’s objections are well -taken.  The Court will not consider the supplemental Doraido \ndeclaration .  In any event, “[t]he introduction of new evidence on a matter previously resolved is \nnot an exception to collateral estoppel.”   Oyeniran , 672 F.3d at 807.   \n Case 5:20-mc-80141-VKD   Document 33   Filed 12/07/20   Page 9 of 18 \n10 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  both this Court and the District of Arizona is whether Spider Labs made a prima facie showing on \nall elements of its defamation claim .  Second, t he parties actually litigated the question of Spider \nLabs’s prima facie showing before the District of Arizona , and in so doing relied on briefing and \nargument  that is largely id entical to the briefing and argument before this Court .4  See, e.g. , Spider \nLabs Ltd. v. Doe , No. MC -20-00039 -PHX -SPL, Dkt. No. 12 at 2 n.1  (D. Ariz. Oct. 13 , 2020)  \n(acknowledging that “[s]ubstantively identical motions to quash” were filed before the Dis trict of \nArizona and the Northern District of California and suggesting that the Arizona court should await \na ruling in the California court).  Third, although the District of Arizona did not hold a hearing on \nDoe’s motion to quash, the parties had a full and fair opportunity to litigate the question in \nArizona .5  Fourth,  the District of Arizona  issued an order on the merits finding that Spider Labs \ndid not make a prima facie showing of defamation and quashing Spider Labs’ s subpoena  for that \nreason .   \nThe parties do not dispute that resolution of a miscellaneous discovery proceeding \nancillary to an underlying civil action may have collateral estoppel effect, even  where multiple \nsimilar  discovery disputes are litigated in parallel with one another and with the underlying action.  \nThe Court has been able to identify  only a few courts  that have considered this question, and those \nthat have generally agree that co llateral estoppel applies to ancillary discovery proceeding s such as \nthis one.  See, e.g. , Signature Mgmt. Team, LLC v. Doe , No. 13 –cv–14005 , 2015 WL 1245861 , at \n*4–7 (E.D. Mich. Mar. 18, 2015) ( noting that the Sixth Circuit has held that that “an order by  one \nfederal district court on a discovery dispute is res judicata on that same issue in another federal \ndistrict court that has concurrent jurisdiction of the discovery dispute”) (internal citation and \n \n4 Spider Labs argues that Doe’s motions to quash did not contain identical briefs or case law.  Dkt. \nNo. 30 at 5.  While the motions are not verbatim replicas of one another, upon examination, the \narguments and propositions for which various cases are cited are the same.  At the hearing, Spider \nLabs acknowledged that the evidence submitted to both c ourts was identical and the arguments \nsimilar.  Dkt. No. 28 at 42:13 –43:2.  \n \n5 Spider Labs asserts in its supplemental brief that “ on the issue of whether Spider Labs presented \ncompetent evidence of the falsity  of Doe’s statements, Spider Labs presented additional argument \nand clarification during the  hearing by this Court that was not considered by the Arizona court. ”  \nDkt. No. 30.  However, the District of Arizona has since  considered and rejected Spider Labs’s  \nmotion for reconsideration , demonstrating that Spider Labs has now ha d ample opportunity to \nlitigate the issue.  Case 5:20-mc-80141-VKD   Document 33   Filed 12/07/20   Page 10 of 18 \n11 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  quotation marks omitted); Kwolek v. United States , No. 11-mc-53, 2011 WL 2940984  (W.D. \nPenn . July 21, 2011) (finding Northern District of California’s denial of motion to quash IRS \nsummonses collaterally estopped plaintiff’s petition to quash before Eastern District of \nPennsylvania); Bounkhoun v. Barnes , No.  15-CV-631A, 2020 WL 1526917  (W.D.N.Y. Mar. 30, \n2020) (finding that special pre-suit discovery proceeding in state court  resulting in  denial of  \ndiscovery requests estopped plaintiff from later subpoenaing the same information ).  \nFurthermore, the Court finds that the District of Arizona’s decision was a sufficiently final \ndisposition on the merits for the purposes of collateral estoppel.  “ Only a  final judgment that is \n‘sufficiently firm ’ can be issue preclusive. ”  Robi v. Five Platters, Inc. , 838 F.2d 318, 326 (9th Cir. \n1988) .  Because Doe’s several motions to quash  are ancillary  proceedings , no final judgment will \nbe entered in those proceedings  pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 58.  Nevertheless, “a n \norder denying a motion to quash  a subpoena qualifies as  a final decision on the merits for purposes \nof res judicata .”  Signature Mgmt. , 2015 WL 1245861 , at *4 (citing Westwood Chemical Co.  v. \nKulick, 656 F.2d 1224, 1227  (6th Cir.  1981) ); see also Highfields  Capital Mgmt. L.P. v. Doe , 385 \nF. Supp. 2d  969, 971 (N.D. Cal. 2005)  (“[R]esolution of the motion [to quash] will conclude the \nmiscellaneous proceeding in this distric t . . . . ”).  The Court observes that the Arizona court has \ndenied Spider Labs’s motion for reconsideration, but Spider Labs has not yet appealed the Arizona \ncourt’s order to the Ninth Circuit.  Thus, t he Arizona court’s order is sufficiently final for the \npurposes o f issue preclusion in that it signals the end of the discovery proceeding before that court.  \nHowever, the Court disagrees that collateral estoppel applies to all arguments Doe raises \nhere regarding application of the First Amendment.  The parties did not “ actually litigate,”  and the \nDistrict of Arizona  did not decide , whether  Doe is entitled to invoke First Amendment protection \nin the first instance .  “[A]n issue is actually litigated when an issue is raised, contested, and \nsubmitted for determination.”  Janjua, 933 F.3d at 1066; Restatement (Second) of Judgments § 27, \ncmt. (d) (1982) (“When an issue is properly raised, by the pleadings or otherwise, and is submitted \nfor determination and is determined, the issue is actually litigated . . . .”).   \nAccordingl y, the Court will consider whether the record supports Doe’s position that he is \nentitled to invoke  the protections of the First Amendment as a basis to quash Spider Labs’s Case 5:20-mc-80141-VKD   Document 33   Filed 12/07/20   Page 11 of 18 \n12 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  subpoenas.  \n2. Whether Doe is entitled to invoke First Amendment  protections  \nIn their original briefing, the parties assume  that Doe is a person who possesses rights \nunder the First Amendment.  Spider Labs disputes application of the First Amendment based on  \nthe nature of the challenged speech, not the status of the speaker.  Dkt. No. 20 at  8–10.  Doe \nsimply asserts that he has First Amendment rights.  Dkt. No. 19 at 5.   Because the basis for Doe’s \ninvocation of the First Amendment was not clear from the parties’ submissions, the Court \nrequested supplemental briefing identifying  the legal an d factual bases for application of the First \nAmendment.  Dkt. No. 25.  The Court did not authorize the submission of  supplemental  evidence.   \nU.S. citizens , whether inside or  outside U.S. territory , possess First Amendment rights.  \nAgency for Int’l Dev. v. Alliance for Open Soc’y Int’l, Inc.  (“USAID I ”), 570 U.S. 205 (2013).  \nWhile under some circumstances non -citizens within a U.S. territory possess certain constitutional \nrights, “it is long settled as a matter of American constitutional law that foreign citizens outside \nU.S. territory do not possess rights under the U.S. Constitution.”  Agency for Int’l Dev. v. Alliance \nfor Open Soc’y Int’l, Inc.  (“USAID II ”), 140 S. Ct. 2082, 2086 (2020) (finding th at foreign \ncorporations do not possess First Amendment rights, even if affiliated with U.S. entities).  Thus, if \nDoe is a U.S. citizen or if he is a non -citizen within U.S. territory, then he may properly invoke the \nFirst Amendment ; otherwise, he may not.  \nIn the complaint before the Southern District of New York , Spider Labs alleges on \ninformation and belief that Doe is a U.S. citizen who resides within that district.  Spider Labs, Ltd. \nv. Doe , No. 1:20 -cv-05457 -LAP, Dkt. No. 1 ¶¶ 2 -4 (S.D.N.Y. July 16, 2020).  At the hearing, \nSpider Labs explained that  it has evidence  Doe was in New York when he sent the emails at issue , \nbut it does not know whether he is a U.S. citizen .  Dkt. No. 28 at 43:17 -18.  Doe’s declaration in \nsupport of his  motion to quash is entirely silent on these matters .  See Dkt. No. 19 -1; Dkt. No. 28 \nat 13:6 –15:12 .  In his supplemental brief, Doe asserts  that, irrespective of his U.S. citizenship \nstatus, he was indeed lawfully and physically present within the United States when he sent the \nemails at issue , as Spider Labs alleges .  Dkt. No. 29 at 8 –9.  He argues that his physical presence \nin the United States  entitles him to First Amendment protections.  Id. Case 5:20-mc-80141-VKD   Document 33   Filed 12/07/20   Page 12 of 18 \n13 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  The Court agrees with Doe that First Amendment speech pro tections “at a minimum apply \nto all persons legally within our borders.”  Underwager v. v. Channel 9  Australia , 69 F.3d 361, \n365 (9th Cir. 1995).   As Spider Labs does not dispute that Does was legally present within the \nU.S. at the time he sent the emails at issue, and did not oppose Doe’s motion to quash based on his \nstatus, the Court concludes that Doe  may invoke the First Amendment as a basis f or his motion to \nquash.  \n3. Alternatively, Spider Labs has not met its burden under a prima facie \nstandard  \nGiven the dearth of authority regarding application of the collateral estoppel doctrine in the \ncontext of parallel  ancillary discovery proceedings, the Court will additionally make clear its \nindependent views of the merits of this dispute.  \nAs Doe is a party to the underlying action in the Southern District of New York, the Court \nagrees with the District of Arizona that Spider Labs must satisfy a prima facie standard .   Here, the \nCourt relies on the standard as set forth  in Highfields Capital Mgmt., L.P. v. Doe , 385 F. Supp. 2d \n969 (N.D. Cal. 2005).  Rich v. Butowsky , No. 20 -mc-80081 -DMR, 2020 WL 5910069, at *3 n.2 \n(N.D. Cal. Oct. 6, 2020) (observing that the Highfields  test is appropriate where the anonymous \nspeaker is a party to the litigation); USA Techs ., 713 F. Supp. 2d at 907 (applying Highfields test \nwhere Doe defendant in underlying action moved to quash subpoena for information revealing his \nidentity).  Under Highfields , the Court requires: (1) the plaintiff to adduce, without the aid of \ndiscovery, competent evidence  addressing all of the inferences of fact essential to support a prima \nfacie case on all elements of a claim; and (2) if the plaintiff succeeds, the Court must then  \n \nassess and compare the magnitude of the harms that would be \ncaused to the competing intere sts by a ruling in favor of plaintiff and \nby a ruling in favor of defendant.  If, after such an assessment, the \ncourt concludes that enforcing the subpoena would cause relatively \nlittle harm to the defendant ’s First Amendment and privacy rights \nand that it s issuance is necessary to enable plaintiff to protect against \nor remedy serious wrongs, the court would deny the motion to \nquash.  \nHighfields, 385 F. Supp. 2d at 975 –76.  As Spider Labs acknowledged at the hearing, its claims of \ntortious interference with prospective economic advantage and tortious interference with a \ncontractual relationship derive from its defamation claim.  Dkt. No. 28 at 38:20 –39:7; see also Case 5:20-mc-80141-VKD   Document 33   Filed 12/07/20   Page 13 of 18 \n14 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  Spider Labs , 2020 WL 6262397  at *3 (noting that all claims stem from the defamation claim).  \nThe Court therefore focuses on the defamation claim.  \nSpider Labs contends that the New York court  already determined that Spider Labs made \nthe requisite  prima facie showing when it concluded that “Spider Labs has adequately pleaded \nthree causes of action” inc luding defamation .  Spider Labs, Ltd. v. Doe , No. 1:20 -cv-05457 -LAP, \nDkt. No. 7  at 2 (S.D.N.Y. July 20, 2020) ; Dkt. No. 20 at 3, 12.  However, the New York court’s \norder addressed only whether the allegations of the complaint pled claim s of defamation  and \ntortious interference  against Doe.  The court did not consider whether Spider Labs adduced \n“competent evidence” in support of those claims.   \nTo succeed on a claim for defamation,  a plaintiff must establish (1) a false statement about \nthe plaintiff; ( 2) that was published to a third party without authorization or privilege; ( 3) with \nfault amounting to at least negligence; and ( 4) that caused special harm or defamation per se.   Thai \nv. Cayre Group, Ltd. , 726 F.  Supp.  2d 323, 329 (S.D.N.Y. 20 10).  “[A] statement that ‘tend[s] to \ninjure the plaintiff in his or her trade, business or profession’ is defamatory per se and does not \nrequire proof of special damages to be actionable,” and “‘[w]here a statement impugns the basic \nintegrity or creditwor thiness of a business, an action for defamation lies and injury is conclusively \npresumed.’”  Id. at 331.    \nSpider Labs asserts that there are seven false statements in Doe’s emails:  \nStatement No. 1 : Doe was running an article about Spider Labs and its pro duct,  \nSpiderAF, on his blog;  \nStatement No. 2 : Spider Labs’s technology is not based on artificial intelligence;  \nStatement No. 3 : Spider Labs is defrauding its clients;  \nStatement No. 4 : Spider Labs’s clients are not protected from fraud;  \nStatement No. 5: Doe  had hired a team of engineers to test Spider Labs’s  \ntechnology;  \nStatement No. 6 : there is nothing behind Spider Labs’s platform; and  \nStatement No. 7 : Spider Labs’s platform cannot detect fraud.   \nDkt. No. 20 at 13.   Case 5:20-mc-80141-VKD   Document 33   Filed 12/07/20   Page 14 of 18 \n15 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  The Court finds that Spider L abs has not provided competent  evidence supporting the first \nelement of its defamation  claim .  Statements Nos. 1 and 5 concern only Doe, not Spider Labs , and \ntherefore are not  actionable , even if false .  See Thai , 726 F. Supp. 3d at 329.   With respect to \nStatements Nos. 2, 3, 4, 6, and 7, to the extent these  statements are capable of being proved  true or \nfalse, Spider Labs has not adduced competent evidence to support a prima facie showing that they \nare false.   \nMr. Doraido’s  initial declar ation , on which Spider Labs relies,  does little  more than repeat \nthe allegations of the complaint in the underlying action.  Compare  Dkt. No. 20 -1 with Spider \nLabs, Ltd. v. Doe , No. 1:20 -cv-05457 -LAP, Dkt. No. 1 (S.D.N.Y. July 16, 2020).   Mr. Doraido  \ndoes not refute the challenged statements.  For example, he does not state that SpiderAF “uses AI -\ndrive n tools ,” whatever that mean s.  Instead, he simply states that “Spider Labs’s primary service, \nSpiderAF, is an anti -Ad Fraud software platform t hat offers users a variety of different services \nand functions, including a reporting dashboard, a shared ‘blacklist’ service, and a real -time Ad \nFraud detection application program interface that customers can implement to for handling fraud \naffecting the ir business.”  Dkt. No. 20 -1 ¶ 21.  It is not self -evident that those various services and \nfunctions have anything to do with AI.6  Nor does this assertion —or any other assertion by Mr. \nDoraido —show that SpiderAF  succeeds in detecting  Ad Fraud , thereby negating Doe’s statements \nthat Spider Labs is defrauding its clients and that its platform does not function to detect fraud.  In \nshort , Spider Labs has not offered competent evidence showing that  the challenged sta tements are \nactually false.   \nThe Court also finds that Spider Labs has not made a  prima facie showing  on the third \nelement of its defamation claim because it has not adduced competent evidence of fault  on Doe’s \npart.  Spider Labs argues that Doe’s failure  to contact Spider Labs before reaching out to its \ncustomers or to license its technology is evidence of negligence, but Spider Labs cites no  legal  \n \n6 Indeed, Statement No. 2 may not be capable of being proven true or false based on how one \ndefines “artificial intelligence.”  See Ayaadurai  v. Floor64, Inc. , 270 F. Supp. 3d 343 (D. Mass. \n2017) (holding that challenged statements could not be proved true or false because whether the \nplaintiff actually was the inventor of e -mail depended in substantial part on the definition of “e -\nmail,” which  the parties contested).  Case 5:20-mc-80141-VKD   Document 33   Filed 12/07/20   Page 15 of 18 \n16 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  authority or factual support for its contention that someone in Doe’s position acts negligently in \nfailing t o take these steps .  Dkt. No. 20 at 13 –14.  Spider Labs also criticizes Doe for not obtaining  \nspecific details about how Spider Labs’s service functioned in  each individual  customer’s situation  \nand for not fol lowing any “established methodology” for testi ng SpiderAF .  Spider Labs does  not \nexplain why it believes Doe had an obligation to obtain specific details  of Spider Labs’s service  or \nto use a particular  testing methodology (which  Spider Labs does not even describe).   Id.   \nAccordingly, the Court finds that Spider Labs has not adduced competent evidence \nsupporting  the first and third elements of its defamation claim , and likewise has not adduced \ncompetent evidence supporting his derivative claims for tortious interference .  Because the Court \nfinds that Spider Labs has not provided competent evidence of a prima facie case , the Court need \nnot consider the second part of the  Highfields  analysis.  \nD. Doe’s Request for Attorneys’ Fees and Costs  \nDoe seeks his attorneys’ fees and costs f or moving to quash the subpoenas under \nCalifornia Code of Civil Procedure § 1987.2(c) .  Dkt. No. 19 at 18 –19.  Section 1987.2(c)  \nprovides that, when a movant successfully quashes or modifies a subpoena served on an Internet \nservice provider (as defined in 42 U.S.C. §  230(f)(2)) for personally identifying information for \nuse in an action outside of California that arises from the movant’s exercise of free speech rights \non the Internet and the respondent fails to make a prima facie showing of a cause of actio n, the \nmovant is entitled to reasonable expenses and attorneys’ fees incurred in moving to quash or \nmodify.   \nAn award of fees  and costs  is not appropriate here.  First, “ a motion . . . filed under Section \n1987.1 for an order to quash or modify a subpoena from a court of this state for personally  \nidentifying information ” is a prerequisite for fees  and costs .  Cal. Civ.  Proc.  Code § 1987.2(c) .  \nDoe did not file a motion to quash pursuant to California Civil Code § 1987. 1; he moved solely \nunder Rule 45 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure .  Dkt. No. 19 at 5.   Second, t he Court is not \npersuaded that Doe’s email communications with Spider Labs ’s customers are an “exercise of free \nspeech rights on the Internet.”  The challenged statements were not posted  publicly on the Internet , \nbut communicated instead by private email.   Case 5:20-mc-80141-VKD   Document 33   Filed 12/07/20   Page 16 of 18 \n17 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  Furthermore, Doe cites no authority supporting application of § 1987.2(c ) in the \ncircumstances presented here.  He did not provide —nor could the Court find —any examples of \nCalifornia district courts applying section 1987.2 in a miscellaneous federal action where the \nunderlying action is premised on violations of another state’s laws.   The authority on which Doe \nrelies is distinguishable.  In Roe v. Halbig , 29 Cal.  App.  5th 286 (2018) , the California Court of \nAppeals held that a moving party  in a California state court action may  prevail within the me aning \nof section 198 7.2 even where a subpoena is withdrawn before the trial court rule s on the motion to  \nquash.  There, the challenged statements consisted of “‘ defamatory posts ’ about [the plaintiff]  on a \nnumber  of websites and social media sites ”: a clear case of speech “on the Internet” that is not \npresent here.  Id. at 293.  In In re Rule 45 Subpoena Issued to Cablevision Systems Corporation \nRegarding IP Address 69.120.35.31 , No. MISC 08 –347(ARR)(MDG) , 2010 WL 2219343  \n(E.D.N.Y. Feb. 5, 2010) , the federal district court did not consider  section 1987.2 at all, but \nawarded fees and costs solely under  Rule 45.   \nTo the extent Doe seeks an award of fees and costs under Rule 45(d)(1) —and it is not clear \nthat he does, see Dkt. No. 22 at 15 —the Court is no t persuaded that Spider Labs acted \nunreasonably or in bad faith in pursuing the subpoenas.   See Legal Voice v. Stormans Inc. , 738 \nF.3d 1178, 1185 (9th Cir. 2013) (noting that fees and costs under Rule 45(d)(1) is discretionary \nand that “[a] court may . . .  impose sanctions when a party issues a subpoena in bad faith, for an \nimproper purpose, or in a manner inconsistent with existing law”) (citing Mount Hope Church v. \nBash Back! , 705 F.3d 418, 425 (9th Cir. 2012) ; Mattel Inc. v. Walking Mountain Prods. , 353 F.3d \n792, 814 (9th Cir. 2003) ). \nThe Court denies Doe’s request for an awar d of attorneys’ fees and co sts. \nIV. CONCLUSION  \nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court grants  Doe’s motion to quash the subpoenas to \nGoogle and LinkedIn .  Doe’s  request for relief und er California Code of Civil Procedure \n§ 1987.2(c)  is denied.  \n/// \n/// Case 5:20-mc-80141-VKD   Document 33   Filed 12/07/20   Page 17 of 18 \n18 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  IT IS SO ORDERED.  \nDated: December 7, 2020  \n \n  \nVIRGINIA K.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: In Mansfield and Marchionnda v. Norfolk Southern Railway Company, the plaintiffs sued under the Federal Employers' Liability Act to seek compensation for injuries from a train derailment caused by a rockslide. The court denied the defendant's motion for summary judgment, indicating sufficient evidence for a jury to determine whether the railway company was negligent in maintaining a safe working environment. AI was involved in the case as the railway had attempted to use an AI-based system to detect rockslides, but the system failed to be fully operational, contributing to the plaintiffs' claims of negligence.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether Norfolk Southern Railway Company was negligent in ensuring a safe workplace by failing to prevent rockslides on its tracks, particularly through the inadequate implementation and operation of an AI-based rockslide detection system.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court denied the defendant's motion for summary judgment, thereby allowing the case to proceed to trial. The court found that there was sufficient evidence for a jury to reasonably conclude that the rockslide was foreseeable and that the company may have been negligent in maintaining safety protocols, including the reliance on a faulty AI detection system.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine driving a car and suddenly hitting a fallen rock that caused you injuries. You believe the company responsible for maintaining the road should have warned you or removed the rocks before you got there. The company had a robot supposedly watching for dangerous rocks, but it wasn’t working that day. A judge decided that a group of citizens (a jury) should decide whether the company was careless, mainly because the faulty robot might have helped prevent accidents if it had worked.",

Defendant is a railroad company engaged in interstate commerce.  On \nDecember 12, 2021,  plaintiffs were employed by defendant as a locomotive engineer and \nconductor and were acting within the course and scope of  their employment while operating a \nwestbound train on defendant's \"Mon Line Track 2. \"  At approximately 4:00 a.m, their train \nstruck a  pile of debris at milepost 9.3 due to a  rockslide  from the adjacent hillside .  At that \nlocation the tracks abut a steep hillside that trans cends upward at a significant vertical ly-\nslanted  incline.  The hillside had significant layers of stone within its composition.  There are \nlarge sections of \"cut\" stone in the outer -most face of the hillside, which is referred to as \"cut \nrock\" by railroad personnel.  This characteristic of the terrain generally extend s from milepost \n9 to milepost 10 , with large sections of cut rock existing at various locations within that one -\nmile stretch .   \nThe specific area where the derailment occurred is known as \"CP Beck .\"  In the \ndirection plaintiffs were traveling t he tracks cross a highway and make a bend  while doing so .  \nSight ahead is part ially limited while traversing through this area, and a signal system is \nstationed to assist with safe passage into and through the corridor .  When plaintiffs traversed \ninto this area the signal was clear.  As they proceeded through and out of the bend, th e light \nfrom their locomotive suddenly illuminated a large obstruction in the center of the tracks.  Case 2:22-cv-01159-DSC     Document 49     Filed 09/25/25     Page 3 of 254 \n Plaintiffs had only a few seconds to react once they realized the magnitude of the obstruction \nand they moved to the center of the engine to brace for the  upcoming impact.           \nThe rocks on the tracks caused the locomotive in which plaintiffs were working to flip \nover and several cars to derail.  Conductor -plaintiff  Edward Mansfield (\"Mansfield\") was \ndiagnosed with a concussion, post -concussion syndrome and anxiety following the accident \nand was out of work from December 12, 2021 , through December 29, 2022.  Engineer -plaintiff \nMatthew Marchionda was diagnosed with a concussion, post -concussion syndrome and \nforaminal stenosis of the cervical spine followin g the accident and was out of work from \nDecember 12, 2021 , through December, 2023.   Pretrial Stipulation (Doc. No. 40) at ¶ ¶ III (a) -\n(h). \nPrior to the derailment, several rockslides had occurred between milepost s 9.0 and 9.9.  \nA rockslide occurred in the a rea on January 11, 2013.  Engineer Leis was driving the train \nwhen it collided with debris on the tracks.  She completed a repor t stating:  \"while operating \n653 North on track 1 at Monline  9.2 [the locomotive] struck 2 large rocks fouling track 1.\"  \nReport of Personal Injury of Cathy M. Leis (Doc.

Leis' supervisor completed a report that also identified the location of the \nincident as occurring at milepost 9.2.  Id. at pp. 4 -5.     \nDefendant dispatched a team to inspect the scene and clean up the debris.  A crew \ndispatched  by Engineer G eotechnical Services took photographs of the debris and completed a \nreport of inspection.  It identified the accident as occurring at mile post 9.9.

It performed these undertakings on January 15, 2013, and issued a report on January \n17, 2013.    \nIn its report, Golder identified the rockslide as occurring at milepost 9.9.  It observed \nand identified the various form ations of rock that could be identified visually from track level \nin the steep slope near the location of the slide .  It determined that t he slide occurred near the \ncrest of the rock slope, which was \"80 to 100 feet vertically above the track grade.\"  Golder \nAssociates Report of January 17, 2013 (Doc. No. 43 -6) a p. 2.  It opined that \"the slide \noccurred within the middle massive sandstone m ember (Morgantown) of the Casselman \nFormation.\"  Id.  This sandstone unit is about \"20 to 25 [f oot] thick in the slope and is \nunderlain by approximately 20 [foot] of thinly -bedded siltstone and shale.\"  Id.   Bent tre es \nwere observed to the south of the sl ide indicating \"soil/talus creep [was] occurring\" and several \nwet areas also were observed.  There was erosion occurring below the lower sandstone unit, \nindicating a potential for further slides.  There was evidence of similar erosion and failure \nwhere a p rior rockslide occurred \"within this same sandstone unit\" at mile post 9.8 .  Id. at p. 3.   \nGolder identified two factors that likely contributed to the slide: (1) the erosion and \nundercutting of the underlying weaker , thinly -bedded siltstones and shales; and (2) the freeze \nand thaw cycles expanding the soil behind the block and reducing cohesion on the joint plain \nthat gave way.  Id.  The \"mechanism\" was similar \"to the ML 4.9 rockslide mechanism that \noccurred in November [of]  2012. \"  Id.  Similar to the milepost 4.9 rockslide  that occurred \napproximately 10 years earlier , a large rock mass remained near the crest of the slope.  Golder Case 2:22-cv-01159-DSC     Document 49     Filed 09/25/25     Page 5 of 256 \n opined that \"this rock mass will eventually be undermined by the differential weathering and \nerosion of the siltstone/shale and fall from the slope.\"  Id.     \nGolder recommended removing the large rock mass at the crest of the slope.  It also \nrecommended  conducting frequent visual observations of the hillside (such as twice a week) \nfor factors that  might indicate hillside instability .  It indicated that the slides were more likely \nto occur with the event of inclement weather, such as heavy rains, sudden temperature changes , \nand freezing and thawing cycles .  Additional visual inspections were recomme nded follow ing \nsuch weather events.   Id. at p. 4 .  If changes to the slopes were detect ed, Golder recommended \nthat a \"slow order \" be issued \"in this area\" to decrease the chance of a train colliding with any \nslide that occurred.  In the alternative, Golder  recommended defendant \"install a rockfall \ndetection fence at this location tied into the signal system to provide an early warning of a \nrockfall.\"  Id.   \nA rockslide also occurred on February 12, 2017 , between mile posts 9.9 and 10.  Golder \nwas again disp atched to make field observations and recommendations.  Crews removed 15 \ndump truck loads of rock and debris from the tracks.  \nGolder reported that the 2017 slide was adjacent to the location where the 2013 slide \nhad occurred.  At the time of its observations there were two large blocks that remained near \nthe top of the slope but were observed to be moving.  They had dropped about  18 feet down the \nslope, bulldozing a soil pile as they did so and shedding smaller rock s and debris as they \nmoved.  In addition, Golder noted the adjacent scarp face of the 2013 rockslide appeared to \nhave minimal stability .  Golder cautioned that the larg e blocks were precariously positioned \nand the shale that was directly beneath them was mostly gone except for what was directly at \ntheir base .  It noted that this was the same mechanism that caused the second failure at mile Case 2:22-cv-01159-DSC     Document 49     Filed 09/25/25     Page 6 of 257 \n post 4.5 after the first two bl ocks there came down, and it opined that the two large blocks that \nwere continuing to move were  likely  the next rockslide in the making .   \nGolder recommended that the two main blocks that were still moving be broken up on \nthe slope and scaled down in a con trolled manner; the scarp from the 2013 slide be scaled \ndown at that time or with in one year; the additional loose rocks on the right be assessed and \nscaled down if they were minimally stable; and the center nose of the rock beneath the two \nsliding blocks be assessed and scaled down if necessary; all with care to avoid over -scaling and \ndestabilization.  Golder and Associates Report of February 21, 2017 (Doc. No. 43 -8) at pp. 2 -4.  \nIn March of 2019, defendant solicited proposals for the creation of an artifi cial \nintelligence system designed to detect rockslide activity that threatened track integrity.  \nCommunications Concepts Integration (\"CCI\") presented a number of different options to \nreview the types of systems available and select an option that would mi nimize false positives.  \nIn July through September of 2019, defendant installed a support cantilever and camera system \nnear milepost 9.25 as part of a test program.  The purpose of the system was proactively to \ndetect and provide early notice of rockslides  and/or potential rockslide activity.   \nThe system encompassed thermal cameras, a laser measuring system and artificial \nintelligence technology to monitor the tracks , the cut rock and the adjacent s ections of the steep \nincline abutting the tracks.  It was intended to provide a better system than the previously \nemployed measures for monitoring rockslides and changes in the area that indicat ed a potential \nfor rockslide activity.  In order to work properly, the system had to be \"taught \" how to \ndistinguish between acceptable ground and other movements and unacceptable rockslides.  \nCCI had recommended that defendant set up slide fences while the system made its own \ndecisions during th at learning process.   Case 2:22-cv-01159-DSC     Document 49     Filed 09/25/25     Page 7 of 258 \n Challenges arose during the efforts to get the system operational.  The laser measuring \nsystem and the accompanying artificial intelligence proved to be unsuccessful for the location.  \nDuring the fall of 2020, the system continued to  malfunction and present unanticipated \nchallenges.  For example, t he system failed to alert to the events that it should have and \npresented challenges as to its reliability regarding  varying weather conditions.  Changes were \nmade to the components of the s ystem , including installing a new camera with infrared \nilluminators.  When this failed, it was proposed that the system be set up with LIDAR, which is \na form of penetrating radar.  The system never became fully functional and was non -\noperational on the day  plaintiffs encountered the rockslide underlying this lawsuit.  \nEach party retained an expert in preparation for trial.  Plaintiff retained George A. \nGavalla, a consultant and expert in railroad industry safety sta ndards and  practices, to offer \nopinions as to the safety issues relating to the underlying train derailment and the plaintiffs' \nresulting injuries.  Gavalla authored an expert report about the relation of standard safety \npractices to the incident .  He is prepared to opine that defendant knew or sho uld have known \nabout the history of rockslides in the area and should have taken additional steps  to ensure \nplaintiffs' safety , such as installing a slide fence  connected to its signal system or utilizing \nflagmen .  Report of George A. Gavalla ( Doc. No. 43-5) at pp. 20-21. \nDefendant retained Engineering Systems, Inc.  (\"ESI\") , a geotechnic and engineering \nfirm, to review the defendant's maintenance and inspection practices regarding the rockslide \nactivity at milepost 9.3 on December 12, 2021 .  The authors of the report are prepared to offer \nopinions about the differences between the causes for that rockslide and the others that \noccurred in the vicinity of milepost 9.9  as well as the safety practices defendant utilized in \nthose respective areas.  They also are prepared to opine that the rockslides were at distinct Case 2:22-cv-01159-DSC     Document 49     Filed 09/25/25     Page 8 of 259 \n locations that are unrelated  from a geotechnical standpoint.  In addition,  the 9.3 location was \ninactive prior to the 2021 incident, it did not pose any more risk tha n numerous other rock \nslopes in Western Pennsylvania, and defendant followed accepted as well as proactive safety \nprecautions at that location.  Report of Nathaniel Landsperger, P.E., and Dustin Bell (Doc. No. \n43-4) at p. 22.   \nPlaintiff s contend that the dangerous condition caused by the  presence of the \nrockslide/boulders on the tracks w as attributable to the negligence of defendant.  Complaint ¶ \n19.  They identify several means by which defendant's actions fell short of the standard of care, \nincluding failing to conduct proper inspection s, issue effective safety orders, provide effective \nwarnings and utiliz e appropriate safety equipment.  Id. at ¶¶ 24 (a) -(j).   \nMore specifically, plaintiffs posit that the negligence of the defendant consisted of  \nshortcomings in defendant's system of inspecting for rockslides and potential rockslide activity, \nincluding the failure to inspect the hillsides , cut rock and/ or the tracks at or near the site of the \naccident .  This should have been done  either pursuant t o a routine inspection or as part of a  \nweather -related inspection following the heavy rain and winds that occurred on December 11, \n2021 .  Further, defendants failed to follow a recommendation by CCI to utilize a slide fence \nwhile the artificial intelligenc e system was transitioned to full operational capacity .  Plaintiffs' \nBrief in Opposition (Doc. No. 45) at pp. 7 -9.   \nDefendant moves for summary judgment for three basic reasons.  First, it asserts it met \nits duty to inspect and maintain the tracks at mile post 9.3 under the existing circumstances and \nits efforts even exceed ed the requirements of the F ederal Railroad Administration ( \"FRA \").  \nDefendant's Brief in Support of Motion for Summary Judgement (Doc. No. 42) at p. 7.  Case 2:22-cv-01159-DSC     Document 49     Filed 09/25/25     Page 9 of 2510 \n Second, plaintiff's expert misint erpreted the underlying facts by resting his conclusions \non the proposition that there were prior rockslides at milepost 9.3 when all documentation save \none set of \"incorrectly completed \" form s indicates that the other slides occurred at or near \nmilepost 9.9.  Doing so supposedly renders his opinions inadmissible because they are bereft of \nactual factual support and reflect a gross misinterpretation of the record.  And without such \nfactual suppo rt, plaintiffs cannot s how defendant was aware of a risk of rockslides at the \naccident site as it relates to satisfy ing the forese eability requirement of their negligence claim.   \nThird, plaintiffs' expert lacks the qualifications to testify as to the fore seeability of \nrockslides at milepost 9.3.  Gavalla admittedly is not a geologist or a geotechnical expert.  Nor \nis he a civil engineer.  And he purportedly lacks the background to render a geotechnical \nanalysis.  So from defendant's perspective, he does no t have the scientific, technical or other \nspecialized knowledge required to provide a conclusion about the probability of rockslides \noccurring near milepost 9.3.   \nPursuant to these three grounds , defendant maintains that plaintiffs lack sufficient \nevidenc e to establish a material issue of fact as to the foreseeability of a rockslide at milepost \n9.3 on December 12, 2021 , and/or that defendant committed any negligence that contributed to \nplaintiffs' injuries .   \nPlaintiffs maintain that there is more than suf ficient evidence to show defendant was on \nnotice of the potential for rockslides in the area  and its own actions and records demonstrate as \nmuch.  Further, the caselaw is clear that such matters are reserved for the jury to resolve.  And \nthe jury may well conclude that defendant was negligent by failing to install a slide fence at the \nlocation in question and/or inspect the area after the severe weather on December 11, 2021.  \nAnd plaintiffs' expert has sufficient experience to opine about these matters.  See Plaintiffs' Case 2:22-cv-01159-DSC     Document 49     Filed 09/25/25     Page 10 of 2511 \n Counterstatement of Material Facts (Doc. No. 46) at ¶¶ 66 -84 (which plaintiffs incorporate into \ntheir brief in opposition).   \nDefendant's contention that Gavalla  lacks the requisite expertise to offer opinions about \ndefendant's undertakings and practices as they relate to the safety conditions of the track at \nmilepost 9.3 on December 12, 2023, is unavailing.  The issue of whether  Gavalla  will be \npermitted to testify generally is governed by a Daubert Inquiry.   The record as currently \ndeveloped supports the admissibility of his proposed testimony.    \nUnder Federal Rule of Evidence 702, trial courts must act as \"gatekeeper\" and exercise \ndiscretion to preclude expert testimony that is unreliable, irrelevant, or unhelpful to the jury.  \nDaubert , 509 U.S. at 597.  In the Third Circuit, district courts must focus on the \"trilogy of \nrestrictions on expert testimony: qualification, reliability and f it.\"  Calhoun v. Yamaha Motor \nCorp. , U.S.A., 350 F.3d 316 (3d Cir. 2003).  Thus, district courts should permit expert \ntestimony so long as: (1) the expert has the necessary qualifications, (2) the testimony is based \non reliable methods, and (3) the testimo ny would assist the trier of fact in understanding the \nevidence or in resolving factual issues.  See In re Paoli R.R. Yard PCB Litigation , 35 F.3d 717, \n741–43 (3d Cir. 1994) (\" Paoli II \").1 \nDefendant claims that Gavalla  does not have the necessary qualific ations to testify as \nan expert on the incident at issue, namely because he is not a geologist , geotechnical expert  or \na civil engineer.   But this position misapprehends the nature of Gavalla's proposed testimony \n \n1 This opinion applies the current version of Rule 702, which was most recently amended on \nDecember 1, 2023. \"The amendment does not substantively alter Rule 702, but rather 'clarifies \nthat the preponderance standard applies to the three reliability -based re quirements added in \n2000 —requirements that many courts have incorrectly determined to be governed by the more \npermissive Rule 104(b) standard.'\" S.Y. v. Roman Cath. Diocese of Paterson , No. 20CV2605 \n(EP) (CLW), 2024 WL 1231333, at *2 (D.N.J. Mar. 21, 2024)  (quoting Fed. R. Evid. 702 \nadvisory committee's note to 2023 amendments).   Case 2:22-cv-01159-DSC     Document 49     Filed 09/25/25     Page 11 of 2512 \n and the factual foundations in the record that support it.  Gavalla's testimony is focused on the \nsafety measures defendant did and did not undertake in the area in and around CP Beck where \nthe derailment occurred, what defendant knew or should have known from the plethora of \ninformation available to it, what defendant's actions reveal about its knowledge and \nunderstandings as they relate to safe rail passage in th at corridor and whether defendant's \nactions and inactions breached the standard of care.  And as to these matters, Gavalla ’s \nproposed testimony and opinion s meet the foundational requirements for admission under Rule \n702.   \nGavalla  possess es the requisite qualifications  to provide testimony as an expert in \nrailroad safety .  To qualify as an expert,  the witness must possess specialized expertise, gained \nfrom \"practical experience as well as academic training and credentials\" in the relevant area.  \nJones v. Swepi L.P. , 643 F. Supp. 3d 547, 561 (W.D. Pa. 2022) (quoting Waldorf v. Shuta , 142 \nF.3d 601, 6 25 (3d Cir. 1998)).  \nGavalla  has 47 years of experience in the railroad industry.   ECF Doc. No. 43 -5 at p. \n27.  Gavalla attended Georgetown University, earning a degree in history, graduated from a \nsenior executive service program at the Federal Executive Institute and completed an executive \ntraining course at Harvard University.  From 1976 to 1984, he worked as a communications \nand signal maintainer for Consolidated Rail Corporation.  He inspected, tested, repaired and \nbuilt railroad communications and signal systems throughout Conrail's territory, which \nconsisted of Washington D.C., Maryland, Virginia , Pennsylvania and Delaware.  Among other \nthings, h e was responsible for the installation and maintenance of rockslide detection systems, \nincluding slide fences , throughout this territory.  Id. at 2.  Plaintiffs are prepared to elicit \nfurther testimony abo ut Gavalla's experience in these matters.  Case 2:22-cv-01159-DSC     Document 49     Filed 09/25/25     Page 12 of 2513 \n After working for seven years as an assistant general chairman and four years as the \ndirector of research for the Brotherhood of Railroad Signalmen , in 1995  Gavalla joined the \nFRA as a safety project coordinator on the Amtrak , Long Island Railroad  and the Union Pacific \nRailroad .  ECF Doc. No. 43 -5 at p p. 3, 29.  There he conducted large scale assessments of \npassenger rail operations and safety.  In this role he had to become familiar with all regulations \nand railroa d rules, policies, and safety management practices .  Id. at p. 3.  Plaintiffs are \nprepared to elicit testimony from Gavalla to the effect that as part of his duties he researched \nrockslides and fault planes and the propensity of adjacent rock formations to  collapse once \nthere had been a prior rockslide.   It is apparent that Gavalla will be able to provide this \nbackground information.     \nIn October of 1997, Gavalla  became the Associate Administrator for Safety  with the \nFRA , wherein he was the senior manager  of the FRA’s Office of Safety .  He served in that \ncapacity until early 2004.   Id. at 29.  As the senior official in the Office of Safety, he had to \noversee the safety of our nation’s railroads  and the managing of FRA’s safety programs, \nincluding promulgating new and revised federal railroad safety regulations, overseeing the \nenforcement those regulations and conducting railroad accident investigations.   Id. at 3.   \nSince 2011, Gavalla  has run his own railroad safety consulting company, which utilizes \na network of railroad safety and operations experts.   Id.  His projects have included performin g \nsafety assessments of rail operations, conducting safety training , developing rules and \nprocedures regarding train operations, conducting track inspections and risk assessments,  and \nproviding hazard analys es of highway -rail grade crossing systems.  Id.   \nIt is undisputed that the use of slide fences in areas prone to rockslides have been very \ncommon for many decades and provide a widely accepted standard of care on all major Case 2:22-cv-01159-DSC     Document 49     Filed 09/25/25     Page 13 of 2514 \n railroads.  Id. at 9-10.  Indeed, defendant employed these fences at hundreds of locations \nthroughout its territory.  Spadone Deposition (Doc. No. 46 -3) at p. 7.  Gavalla is not a \ngeotechnical engineer.  Nevertheless, he does have a developed understanding of railroad \nindustry policies and procedures for managing and mitigating the ris ks of rockslides, falling \nrocks and landslides.  Gavalla Report (Doc. 45 -3) at p. 15.  \nIt is clear that Gavalla  has gained specialized expertise in railroad safety from his \neducation and extensive years of experience working in, with and overseeing safety r egulations \ninvolving railroads.   His exposure to, experience with and safety evaluation of the common \ncomponent s of railroad safety practices and procedures is readily apparent.  Gavalla has \nextensive experience in working with, reviewing and analyzing rai lroad safety practices, which \nnecessarily include s the common use of slide fences.  Thus, t here appears to be little doubt that \nGavalla has the requisite experience to testify about the common uses of slide fences  and the \nsafety regulations and circumstanc es surrounding their use.   \nIt likewise follows that Gavalla has the requisite experience to testify about the general \nand/or specific circumstances surrounding the use of slide fences as they relate to maintaining \nsafe practices on the railroad.  As Spado ne confirmed, the use of slide fences is a common \nsafety measure employed by railroads and defendant utilizes them at hundreds of locations on \nits tracks.  And defendant has to monitor and make decisions about the need for utilizing these \nand other measures to combat the threat of rockslides at these various locations with its \nordinary workforce, which does not include geological, geotechnical or civil engineering \nexperts.  It follows that Gavalla's familiarity with the circumstances connected to the  use of \nsuch a common component of safety on the railroad can readily be assumed.   Case 2:22-cv-01159-DSC     Document 49     Filed 09/25/25     Page 14 of 2515 \n For the same reasons, Gavalla has the experience to offer testimony and conclusions \nabout defendant's use of the prototype artificial intelligence system employed by defend ant at \nCP Beck as well as the safety regulations and concerns surrounding th at undertaking.  His \nexperience provides a sufficient basis to assess the safety regulations and accept ed safety \npractices implicated by that undertaking, and whether defendant satisfied the applicable \nstandards of care while attempting to get that system to full functionality.   \nIn short , Gavalla  is qualified under Rule 702 to render opinions on the adequacy of \nsafety measures put in place and/or omitted by defendant  in conjunction  with the general area \nand/or the specific location where the underlying derailment occurred .   \nNext, Gavalla ’s testimony is reliable.  The reliability inquiry is a flexible one wherein \nthe court must focus solely on the expert's chosen principles and meth odology rather than the \nconclusions drawn therefrom.  Daubert , 509 U.S. at 594 –95.  \"To be reliable, the expert's \nopinion must be premised on more than mere subjective belief or unsupported speculation; the \nexpert must have good grounds for his or her beli ef.\"  Marcum v. Columbia Gas Transmission, \nLLC , 549 F. Supp. 3d 408, 416 (E.D. Pa. 2021) (quoting Paoli II , 35 F.3d at 742) (internal \nquotation marks omitted).   \nWhether \"good grounds\" support an expert's potential testimony depends on various \nfactors, incl uding: \"(1) whether a method consists of a testable hypothesis; (2) whether the \nmethod has been subject to peer review; (3) the known or potential rate of error; (4) the \nexistence and maintenance of standards controlling the technique's operation; (5) whet her the \nmethod is generally accepted; (6) the relationship of the technique to methods which have been \nestablished to be reliable; (7) the qualifications of the expert witness testifying based on the \nmethodology; and (8) the non -judicial uses to which the method has been put.\"  Jones , 643 F. Case 2:22-cv-01159-DSC     Document 49     Filed 09/25/25     Page 15 of 2516 \n Supp. 3d at 562 (quoting Pineda v. Ford Motor Co. , 520 F.3d 237, 247 –48 (3d Cir. 2008)).  \nBut these factors are not exhaustive and some may be more or less applicable depending on the \ncase.   See Pineda , 520 F.3d at 248.   Trial courts have broad latitude in determining whether \nthese specific factors are \"reasonable measures of reliability in a particular case.\"  Kumho Tire \nCo. v. Carmichael , 526 U.S. 137, 153, 119 S. Ct. 1167, 1176, 143 L. Ed. 2d 238 (1999).  \nGavalla ’s opini ons and testimony  are based on his years of experience working with, \noverseeing and evaluating railroad safety measures in a variety of settings .  He also \n\"review [ed] relevant materials; review [ed] safety rules, procedures and standards; examine [ed] \nreleva nt documents, [and] review [ed] testimony and evidence obtained through discovery \nrelative to th [is] case.\"  ECF Doc. No. 43 -5 at p. 2 .  Thus , he used his practical experience to \nassess the safety standards that were employed or not employed by defendant.  And he drew on \naccepted industry standards in formulating his opinion.  Accordingly, Gavalla 's proposed \ntestimony and opinion s sufficiently are premised on his knowledge, experience, and facts in the \nrecord to satisfy the reliability prong.   \nFinally, Gavalla ’s testimony \"fits\" because there are good grounds to believe it would \nhelp a jury decide a factual dispute.  To determine whether an expert's testimony \"fits\" the \nproceedings, the trial court asks \"whether [the] expert testimony proffered . . . is sufficiently \ntied to the f acts of the case that it will aid the jury in resolving a factual dispute.\"  United States \nv. Schiff , 602 F.3d 152, 173 (3d Cir. 2010) (quoting Daubert , 509 U.S. at 591). This \nrequirement goes primarily to relevance.  See Daubert , 509 U.S. at 591.  Even if  an expert's \ntestimony is based on their specialized knowledge, \"the testimony will be excluded if it is not \nknowledge related to the purposes of, or pertinent inquiry to, the case.\"   Jones , 643 F. Supp. 3d \nat 563.   Gavalla ’s testimony meets this requireme nt: it directly addresses a number of the Case 2:22-cv-01159-DSC     Document 49     Filed 09/25/25     Page 16 of 2517 \n fundamental factual disputes in this litigation, including whether defendant met its duty of care \nwith regard to the s afety protocols that were utilized or omitted .  \nHaving established that Gavalla  is a qualified e xpert, his opinions are sufficiently \nreliable, and there are good grounds to believe that the testimony will be helpful to the jury, \nplaintiffs have met the foundational requirements for admission under Rule 702.  Therefore , \nthe court will assume for the p urposes of resolving defendant's summary judgment that the \nexpert testimony proffered by plaintiff  relating to the applicable standards of care and whether \ndefendant breached those standards is admissible .2 \nDefendant 's contention that plaintiffs' ability to prove the potential of a rockslide at CP \nBeck was foreseeable to defendant requires the testimony of a geologist , geotechnical expert  or \na civil engineer  is misplaced.  Even assuming for the sake of argument that G avalla relied on \nan assumption of fact that the major derailments in 2013 and 2017 were at the same location  as \nthe underlying derailment and this assumption was erroneous , the record contains more than \nsufficient evidence from which the finder of fact can  determine that the potential for rockslides \nin the vicinity of milepost 9.3 was foreseeable to defendant prior to the December 12, 202 1, \nincident.   \nUnder the FELA “[e]very common carrier by railroad ... shall be liable in damages to \nany person suffering injury while he is employed by such carrier ... for such injury or death \nresulting in whole or in part from the negligence of any of the officers, agents, or employees of \nsuch carrier....” 45 U.S.C. § 51.  The FELA is a negligence statute with a  relaxed st andard of \ncausation.  Consolidated Rail Corp. v. Gottshall , 512 U.S. 532, 542 –543 (1994).    \n \n2 This ruling will be without prejudice to either party filing additional motions in limine , \nincluding a Daubert motion provided there are reasonable grounds for doing so.     Case 2:22-cv-01159-DSC     Document 49     Filed 09/25/25     Page 17 of 2521 \n can be used to satisfy it.  Hines , 926 F.2d at 268 (citing Gallick , 372 U.S. at 117 and collecting \ncases).  And in this jurisdiction, \"[a] trial court is justified in withdrawing  . . . issue[s] from the \njury's consideration only in those extremely rare instances where there is a zero probability \neither of employer neglig ence or that any such negligence contributed to the injury of an \nemployee.”  Pehowic , 430 F.2d at 699 –700; Monheim , 996 F. Supp.2d at 362 (citing Eckert v. \nAliquippa & S. R.R. , 828 F.2d 183, 187 (3d Cir.  1987) (applying Pehowic 's zero probability \ntest) and Masters v. Norfolk S. Ry. Co., Inc. , No. 08 –1872, 2010 WL 4973315, at *8 (Oct. 6, \n2010) (same) ). \n\"The ultimate question is whether a reasonable jury could reach the conclusion that the \nemployer was negligent in whole or in part \" and an \" FELA plaintiff mus t present probative \nfacts from which the negligence and causal relationship can reasonably be inferred in order to \nsurvive summary judgment. \"   Monheim , 996 F.

However , even with these \nlesser standards of proof for negligence and causation , a plaintiff  cannot survive summary \njudgment based on pure speculation or a record completely devoid of probative facts.   Id. \n(citing Newton v. Norfolk S. Corp. , No. 05 –1465, 2008 WL 55997, *8 (W.D.  Pa. Jan. 3, \n2008) ). \nHere, se veral aspects of the record  can be used to satisfy th e foreseeability requirement.   \nFirst,  Mansfield is prepared to recount a long history of rockslides in the vicinity of CP Beck , \nwhich was well -known  to those who regularly worked in the area.   Mansfield indicated the \narea had been prone to slides since the time he began working for defendant (which was over a \ndecade) and there had been multiple slides on just about the whole Mon L ine.  One involved \nTeddy Karas at about the same location.  Marchionda testified that this one occurred around Case 2:22-cv-01159-DSC     Document 49     Filed 09/25/25     Page 21 of 2522 \n the time he was hired.  The 2013 slide with Cathy Leis was reported by her and her supervisor \nas occurring near the location in question and even ass uming it occurred close to or near \nmilepost 9.9, it did occur on Mon Line within a half a mile from the location in question.  The \n2017 slide was adjacent to the site of the 2013  slide.  Mansfield recalled another slide \ninvolving Sam Wagner occurring near milepost 9 in 2018.  And Marchionda recounted another \nslide on the Mon Line near Mt. Washington after the one involving Wagner.  While defendant \nmay choose to defend on the ground that each of these incidents involved locations that where \ndistinct  from a g eotechnical perspective , it appears that the testimony at trial will support an \ninference that the Mon Line in general and the area known as CP Beck in particular was a \nhotbed for slide activity.  \nSecond, the jury may make a comparison between the face of the sheared rock \nformation and ascending incline abutting the tracks at milepost 9.3 and those same \ncharacteristics  at milepost 9.9.  In doing so, they may draw on any understandings that should \nhave been known by defendant 's workforce and observation crews in assessing the similarities \nand differences in the safety risk that these two locations presented.  Defendant had to use its \nregular work force to monitor slide prone areas and to make decisions about the risks they \npresented  on a day -to-day basis .  Although defendant had outside geotechnical  experts \navailable for consultation, its workforce and observation crews were not geotechnical experts.  \nThey were , however , trained on a general level to look for geometr ic or FRA d efects and were \ndirected to inspect visually the slopes, cut sections and rock faces  abutting the tracks as part of \ntheir required inspections.  So, there were ongoing efforts and decisions made by defendant's \nworkforce about the se aspects of the  terrain a nd the weather conditions that presented at any Case 2:22-cv-01159-DSC     Document 49     Filed 09/25/25     Page 22 of 2523 \n given time .  And safety decisions were regularly made  based in part on what was observed \nabout the conditions of the tracks and the inclines and hillsides that abut them.   \nAgainst this backdrop , the pictures  of 1) the derailment, 2) the Prototype AI Camera \nSlide Detector and 3) the comparisons of the cut rock walls at mileposts 9.2 and 9.9 provide \ninsight into what defendant's inspection crews and management personnel would have s een and \nunderstood in fulf illing defendant's duties to provide a safe workplace at each of those \nlocations.   In this regard , defendant's photographs depicting the cut rock and steep inclines \nexisting where the derailment in question occurred and at mile post 9.9 bear substantial \nsimilarities.  While being  presented as  photographs of different locations, the size and vertical \nascent of the cut rock formations abutting the tracks share many of the same characteristics.  \nThus, while defendant is free to argue that the two locations presented very different risks for \nrockslide activity from a geological and geotechnical point of view, the very na ture of the \ninclines, the cut rock protruding from the face of the vertical incline s, the distinct formation of \nthe layers of stone , debris at the base of the incline abutting the tracks near milepost 9.3  and the \ncatch basin at that location  provide some e vidence from which the finder of fact may inform its \nassessment of whether defendant was on notice of a potential for rockslides at the CP Beck \nderailment site.   \nThird, and tellingly, defendant chose to locate the Prototype AI Camera Slide Detector \nin clo se proximity to where the derailment occurred.   Defendant installed this system as a \nproactive measure to provide early detection of potential rockslides.  The system was installed \nwithin 600 feet of where the derailment occurred.  Again, assuming there ha d not been any \nsignificant slides at that precise location at the time of installation, there had been a number of \nother slides near that location and significant slides within a half mile of it as noted above.  The Case 2:22-cv-01159-DSC     Document 49     Filed 09/25/25     Page 23 of 2524 \n plan was to prevent future rockslides and the idea was for the camera system to capture a \npotential rockslide in real  time while identifying other obstructions that would not pose the \nsafety risks of a rockslide and then distinguish between the two.  It wa s planned that the system \nwould be integrated so that train crews would receive notice of a potential obstruction through \neither radio dispatch or a stop signal within the existing signal system.  \nTo gain functionality, the AI system had to be taught to dif ferentiate between the events \nin the environment around it that were acceptable and those that were not.  In other words, \ndefendant had to select a location that had the potential to expose the system to rockslides that \nhad the potential to present a dange r to safe rail passage and those that were minor and did not \npose such a safety risk.  Defendant chose a location close to CP Beck  as being capable of \nproviding a terrain that presented the potential for these differing events in real time.  And the \njury m ay consider the siting of system near the derailment site as some evidence about whether \ndefendant knew or had reason to know that the near vertical incline abutting the tracks and face \nof the cut rock at the derailment site presented a foreseeable risk of  rockslides that threatened \nthe safety of train operations and railroad crews.  And they can consider the degree to which \nCCI's recommend ation that a slide fence be used while the system was brought up to full \nfunctional capacity  has a bearing on whether a  foreseeable risk of rockslides existed at or near \nCP Beck prior to the derailment  as well as whether defendant breached a duty by failing to use \nan alternative measure to provide a safe workplace at that location .          \nIt follows that these aspects of record provide sufficient direct and circumstantial \nevidence from which the jury can find that prior to the derailment defendant could foresee a \nrisk of harm to crew members at or near that site .  In other words, there is not zero probability \nof defendant being found to have been negligent and the issue of foreseeability is an issue of Case 2:22-cv-01159-DSC     Document 49     Filed 09/25/25     Page 24 of 2525 \n fact for the jury to decide notwithstanding the fact that plaintiffs do not intend to introduce \ntheir own geotechnical or civil engineering expert.  Consequently, this component of \ndefendant's motion for summary judgment cannot bear the weight defendant assigns to it.   \nIn short, there are numerous issue s of material fact for the jury to decide.  Among them \nare whether defendant knew or should have known that rocksl ides were likely to occur in the  \narea and whether a rockslide that would present a risk to crew safety at or near CP Beck was \nforeseeable to defendant prior to the derailment , whether the weather conditions were severe \nenough to cause the need for addition al inspection,  whether defendant's actions or inactions at \nthat location were consistent with its duties to provide a reasonably safe workplace , and so \nforth .  These are all issues which the jury must determine.   And plaintiff's safety expert and the \nrecor d as developed supply sufficient evidence from which the elements of plaintiffs' claims \ncan be satisfied.   \nFor the reasons  set forth above , defendant's motion for summary judgement will be  \ndenied.   An appropriate order will follow.   \nDate: September 2 5, 2025  \n s/David Stewart Cercone                        \n David Stewart Cercone  \n Senior United States District Judge  \n \n \ncc: Lawrence A.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: The Tenth Circuit Court dismissed Michael Shawn Stewart's appeal due to jurisdictional issues; he failed to comply with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 3 by not properly designating an appealable order. Additionally, the Court expressed concern that Stewart's response, which cited nonexistent cases and documents, may have been generated using artificial intelligence.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether Mr. Stewart's appeal meets the jurisdictional requirements under Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 3, necessary for the court to consider the appeal.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court held that it lacks jurisdiction over Mr. Stewart's appeal due to his failure to properly identify an appealable order, as required by Rule 3, and noted that the use of AI appeared to have led to the submission of citations to non-existent case law, violating court rules.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine you're trying to join a club, but you didn't fill out the membership form correctly, so they won't let you in until you do. That’s what happened here: Mr. Stewart tried to appeal a case, but he didn't follow the rules about how to officially file his appeal, so the court couldn't accept it. Plus, it looks like he used a computer program to write parts of what he submitted, and it made stuff up, which worried the judges.",

No. 1:21-CR -00034-WJM- 1) \n(D. Colo.)  \n_________________________________  \nORDER  \n_________________________________  \nBefore TYMKOVICH, CARSON, and FEDERICO , Circuit Judges. \n_________________________________  \nThis matter is before the court following Mr. Stewart’s response to this court’s \nJune 27, 2025, show cause order. Upon consideration, we conclude that we lack \njurisdiction for the following reasons.  \n This court raised jurisdictional concerns regarding Federal Rule of Appellate \nProcedure 3 and the finality of the order Mr. Stewart sought to appeal. Rule 3(c) requires that the notice of appeal designate the order or judgment being appealed. This Rule’s \nrequirements are jurisdictional and failure to comply with them deprives this court of \njurisdiction. See Smith v. Barry, 502 U.S. 244, 248 (1992) (“Rule 3’s dictates are \njurisdictional in nature, and their satisfaction is a prerequisite to appellate review.”).\n FILED  \nUnited States Court of Appeals  \nTenth Circuit  \n \nJuly 16, 2025  \n \nChristopher M. Wolpert  \nClerk of Court  Appellate Case: 25-1250     Document: 14     Date Filed: 07/16/2025     Page: 1 2 \n  In his notice of appeal, Mr. Stewart failed to identify an order from which he \nappealed. In his response to the show cause order, he identified the following three \ndocuments as the subject of his appeal:  \n1.    Docket Entry 4 – Emergency Ex Parte Motion for Asset Freeze \n(Filed Sept. 12, 2019) . . .  \n2.    Docket Entry 35 – Stipulated Preliminary Injunction and Asset \nFreeze (Entered Oct. 10, 2019) . . .  \n3.    Docket Entry 36 –  Cancellation of Show Cause Hearing (Oct. \n10, 2019) . . .  \n \nResponse at 2-3.  \n Mr. Stewart’s response does not resolve this court’s Rule 3 concerns. Indeed, \nwhile he says that he is appealing from matters entered on the district court docket in 2019, the underlying case from which he appeals did not begin until he was indicted on \nFebruary 4, 2021. Further, docket entry 4 is not an Emergency Ex Parte Motion for Asset \nFreeze. Rather, it is the sealed indictment. Likewise, docket entry 35 is not a Stipulated \nPreliminary Injunction and Asset Freeze. Rather, it is a motion to continue filed by his \nco-defendant. And docket entry 36 is not a Cancellation of Show Cause Hearing. Rather, \nit is the district court’s order granting the continuance. Mr. Stewart attempts to appeal \nfrom orders that do not exist.\n \n Because the designation requirement of Rule 3 is jurisdictional, and Mr. Stewart’s \nresponse fails to meet the jurisdictional prerequisites to appeal, this court is “without jurisdiction under the facts of this case.” Jenkins v. Burtzloff, 69 F.2d 460, 464 (10th Cir. \n1995).  Appellate Case: 25-1250     Document: 14     Date Filed: 07/16/2025     Page: 2 3 \n Finally, the court notes that Mr. Stewart’s response relied on multiple cases and \ncitations that do not exist. The court is concerned that, due to inconsistent references to \nthe district court’s docket and reference to hallucinatory case law, artificial intelligence \nwas used, at least in part, to draft Mr. Stewart’s response.   \nTenth Circuit Rule 46.5(B) states:  \n \nBy presenting to the court –  whether by signing . . . filing, [or] submitting \n. . . – a brief, motion, or other paper, an attorney or unrepresented party \ncertifies that, to the best of the person’s knowledge, information, and belief, \nformed after an inquir y reasonable under the circumstances . . . the issues \npresented are warranted by existing law . . ..  \n  \nCitations to hallucinatory case law violate this rule. See, e.g., Coomer v. Lindell, et al., \nNo. 22-cv -01129- NYW-SBP, 2025 WL 1865282, at *8 (D. Colo. July 7, 2025); \nWadsworth v. Walmart, Inc., 348 F.R.F. 489, 495 (D.

The Federal Circuit affirmed the lower court's dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, failure to state a claim, and failure to prosecute, and held that Dr. Aljindi's claims were barred by res judicata and not facially plausible. The case involves AI in claims related to Dr. Aljindi’s research into information security and AI.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether Dr. Aljindi had a valid claim for compensation under the Fifth Amendment for the use of his research in AI and whether the denial of an SBA loan constituted retaliation.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court held that Dr. Aljindi's claims were time-barred, barred by res judicata, and not facially plausible. The court also held that Dr. Aljindi, a pro se litigant, could not represent his LLC, affirming the dismissal for lack of prosecution and the refusal to disqualify the presiding judge.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Dr. Aljindi argued that the government improperly used his AI research and wrongfully denied his company a loan. The court said his claims were too late, were already decided in previous cases, or were not clear enough to take seriously. Also, since Aljindi represented himself, he couldn’t act for his company in court.

Appx.  60–84.  On April 17, 2024, \nthe government moved to dismiss the complaint pursuant \nto Rule 12(b)(1) and Rule 12(b)(6) of the Rules of the United States Court of Federal Claims (RCFC).  S. Appx.  10–24. \nThe Claims Court granted the government’s motion to \ndismiss and denied Dr. Aljindi’s motion for summary judg-\nment as moot.  Claims Court Opinion , at *1 , *5.  Noting \nthat Dr. Aljindi cited five different government documents \n(published between October 2016 and August 2019) as evi-\ndence for his Fifth Amendment taking s claim, the Claims \nCourt ruled that Dr. Aljindi’s claim involving one govern-\nment component ( the National Science and Technology \nCouncil , or NSTC) was time -barred by the six -year statute \n \n2  “S. Appx .” refers to the Supplemental Appendix \nsubmitted by the Appellee . Case: 24-1997      Document: 27     Page: 5     Filed: 02/10/2025ALJINDI  v. US 6 \nof limitations in 28 U.S.C. §  2501 but that his claims relat-\ning to other government components3 were timely .  Id.  at \n*2 & n.1.  Nevertheless, the Claims Court concluded that \nthe taking s claim was barred in whole by the doctrine of \nres judicata and also because it was “not facially plausible.”  \nId. at *2 –4.  To the extent that the taking s claim could be \ninterpreted to be asserting intellectual -property theft, the \nClaims Court added, the claim would be a tort claim  out-\nside its jurisdiction.  Id.  at *3; 28 U.S.C. §  1491(a)(1).  Re-\ngarding the alleged retaliation by SBA in handling the \nrequest for an EIDL for AI Net Group LLC, the Claims  \nCourt concluded that R ule 83.1 of the Claims Court’s Rules \nbarred Dr. Aljindi, a pro se plaintiff, from representing AI Net Group LLC or any other entity besides himself and, \nthus, his SBA retaliation claim had to be dismissed for lack of prosecution under Rule 41(b).  Id. at *4 –5. \nOn the same day that it issued its opinion dismissing \nDr. Aljindi’s complaint, the Claims Court denied Dr. Aljindi’s motion to disqualify Judge Tapp.  Order, Aljindi v. United States , No. 24 -242, 2024 WL 3024654 (Fed. Cl. \nJune 17, 2024), ECF No.  25 (Order); S.  Appx.  60–84.  In his \nmotion to disqualify, Dr. Aljindi cited the decisions in the two cases discussed in Part I.A above  and argued that they \nsupport ed his allegation that Judge Tapp was prejudiced \nagainst him and must disqualify himself pursuant to 28  \nU.S.C. §  455.  S.  Appx.  60–61.  Dr. Aljindi also argued that \nChief Judge Kaplan should hear his case as he had “[t]yped [her] name” in his filings.  S.  Appx.  61.  In denying Dr. \nAljindi’s motion to disqualify, the Claims Court explained \nthat Dr. Aljindi h ad “fail[ed] to identify any personal bias \nor prejudice” on the part of Judge Tapp and that the prior \n \n3  Those other components are the  Office of the Direc-\ntor of National Intelligence, Department of Defense, De-partment of Justice, and National Institute of Standards \nand Technology.

Order at 1–2. \nDr. Aljindi timely appealed.  We have jurisdiction un-\nder 28 U.S.C. §  1295(a)(3).  \nII \nIn this case, where the factual allegations of the com-\nplaint are not challenge d for purposes of the dismissal mo-\ntion, we review the dismissal (for lack of jurisdiction or for \nfailure to state a claim) de novo.

A trial court has “broad discretion to manage [its] docket[] .”  Procter & Gamble Co. v. Kraft Foods Global, Inc. , \n549 F.3d 842, 848– 49 (Fed. Cir. 2008).  We review the de-\nnial of a motion to disqualify under 28  U.S.C. §  455 for \nabuse of discretion.  Allphin v. United States, 758 F.3d \n1336, 1343– 44 (Fed. Cir. 2014); Shell Oil Co. v. United \nStates, 672 F.3d 1283, 1288 (Fed. Cir. 2012).  We address \nthe taking s issue , then the retaliation issue , and finally the \ndisqualification  issue . \nA \nDr. Aljindi challenges the Claims Court’s dismissal of \nhis taking s claim, arguing that the government “has taken \nhis property by engaging in research” in the “combined \nfield of [information security, artificial intelligence (AI), Case: 24-1997      Document: 27     Page: 7     Filed: 02/10/2025ALJINDI  v. US 8 \nand legacy information systems (LIS)].”  Appellant’s Infor-\nmal Br. at 19.  We reject the challenge.  \nRegarding the taking s claim related to a published \nstrategic plan  of the NSTC, t he Claims Court properly held \nthat claim to be  time-barred by 28 U.S.C. §  2501.  Claim \nCourt Opinion , at *2.  That provision, which is a jurisdic-\ntional limitation, John R. Sand & Gravel Co. v. United \nStates, 552 U.S. 130. 133 –34 (2008) , requires that a claim \nbe brought “within six years after such claim first accrues ,” \n28 U.S.C. §  2501.  Dr. Aljindi contends that the “six -year[] \nstatute of limitation s does not apply here simply because \nthe 2016 example [of the NSTC strategic plan] .  . . was dis-\ncovered by [him] around December 2018.”  Appellant’s In-form al Br. at 24.  But “[a] claim first accrues when all the \nevents have occurred that fix the alleged liability of the government and entitle the claimant to institute an ac-tion, ” Ingrum v. United States, 560 F.3d 1311, 1314 (Fed. \nCir. 2009) , and Dr. Aljindi did not establish in the Claims \nCourt and does not establish here that the publication was \nconcealed or unknowable or that he should not have known \nof it, see id. at 1314– 14; Appellant’s Informal Br. at 19, 24, \nso there is no basis for suspending the accru al past the \nNSTC publication date  in 2016, more than six years before \nhis suit here.  \nDr. Aljindi also has not identified reversible error in \nthe Claims Court’s holding that  the taking s claim  (as to the \ntimely and untimely challenged uses) was precluded by the doctrine of res judicata  based on the Aljindi IP litigation .  \nSee Claims Court Opinion , at *2 –3.  “A claim is barred by \nres judicata when ‘ (1) the parties are identical or in privity; \n(2) the first suit proceeded to a final judgment on the mer-\nits; and (3) the second claim is based on the same set of transactional facts as the first. ’”  Cunningham v. United \nStates, 748 F.3d 1172, 1179 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (quoting Ammex, Inc. v. United States, 334 F.3d 1052, 1055 (Fed. Cir. 2003)).   All three elements are present here. Case: 24-1997      Document: 27     Page: 8     Filed: 02/10/2025ALJINDI  v. US 9 \nFirst, the parties (Dr. Aljindi and the United States) \nare identical to the parties in the Aljindi IP  litigation.  Sec-\nond, Dr. Aljindi’s Fifth Amendment taking s claim was pre-\nviously dismissed  in Aljindi I  (and affirmed in Aljindi II  \nand Aljindi IV) for failure to state a claim upon which relief \ncould be granted.  Aljindi I, at *2; Aljindi II , at *3; Aljindi \nIV, at *2 n.3; see Claims Court Opinion , at *3 .  A dismissal \nfor failure to state a claim constitutes a final judgment on \nthe merits, and thus has res judicata effect.  See Spruill v. Merit Systems Protection Board , 978 F.2d 679, 687 (Fed. \nCir. 1992).  Third, we agree with the Claims Court that his “present takings claim is based on the same set of transac-tional facts as his prior [ Aljindi IP] litigation ” because his \npresent case against “ALL formal AI Strategies published by the federal government” necessarily includes the 2019 publication by the D epartment of Defense that was the fo-\ncus of his prior claim.  Claims Court Opinion , at *3.  Dr. \nAljindi is attempting to litigate “issues that were or could have been raised” in his earlier suit, which res judicata pre-\nvents.  See First Mortgage Corp. v. United States, 961 F.3d \n1331, 1338 (Fed. Cir. 2020) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).  \nDr. Aljindi has similarly shown no error in the Claims \nCourt’s dismissal of the taking s claim for failure to meet \nthe pleading standard of setting forth facts that plausibly establish the elements of the asserted wrong.  Claims \nCourt Opinion , at *3 –4; but see Appellant’s Informal Br. at \n19 (arguing the claim is “facially plausible”).  Dr. Aljindi \nhad to allege plausibly , among other things, that he owned \nproperty protected by the Takings Clause and that it was \ntaken by the government .  He has pleaded that h e discov-\nered the entire field of research into the relationship be-\ntween information security, artificial intelligence, and \nlegacy information systems,  Claims Court Compl. at 4, but  \nat a minimum he has not shown that it is plausible that he  \nhas a cognizable property interest (for Takings Clause pur-poses) in that general idea and “everything built on top of’ Case: 24-1997      Document: 27     Page: 9     Filed: 02/10/2025ALJINDI  v. US 10 \n[his] research”  and that the government has taken that \nfrom him , Claims Court Opinion , at *4.  \nB \nDr. Aljindi challenges the Claims Court’s dismissal of \nhis claim of systemic and intentional retaliation by SBA for \nlack of prosecution, arguing that he “can pursue this claim \npro se on behalf of his single member LLC and disregarded \nentity company because he is the founder and the only \nowner of his company” and because “the SBA’s retaliation \nis directed toward [him] directly because of his federally \nprotected classes, statuses, and federally protected activi-ties.”  Appellant’s Informal Br. at 19 –20.  We di sagree.  The \nClaims Court correctly found that , even when reading the \ncorrespondence with SBA that Dr. Aljindi provided, the SBA’s action regarding the requested EIDL was directed at \nAI Net Group LLC and thus his claim is “on behalf of AI \nNet Group LLC, not Dr. Aljindi as an individual.”  Claims \nCourt Opinion , at *4 ; Claims Court Compl. Ex. at 368 (SBA \ndocument confirming receipt of documents for an EIDL ap-plication for AI Net Group LLC).  Under the Claims Court’s Rule 83.1, Dr. Aljindi cannot represent AI Net Group LLC, \nand the Claims Court’s dismissal, under its Rule 41(b), for \nDr. Aljindi’s failure to comply with this rule is not an abuse of discretion.  See Claims Court Opinion , at *4.  We there-\nfore affirm the Claims Court’s dismissal for lack of prose-\ncution.  Id . \nWe also agree with the Claims Court that if Dr. Aljindi \nbrought this claim on behalf of himself, the Claims Court \nwould lack jurisdiction because retaliation claims are tort \nclaims.  Id. at *4 & n.8; 28 U.S.C. §  1491(a)(1); see Aljindi \nII, at *1.  To the extent Dr. Aljindi claims discrimination \nhere, there is no basis for Claims Court jurisdiction over \nsuch a claim.   See Aljindi I , at *1 –2; Aljindi II , at *1 –2; \nBrown v. United States , 105 F.3d 621, 623 (Fed. Cir. 1997).  Case: 24-1997      Document: 27     Page: 10     Filed: 02/10/2025ALJINDI  v. US 11 \nC \nDr. Aljindi challenges the Claims Court’s d enial  of his \nmotion to disqualify, arguing that Judge Tapp denied his \nsummary -judgment motion as moot “illegally and mali-\nciously,” that his “actions are criminal,” and that his “mo-\ntive was malicious and retaliatory.”  Appellant’s Informal \nBr. at 20– 21.4  The assertions supply no basis for setting \naside Judge Tapp’s decision not to disqualify himself.  \nDr. Aljindi cites to Judge Tapp’s prior dismissals of his \ncomplaints, id., but he has no right to a new judge because \nhe has earlier lost before a given judge, and that judge has gained some knowledge of the litigant .  See Liteky v. United \nStates, 510 U.S. 540, 551  (1994) ( “[N]ot subject to depreca-\ntory characterization as ‘bias’ or ‘prejudice’ are opinions held by judges as a result of what they learned in earlier \nproceedings.  It has long been regarded as normal and \nproper for a judge to sit in the same case upon its remand , \nand to sit in successive trials involving the same defend-\nant.”).  He cites to various procedural orders, such as the \ncourt’s grant of the government’s motion for extension of \ntime, Appellant’s Informal Br.  at 21– 22, but t hose are \nsimply examples of the c ourt exercising its inherent au-\nthority to manage its docket, and nothing indicates that the \ncourt abused its discretion in exercising that discretion , \nmuch less did so in a way that supplies a ground for dis-\nqualification .  Dr . Aljindi supplies no basis for suggesting \nmisconduct in the assignment of the case to Judge Tapp .  \nRule 40.2 of the Claims Court ’s Rules requires that parties \nidentify related cases in their complaint, RCFC 40.2(a) (1)–\n(3), and instructs that “the clerk will assign the case to the \n \n4  Dr. Aljindi also claims to have filed, and cites to, \nother motions to disqualify other judges, but we decline to consider them as they are not relevant to the present case.  \nSee, e.g., Appellant’s Informal Br. at 6; Appx29, 31 –34; Ap-\npellant’s Informal Reply Br. at 2 –3. Case: 24-1997      Document: 27     Page: 11     Filed: 02/10/2025ALJINDI  v. US 12 \njudge to  whom the earliest -filed case is assigned,” RCFC \n40.2(a)(4)(A).  Dr. Aljindi identified the case resulting in \nJudge Tapp’s SBA Opinion ( Case No.  21-1578C ) as a re-\nlated case, Claims Court Compl. at 1 –2, and the clerk \nproperly assigned Judge Tapp to th e underlying  case here \npursuant t o Rule 40.2(a)(4)(A), Notice of Direct Assign-\nment .  See Appellant’s Informal Br. at 5 –7.  At bottom, Dr. \nAljindi has no basis for asserting bias or prejudice  except  \nhis own beliefs about Judge Tapp and Judge Tapp’s prior \ndismissal.  But “subjective beliefs about the judge’s impar-\ntiality are irrelevant” in the objective test required by 28 \nU.S.C. §  455(a), Allphin , 758 F.3d at 1344, and Judge \nTapp’s past judicial rulings alone do not constitute a valid \nbasis for recusal in this case, particularly as his opinions \ndo not display “favoritism or antagonism that would make fair judgment impossible,” Liteky , 510 U.S. at 555; see Or-\nder at 1–2.  We thus affirm the Claims Court’s denial of Dr. \nAljindi’s recusal motion.  \nIII \nWe have considered Dr. Aljindi’s remaining arguments \nand find them unpersuasive.  We affirm the Claims Court’s \ndismissal of Dr. Aljindi’s complaint and denial of his mo-\ntion to disqualify.  \nAFFIRMED  Case: 24-1997      Document: 27     Page: 12     Filed: 02/10/2025",

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: Monica Raeven Linker, under supervised release for a previous offense of receipt of child pornography, allegedly violated the conditions of her supervision by using an AI painting application to create pornographic images, some of which may depict minors. The violation involves using the app to generate explicit images based on inappropriate search criteria, prompting her probation officer to request a warrant from the court for further proceedings.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether Monica Raeven Linker violated the conditions of her supervised release by engaging with AI-generated pornographic content that potentially depicts minors, contrary to her prohibition from viewing or possessing such material.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The document is a petition requesting the court to issue a warrant for Monica Raeven Linker to appear and address the allegations of violating her supervised release conditions. The actual court ruling or decision on this petition is not included in the document.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Monica Raeven Linker, who previously got in trouble for having illegal pictures, isn't supposed to look at any more bad pictures. She used an app on her phone that makes pictures using AI, and it made pictures that might not be allowed since they look like young people in bad situations. Because of this, the officer who checks on her wants the court to call her in to talk about her using those pictures.",

According to monitoring\nreports, the client used an application titled ArtSense, an android only application, which is\ndescribed as the “ultimate AI painting app.” The app further describes its ability to utilize\nartificial intelligence to “transform” thoughts into paintings.

It is also\nnoted that Ms. Linker often used search terms to include “small”, “small girls” and “small\nbreasts,” seemingly search criteria that is likely to result in very young participants being\nshown and in which it seems that the terms could also likely describe minors or children.\nOn January 17, 2024, Ms. Linker reported to the U.S. Probation Office as directed and did\nsurrender her phone. When confronted as to the concerns as identified herein, Ms. Linker\nresponded that she had downloaded the application in question to recreate an image of\nherself and her fiancee, but after entering innocuous search criteria, she stated that she was\npresented with a pornographic image. When confronted about her ongoing inappropriate\nsearch criteria, Ms. Linker stated that she had “blacked out” and didn’t remember searching\nfor any other inappropriate images. Ms. Linker also indicated that she stayed up crying due\nto having viewed the pornographic images, and the thought of her fiancee, who she is not\nable to have contacted with. Ms. Linker stated that she did not report the incident to this\nofficer last night as it was late, and she stated that she forgot to do so this morning. Ms.\nLinker stated that she deleted the application, as it was the only way to remove the\npornographic image from her phone. \nGiven the client’s conduct as outlined, it is the belief of the undersigned officer that a\nwarrant is appropriate. \nThe U.S. Probation Office respectfully recommends the Court issue a WARRANT  requiring the offender to appear\nto answer to the allegation(s) contained in this petition.\nI declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct.\nExecuted on: January 17, 2024\ns/Chris Heinen\nChris Heinen\nU.S. Probation OfficerCase 4:19-cr-06002-SAB    ECF No. 170    filed 01/17/24    PageID.<pageID>   Page 2 of 3Case 4:19-cr-06002-SAB    ECF No. 170    filed 01/17/24    PageID.<pageID>   Page 3 of 3",

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: In this legal case, Jeremy Ryan sued X Corp. (formerly Twitter) for suspending his accounts, claiming promissory fraud, promissory estoppel, unjust enrichment, and unfair business practices. The court dismissed all claims because they were barred by X's terms of service, which allow account suspension and limit liability. Notably, Ryan argued that X used an artificial intelligence (AI) system to target and suspend his accounts without proper user notification, forming part of his claims under unfair business practices.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the plaintiff's claims against X Corp. for suspending his accounts are viable given the Terms of Service and the protection offered by Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court dismissed all of Ryan’s claims because they are precluded by X Corp's Terms of Service, which permit account suspension and exclude liability for such actions. The court also found that Ryan’s unjust enrichment claim is independently barred by Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine you have a social media account, and the rules you agreed to say the company can remove your account for any reason and won't be responsible for that. In this case, when the company did remove an account, the user tried to sue, saying it wasn't fair and that they broke promises. However, the court said, “Sorry, those rules you agreed to allow this action, so you can't win in court.” The company also used AI to decide which accounts to remove, which wasn't against any law in this instance.",

No. 32  \n \n \nDefendant X Corp., (formerly Twitter, hereafter, “X”) suspended several of plaintiff \nJeremy Ryan’s X accounts last year.  Soon after  that, Ryan filed this action.  Four claims remain: \npromissory fraud, promissory estoppel, unjust enrichment, and an unfair business practice s claim.  \nAs pleaded, all are barred by X’s Terms of Service (the “Terms”), which  limit X’s liability for any \nconduct arising out of users’ inability to access their accounts.  Ryan’s unjust enrichment claim  \nwould also be  barred by section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996 (“section 230”).  \nI will grant X’s motion to dismiss and allow one last opportunity for Ryan to amend his complaint.  \nBACKGROUND  \n The parties are familiar with the factual background of the case .  In the Order Granting \nMotion To Dismiss (“Order”) (Dkt. No. 29), I held that  Ryan’s breach of contract, intentional \ninterference, and conversion claims were barred by section 230  because they “ar[ose] from X’s \ndecision to suspend [Ryan’s] seven accounts and suspension is a traditional publishing function \naccording to the Ninth Circuit.” Dkt. No. 29.  I also dismissed Ryan’s California Business and \nProfessions Code § 17200 (“UCL”) claim to t he extent that it was also predicated on X’s \nsuspension of his accounts  and because it did not allege any economic damages . Id.   \n In his First Amended Complaint (“FAC”) [Dkt. No. 30],  Ryan still alleges that X Case 3:24-cv-03553-WHO     Document 41     Filed 12/09/24     Page 1 of 13 \n2 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  wrongfully suspended his accounts and denied him the opportunity to appeal the suspensions, but \nhe has trimmed and redirected his claims.  His promissory estoppel claim asserts that X did not \nfollow its “multi -pronged suspension policy” when it suspended his accounts.  FAC , ¶¶ 91 -94.  He \nalleges that he “did not violate X’s Terms, policies, or rules,” but that his accounts were \nnevertheless suspended “without any proper explanation.”  Id. ¶¶ 46, 82.  He also claims that X \nused an artificial intelligence sys tem to target, identify, and suspend his account, something which \nit did not disclose to its users.  Id.  His unjust enrichment claim stems  from the same facts; he \nalleges that because X suspended his accounts in the manner he describes, the revenue it generates \nfrom advertisements that still run alongside  or are associated with his now -unavailable content is \nrevenue wrongly obtained.  Id.   \nRyan’s promissory fraud claim asserts that X promised (through its Terms, representations \nmade in its “Help Center” and media commentary by Elon Musk) not to suspend accounts without \ncause but failed to adhere to those promises . Id. ¶¶ 113, 118.  His UCL claim a lleges  that X \n“engaged in unfair business practices by using an artificial intelligence system to identify, target, \nand suspend user accounts without providing proper notice in its Terms and allowing this system \nto suspend accounts for any reason at all,” by “represent[ing] to users and Plaintiff . . . that it \nabides by a multi -pronged suspension policy” despite allegedly “never publiciz[ing] the provision \nof its Terms stating that the company may suspend accounts for any reason,” and by representing \nthat Plaintiff could “submit an appeal” with respect to the suspension of his accounts.  See id. ¶¶ \n124, 126 -27.   \n X has moved once again to dismiss all of Ryan’s claims. Motion to Dismiss (“Motion”) \n[Dkt. No. 32].   \nLEGAL STANDARD  \nA motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) “tests the legal \nsufficiency of a claim. A claim may be dismissed only if it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff \ncan prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle hi m to relief.” Cook v. \nBrewer , 637 F.3d 1002, 1004 (9th Cir. 2011) (citation and quotation marks omitted). Rule 8 \nprovides that a complaint must contain a “short and plain statement of the claim showing that the Case 3:24-cv-03553-WHO     Document 41     Filed 12/09/24     Page 2 of 13 \n3 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  pleader is entitled to relief.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2). Thus, a complaint must plead “enough facts to \nstate a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.” Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly , 550 U.S. 544, 570 \n(2007). Plausibility does not mean probability, but it requires “more than a sheer possibility that a \ndefendant has acted unlawfully.” Ashcroft v. Iqbal , 556 U.S. 662, 687 (2009). A complaint must \ntherefore provide a defendant with “fair notice” of the claims against it and the grounds for relief. \nTwombly , 550 U.S. at 555 (quotations and citation omitted).  \nIn considering a motion to dismiss, the court accepts factual allegations in the complaint as \ntrue and construes the pleadings in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. Manzarek v. \nSt. Paul Fire & Marine Ins. Co ., 519 F.3d 1025, 1031 (9th Cir. 2008); Erickson v. Pardus , 551 \nU.S. 89, 93 -94 (2007). However, “the tenet that a court must accept a complaint's allegations as \ntrue is inapplicable to threadbare recitals of a cause of action's elements, supported by mere \nconclusory statements.” Iqbal , 556 U.S. at 678. If a Rule 12(b)(6) motion is granted, the “court \nshould grant leave to amend even if no request to amend the pleading was made, unless it \ndetermines that the pleading could not possibly be cured by the allegation of other facts.” Lopez v. \nSmith , 203 F.3d 1122, 1127 (9th Cir. 2000) (en banc) (citations and quotations omitted). However, \na court “may exercise its discretion to deny leave to amend due to ‘undue delay, bad faith or \ndilatory motive on part of the movant, repeated failure to cure defi ciencies by amendments \npreviously allowed, undue prejudice to the opposing party ..., [and] futility of amendment.’ ” \nCarvalho v. Equifax Info. Servs., LLC , 629 F.3d 876, 892 –93 (9th Cir. 2010) (alterations in \noriginal) (quoting Foman v. Davis , 371 U.S. 178, 182 (1962)).  \nDISCUSSION  \nI. X’S TERMS OF SERVICE BAR RYAN’S CLAIMS  \nAll of Ryan’s claims are barred by  the Terms , which provide that the platform may stop \nproviding its services to users for any or no reason.  Ryan concedes  that the Terms, which are a \npart of X’s User Agreement, are a legally binding contract to which he  is a party .  See FAC ¶¶ 76, \n78, 105 -06, 125.  But he notes that  the limitation of liability clause does not bar claims for fraud or \ngross negligence.  While that is true, that does not help him  because he has not plausibly alleged \neither.  Case 3:24-cv-03553-WHO     Document 41     Filed 12/09/24     Page 3 of 13 \n4 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  A. The Terms  \nX’s Terms of Service (the “Terms”) provide, in relevant part:  \nWe may stop (permanently or temporarily) providing the Services or any features within the \nServices to you or to users generally. We also retain the right to create limits on use and \nstorage at our sole discretion at any time. We may also remove or refuse to distribute any \nContent on the Services, limit distribution or visibility of any Content on the service, suspend \nor terminate users, and reclaim usernames without liability to you  . . .  \n \n. . . [X] [s]hall not be liable  for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential or punitive \ndamages, or any loss of profits or revenues . . . resulting from” the user’s “inability to access \nor use the services . \nX’s Request for Judicial Notice [Dkt. No. 33 -2] Ex. A (“X Terms”) at pp. 3 -6 (emphasis added).1  \nThis liability limitation applies to “any theory of liability, whether based on . . . contract, statute, \ntort . . . or otherwise.” Id.  California courts regularly recognize limitation of liability clauses as \nvalid.  See e.g. , Lewis v. YouTube, LLC , 244 Cal. App. 4th 118 (2015); Food Safety Net Services v. \nEco Safe Systems USA, Inc. , 209 Cal. App. 4th 1118 (2012).2   \nB. X Has Limited  its Liability for Ryan’s Claims  \nAll of Ryan’s claims arise from his inability to access X’s services after it suspended his \naccounts .  His promissory estoppel claim seeks damages for what he says were false promises  that \nX made to him about how it would handle account suspension; he alleges that X made “specific, \npersonal promises” that it would not suspend his “access” to his accounts but did anyway.   FAC ¶¶ \n46-51, 85 -89.  His unjust enrichment claim seeks recovery of advertising revenue that X \npurportedly obtained through its continued use  of Ryan’s accounts after their suspension.  See id. \n¶¶ 106 -109.  His promissory fraud claim seeks damages for what he describes as X’s \nmisrepresentations about its appeals process to get his accounts unsuspended.  See id. ¶¶ 113 -15, \n119.  And h is UCL claim seeks damages for X’s retention of “a financial benefit” from Ryan’s \naccounts’ suspension and his loss of prospective economic advantages.  See id. ¶¶ 128 -29; see \nMotion 8 -10; X Reply [Dkt. No. 38] 1 -2; Terms at p. 6.   \n \n1 X has asked that I take judicial notice of its Terms. Dkt. No. 33 -2.  Ryan does not oppose.  The \ncontents of the Terms are not subject to reasonable dispute  and the defendant’s Request for \nJudicial Notice is GRANTED.  \n \n2 These clauses have been specifically recognized as appropriate where one party is offering a \nservice for free to the public, as is the situation here.  See e.g. , Lewis , 244 Cal. App. 4th at 125 \n(citing Marksborough  California, Inc. v. Superior Court , 227 Cal. App. 3d 705 (1991)).  Case 3:24-cv-03553-WHO     Document 41     Filed 12/09/24     Page 4 of 13 \n5 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  Ryan points out that California courts find limitation of liability provisions unenforceable \nunder California Civil Code section 1668 to the extent that those provisions insulate a party from \nfraud or gross negligence.  See Opposition to X’s Motion to Dismiss (“Oppo.”) [Dkt. No. 37] 18 -\n19 (citing City of Santa Barbara v. Superior Court , (“Santa Barbara ”) 41 Cal. 4th 747 (2007)).  \nOnly one of his four claims, for promissory fraud, alleges fraud or gross negligence.  He argues \nthat section 1668 precludes X fr om limiting its liability against that claim because it involves a \n“standard above negligence .”  Id.  But even in that claim, he  has failed to plausibly allege fraud.  \n1. Section 1668   \nSection 1668 provides: “All contracts which have for their object, directly or indirectly, to \nexempt anyone from responsibility for his own fraud . . . or violation of law, whether willful or \nnegligent, are against the policy of the law.” Cal. Civ. Code § 1668.  California courts have \nrepeatedly interpreted the statute as rendering  limitation of liability unenforceable to the extent \nthat they would insulate an individual or entity  from liability for fraud or willful injury. See e.g., \nWeBoost Media S.R.L. v.  LookSmart Ltd. , No. C 13 –5304 SC, 2014 WL 2621465, at *9 –10 (N.D. \nCal. June 12, 2014) ; New England Country -Foods, LLC v. Vanlaw Food Products, Inc. , 87 F.4th \n1016, 1019 -20 (9th Cir. 2023).  \nThe Ninth Circuit provided a helpful overview of section 1668 law in New England \nCountry Foods :  \nThe California Supreme Court has held that provisions exculpating all  liability for \n“intentional wrongdoing” and “gross negligence” are invalid under Section 1668.  See \nWestlake Cmty. Hosp. v. Superior Ct. , 17 Cal. 3d 465, 479, 131 Cal.Rptr. 90, 551 P.2d 410 \n(1976) (holding that a bylaw that “bar[red] ... plaintiff's claim based on the intentional  \nwrongdoing of the hospital or its staff” was invalid under Section 1668 (emphasis in \noriginal)); City of Santa Barbara v. Superior Ct. , 41 Cal. 4th 747, 751, 62 Ca l.Rptr.3d 527, \n161 P.3d 1095 (2007) (holding “that an agreement made in the context of sports or \nrecreational programs or services, purporting to release liability for future gross negligence, \ngenerally is unenforceable as a matter of public policy”).   Accordingly, Section 1668 will \n“invalidate[ ] contracts that purport to exempt an individual or entity from liability for future \nintentional wrongs,” “gross negligence,” and “ordinary negligence when the public interest \nis involved or ... a statute express ly forbids it.”  Spencer S. Busby, APLC v. BACTES Imaging \nSols., LLC , 74 Cal. App. 5th 71, 84, 289 Cal.Rptr.3d 100 (2022) (internal quotation marks \nomitted) (quoting Frittelli, Inc. v. 350 N. Canon Drive, LP , 202 Cal. App. 4th 35, 43, 135 \nCal.Rptr.3d 761 (2011)).  \n87 F.4th at 1019 -20.   Case 3:24-cv-03553-WHO     Document 41     Filed 12/09/24     Page 5 of 13 \n6 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  In Santa Barbara , the court  considered the effect of section 1668 on a contractual \nprovision that sought to release the City of Santa Barbara (the “City”), from liability for future \ngross negligence .  See Santa Barbara , 41 Cal. 4th 747 (2007).  The mother of a developmentally \ndisabled 14 -year-old girl  had signed an application form that released the City from liability for \n“any negligent act” related to the child’s participation in the City’s summer camp for \ndevelopmentally disabled children.  Her daughter drowned while attending the camp and the \nparents sued the City.   The California Court of Appeal held that “(1) the agreement in the \napplication form was effective and enforceable insofar as it concerned defendants’ liability for \nfuture ordinary negligence , but (2) the release of liability clause for future gross negligence  was \nunenforceable.”  Id. at 751 (emphasis added).  On appeal, the Supreme Court of California \naffirmed the second conclusion.3  \nSince Santa Barbara , other California courts have considered the appropriate scope of \nliability -limiting clauses like the one at issue here and held that section 1668 renders liability \nwaivers unenforceable to the extent that those waivers would insulate a party from fraud , \nintentional tort liability, 4 or gross negligence .  See e.g. , WeBoost Media , 2014 WL 2621465, at \n*9-10.  Where  there are no plausible allegations of fraud , intentional tort liability, or gross \nnegligence , the constraint is inapplicable.  See e.g. , Block Scientific, Inc. v. True Diagnostics, Inc. , \n2022 WL 485010, at *9 (S.D. Cal. Feb. 16, 2022) (holding that section 1668 does not render a \nlimitation of liability provision unenforceable where the plaintiff “has not satisfied the heightened \npleading requirements of fraud” and “has not adequately all eged that Defendants violated the \nlaw”).  \n \n3 The Santa Barbara court noted that no published California case as of 2007 had upheld (or \nvoided) an agreement that purported to release liability for future gross negligence, only \n“ordinary” or “simple” negligence, making the issue before it one of first impression.  In th e \nabsence of California authority on the issue at the time, the court turned to other jurisdictions, and \nfound that the “vast majority of decisions . . . [held] that such agreements,” i.e. those that waive \nfuture liability for gross negligence, “generally are void on the ground that public policy precludes \nenforcement of a release that would shelter aggravated misconduct.” See id. at 760 (collecting \nnon-California cases).  The Santa Barbara court followed th at analysis . \n \n4 Notably, Ryan did allege intentional torts in his first complaint —he alleged intentional \ninterference with his economic advantage and conversion —but I dismissed those claims without \nleave to amend because they were barred by section 230.  Dkt. No. 29.  Case 3:24-cv-03553-WHO     Document 41     Filed 12/09/24     Page 6 of 13 \n7 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  2. Ryan Has Not Plausibly  Alleged Fraud  \nIf Ryan had plausibly alleged fraud, X’s limitation of liability clause  might not apply  to his \npromissory fraud claim .  He has not  done so .   \nThe elements of a promissory fraud claim are (1) “a promise clear and unambiguous in its \nterms” (2) that is false; (3) “that the promisor know of the falsity when making the promise;” (4) \n“reliance by the party to whom the promise is made” (5) that is “bot h reasonable and foreseeable;” \nand (6) resulting injury. Aceves v. U.S. Bank, N.A. , 192 Cal. App. 4th 218, 225, 231 (2011).   Under  \nRule 9(b), parties must “allege fraud with particularity,” including the “who, what, when, where, \nand how of the misconduct charged.”  See Coronavirus Rep. v. Apple, Inc ., 85 F.4th 948, 958 (9th \nCir. 2023).   \nThe FAC does not allege  a “promise” by X to not suspend Ryan’s accounts , despite  Ryan’ s \ncontentions in his briefs and at the hearing .  See Oppo. 23 -24.  Ryan  does not allege when these \nsupposed representations were made .  He simply  asserts that  “X’s . . . executives and agents have \nmade numerous general and specific representations that [X] will not be overly active in its \nsuspension of user accounts.” FAC ¶¶ 11, 112 -115; Oppo. 23 -24.  He offers statements by Elon \nMusk that the platform will be a “‘common d igital town square,’” X’s “Freedom of Speech, Not \nReach” policy, and “repeated statements by corporate executives that the company will not bad \n[sic] user accounts for reasons contrary to its Terms.”  Oppo. 23 -24; FAC ¶¶ 11, 15.  These \ngeneralized allegations are far from “clear and unambiguous” promises not to suspend Ryan’s \naccounts.  And they do not come close to meeting the Rule 9(b) particularity standard.5, 6   \n \n5 The closest that Ryan comes to alleging fraud with particularity is his allegation that on \nDecember 19, 2023, X emailed him explaining that one of his accounts associated with the handle \n“@nftdemon_420” had been mistakenly  suspended, and X was “unsuspend[ing]” it, see FAC ¶ 47.  \nX did “unsuspend” that account, but later suspended it again in April 2024.  FAC ¶¶ 49 -50.  Ryan \nargues that this representation indicated to him that he would be allowed back on the X platform \nbecause he had not violated its Terms .  But he never alleges how X represented to him that it \nwould not suspend his accounts in the first place or that he would be allowed back on X \nindefinitely . \n \n6 Ryan also alleges that “X never represented to [Ryan] . . . that it used artificial intelligence \nsystems to target, identify, and suspend user accounts,” FAC ¶ 114, but does not allege how or \nwhy this would constitute fraud.  No  cited  authority suggests that a social media platform using an \nAI system to identify accounts for suspension qualifies as a fraudulent practice.  \n Case 3:24-cv-03553-WHO     Document 41     Filed 12/09/24     Page 7 of 13 \n8 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  Finally, Ryan’s claim that he “resumed his activities . . . under the representation that his \ncompliance with [X’s] Terms of Service and adherence to the rules of the platform would allow \nhim to continue creating content, building his business, and engaging with th e cryptocurrency and \nNFT community” is conclusory  and contradicted by X’s Terms.  See FAC ¶¶ 50 -51.  He provides \nno indication of when, how, where, or in what context X represented to him that so long as he \ncomplied with  its Terms and “adhere[ed] to the rules of the platform” he could continue using his \naccounts indefinitely and without interruption.  Any such representation would have been out -of-\nstep with the Terms.  \n*** \nTaking all pleaded facts as true, Ryan does not plausibly allege the kind of conduct  that \nwould render X’s limitation of liability unenforceable under section 1668.  The Terms anticipate \nand release X from liability for claims like Ryan’s that seek “indirect, incidental, special, \nconsequential or punitive damages, or any loss of profits or revenues . . . resulting from” the user’s \n“inability to access or use the servic es.”   \nII. SECTION 230  \nWhile Ryan’s claims are all barred by the Terms, which warrants  their dismissal, his unjust \nenrichment claim would also be  barred by Section 230(c)(1) of the Communications Decency \nAct.7  \nTo invoke section 230 as an affirmative defense at the pleading stage, X must show that \nRyan’s allegations establish beyond dispute that: (1) that X is a “provider . . . of an interactive \ncomputer service”; (2) that the challenged content is “information pr ovided by another  \ninformation content  provider”; and (3) that Ryan’s claims “treat” X as the “publisher or speaker” \nof that information. See Calise v. Meta Platforms, Inc ., 103 F.4th 732 (9th Cir. 2024) (laying out \nthe elements of the test for section 230 immunity as iterated by the Ninth Circuit in Barnes v. \n \n7 X argues that section 230 bars all of Ryan’s claims, but I disagree.  His claims for promissory \nfraud and estoppel and his UCL claim are implausibly alleged, but they seek to hold X liable for \nwhat Ryan interpreted as promises to treat his accounts in a particular way; those purported \npromises are distinct from X’s publishing conduct.   \n Case 3:24-cv-03553-WHO     Document 41     Filed 12/09/24     Page 8 of 13 \n9 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  Yahoo! , Inc., 570 F.3d 1096, 1102 (9th Cir. 2009), the “ Barnes  test”) (emphasis added).  \nPreviously , I could not ascertain whether Ryan’s unjust enrichment claim was subject to \nsection 230 because the pleadings were unclear.  See Order  at 15 -16.  I directed Ryan to amend his \ncomplaint to clarify.  According to the FAC, X is wrongfully deriving and retaining a benefit from \nRyan’s intellectual property because it still generates advertising revenue from ads that continue to \nrun alongside  Ryan’s suspended accounts  even though  Ryan cannot himself access his accounts or \nthe content they hosted .  FAC  ¶¶ 103 -111.  He contends that this revenue is wrongfully gotten.8  \nFAC ¶¶ 105 -110.   \nAt its heart, Ryan’s unjust enrichment claim  attempts to hold X liable for decisions it made \nas a publisher  and is accordingly barred by section 230.  X decided to suspend Ryan’s accounts (a \npublishing activity) and it continues to allow various entities  to advertise on its platform (also a \npublishing activity).  This claim  does not attempt to hold X liable for alleged misrepresentations or \nfalse promises.  Ryan does not assert  that X promised him that it would not continue to generate \nad revenue from adver tisements associated with his suspended accounts —he merely challenges its \ndecision to do so.  See FAC ¶¶ 103 -111.   \nRyan argu es that section 230 generally does not apply to  any of his claims, both because \nhe says that his claims arise from “X’s unlawful activity embedded in its inconsistent Terms . . . \nand conflicting statements,” rather than from its publishing activity per se, and also because he \nbelieves that X’s use of an AI system to suspend accounts takes it outside the scope of section 230 \nprotection.  See Oppo. 9 -10.  Neither argument  holds water.  \nA. The Second Barnes Element is Met for All Claims  \nThere is no dispute that the first Barnes  element is met: X is a provider of an interactive \n \n8 Ryan alleges that since he filed his opposition to X’s first motion to dismiss, X has “taken \nremedial steps to change this function on the X platform,” Oppo. 22:16 -18.  At oral argument, \nRyan’s lawyer  clarified that she was referencing new provisions in X’s updated Terms that \ninvolved its use of artificial intelligence systems.  See Dkt. No. 37 -2 (Ryan’s Request for Judicial \nNotice of X’s updated Terms).  I grant Ryan’s  request for judicial notice  (there appears to be no \ndispute a bout the legitimacy of the new Terms ), but they have no effect on my analysis .  The \nprovision that Ryan ’s counsel pointed to  at oral argument merely states  that X has the right to use \ninformation that its users provide  to train its machine learning and artificial intelligence models \nwithout compensation to the user.  Id. at pp. 7, 21.  \n Case 3:24-cv-03553-WHO     Document 41     Filed 12/09/24     Page 9 of 13 \n10 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  computer service.  The second Barnes element was  also uncontested the first time around ; all of \nRyan’s claims hold X liable for decisions it made regarding “information provided by another \ninformation content provider,” i.e. information that Ryan , not X, provided. See Barnes , 570 F.3d at \n1109 (finding that the removal of social media content falls under section 230(c)(1)); see also \nKing v. Facebook, Inc ., 572 F. Supp. 3d 776, 780 -81 (N.D. Cal. 2021) (finding that claims relating \nto disabling of accounts fal l under section 230(c)(1)); First Motion to Dismiss [Dkt. No. 13]; \nOpposition to First Motion to Dismiss [Dkt. No. 26].   \nBut n ow Ryan argues that section 230 immunity “only applies if the interactive computer \nservice provider is not also a ‘information content provider’.” Oppo. 10:12 -19.  He s ays that \n“section 230 does not immunize X . . . from its own unlawful activity and therefore does not bar \n[his] claims,” see id. 10:8 -12:28, and argues that because X “is responsible in whole or in part” for \ncreating or developing content (the nature of which he does not specify), it is also an “information \ncontent provider” as defined b y 47 U.S.C. § 230(f)(3) and is therefore not immune under section \n230(c)(1).9   \nI do not fully understand this argument, but I think that Ryan may be contending that \nbecause he alleges that the “challenged activity” (i.e. X’s suspending of his accounts) may have \nbeen taken “entirely by another information content provider,” meaning X’s AI system , he has \nshown a dispute a bout whether the challenged content is provided by “another” information \ncontent provider .  If my interpretation is right, Ryan misunderst ands X’s burden in establishing a \nsection 230 defense .  He  conflat es the second Barnes element, which considers the source of the \ncontent at issue, and the third Barnes element, which considers whether the challenged action was \nundertaken in the actor’s role as a publisher or speaker.  \nNothing in the FAC allows me to infer that X (or anyone other than Ryan) provided the \ninformation on Ryan’s pages.  The FAC does allege at various points that something other than X \n \n9 That subsection defines “information content provider” as “a ny person or entity that is \nresponsible, in whole or in part, for the creation or development of information provided through \nthe Internet or any other interactive computer service. ” 47 U.S.C. § 230(f)(3).   \n Case 3:24-cv-03553-WHO     Document 41     Filed 12/09/24     Page 10 of 13 \n11 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  (its AI systems) could have made the decision to suspend Ryan’s accounts.10  (This argument \nmakes no sense to me; if X uses its AI system, it is still X’s ultimate decision that is at issue.)  \nRegardless, that has no bearing on the second Barnes element.  Whether X or its AI system or \nsome combination thereof made the decision to suspend Ryan’s accounts, the content at issue on \nthose accounts was content provided by “another ” information content provider other  than X or its \nAI system: Ryan.  The second Barnes element is met with respect to all claims.  \nB. The Third Barnes Element is Met for Ryan’s Unjust Enrichment Claim  \nRyan offers two reasons why his claims generally do not seek to impose liability for \n“publishing” activity and thus do not meet the third Barnes element.  First, he argues that “[w]hile \nsection 230 can provide immunity to interactive service providers, it does not provide immunity to \ngenerative artificial intelligence models or systems deployed by interactive service providers.” \nOppo. 13.  Second, he argues that all four of his remaining claims are based on some kind of \nindependent “promise” that X made to him, not on its decision to suspend his account s, and thus \nare not subject to section 230.  Id. 9.  The first argument lacks foundation .  The second is not \napplicable to his unjust enrichment claim.  \n1. X’s Use of AI Systems  \nFirst, no  authority suggests that X’s use of a generative AI model to do content regulation \ndeprives it of section 230 immunity.  Nothing  in the plain language of the statute  suggests that X \nwould be denied section 230 protection because it uses an AI system for content moderation. See \ngenerally , 47 U.S.C. § 230(c)(1).  No court has held otherwise.   \nRealizing this, Ryan turns to an unenacted Congressional bill that proposed modifications \nto section 230.  See Oppo. 14 -15 (referencing Senator Josh Hawley’s proposed “No Section 230 \nImmunity for AI” Act, which sought to amend the Communications Decency Act such that \n \n10 Ryan alleges that the AI system operated outside of X’s control to suspend his accounts, based \non its own “machine learning capabilities and ability to form independent behaviors and actions”, \nsee Oppo. 14:9 -12.  He goes on to argue that X “has not demonstrated that there can be no dispute \n… that X’s actions were related to content produced by another information content provider and \nnot its own behavior or that its contributions are entirely unrela ted to the aspect of the conduct \n[that] was allegedly unlawful.” Id.   \n Case 3:24-cv-03553-WHO     Document 41     Filed 12/09/24     Page 11 of 13 \n12 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  “nothing in this section . . . shall be construed to impair or limit any claim in a civil action . . . \nbrought under Federal or State law against the provider of an interactive computer service if the \nconduct underlying the claim or charge involves the use or provision of generative artificia l \nintelligence by the interactive computer service.”); see supra n. 6.  An unenacted bill has no \npersuasive power here.  Ryan has offered no authority that suggests section 230 protections are to \nbe rescinded from interactive computer services that use AI systems to moderate content.  X’s \ndecision to suspend —and its act of suspending —Ryan ’s accounts was publishing activity that falls \nwithin the scope of section 230.11 \n2. Misleading Representations  \nRyan’s unjust enrichment claim fundamentally challenges X’s decision to suspend his \naccounts, which is a publishing activity, and its continued collection of ad revenue associated with \nthose accounts.   The Ninth Circuit has held that any activity that “can be boiled down to deciding \nwhether to exclude material that third parties seek to post online ,” i.e. publishing conduct,  “is \nperforce immune under section 230.” Roommates.Com , 521 F.3d at 1162 -63, 1170 -71; see also \nBarnes , at 1107 (quoting Roommates.Com ).   \nAs indicated supra , n.7, Ryan’s claims for promissory fraud and estoppel and his UCL \nclaim do challenge something other than publishing conduct, albeit  unsuccessfully : They \nchallenge X’s alleged misrepresentations.  But his  unjust enrichment claim does not allege that X \npromised  that it would cease all advertising activity connected to his accounts in the event that it \nsuspended those accounts .  See discussion supra , Section I(B).  It alleges that X’s decision to \ncontinue publishing ads connected to his accounts was wrongful, and its retention of associated \nrevenue is unjust.  This claim challenges X’s publishing activity.  It is barred by section 230.  \n \n11 X also points out that the United States Supreme Court recently contemplated social media \nplatforms’ use of “algorithms” to implement community guidelines and standards, including to \ntake down content that violates those guidelines and standards.  See Moody v. NetChoice , 144 S. \nCt. 2383 (2024) (considering whether a Florida statute that limited social media platforms’ \ncapacities to engage in content moderation violated the First Amendment).  But the majority \nopinion in Moody did not contemplate the use of artificial intelligence systems  to regulate content, \nwhich is what Ryan alleges X is using, so Moody is not helpful here.  Justices Alito, Thomas, and \nGorsuch, concurring, noted that social media platforms will increasingly use AI systems to \narrange, delete, and modify content.  But no substantive guidance came from Moody  on this \nquestion.

His unjust enrichment claim would also be  \nbarred by section 230.  Ryan may file an amended complaint within 30 days of the date below  \n(given the holidays).

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: This court case involves Spider Labs Limited filing a Motion for Reconsideration after the court previously granted the defendant's motion to quash a subpoena. The subpoena sought to uncover the identity of John Doe, who allegedly made defamatory statements about Spider Labs' AI technology and business practices. The court denied the reconsideration, finding that Spider Labs failed to provide sufficient evidence that the statements were false or defamed the company.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the court erred in quashing the subpoena that sought to reveal the identity of an anonymous defendant who allegedly made defamatory statements online.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court held that Spider Labs did not present sufficient evidence to reconsider its decision to quash the subpoena and protect the defendant’s First Amendment right to anonymity. The court found that the plaintiff's evidence did not demonstrate a prima facie case of defamation.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine Spider Labs felt someone, who is hiding their identity, said bad things about them online, claiming their tech doesn't work as it's supposed to. They wanted the court to order GoDaddy to reveal who that person is so they could take legal action. The court said, \"No, unless you have more proof that what they said was really false and damaging, we can't force GoDaddy to give up their identity. Saying they hurt your feelings isn't enough; you need stronger evidence.\" So, Spider Labs asked the court to think again, and the court said, \"We've thought about it already, and our decision stays the same.\"",

( Spider Labs, Ltd. v. Doe , No. 20 -5457 (S.D.N.Y. filed July 16, \n2020))  Plaintiff sought identifying information about anonymous Defendant from non -\nparty GoDaddy.com. (Doc. 14 at 1)  The Motion to Quash was filed in this District as \nrequired by Rule 45(d).  This Court found that Plaintiff did not meet its burden of proving  \nits interests outweighed Defendant’s First Amendment right to anonymity. (Doc. 14 at 4) \nPlaintiff now asserts that the Court improperly analyzed the evidence it provided, failed to \nconsider material facts it presented, and misapprehended one of its argume nts. (Doc. 15 at \n2)  \nII. LEGAL STANDARD  \nReconsideration is disfavored and “appropriate only in rare circumstances.” \nWildEarth Guardians v. United States Dep’t of Justice , 283 F.Supp.3d 783, 795 n.11 (D. \nAriz. June 21, 2017); see also Bergdale v. Countrywide Ba nk FSB , No. CV -12-8057 -PCT-\nSMM, 2014 WL 12643162, at *2 (D. Ariz. May 23, 2014) (“[Reconsideration] motions \nshould not be used for the purpose of asking a court to rethink what the court had already \nthought through -rightly or wrongly.”). A motion for recon sideration is best used when the \nCourt is “(1) presented with newly discovered evidence, (2) committed clear error or the \ninitial decision was manifestly unjust or (3) if there is an intervening change in controlling \nlaw.” School Dist. No. 1J, Multnomah Cn ty. v. ACandS, Inc. , 5 F.3d 1255, 1263 (9th Cir. \n1993). “The motion to reconsider would be appropriate where, for example, the court has \npatently misunderstood a party, or has made a decision outside the adversarial issues \npresented to the court by the par ties, or has made an error not of reasoning but of \napprehension … Such problems rarely arise and the motion to reconsider should be equally \nrare.” Defs. of Wildlife v. Browner , 909 F. Supp. 1342, 1351 (D. Ariz. 1995) (internal \ncitations omitted ). Under LRC iv 7.2 (g), “[n]o motion for reconsideration ... may repeat any \noral or written argument made by the movant in support of or in opposition to the motion \nthat resulted in the Order.” Id. \nIII. DISCUSSION  \nPlaintiff argues that the Court failed to properly consider the evidence and facts Case 2:20-mc-00039-SPL   Document 20   Filed 11/30/20   Page 2 of 5 \n3  \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n presented at the time of the Motion to Quash . (Doc. 15 at 2)  It also argues the Court \n“misapprehended one or more argument set forth by Spider Labs.” (Doc. 15 at 2)  Plaintif f \nalso essentially repeats its arguments from its Response to the Motion to Quash, which is \nunacceptable under LRCiv 7.2(g).  \nTo the extent the Court erred by failing to address the “defamatory statements” \nindividually within its Order, the error is harmles s because the Court found the “evidence” \npresented by Plaintiff  is not sufficient to make a prima facie  showing  of defamation. \nThough Plaintiff  is effectively asking the Court to rethink what it already thought, the Court \nwill now go through each statement  and show why the evidence presented is insufficient .  \n1. “Doe was running an article about Spider Labs and its product, SpiderAF, \non his blog .” (Doc. 10 at 11)  \nThis statement, whether or not it is true, cannot be defamatory to Plaintiff . It is \nnot about Plaintiff ; it is about D efendant ’s article. It is irrelevant to the defamation \nclaim.  \n2. “Spider Labs’s technology is not based on artificial intelligence .” (Doc. 10 \nat 11 –12) \nPlaintiff  provided statements that were so -called evidence of this statement’s \nfalsit y in its Response to the Motion to Quash by providing a Declaration from its \nChief Technical Officer.  (Doc. 11) The Declaration did not contain any statements \nthat plainly addressed this statement or showed one way or another that Spider Labs \nuses artifici al intelligence. There are two statements that explain the features of the \nSpider Labs platform and explain that the platform’s functionality varies depending \non the needs of the user. (Doc. 11 ¶¶12 –13) These explanations may be true as to \nSpider Labs’ pla tform and functionality but they do not confirm or deny whether \nthe technology is based on artificial intelligence and thus are not evidence as to the \nfalsity of D efendant ’s statement. Plaintiff  did not provide any other statements or \nevidence showing that  this statement was false.  \n3. “Spider Labs is defrauding its clients .” (Doc. 10 at 12)  Case 2:20-mc-00039-SPL   Document 20   Filed 11/30/20   Page 3 of 5 \n4  \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n This statement goes to the heart of the claim . While this Court did not and will \nnot decide whether it is true, Plaintiff  has not shown evidence that its clients are not \nbeing defrauded. The statements about the recognition Spider Labs has received as \nwell as the kinds of features of the platform  do not definitively show its clients are \nreceiving the kind of protection for which they are paying. Merely stating “Spider \nLabs is leading provider of anti -Ad Fraud services” does not go to the truthfulness \nof the above statement. (Doc. 11 at 10)  Indeed, Pla intiff previously stated additional \ndiscovery was necessary to ascertain the truthfulness or falsity of the statements. \n(Doc. 10 at 15)  \n4. “Spider Labs’s clients are not protected from fraud .” (Doc. 10 at 12)  \nFor the same reasons as the above statement, Plain tiff has not shown evidence \nthat this statement is false.  \n5. “[Doe] had hired a team of engineers to test Spider Labs’s technology .” \n(Doc. 10 at 12)  \nThis statement, whether or not it is true, cannot be defamatory to Plaintiff . It is \nnot about Plaintiff ; it is about Defendant . It is irrelevant to the defamation claim.  \n6. “[T]here is nothing behind Spider Labs’s platform .” (Doc. 10 at 12)  \nThe Court acknowledges that the broad nature of this statement  makes it difficult \nto refute or confirm. However, the statements Plaintiff  did provide, as characterized \nby Defendant, are “generic marketing language that [do] not prove any of Doe’s \nstatements are false.” (Doc. 19 at 7) As broad as D efendant ’s statement  is, Plaintiff’s \nstatements are broader.  \n7. “Spider Labs’s platform cannot detect fraud.”  (Doc. 10 at 12)  \nFor the  same reasons as the above statement, Plaintiff  has not shown evidence \nthat this statement is false.  \n8. Spider Labs is not accredited by the Media R ating Council (Doc. 10 at 8)  \nThis statement has been heavily discussed in the briefings. Plaintiff  has \nalready  acknowledged its translation error and that this statement is no longer part Case 2:20-mc-00039-SPL   Document 20   Filed 11/30/20   Page 4 of 5 \n5  \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n of the claim for defamation. There is no need to further parse this statement.  \n As stated in the Court’s October 23, 2020 Order, mere assertions that statements are \ndefamatory are not sufficient evidence to establish a prima facie  case of defamation. (Doc. \n14 at 3 –4)  \nIV. CONCLUSION  \nThis Court properly considered the evidence and facts presented at the time of the \nMotion to Quash. The Court will not reconsider arguments repeated from the Motion to \nQuash papers. To the extent that the Court misapprehended any of Plaintiff’s arguments, \nthe error was harmless.  \nTherefore,  \nIT IS ORDERED  that Plaintiff’s Motion for Reconsideration (Doc. 15) is denied .  \nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED  that this case shall remain closed . \n Dated this 30th day of November, 2 020. \n \n \n \nHonorable Steven P.
