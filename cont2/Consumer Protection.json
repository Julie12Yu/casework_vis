    "summary": "1. Summary: In this putative securities class action, Lead Plaintiff Dutch Smith accused GitLab Inc. and its executives of misleading investors about the company's AI capabilities, customer feedback, market competitiveness, and financial projections, leading to inflated stock prices. The court found the claims insufficient and dismissed the case, allowing the plaintiff to amend the complaint, noting many statements were forward-looking, non-actionable opinions, or lacked specific allegations of falsity, scienter, and loss causation.\n\n2. Key Legal Issue: Whether GitLab Inc. and its executives made false or misleading statements regarding the company's AI capabilities and financial projections in violation of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and SEC Rule 10b-5.\n\n3. Court's Holding: The court dismissed the complaint for failing to state a claim, citing inadequacies in specifying false or misleading statements, scienter, and loss causation—while granting leave to amend for the plaintiff to rectify these deficiencies.\n\n4. ELI5 Explanation: The lawsuit claimed GitLab misled investors, causing them to lose money when the stock price dropped. The court said the accusations weren't strong enough since GitLab's statements about future performance and AI were protected as either predictions, opinions, or lacking evidence of being intentionally deceitful. The court gave the plaintiff another chance to improve the case details.",

Nos. 50, 52  \n \n \nIn this putative  securities class action, Lead Plaintiff Dutch Smith alleges  that GitLab Inc. \n(“GitLab”) and its executives Sytse Sijbrandij, Brian Robins, and David DeSanto  (“Individual \nDefendants”)  knowingly made false and misleading statements to  investors  about the company’s \nproducts  and their  artificial intelligence (“AI”) capabilities, customer  feedback , competitiveness in \nthe market , and financial  projections .  Second Am. Compl. , ECF No. 47  (“SAC”) .  Plaintiff also \nalleges that subsequent financial disclosures revea led Defendants’ fraudulent conduct and caused \nGitLab’s inflated stock prices to drop, harming investors.  Id.  GitLab and Individual Defendants \n(together, “Defendants”) move to dismiss the case for failure to state a claim.  Mot. to Dismiss \nSAC, ECF No. 50  (“Motion”) .  The Court reviewed the parties’ briefs and relevant authority , \nprovided the parties with a tentative ruling,  and heard argument on August 7, 2025.  For the \nfollowing reasons, the motion is GRANTED with leave to amend.    \nI. BACKGROUND1   \nPlaintiff claim s that Defendants overhyped  the potential of AI  in the software development \ncycle  at a time when the market had concerns  about using  AI with  highly sensitive data .  GitLab \n \n1 The facts are taken from the complaint and assumed to be true for purposes of this motion .   Case 5:24-cv-06244-EKL     Document 72     Filed 08/14/25     Page 1 of 29 \n   2 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  also felt that it needed to compete with rival AI products, like GitHub’s, to avoid falling behind.  \nDefendants’ optimis tic assumptions regarding  customer demand for AI features led Defendants to \nmake the ultimately incorrect decision  to increase prices.  Plaintiff argues that Defendants knew \nabout the company’s  suboptimal AI capabilities  and financial forecasts , yet failed to disclose \nimportant information , thereby  mislead ing investors.   \nA. Company Background    \n GitLab  provides a one platform solution  that integrates security into the automation  of the \nsoftware development cycle .  SAC  ¶¶ 44, 84.  Instead of splitting software development projects \namong different teams , GitLab’s goal is for software development and operations teams to \ncollaborate using AI -powered processes to make workflow more efficient.  See id. ¶¶ 43-46.  The \nunderlying mechanism of this solution is DevSecOps , an enhanced version of the DevOps \nmethodology that adds security (Sec) to software development (Dev) and informational \ntechnology operations (Ops).  Id. ¶¶ 43-44.  While competitors like GitHub focus on incorporating \nAI for software developers  to write and complete code , GitLab aims to also automate processes for \ntesting security issues and protecting highly sensitive data to enhance efficiency.   See id. ¶ 77.  \nGitLab 16 was the newest iteration of GitLab’s AI -powered DevSecOps platform during the Class \nPeriod – June 5, 2023 to June 3, 2024 .  Id. ¶ 84.   \n GitLab’s pricing structure has three tiers:  Free, Premium, and Ultimate.  Id. ¶ 48.  Most of \nGitLab’s revenue historically comes from Premium tier subscriptions.  Id. ¶ 58.  On March 2, \n2023, GitLab announced a price increase on its Premium tier  subscription  from $19 to $29 per \nuser per month , effective April 3, 2023 .  Id. ¶ 87.  GitLab expected the price increase to nominally \nincrease revenue for the fiscal year ending January 31, 2024 (“FY 2024”) and to significantly \nincrease revenue for the fiscal year ending January 31, 2025 (“FY 2025”).  Id. ¶ 96.   \nB. Alleged ly False and Misleading Statements    \nFollowing the price increase announcement, Defendants allegedly made false and \nmisleading statements to investors.  During the Class Period,  Defendants allegedly misrepresented \n(1) GitLab’s  AI capabilities  in order to  drive market demand, (2) customers’ evaluations and \nconcerns  regarding these AI capabilities , (3) GitLab’s  intent to develop AI -powered features Case 5:24-cv-06244-EKL     Document 72     Filed 08/14/25     Page 2 of 29 \n   3 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  competitive with Copilot , GitHub’s AI coding assistant , and (4) the projected financial \nimplications of the Premium tier price increase .  Id. ¶¶ 142, 173.  The Court does not list all of the  \nchallenged  statements here, but includes the following illustrative examples:    \n1. Statements about GitLab’s AI capabilities    \n• “[O]ur customers now can now [sic] run AI and ML  [machine learning]  workloads on \nGPU -enabled GitLab Runners on the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure [.]”  Id. ¶ 152.   \n• “Code Suggestions uses generative AI to suggest code  to developers.  Suggested \nReviewers leverages AI to identify the most appropriate reviewers of code.  Explain [] This \nVulnerability provides details about potential security vulnerabilities in code.”  Id. ¶ 161.   \n• “We already have 14 AI features available to our customers.”  Id. ¶ 195; see also id . ¶ 203 .   \n2. Statements about  customers’ evaluations and concerns    \n• “[W]e expect customers will increasingly turn to GitLab as they build machine learning \nmodels and AI into their applications.”  Id. ¶ 148.   \n• “[T]he early feedback to Duo has been very positive. . . . [ C]ustomers recognize that they \nneed a suite of AI features, and therefore, we’re excited about Duo.”  Id. ¶ 168.   \n• “Our customers have reported efficiency improvements upwards of 50% with Code \nSuggestions.  . . . We also spoke with a multinational financial technology company, and \ntheir team is excited about using GitLab Duo [.]”  Id. ¶ 203.   \n3. Statements about GitLab’s intent to compete with GitHub    \n• “The real promise of AI extends far beyond code creation.  And this is where GitLab has a \nstructural advantage. . . . And to date, GitLab has more AI features geared towards \ndevelopers than our competitors. ”  Id. ¶ 148.   \n• “So we’re winning deals against GitHub because we have the most comprehensive \nplatform. . . . [B]ecause we are better able to address those use  cases  [i.e., security scans] , \nwe’re also able to build AI features that build on that, for example, the ability to explain \nvulnerabilities and to have the AI suggest a fix.”  Id. ¶ 208.   Case 5:24-cv-06244-EKL     Document 72     Filed 08/14/25     Page 3 of 29 \n   4 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  4. Statements about the Premium tier p rice increase   \n• “The price increase, which took effect on April 3 , [2023 ,] is going as planned.  We only \nhad 1 month of renewals impacted by the price increase in the quarter.  To date, customer \nchurn is unchanged for the Premium customers who renewed in April, and our average \n[annual recurring revenue]  per customer increased in line with our expectations.”  Id. \n¶ 150.   \n• “[W]e really only had a short period of less than a month, . . . [but] the renewal rates and \nthe churn and the land of new customers have been better than expected.”  Id. ¶ 155.   \n• “[O]verall bookings [are] more positive than our internal forecast and churn is less.  And \nso we’re seeing positive signs on every element of how we modeled it from a bookings and \nchurn perspective.”  Id. ¶ 166.   \nC. Scienter and Loss Causation  \nPlaintiff claims that Individual Defendants intentional ly or reckless ly failed to disclose \nfacts regarding delayed AI features, weak market demand, and slowed or stalled “seat expansion, ” \ni.e., the growth of individual licenses sold to existing customer s.  See id.  ¶¶ 119, 216.  When \nGitLab  later announced its financial results for the fourth quarter of FY 2024 (“4Q24”) and the \nfirst quarter of FY 2025 (“1Q25”), each of the two disclosures allegedly revealed Defendants’ \nfraudulent conduct and thus caused GitLab’s  inflated stock price to drop .  Id. ¶ 252.   \n1. GitLab’s 4Q24 disclosures   \n In a March 4, 2024 press release , GitLab announced its 4Q24 results of a positive revenue \nand growth rate, yet revealed a lower -than-expected guidance for 1Q25.  GitLab’s 4Q24 results \nconsisted of a quarterly revenue of $163.8 million  and a growth rate of 33% year -over-year \n(“y/y”) , and an annual revenue of $579.9 million  and a growth rate of 37% y/y.  Id. ¶ 5.  GitLab ’s \nguidance for 1Q25  consisted of  an expected annual revenue range of $725 million to $731 million \nfor FY 2025 and a growth rate of approxim ately 26% y/y.  Id.  In the earnings call, Defendants \ninformed investors that GitLab had not yet finished analyzing its standalone selling price (“SSP”) , \nwhich represents  the cost of each product when sold individually, for FY 2025.  Id. ¶ 8.  An SSP \nanalysis would allow GitLab to accurately assess revenue for customer organizations that purchase Case 5:24-cv-06244-EKL     Document 72     Filed 08/14/25     Page 4 of 29 \n   5 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  products in bundles.  See id.   Thus, Defendants explained that they did not factor in any change in \nSSP for the company’s 1Q25 guidance when asked about their lower -than-expected future \nestimates.   Id. ¶ 8.  Whereas before the Class Period Defendants expected significant revenue \ncontributions  from the Premium tier price increase  in FY 2025, Defendants now expected these \ncontributions  would be delayed until  FY 2026 .  Id. ¶ 7.  The 1Q25 guidance  confirmed a negative \nshift in financial projections and customer  buying behavior that Defendants allegedly failed to \nreveal prior to the press release .  See id. ¶ 261.  On March 5, 2024, t he day  after the press release , \nGitLab’s stock price dropped approximately  21% from $74.47 to $58.84 per share.  Id. ¶ 9.   \n2. GitLab’s 1Q25 disclosures   \nIn a June 3, 2024 press release, GitLab announced its 1Q25 results of an approximate ly \n21% growth y/y in Annual Recurring Revenue (“ARR”) , landing 5 points below  the previously \nexpected 26% growth y/y that Defendants had estimated in their guidance .  Id. ¶ 11; see also \nSupp. Tang Decl. Ex. 23 at 1, ECF No. 64  (stating 21% growth y/y in “calculated billings”).2  \nGitLab’s Dollar -Based Net Retention Rate (“DBNRR”) , a financial metric that shows revenue \ngrowth within the existing customer base,  dropped by 1 point to 129%.  SAC ¶  11.  GitLab also \nannounced that it had completed its SSP analysis, resulting in “an estimated $4 million headwind \nto FY 2025 revenue guidance ” compared to the initial 1Q25 guidance  given along with  the 4Q24 \ndisclosures.  Id.  Plaintiff argues that this headwind further revealed a steep decline of net new \nPremium tier users in the quarter, cont rary to Defendants’ prior optimism of the market.  Id. ¶ 138.  \nThe next day, GitLab’s stock price dropped about  5% from $ 47.07 to $ 44.75  per share.  Id. ¶ 12.   \nD. Procedural History  \nOn September 4, 2024, Arlie Dolly filed the original  complaint  in this action .  ECF No. 1.  \nOn December 23, 2024, t he Court appointed Dutch Smith as Lead Plaintiff.  ECF No. 36.  On \nFebruary 5, 2025, Lead Plaintiff filed an amended complaint.   ECF No. 41.  On March 7, 2025, \nLead Plaintiff filed the operative second amended complaint  pursuant to stipulation .  See ECF \nNo. 44.   \n \n2 Exhibits 1-22 are from the declaration of Fiona Y. Tang in support of the Motion, ECF No. 51 \n(“Tang Decl aration ”), and Exhibits 23 and 24 are from the Supplemental Tang Declaration.   Case 5:24-cv-06244-EKL     Document 72     Filed 08/14/25     Page 5 of 29 \n   6 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  Plaintiff alleges  that Defendants violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of \n1934 (“Exchange Act”) and Rule 10b -5, promulgated by the United States Securities and \nExchange Commission (“SEC”).  SAC ¶  1.  Plaintiff also alleges that Individual Defendants were \ncontrolling persons of GitLab and thus violated  Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act.  Id. ¶¶ 284-\n289.  Plaintiff seeks to recover damages on behalf of all persons and entities who purchased or \notherwise acquired GitLab securities during the C lass Period and suffered a loss.  Id.   \nDefendants move to dismiss for failure to state a claim  under Federal Rule s of Civil \nProcedure 12(b)(6) and 9(b), and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 \n(“PSLRA”).  Mot. at 1.  Defendants contend that Plaintiff  has not plausibly alleged false or \nmisleading statements , scienter, or loss causation .  See id. at 10 -20.  Defendants also move to \ndismiss the Section 20(a) claim that is derivative of the Section 10(b) and SEC Rule 10b -5 claim.  \nId. at 25.   \nII. REQUEST FOR JUDICIAL NOTICE  \nIn ruling on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, courts generally do not consider material outside the \npleadings.  United States v. Corinthian Colls. , 655 F.3d 984, 998 (9th Cir. 2011).  However, courts \nmay consider “documents incorporated in the complaint by reference[.]”  Tellabs, Inc. v. Makor \nIssues & Rts., Ltd ., 551 U.S. 308, 322 (2007) .  Incorporation by reference “treats certain \ndocuments as though they are part of the complaint itself.  The doctrine prevents plaintiffs from \nselecting only portions of documents that support their claims, while omitting portions of those \nvery documents that weaken – or doom – their claims.”  Khoja v. Orexigen Therapeutics, Inc ., 899 \nF.3d 988, 1002 (9th Cir. 2018).  “[A] defendant may seek to incorporate a document into the \ncomplaint ‘if the plaintiff refers extensively to the document or the document forms the basis of \nthe plaintiff’s claim.’”  Id. (quoting United States v. Ritchie , 342 F.3d 903, 907 (9th Cir. 2003)).    \nIn ruling on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, courts  may also consider “matters of public record.”  \nFed. R. Evid. 201(b).   For example, c ourts may take judicial notice of SEC filings because they \nare publicly available documents whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned.  Fed. R. Evid. \n201(b); see also  In re Bare Escentuals, Inc. Sec. Litig. , 745 F. Supp. 2d 1052, 1066 -67 (N.D. Cal. \n2010) (“The court is [] permitted to take judicial notice of the content of relevant public disclosure Case 5:24-cv-06244-EKL     Document 72     Filed 08/14/25     Page 6 of 29 \n   7 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  documents required to be filed with the SEC [.]”).  But courts  should consider SEC filings “only \nfor the purpose of determining what statements the documents contain, not to prove the truth of \nthe documents’ contents.”  Troy Grp., Inc. v. Tilson , 364 F. Supp. 2d 1149, 1152 (C.D. Cal. 2005)  \n(quoting  Lovelace v. Software Spectrum, Inc. , 78 F.3d 1015, 1018 (5th Cir. 1996)) .   \nDefendants ask the Court to consider certain  earnings statements, earnings call transcripts, \nSEC filings, and market analyst reports.  Defendants argue  that the Court may consider Exhibits 1 -\n2, 4-5, 7-14, and 18 -22 because they are incorporated by reference in the complaint.  See Req. for \nJud. Notice  at 3, ECF No. 52 (“RJN”).  “ Plaintiff does not object to the Court’s consideration of \nExhibits 1 -2, 4-5, 7-14 and 18 -22 for their existence and contents under the doctrine of \nincorporation by reference as Plain tiff has quoted or otherwise relied on portions in the \nComplaint .”  Opp. to RJN at 9, ECF No. 56.   Defendants also ask the Court to take judicial notice \nof Exhibits 1 -6, 10 -12, 15-24.  See RJN at 4-5; see also Supp. RJN at 2, ECF No. 63.   Judicial \nnotice of these materials is appropriate because they are SEC filings  and analyst reports , and their \naccuracy cannot reasonably be questioned.  Plaintiff does not object to the Court judicially \nnoticing these materials for “their existence and contents.”   Opp. to RJN at 8.    \nPlaintiff object s to the Court’s consideration of any exhibit  “for the purpose of disputing \nPlaintiff’s well -plead factual allegations.”  Id.  The Court has not identified any factual disputes \nraised by these materials, and in any event, the Court will not consider the exhibits for an improper \npurpose.  Accordingly, Defendants’ requests for incorporation by reference and judicial notice are \nGRANTED.3   \nIII. LEGAL STANDARD  \nUnder Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), court s must dismiss a complaint if it fails \nto state a claim upon which relief can be granted.  To avoid dismissal, plaintiff s must allege \n“enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.”  Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly , \n550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007).  A claim is facially plausible when the pleaded facts allow the court “to \n \n3 Additionally, the Court may consider Exhibits 1 -19 to the extent they contain cautionary \nstatements that accompany forward -looking statements cited in the complaint.  See 15 U.S.C. \n§ 78u-5(e).   Case 5:24-cv-06244-EKL     Document 72     Filed 08/14/25     Page 7 of 29 \n   8 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.”  Ashcroft v. \nIqbal , 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009).  For purposes of a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, court s generally “accept \nfactual allegations in the complaint as true and construe the pleadings in the light most favorable \nto the nonmoving party.”  Manzarek v. St. Paul Fire & Marine Ins. Co. , 519 F.3d 1025, 1031 (9th \nCir. 2008).  However, court s need not “assume the truth of legal conclusions merely because they \nare cast in the for m of factual allegations.”  Fayer v. Vaughn , 649 F.3d 1061, 1064 (9th Cir. 2011) \n(per curiam) (quoting W. Mining Council v. Watt , 643 F.2d 618, 624 (9th Cir. 1981)).  If court s \nfind that dismissal pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) is warranted, “court [s] should grant leave to amend \neven if no request to amend the pleading was made, unless it determines that the pleading could \nnot possibly be cured by the allegation of other facts.”  Lopez v. Smith , 203 F.3d 1122, 1127 (9th \nCir. 2000) (en banc) (quoting Doe v. United States , 58 F.3d 494, 497 (9th Cir. 1995) ).   \nIV. DISCUSSION  \nDefendants move to dismiss on the following  grounds.  First, the complaint is puzzle -pled.  \nSecond, the alleged false and misleading statements are inactionable and unsupported by \nparticularized facts .  Third, the complaint does not plausibly allege that Individual Defendant s \nacted with scienter.  Fourth , the complaint fails to plausibly allege that Defendants’ alleged fraud \ncaused GitLab’s two stock price drops.    \nThe Court find s that the complaint should not be dismissed for puzzle pleading , but grants \nthe motion in all other respects .  First, Plaintiff alleges that Defendants knowingly misrepresented \nor omitted important information because GitLab underperformed compared to previous financial \nforecasts.  However, m any of the allegedly false and misleading statements are inactionable \nbecause they are forward -looking  statements , puffery, or otherwise inactionable opinion s.  \nPlaintiff also fails to plead with particul arity how any actionable statement  contradicts information \nthat Defendants materially omitted or misrepresented .  Plaintiff likewise fails to plead with \nparticularity how Individual Defendants were intentional or reckless in failing to disclose \ninformation .  Finally, Plaintiff fails to plead with particularity what new information the two \ncorrective disclosures reveal ed that would indicate fraudulent conduct and cause stock prices to \ndrop.  The Court cannot infer fraud nor loss causation solely from GitLab’s alleged  failure to meet Case 5:24-cv-06244-EKL     Document 72     Filed 08/14/25     Page 8 of 29 \n   9 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  its financial projections .  Because the  primary Section 10 (b) claim fails, the Court also dismisses \nthe derivative Section 20 (a) claim.   \nA. Puzzle Pleading  \nDefendants argue that the complaint should be dismissed for puzzle pleading.  Mot. at 8.  \nA puzzle pleading is a complaint that puts undue burden on defendants and courts to identify the \nstatements at issue and to match them up with reasons why the statements are false or misleading.  \nSee In re GlenFed, Inc. Sec. Litig. , 42 F.3d 1541, 1554 (9th Cir. 1994) (en banc); In re Autodesk, \nInc. Sec. Litig. , 132 F. Supp. 2d 833, 842 (N.D. Cal. 2000).  The PSLRA requires plaintiffs to craft \ntheir complaints in a way that avoids such burden.  In re Splash Tech. Holdings, Inc. Sec. Litig. , \n160 F. Supp. 2d 1059, 1075 (N.D. Cal. 2001).  Thus, plaintiffs in securities cases must avoid \n“rambl[ing] through long stretches of material quoted from defendants’ public statements . . . \nunpunctuated by any specific ‘reasons for falsity,’” which “makes  the nature of the fraud difficult \nto divine [.]”  GlenFed , 42 F.3d at 1553 -54.   \nHere, the complaint is not a puzzle pleading.  First, the allegedly false and misleading \nstatements are listed chronologically in a clearly designated section titled “Defendants’ Materially \nFalse and Misleading Statements .”  See, e.g. , SAC  ¶ 143; cf. Wenger v. Lumisys, Inc. , 2 F. Supp. \n2d 1231, 1243 (N.D. Cal. 1998) (dismissing complaint that lumped together all alleged \nmisrepresentations spanning across eight months).  Second, the complaint delineates the \nstatements allegedly made by each Individual Defend ant.  See, e.g. , SAC  ¶ 145; cf. Splash , 160 \nF. Supp. 2d at 1073 (dismissing complaint for not specifying which of the individual defendants \nallegedly made certain statements).  Third, the complaint groups a number of statements together \nat a time and provides reasons why they are allegedly  false or misleading.4  See, e.g. , SAC  ¶¶ 145-\n147; see also Kampe v. Volta Inc. , No. 22 -cv-02055 -JST, 2024 WL 4534732, at *6 (N.D. Cal. Oct. \n21, 2024) ( “The [complaint] is generally organized in a manner that permits the reader to connect \nthe allegedly false or misleading statements with the reasons why [p]laintiff challenges those \nstatements.” ).   \n \n4 Defendants ’ argument  that the “boilerplate list of supposed reasons” are “without any specifics ,” \nMot. at 9 , is irrelevant to the issue of puzzle pleading.    Case 5:24-cv-06244-EKL     Document 72     Filed 08/14/25     Page 9 of 29 \n  10 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  The cases cited by Defendants are inapposite because the structure of the complaint here is \ndifferent from the puzzle -like complaints that other courts found perplexing .  The complaint is not \nso confusing or disorganized that the Court is unable to identify the alleged statements and the \ncorresponding reasons for falsity .5  Cf. Lu v. Align Tech., Inc. , 417 F. Supp. 3d 1266, 1274 \n(N.D.  Cal. 2019) (dismissing the complaint for lack of clarity between allegations and contextual \nstatements); In re Aqua Metals, Inc. Sec. Litig. , No. 17 -cv-07142 -HSG, 2019 WL 3817849, at *8 \n(N.D. Cal. Aug. 14, 2019) (dismissing the complaint because matching hundreds of statements \nwith corresponding reasons for falsity is undu ly burdensome ).   \nAccordingly, the Court declines  to dismiss the complaint for puzzle pleading.   \nB. Section 10(b) and SEC Rule 10b -5 Claim  \nTo state a claim for damages under Section 10(b) and SEC Rule 10b -5, plaintiffs must \nallege “(1) a material misrepresentation or omission by the defendant; (2) scienter; (3) a \nconnection between the misrepresentation or omission and the purchase or sale of a security; \n(4) reliance upon the misrepresentation or omission; (5) economic loss; and (6) loss causation.”  \nIn re Quality Sys., Inc. Sec. Litig ., 865 F.3d 1130, 1140 (9th Cir. 2017) (quoting Halliburton Co. v. \nErica P. John Fund, Inc ., 573 U.S. 258, 267 (2014)).  Securities fraud cases must meet the \n“higher, exacting pleading standards” of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b) and the PSLRA.  \nOr. Pub. Emps. Ret. Fund v. Apollo Grp. Inc. , 774 F.3d 598, 604 (9th Cir. 2014).   “If the \ncomplaint does not satisfy the PSLRA’s pleading requirements, the Court must grant a motion to \ndismiss the complaint.”  Shenwick v. Twitter, Inc ., 282 F. Supp. 3d 1115, 11 33 (N.D. Cal. 2017) \n(citing 15 U.S.C. § 78u –4(b)(3)(A)).   \nRule 9(b) requires plaintiffs to “state with particularity the circumstances constituting fraud \nor mistake .”  This means that plaintiffs must allege  the “‘who, what, when, where, and how’ of the \nmisconduct charged .”  Kearns v. Ford Motor Co ., 567 F.3d 1120, 1124 (9th Cir. 2009)  (quoting \n \n5 On the whole, the complaint is clear enough and not puzzle -pled.  However, there are isolated \nexamples of lengthy  block quotation s without any bolded or italicized portions  to clearly identify \nthe statements that Plaintiff claim s to be false  or misleading .  See, e.g. , SAC  ¶¶ 178,  205.  Plaintiff \nmust address this issue upon amendment.    Case 5:24-cv-06244-EKL     Document 72     Filed 08/14/25     Page 10 of 29 \n  11 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  Vess v. Ciba -Geigy Corp. USA , 317 F.3d 1097, 1106 (9th Cir. 2003)).  The Rule 9(b) particularity \nrequirement “applies to all elements of a securities fraud action[.]”  Apollo  Grp., 774 F.3d at 605.   \nHere, Plaintiff fails to plead with particularity why Defendants’ statements are false and \nmisleading, how Individual Defendants were intentional or reckless , and what new information \nwas revealed by the two alleged corrective  disclosures that caused GitLab’s stock prices to drop.   \nSee infra Section IV.B.1 -4.   \n1. Inactionable  statements   \nBefore addressing  the particularity requirement  in detail , the Court evaluates whether the \nallegedly false and misleading statements are actionable.  The Court holds that many of the \nstatements at issue are either forward -looking statements protected by the PSLRA safe harbor or \notherwise inactionable opinions or puffery.   \na. Forward -looking statements    \n Defendants argue that the bulk of the statements at issue are forward -looking.  Mot. at 10 -\n11.  A forward -looking statement is “any statement regarding (1) financial projections, (2) plans \nand objectives of management for future operations, (3) future eco nomic performance, or (4) the \nassumptions ‘underlying or related to’ any of these issues.”  No. 84 Emp. -Teamster Joint Council \nPension Tr. Fund v. Am. W. Holding Corp. , 320 F.3d 920, 936 (9th Cir. 2003).  A statement that \n“plainly project[s] expectations f or future growth” is still forward -looking even if it is based on \npast or present circumstances.  Police Ret. Sys. of St. Louis v. Intuitive Surgical, Inc. , 759 F.3d \n1051, 1058 (9th Cir. 2014).  However, a statement that goes beyond future projections and instead \n“provide[s] a concrete description of the past and present state of the [company’s] pipeline” is not \nforward -looking.  Quality , 865 F.3d at 1144.   \nUnder the PSLRA, defendant s will not be liable if a forward -looking statement is either \naccompanied by meaningful cautionary language or is made without actual knowledge that the \nstatement is false or misleading.  15 U.S.C. §  78u5(c)(1)(A)(i); see also Wochos v. Tesla, Inc. , 985 \nF.3d 1180, 1190 (9th Cir. 2021).  “The PSLRA ’s safe harbor is designed to protect companies and \ntheir officials from suit when optimistic projections of growth in revenues and earnings are not \nborne out by events. ”  Quality , 865 F.3 d at 1142 .  Thus, “if a forward -looking statement is Case 5:24-cv-06244-EKL     Document 72     Filed 08/14/25     Page 11 of 29 \n  12 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  identified as such and accompanied by meaningful cautionary statements, then the state of mind of \nthe individual making the statement is irrelevant[.]”  In re Cutera Sec. Litig. , 610 F.3d 1103, 1112 \n(9th Cir. 2010).  If there are no meaningful cautionary statements, however, plaintiff s still need to \n“allege facts that would create a strong inference” that defendant s had actual knowledge of falsity.  \nId.; see also  Quality , 865 F.3d at 1142  (“[T] he safe harbor is not designed to protect companies \nand their of ficials when they knowingly make a materially false or misleading statement about \ncurrent or past facts .”).  For mixed statements containing both forward -looking and non -forward -\nlooking portions, courts examine each portion separately.  See Quality , 865 F.3d at 1141 -42.   \nMany of the allegedly false or misleading statements are either “forward -looking \nstatements made as part of mixed statements, . . . [or] free -standing forward -looking statements.”  \nId. at 1146.  The Court does not list all of the statements but includes the following examples .   \nFree -standing forward -looking statements  \n The following examples  are entirely forward -looking  statements :   \n• “Against a backdrop of macroeconomic uncertainty, customers are looking to our AI -\npowered DevSecOps platform to drive efficiencies, increase productivity, and accelerate \ntheir pace of innovation.  We are poised to make the most of the estimated $40B total \naddressable market opportunity before us.”  SAC ¶ 146.   \n• “We believe that our rapid pace of product innovation and strong customer demand \nposition us to capture a greater share of the estimated $40 billion total addressable market \nopportunity.”  Id. ¶ 160.   \nForward -looking portions of mixed statements  \n The following examples  are forward -looking portions of mixed statements:   \n• “There’s going to be more demand.  And more demand, again, means more people \nentering the fray. . . . [W]e expect the citizen developers . . . to start coding.  That code \nneeds to be managed somewhere.  And that is in GitLab.”  Id. ¶ 152.   \n• “There would be very little impact in FY 2024 and the majority of the impact would come \nin FY 2025 with all the impact realized in the year of FY 2026.”  Id. ¶ 166.   Case 5:24-cv-06244-EKL     Document 72     Filed 08/14/25     Page 12 of 29 \n  13 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  • “So I expect we have another quarter, 1.5 quarters to go until we work through the cycle of \nthe new buying patterns.”  Id. ¶ 170.   \n• “[Code Suggestions] will be generally available in our December product release.”  Id. \n¶ 195.   \nThese statements are forward -looking because they concern GitLab’s projected financial \nimplications following the Premium  tier price increase, expectations on upcoming releases of new \nAI capabilities and product add -ons, and future customer buying behavior.  Plaintiff argues that \nthese statements are not forward -looking because they “refer[] to present or historical facts when \ndiscussing past events and/or current conditions .”  Opp. at 13 .  However, the statements do not \ninclude specifics or detailed facts .  For example, Plaintiff cites to Defendant Sijbrandij’s statement \nin paragraph 160 of the complaint  that “GitLab’s strong quarter is a result of our focus on creating \na differentiated and innovative DevSecOps platform and executing on a strong go -to-market \nmotion” as an example of “‘mixed statements’ ineligible for protection.”  Id. at 13-14.  This \nstatement does not specify how GitLab focused on making the DevSecOps platform \n“differentiated and innovative,” how GitLab executed “a strong go -to-market motio n,” nor how \nGitLab’s efforts resulted in a strong quarter.  See SAC ¶  160.  Instead, Defendant Sijbrandij  opines \ngener ally that GitLab is advantageously positioned to capture a greater market share in the near \nfuture.   \nThe Court agrees with Plaintiff that not all of the statements that discuss projections and \nfuture expectations are purely forward -looking .  For example, Defendants cite to paragraph  195 of \nthe complaint as one of the many example statements that they argue are fundamentally forward -\nlooking.  Mot. at 11 ; see also  In re ECOtality, Inc. Sec. Litig. , No. 13 -03791 -SC, 2014 WL \n4634280, at *13 (N.D. Cal. Sep. 16, 2014) (holding that “predictions about the release date of” a \nproduct “were forward -looking and prote cted by the PSLRA safe harbor”).   But unlike paragraph \n160, paragraph 195 also includes specific  facts that paint a picture of GitLab’s past or present \ncircumstances, such as GitLab “already hav[ing] 14 AI features available” to customers, receiving \ncustomer feedback “seeing efficiency improvements upwards of 50% with Code Suggestions[,]” \nand multipl e examples of “why enterprises choose GitLab.”  Nevertheless, the “mixed” nature of Case 5:24-cv-06244-EKL     Document 72     Filed 08/14/25     Page 13 of 29 \n  14 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  the statements does not automatically bar the forward -looking portions from the PSLRA’s safe \nharbor.  See Quality , 865 F.3d at 1146 (analyzing forward -looking portions of mixed statements \nseparately from non -forward -looking portions).   \nb. Cautionary statements  \nDefendants argue that the forward -looking statements are also accompanied by meaningful \ncautionary language.  Mot. at 11 -12.  The Court agrees.  Defendants properly notif ied investors \nthat “[s]uch forward -looking statements are based upon current expectations and involve risks and \nuncertainties . . . . [A]ny of the assumptions could prove inaccurate or incorrect and, therefore, \nthere can be no assurance that the results contemplated in the forward -looking statements will be \nrealized.”  Ex. 7 at 9; see, e.g. , Ex. 1 at 3 -4; Ex. 12 at 1.  These warnings are sufficient.  See \nIntuitive Surgical , 759 F.3d at 1059 (holding that cautionary language stating “[p]rospective \ninvestors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward -looking statements” is \nsufficient); Cutera , 610 F.3d at 1112 (holding that cautionary language warning  that Cutera’s \n“‘ability to continue increasing sales performance worldwide’ could cause variance in the results” \nis sufficient).   \nFor mixed statements, the cautionary statements go beyond the bare minimum by \nconveying “appropriate, meaningful information about not only the forward -looking statement[s] \nbut also the non -forward -looking statement[s].”  Quality , 865 F.3d at 1148.  Defendants disclose a \nnumber of risks related to the non-forward -looking portions , such as “loss of market share to \n[GitLab’s]  competitors, . . . a decline in [GitLab’s] customer renewals and expansions, . . . [and \nthe] ability to accurately predict the long -term rate of customer subscription renewals or \nadoption[.]”  Ex. 1 at 4 -5; see, e.g. , Ex. 2 at 1 (“These non -GAAP measures are not intended to be \na substitute for [GitLab’s] GAAP results.”); Ex. 4 at 4 -5; Ex. 11 at 1.   \n Plaintiff argues that Defendants’ cautionary statements are not “meaningful” because they \nare boilerplate warnings “of risks as mere hypotheticals even though they ha [d] already \nmaterialized.”  Opp.  at 15.  But Plaintiff has not alleged  with particularity  that any of the risks had \n“already materialized” when the forward -looking statements were made.  See infra Section \nIV.B.2 ; cf. Glazer Cap. Mgmt., L.P. v. Forescout Techs., Inc. , 63 F.4th 747, 781 (9th Cir. 2023)  Case 5:24-cv-06244-EKL     Document 72     Filed 08/14/25     Page 14 of 29 \n  15 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  (“[Defendant] was aware of a significant likelihood that the risk would materialize[.]”); Khoja , \n899 F.3d at 1016 (“[Defendant] allegedly knew already that the ‘new data’ revealed exactly” the \ninconsistency with interim results .).  Therefore, Plaintiff’s argument is unsupported .   \nc. Puffery  or corporate optimism  \nDefendants argue that the remaining non -forward -looking statements at issue are puffery \nor otherwise inactionable.  Mot. at 14 -20.  “‘[V]ague, generalized, and unspecific assertions ’ of \ncorporate optimism or statements of ‘mere puffing’ cannot state actionable material misstatements \nof fact under federal securities laws.”  In re Cornerstone  Propane Partners, L.P. Sec. Litig. , 355 F. \nSupp. 2d  1069,  1087  (N.D. Cal. 2005)  (quoting Glen Holly Ent ., Inc. v. Tektronix. Inc. , 352 F.3d \n367, 379 (9th Cir.  2003)).  These types of statements are often forward -looking, not measurable, \nand not “tethered to facts that a reasonable person would deem important to a securities \ninvestment decision.”  Id. (quoting  City of Monroe Emps. Ret. Sys. v. Bridgestone Corp. , 387 F.3d \n468, 489 (6th Cir. 2004)) ; see also  Cutera , 610 F.3d at 1111 (“ [I]nvestors do not rely on vague \nstatements of optimism like ‘good,’ ‘well -regarded,’ or other feel good monikers.”).  By contrast, \n“[s]tatements by a company that are capable of objective verification are not ‘puffery[.]’”  Apollo  \nGrp., 774 F.3d at 606.  Likewise, statements of corporate optimism may be actionable “when \nthose statements address specific aspects of a compan y’s operation that the speaker knows to be \nperforming poorly.”  Quality , 865 F.3d at 1143 -44 (quoting Warshaw v. Xoma Corp. , 74 F.3d 955, \n959 (9th Cir. 1996)).   \nHere, some of the statements at issue are puffery  or corporate optimism .  The Court does \nnot list all of the statements but includes the following examples:   \n• “With AI revolutionizing how companies develop, secure, and operate software, we \nbelieve GitLab is positioned as the leading AI -powered DevSecOps platform[.]”  SAC \n¶ 145.   \n• “In all, we believe that AI will increase the total addressable market for several \nreasons.  . . . We believe that an AI -powered platform focused solely on the developer \npersona is incomplete.”  Id. ¶ 148.   Case 5:24-cv-06244-EKL     Document 72     Filed 08/14/25     Page 15 of 29 \n  16 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  • “We believe [the Premium price increase] better aligns price with value for our customers \nand the investment we made over the past 5 years.”  Id. ¶ 163.   \n• “[Privacy and transparency] has allowed customers to feel more comfortable adopting \n[GitLab’s model.] . . . [W]e’re finding ways to monetize [GitLab’s] product in a way that \nis best for our customers.”  Id. ¶ 188.   \n• “Yes, I think the  – our Code Suggestions, I think, is very comparable to market.  But I \nthink what’s unique about GitLab is having 14 AI features in the platform available to \ncustomers today.   I think that’s a big differentiation.”  Id. ¶ 203.   \n• “We feel good about our ability to compete.”  Id. ¶ 214.   \nMany of these statements include language such as “I think” or “we feel” that expressly \nindicate corporate optimism or puffery.  Other statements do not include such language but are \nnonetheless “too general to give rise to any particular impression” about  GitLab’s AI capabilities, \nthe viability  of the Premium tier price increase, customer evaluations  of GitLab’s products , or \nGitLab’s  competitiveness in the market.  In re Paypal Holdings, Inc. S’holder Deriv. Litig. , \nNo. 17-cv-00162 -RS, 2018 WL 466527, at * 4 (N.D. Cal. Jan. 18, 2018).  For example, \nparagraph  188 contains subjective claims that  customers “feel more comfortable” and that \nGitLab’s  monetization method is “best” for customers.  See In re Intel Corp. Sec. Litig. , No. 18 -\ncv-00507 -YGR, 2019 WL 1427660, at *9 (N.D. Cal. Mar. 29, 2019) (“Vague positive statements” \nare not actionable because “the [c]ourt cannot quantify these statements for their truth or falsity.”).  \nNo reasonable investor would rely on these subjective claims, as  they do not provide “ a concrete \ndescription of the past and present”  state of affairs.   Quality , 865 F.3d at 1144.     \nHaving found that many of the challenged statements are inactionable, the Court now turns \nto address whether Plaintiff plausibly alleges that any statement was false or misleading.  \n2. Misrepresentation s or omission s \nThe PSLRA requires the complaint to “specify each statement alleged to have been \nmisleading” and “the reason or reasons why the statement is misleading[.]”  Shenwick , 282 F. \nSupp. 3d at 1133 (quoting 15 U.S.C. § 78u –4(b)(2)(A)).  To be false or misleading, a statement \n“must affirmatively create an impression of a state of affairs that differs in a material way from the Case 5:24-cv-06244-EKL     Document 72     Filed 08/14/25     Page 16 of 29 \n  17 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  one that actually exists.”  Brody v. Transitional Hosp. Corp. , 280 F.3d 997, 1006 (9th Cir. 2002); \nsee also  Ronconi v. Larkin , 253 F.3d 423, 434 (9th Cir. 2001) (holding that statements were not \nmisleading where allegedly true “circumstances are not inconsistent with the statements”).    \nHere, Defendants allegedly made  false or misleading statements  relating to four issues :  \n(1) GitLab’s AI capabilities, ( 2) customers’ evaluations and concerns, ( 3) GitLab’s intent to \ncompete with  GitHub , and (4) the projected financial implications of GitLab’s Premium price \nincrease .  See SAC  ¶¶ 142, 173.  Defendants argue that the complaint provides nothing more than \n“a boilerplate list of supposed reasons why the misstatement[s] [are] false, without any specifics as \nto how those reasons apply to the statements at issue.”  Mot. at 9.  The Court agrees that Plaintiff \nhas not alleged falsity with particularity as to any potentially actionable statement.  Plaintiff’s \nallegations of falsity rely on former employees (“FE”) and confidential witnesses (“CW”) , two \npost-class period events , and various analyst report s.  E.g., SAC  ¶¶ 109-118, 131-140.  But none \nof these allegations render the challenged statements false or misleading.  The Court addresses \neach category  of statements  in turn .   \na. AI capabilities  \nThese statements generally describe GitLab’s new AI -powered features, including the \nnumber of features offered, the features’ capabilities, their availability to customers, and their \npotential in the market.  See, e.g. , id. ¶¶ 152, 161, 178, 195, 203.  None of the allegations in the \ncomplaint support Plaintiff’s position  that these statements were materially different from \nGitLab’s true AI capabilities.   \nPlaintiff relies on FE1’s account that GitLab’s “AI product line was [not] matching its \npublicly touted capabilities,” and that a certain executive “exaggerated the Company’s AI \ncapabilities and other GitLab features ,” caus ing turmoil among GitLab’s executives.  Id. ¶¶ 117-\n118.  Plaintiff also relies on FE2’s account that “AI integration was a new feature that was still in \nthe process of being released and trialed,” id. ¶ 110, and FE4’s account that GitLab was in “panic \nto get onboard the AI train ,” id. ¶ 111.  However, t hese three accounts fail to show that \nDefendants’ statements regarding GitLab’s AI capabilities were false or misleading.   See id. ¶ 161 \n(“Code Suggestions uses generative AI to suggest code to developers .”); ¶ 178 (“[Suggested Case 5:24-cv-06244-EKL     Document 72     Filed 08/14/25     Page 17 of 29 \n  25 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  GitLab’s business operations and financial condition during the Class Period.”  Id. ¶ 230.  \nHowever , “generalized claims about  corporate  knowledge are not sufficient to create a strong \ninference of scienter[.]”  Zucco , 552 F.3d at 998.  As Defendants correctly argue, “Plaintiff’s effort \nto conflate knowledge of the Company’s business with knowledge of falsity is no substitute for \nparticularized facts[.]”  Mot. at 22 -23.  Even if Individual Defendants had knowledge of all of the \ncompany’s operations, Plainti ff has not identified any particularized facts that Individual \nDefendants knew that would undermine the truth of any challenged statement.  See supra  Section \nIV.B.2.    \n Second,  Plaintiff relies on a core operations theory to argue scienter.  See SAC ¶¶ 220-228, \n231-239.  An individual defendant’s role in a company may show scienter if:  (1) “they are \nparticular and suggest that defendants had actual access to the disputed information,” (2) they, \nalong with other allegations “when read together, raise an inference of scienter that is ‘cogent and \ncompelling, thus strong in light of other explanations[,]’” or (3) “in rare circumstances where the \nnature of the relevant fact is of such prominence that it would be ‘absurd’ to suggest that \nmanagement was without knowledge of the matter.”  S. Ferry LP, No. 2 v. Killinger , 542 F.3d \n776, 785 -86 (9th Cir. 2008) (quoting Tellabs , 551 U.S. at 323.).  Here , Plaintiff’s core operations \ntheory at most shows that Individual Defendants had access to core operations information.  \nAccess to information , by itself,  does not establish that Individual Defendants knew their \nstatements were false or misleading.   See Splash , 160 F. Supp. 2d at 107 9-81 (holding that \nboilerplate allegations of defendants’ access to internal information , without particularized facts , \nare insuffic ient to show scienter).   Plaintiff argues that it would be “absurd” to suggest that the \nIndividual Defendants lacked knowledge about customer responses to GitLab’s price change and \nthe company’s AI product offering.  Opp. at 21.  But Plaintiff has not identified any relevant fact \nthat contradict s Defendants’ statements, much less any fact “ of such prominen ce” that the \nIndividual Defendants must have known  it.  Ferry , 542 F.3d at 786.  “Where defendants make \ncheerful predictions that do not come to pass, plaintiffs may not argue, based only on defendants ’ \nprominent positions in the company, that they ought to have known better. ”  Berson v. Applied \nSignal Tech., Inc. , 527 F.3d 982 , 989 (9th Cir. 2008).   Case 5:24-cv-06244-EKL     Document 72     Filed 08/14/25     Page 25 of 29 \n  26 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  Third , Plaintiff suggests that the “suspicious ” timing of executive departures  from the \ncompany  indicates scienter.  SAC  ¶¶ 240-248.  Plaintiff relies on FE1’s account that “Ms. \nKramer’s tendency to exaggerate the Company’s AI capabilities and other GitLab features caused \nturmoil amongst the upper ranks at GitLab[]” and numerous vice presidents ultimately left GitLab \nas a result.  Id. ¶¶ 118, 248.  Plaintiff argues that the  short -term appointments  and departures  of \nformer high -ranking employees in close pro ximity  to the Class Period are suspicious enough to \nstrongly imply scienter.  See id. ¶¶ 240-248.  However , “proximate resignations of high -ranking \nofficers or directors do not alone  support scienter[.]”  In re UTStarcom, Inc. Sec. Litig. , 617 \nF. Supp.  2d 964, 975 -76 (N.D. Cal. 2009).  Here, t he Court cannot solely rely on the seemingly  \nsuspicious timing of executive departures to infer  that Defendants acted with  scienter.   \nFinally, upon a holistic review, the Court holds that Plaintiff’s allegations together do not \n“give rise to a strong inference of scienter”  for the reasons discussed above.   Glazer , 63 F. 4th at \n766.  Although the opposition  correctly points out that Plaintiff does not need  to allege  Individual \nDefendants gained financial benefits to show scienter, the argument that “Defendants offer no \ncompeting non -fraudulent inference” is misplaced.  Opp. at 21 -22.  Plaintiff has the ultimate \nburden of plausibly alleging  that “the inference of scienter [is] cogent and at least as compelling as \nany opposing inference one could draw from the facts alleged.”  Tellabs , 551 U.S. at 324.  In \nmany instances, Plaintiff’s allegations do not support an inference of scienter at all.  See, e.g. , \nSAC  ¶¶ 134-141 ( discussing  information learned after challenged statements were made).  In other \ninstances, Plaintiff’s allegations  support a more compelling inference that Defendants disclosed \nmaterial information to investors .  Compare  id. ¶ 134 (alleging that “40% of individual \ncontributors cited concerns about privacy and data security as a top obstacle to using AI”), with \n¶ 236 (Sijbrandij stating  earlier that customers are concerned about  security and privacy ).   \nTherefore , the Court finds that Plaintiff fails to plead scienter with particularity.    \n4. Loss causation    \n“To establish loss causation in a fraud -on-the-market case, the plaintiff must show that \nafter purchasing her shares and before selling, the following occurred:  (1) ‘the truth became \nknown,’ and (2) the revelation caused the fraud -induced inflation in the  stock’s price to be reduced Case 5:24-cv-06244-EKL     Document 72     Filed 08/14/25     Page 26 of 29 \n  27 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  or eliminated.”  In re BofI Holding, Inc. Sec. Litig. , 977 F.3d 781, 791 (9th Cir. 2020)  (quoting \nDura Pharm s., Inc. v. Broudo , 544 U.S. 336, 347 (2005)).  Plaintiffs commonly seek to prove loss \ncausation by identifying one or more corrective disclosures.  See id . at 790.  A corrective \ndisclosure must reveal “new facts that, taken as true, render some aspect of the defendant’s prior \nstatements false and misleading”; it “need not precisely mirror the earlier misrepresentation.”  Id.  \n(first citing Pub. Emps.  Ret. Sys. of Miss. v. Amedisys, Inc. , 769 F.3d 313, 321 -22 (5th Cir. 2014), \nthen quoting In re Williams Sec. Litig . – WCG Subclass , 558 F.3d 1130, 1140 (10th Cir. 2009)).  \nIdentifying a corrective disclosure is just one way to establish that a fraud was revealed to the \nmarket.  See In re Genius Brands Int’l, Inc. Sec. Litig. , 97 F.4th 1171, 118 3-84 (9th Cir. 2024).   \nRegardless of the method chosen, Plaintiff must plausibly allege that “the defendant’s \nmisstatement, as opposed to some other fact, foreseeably caused the plaintiff’s loss.”  Id. at 1183 \n(quoting Mineworker’s Pension Scheme v. First Solar Inc. , 881 F.3d 750, 753 (9th Cir. 2018)).    \nPlaintiff fails to plead with particularity what new information the 4Q24 and 1Q25 \ncorrective disclosures revealed.  Defendants correctly point out that the 4Q24 and 1Q25 \ndisclosures “said nothing to suggest improprieties in connection with any of [GitLab’s]  prior \nstatements, much less did they reveal a fraud.”  Mot. at 24 (emphases omitted).  The only new \ninformation that the 1Q25 disclosure reveals is the completed SSP analysis resulting in an \nestimated $4 million headwind.  SAC ¶  11.  However, Defendants  had already informed investors \nin the prior 4Q24 disclosure that GitLab had not finished its SSP analysis.  Id. ¶ 8.  Although \nPlaintiff correctly notes that “[a] corrective disclosure [] need not ‘precisely mirror’ the \nmisrepresentation,” Opp. at 23 , Plaintiff fails to elaborate how the market “understood” the $4 \nmillion SSP headwind as a “revelation of fraud .”  First Solar , 881 F.3d at 753-54.  Nor does \nPlaintiff otherwise show with particularity how Individual Defendants’ statements, “ as opposed to \nsome other fact, foreseeably caused the plaintiff's loss .”  Lloyd v. CVB Fin . Corp. , 811 F.3d 1200, \n1210 (9th Cir. 2016).   \nPlaintiff  claims that GitLab’s alleged lower -than-expected 21% growth y/y in ARR \n“revealed that GitLab had experienced a decline in net seat expansion ,” which Defendants Case 5:24-cv-06244-EKL     Document 72     Filed 08/14/25     Page 27 of 29 \n  28 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  allegedly concealed.   SAC ¶  261.  However, Plaintiff seems to conflate two different metrics.9  \nEven assuming that the suboptimal  revenue growth is accurate, t he Court cannot  infer loss \ncausation from loss itself , or from the mere failure to meet a financial projection .  See Dura \nPharms ., 544 U.S. at 343 (“To ‘touch upon’ a loss is not to cause  a loss[.]”) ; In re Oracle Corp. \nSec. Litig. , 627 F.3d 376, 392 (9th Cir. 2010) (“Loss causation requires more than an earnings \nmiss.”).   Fundamentally, Plaintiff fails to allege that the “market understood” GitLab’s supposed \nfinancial underperformance as “a revelation of fraud.”  Genius Brands , 97 F.4th at 1184.   \nTherefore, the Court finds that Plaintiff fails to plead  loss causation  with particularity.  In \nsum, because Plaintiff fails to plead the material misrepresentation or omission, scienter, and loss \ncausation  elements , Defendants’ motion to dismiss the Section 10(b)  and SEC Rule 10b -5 claim is \nGRANTED.   \nC. Section 20 (a) Claim    \nSection 20(a) states:  “Every person who, directly or indirectly, controls any person liable \nunder any provision of this chapter or of any rule or regulation thereunder shall also be liable \njointly and severally with and to the same extent as such controll ed person to any person to whom \nsuch controlled person is liable[.]”  15 U.S.C. § 78t(a).  To state a claim for control person liability \nunder Section 20(a), plaintiffs must allege “(1) a primary violation of federal securities law s[,] . . . \nand (2) that t he defendant exercised actual power or control over the primary violator[.]”  Howard \nv. Everex Sys. , 228 F.3d 1057, 1065 (9th Cir. 2000).  “If [p]laintiffs fail to plead a claim for \nsecurities fraud under [Section] 10(b) and Rule 10b -5, the [Section] 20(a) claim fails as well.”  \nMulligan v. Impax Lab ’ys, Inc ., 36 F. Supp. 3d 942, 956 (N.D. Cal. 2014).    \nFor the reasons discussed above, Plaintiff fails to plead a primary violation of federal \nsecurities law.  See supra  Section IV.B .  Therefore, Plaintiff also fails to plead a violation of \nSection 20(a).  Defendants’ motion to dismiss this claim is GRANTED.    \n \n9 GitLab reported a 33% growth  y/y in ARR , 7 points above the expected 26% growth y/y from \nthe previous 1Q25 guidance announced in the 4Q24 disclosure.  Ex. 19 at 1.  Plaintiff a lleges that \nGitLab “land[ed] 5 points below consensus growth expectations ,” but  appears to be relying on a \ndifferent metric – GitLab’s grow th in number of customers  with more than $5,000 of ARR .  \nCompare SAC ¶  11 with Ex. 19 at 1.

Dismissal is with Leave to Amend    \nThe Court grants leave to amend because this is the Court’s first ruling on the legal \nsufficiency of Plaintiffs’ allegations.  See Lopez , 203 F.3d at 1127 (holding that the “court should \ngrant leave to amend . . . unless it determines that the pleading could not possibly be cured by the \nallegation of other facts” (quoting Doe, 58 F.3d at 497)).10  Although the Court grants leave to \namend, the Court may dismiss Plaintiffs’ claims with prejudice if Plaintiffs’ amended complaint \nfails to plausibly state a claim.  See Zucco , 552 F.3d at 1007 (holding that failure to correct \npleading deficiencies after dismissal is a “strong indication” that further amendment would be \nfutile); see also Salameh v. Tarsadia Hotel , 726 F.3d 1124, 1133 (9th Cir. 2013)  (“A district \ncourt’s discretion to deny leave to amend is ‘particularly broad’ where the plaintiff has previously \namended.” (quoting Sisseton -Wahpeton Sioux Tribe v.  United States , 90 F.3d 351, 355 (9th Cir. \n1996))).    \nV. CONCLUSION    \nFor the foregoing reasons, Defendants’ motion to dismiss is GRANTED and the second  \namended complaint is dismissed with leave to amend.  Plaintiff shall file an amended complaint \nwithin 30 days of this Order.  Upon filing the third amended complaint, Plaintiff shall also file a \nredlined version comparing it to the second amended complaint.  \nIT IS SO ORDERED.    \nDated: August 14 , 2025    \n \n  \nEumi K.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: This case involves a securities fraud class action against Sema4 Holdings Corp., a health company utilizing AI for personalized medicine, which was accused of issuing misleading statements regarding its data platform, Centrellis, and financial health to inflate its stock price. The U.S. District Court granted the defendants' motion to dismiss, determining that the plaintiff failed to demonstrate that the alleged misrepresentations were materially misleading or made with scienter, or fraudulent intent.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether Sema4 Holdings Corp. and its executives made materially misleading statements about the company's data platform and financial metrics intentionally to defraud investors in violation of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court dismissed the case because the plaintiff did not sufficiently allege that the defendants made materially misleading statements with the requisite scienter, or fraudulent intent, nor did they adequately demonstrate loss causation tied to the alleged misrepresentations.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: The court looked at claims that a tech company lied about their products and financial health to trick people into investing. The judge said, \"We can't see strong proof that the company lied on purpose or that their few positive statements convinced investors to make bad choices.\" So, the judge decided the case couldn't continue. The company uses AI in their work, and that's important because the tech helped them make big promises that were hard to prove.",

OLIVER , United States District Judge: \nThis matter is before the C ourt on a motion to dismiss the First Amended Complaint, \nfiled by Defendants Sema4 Ho ldings Corp. (“Sema4” or th e “Company”), Eric Schadt \n(“Schadt”), Katherine Stueland (“Stueland”), Isaac Ro (“Ro”), and Richard Miao (“Miao”) \n(the “Individual Defendants,” and, collectively with Sema4, “Defe ndants”). The lead plaintiff, \nNabil Helo (“Helo” or “Plaintiff” ), brings this putative class action alleging that Defendants \ncommitted securities fraud and seek s remedies under Sections 10(b)  and 20(a) of the Securities \nExchange Act of 1934 (“the Exchange Act”). ( See generally  First Amended Complaint \n(“FAC”), ECF No. 33.) Defendants move to dismiss the First Amended Complaint with \nprejudice under Fed. R. Civ. P.  9(b) and 12(b)(6) and the Priv ate Securities Litigation Reform \nAct of 1995 (“PSLRA”). (Def s. Mot., ECF No. 50.)  \nAfter careful consideration of the record, the Court finds that the matter is appropriate \nfor a decision without a hearing. For the following reasons, the Court GRANTS  Defendants’ \nmotion to dismiss the FAC. Case 3:22-cv-01131-VDO     Document 54     Filed 07/31/24     Page 1 of 252 I. BACKGROUND1 \nA. The Parties \nPlaintiff and the Class are individuals wh o acquired Sema4 secu rities between March \n14, 2022 and August 15, 2022. (FAC ¶ 1.) Sema4 is a health company that uses artificial \nintelligence (“AI”) to enable pers onalized medicine for patients. ( Id. ¶¶ 2-3.) Since its \ninception, Sema4 has racked up net losses. ( Id. ¶ 37.) The Company was initially part of Icahn \nSchool of Medicine at Mount Sinai’s Departme nt of Genetics and Genomic Sciences and the \nIcahn Institute for Genomics and Multiscale Biology. ( Id. ¶ 29.) In June 2017, Sema4 \ncommenced operations as a commercial entity and, after completing a business combination \nwith CM Life Sciences in July  2021, debuted on the Nasdaq Stock Market as a publicly traded \ncompany. ( Id.) Sema4 leverages longitudinal patient data, AI-driven predictive modeling, and \ngenomics in combination with other data to affe ct disease diagnosis, tr eatment, and prevention. \n(Id. ¶¶ 2, 30, 31.) Sema4 maintains a database that  includes de-identifie d clinical records, \nincluding more than 500,000 records with genomic profiles, integrated in a way that it claims \nto enable physicians to proactiv ely diagnose and manage disease. ( Id. ¶ 32.)  \nIn January 2022, the Company announced that it would be acquiring GeneDx, Inc. \n(“GeneDx”), which provides rare disease diagno stic and exome sequenci ng services, in a $623 \nmillion acquisition. ( Id. ¶ 37.) On May 2, 2022, the Compa ny announced the closing of its \nacquisition of GeneDx. ( Id. ¶ 42.)  \n \n1 The Court accepts as true the factual allegations  in the FAC and draws all reasonable inferences \nin Plaintiff’s favor for the purpose of deciding  Defendants’ motion. The Court also considers \ndocuments incorporated into the FAC by refere nce and “legally requir ed public disclosure \ndocuments filed with the SEC,” which are properly  considered at the motion to dismiss stage. See \nATSI Commc’ns, Inc. v. Shaar Fund, Ltd. , 493 F.3d 87, 98 (2d Cir. 2007); see also Kramer v. Time \nWarner Inc. , 937 F.2d 767, 774 (2d Cir. 1991).  Case 3:22-cv-01131-VDO     Document 54     Filed 07/31/24     Page 2 of 253 The Individual Defendants were, during th e Class Period, senior executive officers \nand/or directors of the Company who were pri vy to confidential and proprietary information \nconcerning the Company, its operations, finances , financial condition, and present and future \nbusiness prospects. ( Id. ¶ 17.)  Schadt is the founder of Sema4 and served as its Chief Executive \nOfficer (“CEO”) until May 2022. ( Id. ¶ 12.) Stueland has served as CEO of Sema4 since May \n2022 and, prior to the Compan y’s acquisition of GeneDx, wa s the President and CEO of \nGeneDx. ( Id. ¶ 13.) Ro was the Chief Fina ncial Officer (“CFO”) of Sema4 from July 2021 to \nJune 14, 2022. ( Id. ¶ 14.) Miao was Interim CFO of Sema4 from June 14, 2022 to September \n2, 2022. ( Id. ¶ 15.)  \nB. Procedural History \nHelo filed a putative class action complaint against Defe ndants on September 7, 2022. \n(ECF No. 1.) On November 16, 2022, the Court appoi nted Helo as the lead plaintiff, Glancy \nProngay & Murray LLP as lead counsel, and Hu rwitz, Sagarin, Slossberg & Knuff, LLC as \nliaison counsel. (ECF No. 20). On January 30, 2023, Plaintiff filed the Amended Complaint. \n(FAC, ECF No. 33.)  \nDefendants moved to dismiss the FAC on August 21, 2023 (Defs. Mot., ECF No. 50), \nwhich Plaintiff opposed. (Pl. Opp., ECF No. 5 1.) On October 20, 20 23, Defendants filed a \nreply. (Defs. Reply, ECF No. 52.) \nC. The Amended Complaint \n1. Claims \nPlaintiff alleges two claims. First, he allege s that Defendants violated Section 10(b) of \nthe Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5  because they “disseminated or  approved [] materially false Case 3:22-cv-01131-VDO     Document 54     Filed 07/31/24     Page 3 of 254 and misleading statements . . . which they knew , or were deliberately reckless in not knowing, \nwere misleading.” (FAC ¶ 126.) Specifically, \nDefendants: (1) employed de vices, schemes, and artifices to defraud; (2) made \nuntrue statements of mate rial fact/and or omitted to  state material facts \nnecessary to make the statements made not misleading; and (3) engaged in acts, \npractices, and a course of business that  operated as a fraud and deceit upon the \npurchasers of the Company’s secu rities during the Class Period. \n(Id. ¶ 127.) Second, Plaintiff claims the Individual  Defendants acted as controlling persons of \nthe Company within the meaning of Section 20(a ) of the Exchange Act and are thus liable for \nsecurities fraud. ( Id. ¶¶ 131-134.)  \n2. Alleged Misleading Statements \nPlaintiff, in his opposition brief, organize d the purported misrepresentations into two \ncategories. These include ( 1) statements regarding Centrellis, the Company’s data platform, \nand ( 2) statements about financial results, average selling prices of tests (“ASP” or “ASPs”), \ntest volumes, and reimbursements from third-party payors.  \nRegarding the Centrellis platform, Plaintif f alleges that Defe ndants made false \nstatements about its existence and capabilities in hopes of increas ing the Company’s valuation. \nPlaintiff points to a March 14, 2022 press release, a March 14, 2022 earnings  call, and a June \n16, 2022 conference. In th e March 2022 press release, the Comp any wrote: “We also continue \nto expect to close the acquisition of  GeneDx by the end of Q2, which will significantly \nenhance the power of our Centre llis® platform and distance us as the market leader with \nthe most comprehensive clinically releva nt data set availabl e for research and \ndevelopment purposes .” (Id. ¶ 55 (emphasis in citation).) Th e Company also touted Centrellis \nand the pending GeneDx acquisition, stating: Case 3:22-cv-01131-VDO     Document 54     Filed 07/31/24     Page 4 of 255 Combining GeneDx’s clinical genomi c solutions with our core women’s \nhealth business allows us to better serve health system and pharmaceutical \nand biotech partners in a more holistic way. This transaction will \nsignificantly enhance the power of our Centrellis database by adding more \nthan 2.1 million expertly curated pheno types and well over 300,000 clinical \nexomes that GeneDx ha s generated to date. Following the close of the \nacquisition, Sema4 will have the most co mprehensive clinically relevant data \nset available for our research and development purposes. \n(Id. ¶ 40 (emphasis in citation).) At the acco mpanying March 2022 conference call, while \ndiscussing financial results, Schadt stated, “We believe that Centrellis is the most extensive \nand fastest-growing database of clinically relevant patient data in the industry.” ( Id. ¶ 56.)  \nOn June 16, 2022, Stueland participated in the Goldman Sachs Global Healthcare \nConference, where she stated:  \nBut then when you think about the data engine, Centrellis , that Eric and the \nteam have expertly built. That is an incr edible combination of just being able to \nput a data engine that will be able to deliver improved and personalized \nhealth insights with our exome and genome as a backbone . That really \nenables something that is very differen t from any other company in this space. \nAnd I think that that really sets the f oundation for how we can work with health \nsystems and pharma companies to deliv er on the promise of personalized \nmedicine. \n(Id. ¶ 67 (emphasis added).)  \nRegarding the second category of statements , Plaintiff alleges th at Defendants made \nfalse statements related to the Company’s fina ncial reporting, which ar e found in the following \nsources: \n March 14, 2022 press release reporting on fourth quarter  and 2021 year-end results \n(id. ¶¶ 38, 55; ECF No. 50-2); \n March 14, 2022 conference call with analysts (FAC  ¶ 56); \n the 2021 10-K ( id. ¶ 57); \n May 12, 2022 press release reporting on first quarter 2022 results ( id. ¶ 65); Case 3:22-cv-01131-VDO     Document 54     Filed 07/31/24     Page 5 of 256  May 12, 2022 conference call ( id. ¶ 66); and \n June 16, 2022 Goldman Sachs Glob al Healthcare Conference. ( Id. ¶ 67). \nThe March 14, 2022 press release reporting on f ourth quarter and 2021 year-end results \nclaimed that “2021 was a tran sformative year during which we  grew our test volumes and \npatient database.” ( Id. ¶ 55.) It also stated that the Company experienced a “37% increase in \nfourth quarter test volumes… compared to th e same period last year” and noted “[r]ecord \nquarterly test volume.” ( Id.) It further stated that the Company’s increased revenue from \n$179.3 million in 2020 to $212.2 million in 2021 was “d riven primarily by an increase in \ntesting volumes of both our Women’s H ealth and Oncology product lines.” ( Id. ¶ 38.) \nAlso on March 14, 2022, at a conference call reporting on first quarter 2021 results, Ro \nstated that the Company was making positive pr ogress regarding reimbursements from health \nplans: \nI should also remind you that from a reimb ursement perspective, we had a bunch \nof irons in the fire this y ear to drive better payment so  that the revenue attached \nto our volume starts to catch  up. And if we do that, th at will also be important \nto improving our gross margin profile  in the second half of the year. \n(Id. ¶ 39.) On that call, Schadt reiterated Sema4’ s increasing test volumes at that conference \ncall, noting the “substantial prog ress advancing key initiatives as evidenced by the nearly \n83,000 resulted tests in the quarte r …. We are pleased to see ou r growing patient and provider \nengagement translate into increasing test volumes[.]” ( Id. ¶ 56.)  \nOn May 12, 2022, the Company a nnounced its first quarter re sults for 2022 and, in a \npress release, Schadt stated “We delivered record test volume and expanded engagement \nacross our health system partnerships.” ( Id. ¶ 43.) That May 12, 2022 re lease quoted Stueland \nas saying, Case 3:22-cv-01131-VDO     Document 54     Filed 07/31/24     Page 6 of 257 We have strong momentum that puts us  on a path to deliv er on our 2022 pro \nforma revenue target of $350 million …. Si nce closing the GeneDx acquisition, \nwe have streamlined our leadership team  and established a new, agile, operating \nmodel to drive growth, operating e fficiency, and the delivery of \ntransformational partnerships, all of which put us on a scalable path to \nprofitability. \n(Id. ¶ 65.) The Company also held a public conference call on May 12, 2022, where Ro \nsimilarly discussed its first quarter  2022 financial results, stating  \n[T]otal revenue in the first quarter was $50.1 million, up 4% year-on-year and \nup 6% versus the fourth quarter of 2 021. Regarding volumes, we achieved a new \nrecord this quarter …. This represents a 27% year-over-year increase versus the \nfirst quarter of 2021. Women’s Health  grew 23% and On cology grew 159%. \n(Id. ¶ 66.) In response to a question about where ASPs  were headed for the rest of the year, Ro \nstated: \nSo now that we’ve got a really significan t capability that we didn’t have just a \nfew quarters ago, we’re in a position to, I think, push on several fronts to drive \nbetter ASPs. \nOf course, on the oncology front, we’ve ta lked before about pushing forward \nwith reimbursement for somatic prof iling. That’s making good progress and on \ntrack with our plan to realize better reimbursement by the middle part of the \nyear. And then on the market access side, there’s just a huge universe of ways \nin which we can optimize our efforts in partnership with our commercial team, \nin partnership with payers, in partners hip with our health system partners, a \nwhole bunch of things that I would say,  together, should allo w us to, with the \nsame amount of volume like-for-like, drive better amounts of revenue and, \ntherefore, ASP. So I’m personally very  excited about the opportunity that we \nhave this year to drive improvement ther e. It’s a meaningful part of the gross \nmargin improvement strategy. \n(Id.) \nThen, on June 15, 2022, Stueland participated  in the Goldman Sachs Healthcare and, \nat an interview, stated that “there is top lin e growth in terms of volume, revenue and improved \nASPs.” ( Id. ¶ 67.) Stueland also noted that the Company is “taking a close look at how the \nbusiness is operating and ensuring that we’re really targeting revenue that is high-value Case 3:22-cv-01131-VDO     Document 54     Filed 07/31/24     Page 7 of 258 revenue[.]” ( Id.)  In response to being questioned about th e “areas of R&D that [she was] going \nto be focused on,” Stueland answered: \nSo I’ve now spent, I think, the past deca de in this space really and seeing what \nit takes from a building, scaling and sh aring genomic information standpoint \nand having worked now at 3 companies in  the genomic space. What I think is \nreally interesting about the Sema4 GeneDx combination? One, we have a \nleading reproductive health franchise on the Sema4 side of things.   \nTwo, GeneDx is bringing an incredible rare disease asset to bear, both in terms \nof our exome, our interpretation platform that is not only applicable to our \nexome, but to genome as well in addition to the rare disease dataset that we \nhave.  \nBut then when you think about the data engine, Centrellis, that Eric and \nthe team have expertly built . That is an incredible combination of just being \nable to put a data engine that will be able to deliver improved and personalized health insights with our exome and genome as a backbone. \nThat really enables something that is very different from any other \ncompany in this space.  And I think that that really sets the foundation for how \nwe can work with health systems a nd pharma companies to deliver on the \npromise of personalized medicine. \n(Id. (emphasis in original).) \n3. Alleged Revelations and Subseque nt Plummeting Stock Price \nOn August 15, 2022, it was announced that the Company had “reversed $30.1 million \nof revenue this quarter related to prior pe riods. This reversal was in connection with \nnegotiations with] one of [Sema4’s] larger  commercial payors regarding the potential \nrecoupment of payments for Se ma4 carrier screening services  rendered from 2018 to early \n2022.” ( Id. ¶ 47.) The Company also disclosed that it established a reserve of $39.2 million for \npotential recoupments of payments prev iously made by third-party payors: \nThe Company is currently engaged in di scussions with one of the Company’s \nthird-party payors regarding certain overpayments the Company allegedly \nreceived from the payor fo r services that the payor alleges are not covered by, \nor were not otherwise properly billed to, the payor. This payor has asserted in \ninformal discussions that it will seek rec overy or recoupment in relation to the Case 3:22-cv-01131-VDO     Document 54     Filed 07/31/24     Page 8 of 259 alleged overpayments if the matter cannot be se ttled. While the Company \nbelieves it has defenses to the payor’s allegations, it is currently engaged in \ndiscussions seeking to resolve the ma tter and any claim that may arise in \nconnection therewith in a mu tually satisfactory manner. \nAs a result of this matter, and in co nnection with a review of certain billing \npolicies and procedures undertaken  by management following the \nacquisition of GeneDx, the Company considered the need to establish reserves for potential recoupments of payments previously made by third-\nparty payors. As of June 30, 2022, the Company has established liabilities \nof $39.2 million as a result of this ma tter and other pote ntial settlements \nwith payors based on the current facts and an evaluation of anticipated \nresults that the Company believes reaso nable for all potential recoupments \nfor all third-party payors combined. \n(Id. ¶ 50 (emphasis in original ).) The Company updated its guidance in light of the \ndevelopments, including by “taking a more co nservative view on both volume and ASPs, but \nwe are revising our underlying assumptions at th e legacy GeneDx business up based off of the \ndemand we’re seeing for the whole suite of GeneDx’s products to date.” ( Id. ¶ 49.) The \nCompany lowered its fiscal 2022 revenue guida nce to a range of $245 million to $255 million, \ndown from its prior guidance range of $305 million to $315 million. ( Id. ¶ 48.) On this news, \nthe Company’s share price pl ummeted by $0.80, or 33.33%, to close at $1.60 per share on \nAugust 16, 2022. ( Id. ¶ 51.) \nThen, on November 14, 2022, it was disclosed to invest ors that the Company was \neliminating Sema4’s reproductiv e testing segment, which would include closing down \nSema4’s Stamford, CT laborator y and eliminating approximately  500 more employees—a 1/3 \nreduction of the Comp any’s workforce. ( Id. ¶ 52.) \nII. LEGAL STANDARD \nA party may move to dismiss a complaint for “fa ilure to state a claim upon which relief \ncan be granted[.]” Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). On a motion to  dismiss, all factual allegations in Case 3:22-cv-01131-VDO     Document 54     Filed 07/31/24     Page 9 of 2510 the complaint are accepted as true and all r easonable inferences are drawn in favor of the \nplaintiff. ECA & Loc. 134 IBEW Joint Pension Tr . of Chi. v. JP Morgan Chase Co. , 553 F.3d \n187, 196 (2d Cir. 2009). “To survive a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), a complaint \nmust plead enough facts to state a claim to  relief that is plausible on its face.” In Re Philip \nMorris Int’l Inc. Sec. Litig. , 89 F.4th 408, 416 (2d Cir. 2023). A claim is plausible “when the \nplaintiff pleads factual content th at allows the court to draw th e reasonable inference that the \ndefendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.” Ashcroft v. Iqbal , 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009).  \nMoreover, there are heightened pleading require ments where a plaintiff pleads securities fraud: \nPursuant to Rule 9(b), a complaint sounding in fraud also “must state with \nparticularity the circumstances constitu ting fraud,” Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(b), and \nunder the PSRLA, it must “specify each  statement alleged to have been \nmisleading[ ] [and] the reason . . . why th e statement is misleading,” and “state \nwith particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted \nwith the required state of mind,” 15 U.S.C. § 78u- 4(b)(1), (2)(A). \nIn re Philip Morris , 89 F.4th at 418. Therefore, allegatio ns “must do more than say that the \nstatements were false and misleading; they must demonstrate with specificity why and how \nthat is so.” Carpenters Pension Tr. Fund of St. Louis v. Barclays PLC , 750 F.3d 227, 236 (2d \nCir. 2014) (internal citation and quotation marks omitted). \nWhen considering a Rule 12(b )(6) motion, a district court “must consider the complaint \nin its entirety, as well as other sources courts ordinarily examin e when ruling on Rule 12(b)(6) \nmotions to dismiss, in particular, documents in corporated into the complaint by reference, and \nmatters of which a court ma y take judicial notice.” Tellabs, Inc. v. Makor Issues & Rts., Ltd. , \n551 U.S. 308, 322 (2007). “Even where a document is not inco rporated by reference, the court \nmay nevertheless consider it wher e the complaint ‘relies heavily  upon its terms and effect,’ Case 3:22-cv-01131-VDO     Document 54     Filed 07/31/24     Page 10 of 2511 which renders the document ‘i ntegral’ to the complaint.” Chambers v. Time Warner, Inc. , 282 \nF.3d 147, 153 (2d Cir. 2002) (i nternal citation omitted).   \nIII. DISCUSSION \nA. Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 Liability \nThe Exchange Act makes it unla wful for a party to “use or  employ, in connection with \nthe purchase or sale of any security  . . . any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance in \ncontravention of such rules and regulations  as the [Securities an d Exchange] Commission \n[“SEC”] may prescribe as necessary or appropriate  in the public interest  or for the protection \nof investors.” 15 U.S.C. § 78j(b). SEC Rule 10b–5 implements Section 10(b) of the Exchange \nAct by making it unlawful “[t]o make any untrue statement of a materi al fact or to omit to state \na material fact necessary in order to make the st atements made, in the light of the circumstances \nunder which they were made, not misleading. ” 17 CFR § 240.10b–5(b). Therefore, “[t]o state \na private securities -fraud claim under section 10(b) and Rule  10b-5, a plaintiff must plead ‘(1) \na material misrepresentation or  omission by the defendant; (2) scienter; (3) a connection \nbetween the misrepresentation or omission and the purchase or sale of a security; (4) reliance \nupon the misrepresentation or omission; (5 ) economic loss; and (6) loss causation.’” In Re \nPhilip Morris. , 89 F.4th at 417 (quoting Stoneridge Inv. Partners, LLC v. Sci.-Atlanta, Inc. , \n552 U.S. 148, 157 (2008)). \n1. Material Misrepresentation or Omission \nTo plausibly allege a material  representation or omission, th ere must be either a half-\ntruth or a false statement. Maso Cap. Invs. Ltd. v. E-House (China) Holdings Ltd. , No. 22-355, \n2024 WL 2890968, at *3 (2d Cir. June 10, 2024). “Sile nce, absent a duty to disclose, is not \nmisleading under Rule 10b–5” and, “[e]ven a duty to disclose, however, does not automatically Case 3:22-cv-01131-VDO     Document 54     Filed 07/31/24     Page 11 of 2512 render silence misleadi ng under Rule 10b–5(b).” Macquarie Infrastructure Corp. v. Moab \nPartners, L. P. , 601 U.S. 257, 265 (2024) (internal citation and quotation marks omitted). “A \npure omission occurs when a speaker says noth ing, in circumstances that do not give any \nparticular meaning to that silence.” Id. at 258. “Rule 10b–5(b) does not proscribe pure \nomissions.” Id. at 264. For omissions to become actionable half-truths, or “statements that are \nmisleading under the second prong of  Rule 10b–5 by virtue of wh at they omit to disclose,” In \nre Vivendi, S.A. Sec. Litig. , 838 F.3d 223, 239–40 (2d Cir.  2016), there must be \n“representations that state the truth only so  far as it goes, while omitting critical qualifying \ninformation.” Universal Health Servs., Inc. v. United States ex rel. Escobar , 579 U.S. 176, 188 \n(2016). “Disclosure is required . . . only when neces sary ‘to make statements made, in the light \nof the circumstances under which th ey were made, not misleading.’” Kleinman v. Elan Corp., \nplc, 706 F.3d 145, 153 (2d Cir. 2013) (alteration in original) (internal citation omitted). A false \nstatement is “an actual statement” that is “untrue outright.” In re Vivendi , 838 F.3d at 239. \nWhether a misstatement or omission2 by the defendant is material “depends on whether there \nis a substantial likelihood that a reasonable shareholder would cons ider it important in deciding \nhow to act.” ECA , 553 F.3d at 197. “To be ‘material’ with in the meaning of § 10(b), the alleged \nmisstatement must be sufficiently specific for an investor to reasonably rely on that statement as a guarantee of some concrete fact or outcome which, when it proves false or does not occur, \nforms the basis for a § 10(b) fraud claim.” City of Pontiac Policemen's  & Firemen’s Ret. Sys. \nv. UBS AG , 752 F.3d 173, 185 (2d Cir. 2014). \n \n2 Courts often use the term “omission” when refe rring to half-truth statem ents that fall under the \nsecond prong of Rule 10b–5. In re Vivendi , 838 F.3d at 240 n.9. Case 3:22-cv-01131-VDO     Document 54     Filed 07/31/24     Page 12 of 2513 a. Centrellis Statements \nPlaintiff asserts that statements regarding Centrellis were false and misleading because \nCentrellis was made up by Defend ants in hopes of increasing the Company’s valuation. (Pl. \nOpp. at 25.) Defendants argue that  the statements describing Centrellis have not been plausibly \nalleged to be false or mislead ing. In support of their argum ent, Defendants criticize the \ntestimony from a former employee (“FE-1”) named in the FAC, asserting that the testimony is \nconclusory and that he contradicts himself by acknowledging that “there was a piece of \ntechnology called Centrellis at the Company.” (Def s. Mem. at 30 (internal citation omitted).)  \nAs an initial matter, and contrary to the de fendants’ assertion, the Court may properly \nconsider the alleged testimony of FE-1. A co mplaint sufficiently pleads testimony from a \nconfidential witness when that source is described “with sufficient particularity to support the \nprobability that a person in the position occupied by the source would possess the information alleged.” N.J. Carpenters Health Fund v. Royal Bank of Scotland Grp., PLC , 709 F.3d 109, \n123 (2d Cir. 2013) (internal citation and quotati on marks omitted). Here, the FAC alleges that \nFE-1 was Senior Vice President, Production Bioinformatics at Sema4 from February 2020 \nthrough September 2022 and was responsible for all the data that came from the Company’s \nclinical testing operatio n. (FAC ¶ 22.) In his role, FE-1 an alyzed lab results through pipelines, \nincluding quality checks of samples, utilized t hose analyses into test results or diagnoses, \naccessed a dashboard that incl uded information about Compan y costs incurred to deliver \nservices, and reported to the Comp any’s Chief Data Officer.  ( Id.) Therefore, because it is \nprobable that FE-1 would have had access to information about Centrellis, the Court may credit \nFE-1’s testimony. Case 3:22-cv-01131-VDO     Document 54     Filed 07/31/24     Page 13 of 2514 FE-1’s testimony supports the claim that, if a reasonable investor viewed the \nCompany’s marketing materials or disclosures, it would be understood that there was a piece \nof technology called Centrellis that allo wed the Company to perform capabilities. ( Id. ¶¶ 58, \n69.) For example, in March 202 2, Schadt described Centrellis as “the most extensive and \nfastest-growing database of clinically relevant patient  data in the industry.” ( Id. ¶ 56.) The \nCompany also stated in a press release that th e GeneDx acquisition would establish “the power \nof our Centrellis® platform  and distance us as the market leader.” ( Id. ¶ 67.) In June 2022, \nStueland claimed Centrellis would “be able to  deliver improved and personalized health \ninsights with our exome and genome as a backbone[.]” ( Id. ¶ 55.) However, according to FE-\n1, Centrellis “never existed.” ( Id. ¶¶ 58, 69.) \nDefendants dispute the truth of these allegations, characterizing the claim that \nCentrellis did not exist to be “nonsense.” (Def s. Mem. at 30.) But the Court must accept as \ntrue the well-pleaded allegations. Drawing all r easonable inferences in the plaintiff’s favor, \nFE-1 testified that, while there was a piece of technology called Centrellis at the company, the \nreality is that Centre llis did not exist. ( Id. ¶¶ 58, 69.) These allegations support with \nparticularity the claim that statements  regarding Centrellis were misleading. \nb. Statements about Financial Results, ASPs, Test Volumes, \nand Reimbursements from Third-Party Payors \nPlaintiff also asserts that Defendants misled investors regarding the Company’s \nfinancial results, ASPs, test volumes, and reimbursements from third-party payors. To \nillustrate, regarding financial results, Plainti ff highlights statements from the March 2022 press \nrelease stating that “[t]otal re venue increased 24% in  the fourth quarter of 2021 . . . resulting \nin total revenue of $47.3 milli on compared to $38.2 million” ( id. ¶ 55); and the May 2022 press Case 3:22-cv-01131-VDO     Document 54     Filed 07/31/24     Page 14 of 2515 release stating that “total re venue for the first quarter of 2022 was $53.9 million” with “84,925 \nresulted tests.” ( Id. ¶ 65.) Regarding the remaining me trics, in the opposition memorandum, \nPlaintiff points to statements from the March 2022 press release stating that the Company experienced a “37% increase in fourth quarter test volumes… compared to the same period \nlast year” and “[r]ecord quarterly test volume” ( id. ¶ 38); and Ro’s May 2022 statement that \nreimbursement was “making good progress and on  track with our plan to realize better \nreimbursement by the middle part of the year” a nd “now that we’ve got a really significant \ncapability that we didn’t have just a few quarters ago, we’re in a position to … push on several \nfronts to drive better ASPs.” ( Id. ¶ 66.) Plaintiff asserts that th ese statements were fraudulent \nin light of the revelation on August 15, 2022, where the Company announc ed that “reversed \n$30.1 million of revenue this quarter related to pr ior periods” and that this reversal was in \nconnection with negotiations with one of the Company’s “larger commercial payors regarding \nthe potential recoupment of payments for Sema4 carrier screening serv ices rendered from 2018 \nto early 2022.” ( Id. ¶ 47.) The Company established a $39.2 million reserve to cover potential \nrecoupment disputes with other TSPs ( id. ¶ 50) and disclosed that the Company was “expecting \nfor the remainder of the year, at least double-di git sequential declines from 2Q into 3Q for \nthose ASPs.” ( Id. ¶ 48.)  \nDefendants argue that the challenged stat ements are not misleading because they are \neither: (1) accurate representations of the Co mpany’s revenue or test results, (2) forward-\nlooking statements covered by the PSLRA safe -harbor, or (3) non- actionable opinion or \npuffery. (Defs. Mem. at 25-30.) Th e Court agrees that Plaintiff has failed to plausibly allege \nany misleading or false statements regardin g financial results, ASPs, test volumes, and \nreimbursements. Case 3:22-cv-01131-VDO     Document 54     Filed 07/31/24     Page 15 of 2516 “[I]t bears emphasis that § 10(b) and Rule 10b–5(b) do not create an affirmative duty \nto disclose any and all material information. Disclosure is required under these provisions only \nwhen necessary to make ... statements made, in the light of the circumst ances under which they \nwere made, not misleading.”  Matrixx Initiatives, Inc. v. Siracusano , 563 U.S. 27, 44 (2011) \n(internal citation and quotation marks omitted). Plaintiff does not  allege that the financial \nresults, ASPs, test volumes, and reimbursements we re false. Instead, Plaintiff asserts that, by \nchoosing to release positive outlooks on these me trics, the failure to disclose that the \nCompany’s business practices as being allegedl y unsustainable and unprofitable made these \nstatements become actionable half-truths. (Pl. Opp. at 24.) \nHere, contrary to Plaintiff’s characterizati ons of Defendants’ public disclosures, the \nrecord is clear that Defendants disclosed that there was considerable risk to the Company’s \nbusiness model. The Company disclosed in the 2021 10-K that the business “is subject to a \nnumber of risks and uncertainties,” including: \nIf third-party payors, including managed care organizations, private health \ninsurers and government health plans, do not provide adequate reimbursement \nfor our tests, or seek to amend or renegotiate their fee reimbursement schedules, \nor if we are unable to comply with their requirements for reimbursement, our \ncommercial success could be negatively affected. \n(ECF No. 50-4 at 18.) The Company also disc losed the challenges in complying with the \nprocedural requirements for reimbursements with th ird-party payors and th at there were audits \nof the amounts paid to the company: \nWe have also experienced, and may continue  to experience, delays in or denials \nof coverage if we do not adequately comply with … requirements. Our third-\nparty payors have also requested, and in the future may request, audits of the \namounts paid to us. We have been requi red to repay certain amounts to payers \nas a result of such audits, and we could be adversely affected if we are required \nto repay other payers for alleged overpayments due to  lack of compliance with \ntheir reimbursement policies. Case 3:22-cv-01131-VDO     Document 54     Filed 07/31/24     Page 16 of 2517 (Id. at 22.) The Company further disclosed that “each payor makes its own decision” as to \nwhether it will provide reimbursement  and the reimbursement rate ( id. at 30), and that “third-\nparty payors often attempt to, or  do in fact, amend or renegotia te their fee for reimbursement \nschedules,” resulting in a “[l]oss of revenue.” ( Id. at 22.) The Company also cautioned the \npublic by disclosing that “[w]e cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to obtain and \nmaintain third-party coverage or adequate reimbursement for our products and services in \nwhole or in part.” ( Id. at 17.)  \nThus, reviewed in the context of the Comp any’s disclosures, a reasonable investor \nwould not have been misled with the statemen ts regarding financial results, ASPs, test \nvolumes, and reimbursements from third-party pa yors. Disclosure of additional information \nwas not necessary, “in the light of the circumst ances under which [the statements] were made” \nto make the challenged statements not misleading. Matrixx Initiatives, Inc. , 563 U.S. at 47. \nThese statements are therefore not actionable under the Exchange Act. See In re Morgan \nStanley Info. F und Sec. Litig. , 592 F.3d 347, 366 (2d Cir. 2010) (“Th e literal truth of an isolated \nstatement is insufficient; the proper inquiry requires an examination of ‘defendants’ representations, taken together and in context.’”) (internal citation omitted); see also Olkey v. \nHyperion 1999 Term Trust , 98 F.3d 2, 9 (2d Cir. 1996) (“Si nce the plaintiffs’ claims are \ncontradicted by the disclosure of  risk made on the face  of each prospectus , no set of additional \nfacts could prove the plaintiffs’ claims.”).  \nEven if there was an omission of a material fact necessary to make the statements not \nmisleading, the Court finds that the statem ents about reimbursements and ASPs are not \nactionable because they are, at least in part , forward-looking. A forward-looking statement \nincludes “a statement of the plans and objectives of management fo r future opera tions” or “any Case 3:22-cv-01131-VDO     Document 54     Filed 07/31/24     Page 17 of 2521 As an initial matter, Plaintiff fails to esta blish scienter on a defendant-by-defendant \nbasis consistent with the particul arity requirement of the PSLRA. In re Aceto Corp. Sec. Litig. , \nNo. 2:18-CV-2425 (ERK) (AYS ), 2019 WL 3606745, at *8 (E.D .N.Y.

Rule 9(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil \nProcedures requires that “[i]n a case involving  multiple defendants, pl aintiffs must plead \ncircumstances providing a factual basis for scie nter for each defendant; guilt by association is \nimpermissible.” In re DDAVP Direct Purchaser Antitrust Litig. , 585 F.3d 677, 695 (2d Cir. \n2009). The FAC here improperly treats the defenda nts as an undifferentia ted group in alleging \nscienter. See, e.g. , FAC ¶¶ 100 (“Defendants were thus motivated to artificially inflate the \nCompany’s share price in order to raise much-n eeded capital needed to finance and close the \nGeneDx acquisition.”). The allegations concer ning Stueland illustrate this problem. While \nPlaintiff contends that Defend ants were motivated to inflat e the Company’s stock price to \nacquire GeneDx, Stueland did not join the Company until after it closed the GeneDx \nacquisition on May 2, 2022. ( Id. ¶¶ 13, 101.) Moreover, Stue land was the CEO and a \nstockholder of GeneDx at the time of the acquisition, and thus would not have been a \nperpetrator of  the fraud.  \nAdditionally, even if Plaintiff pled the circ umstances regarding fraud with particularity \non a defendant-by-defendant basis, the allegations  fail to raise a strong inference of scienter. \nRegarding Plaintiff’s first, second, and third contentions, “it is well established in this Circuit \nthat the Lead Plaintiff’s allegations concerni ng Defendants’ alleged de sire to maintain the \n‘artificial’ high price of the stock and to be pr ofitable is not sufficie nt to plead scienter.” \nSaskatchewan Healthcare Emp.’s Pe nsion Plan v.

Regarding \nPlaintiff’s fourth contention, an alleged  motive to protect execu tive compensation is “too \ngeneralized to demonstrate sc ienter” as it is “c ommon to all corporate executives.” Kalnit , 264 \nF.3d at 139.  \nFinally, Plaintiff’s reliance on circumstantial evidence do not adequately show scienter. \n“Where motive is not apparent, it is still possible to plead scienter by identifying circumstances \nindicating conscious behavior by the defendant.” Id. at 142. “Courts may look to circumstances \nsuch as whether defendants (1 ) benefitted in a concrete and personal way from the purported \nfraud; (2) engaged in deliberately illegal behavi or; (3) knew facts or had access to information \nsuggesting that their public statements were not accurate; or (4) failed to check information they had a duty to monitor.” Hills v. BioXcel Therapeutics, Inc. , No. 3:23-CV-00915 (SVN), \n2024 WL 3374145, at *19 (D. Conn. July 11, 2024) (internal citation and quotation marks \nomitted).   \nFirst, Plaintiff contends that testim ony from former employees support a strong \ninference of scienter (Pl. Opp. at 37.) But there is only one former employee, FE-1, who \nprovides information about the ex istence of Centrellis. Absent from the FAC are allegations \nregarding FE-1’s interactions with the Individual  Defendants that involved Centrellis and thus, \nwhile FE-1’s testimony is probativ e regarding the falsity of the a lleged statement, they are not \nprobative of Defendants’ mental state. Sun v. TAL Educ. Grp. , No. 22-CV-01015 (ALC), 2023 \nWL 6394413, at *31 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 29, 2023) (find ing conclusory allegations regarding \nconfidential witness to  be insufficient to  show scienter).  \nMoreover, Plaintiff contends that Defenda nts’ exposure to information within the \nCompany bolster the inference of scienter. (P l. Opp. at 41-42.) But this position, unsupported Case 3:22-cv-01131-VDO     Document 54     Filed 07/31/24     Page 22 of 2523 by any allegation regarding the content of the inte rnal documents, is in sufficient to raise the \nrequisite inference of scienter. See Teamsters Local 445 Freight Div. Pension Fund v. Dynex \nCap. Inc. , 531 F.3d 190, 196 (2d Cir. 2008) (allegations that senior executives “had access to \n‘collection data’” that re vealed certain undisclosed facts were insufficient); IKB Int’l S.A. v. \nBank of Am. Corp. , 584 F. App’x 26, 28 (2d Cir. 2014) (“[Plaintiff’s] complaint does not \nspecifically identify the contem poraneous [] reports containing inconsistent information”). \nBecause Plaintiff does not “specifically identif y the reports or statements containing” the \ninformation suggesting the inaccuracy of the ch allenged Centrellis statements, Plaintiff has \nfailed to allege scienter. Jackson v. Abernathy , 960 F.3d 94, 99 (2d Cir. 2020).  \nTherefore, viewing the allegations as a whol e, the Court finds that Plaintiff fails to \nadequately allege sc ienter sufficient to survive dismissal. \n3. Loss Causation \nThe PSLRA “codified loss causation as a separate element of federal securities fraud \nactions.” Loreley Fin. (Jersey) No. 3 Ltd. v. Wells Fargo Sec., LLC , 797 F.3d 160, 187 (2d Cir. \n2015) (citing 15 U.S.C. § 78 u–4(b)(4)). Loss causation “is the causal link between the alleged \nmisconduct and the economic harm ultima tely suffered by the plaintiff.” Emergent Cap. Inv. \nMgmt., LLC v. Stonepath Grp. , Inc. , 343 F.3d 189, 197 (2d Cir. 2003). “To plead loss \ncausation, plaintiffs must allege ‘that the subj ect of the fraudulent statement or omission was \nthe cause of the actual loss suffered.’” Carpenters , 750 F.3d at 232 (quoting Suez Equity Inv’rs, \nL.P. v. Toronto–Dominion Bank , 250 F.3d 87, 95 (2d Cir. 2001)). A plaintiff “may do so either \nby alleging (a) the existence of cause-in-fact on the ground that  the market reacted negatively \nto a corrective disclosure of the fraud; or (b) that that the lo ss was foreseeable and caused by \nthe materialization of the risk c oncealed by the fraudulent statement.” Id. (internal citation and Case 3:22-cv-01131-VDO     Document 54     Filed 07/31/24     Page 23 of 2524 quotation marks omitted). The burden to plead loss causation “is not a heavy one.” Loreley \nFin. (Jersey) No. 3 Ltd. , 797 F.3d at 187. \nConsidering the above conclusions, the C ourt need not address whether Plaintiff \nplausibly alleged loss causation because none of  the alleged misstatements or omissions can \nsurvive a motion to dismiss. See Onel v. Top Ships, Inc. , 806 F. App’x 64, 68 n.4 (2d Cir. 2020) \n(“Because we agree with the district court that  dismissal is warranted due to the Complaint’s \nfailure to allege a manipulative act, we do not reach the  []  defendants’ alternative argument[] \n… that the Complaint fails to adeq uately allege … loss causation.”). \nB. Section 20(a) Liability \n“To establish a prima facie  case of control person liability, a plaintiff must show (1) a \nprimary violation by the controlle d person, (2) control of the pr imary violator by the defendant, \nand (3) that the defendant was, in some mean ingful sense, a culpable participant in the \ncontrolled person’s fraud.” ATSI Commc’ns, Inc. v. Shaar Fund, Ltd. , 493 F.3d 87, 108 (2d \nCir. 2007). \nHere, “[b]ecause the Court has found that Pl aintiff[] fail[s] to state a claim under \nSection 10(b), their Section 20(a) claim necessarily also fails.” Hills , 2024 WL 3374145, at \n*20. Plaintiff’s Section 20(a) claims against the Individual Defendants are therefore dismissed \nfor failure to state a claim. IV. CONCLUSION  \nFor the reasons described above, Defendants’ motion to dismiss (ECF No. 50) is \nGRANTED . Plaintiff’s request to amend the complaint (ECF No. 51 at 47) is GRANTED . \nWithin thirty (30) days  of this Order, Plaintiff may file a Second Amended Complaint. \nPlaintiff must also file a re dline comparison of the First and Second Amended Complaints.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**:  \n   In the derivative action, shareholders of Cerence, Inc. accused the company's directors and officers of violating the Exchange Act through insider trading and breach of fiduciary duty related to the manipulation of revenue from fixed contracts meant to inflate short-term earnings. The court granted the defendants' motion to dismiss because the plaintiffs failed to make a pre-suit demand on the board, which would have been necessary unless it could be shown to be futile, a standard the plaintiffs did not meet. The case involves artificial intelligence as Cerence builds AI-powered virtual assistants.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**:  \n   The central legal issue is whether the plaintiffs' failure to make a pre-suit demand on Cerence's board can be excused as futile under Delaware law, considering alleged breaches of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment claims.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**:  \n   The court held that plaintiffs did not sufficiently demonstrate that making a pre-suit demand on the board would have been futile, as they failed to allege that a majority of the board members faced a substantial likelihood of liability. Consequently, the defendants' motion to dismiss was granted.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**:  \n   Imagine if you had your savings in a group fund, and a few people in charge of the fund started doing sneaky things to make the money look bigger. If some other members wanted to sue these people, they first had to ask the group if they wanted to take action first. In this case, the members trying to sue didn't do that important step or convincingly prove it would have been pointless. That's why their case got thrown out before it began. Also, there's some tech-talk about the company dealing with smart computer assistants in cars.",

(“Cerence” or “the Company”) and nine of its \nofficers and directors (the “Individual Defendants,” and, collectively with Cerence, \n“Defendants”), alleging violations of various provisions of the Exchange Act, as well as claims \nfor breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, and insider trading.  See generally  [ECF No. 18-\n3 (“Consolidated Amended Complaint ” or “CAC ”)].  B efore the Court is Defendants’ motion to \ndismiss  the Consolidated Amended Complaint asserting that Plaintiffs failed to make the \nrequisite pre-suit demand on the Company’s Board and that the Consolidated Amended \nComplaint fails to state a claim for relief .  [ECF No. 39].  Because Plaintiffs failed to make a \ndemand , Defendants ’ motion is GRANTED.  \nI. BACKGROUND  \nA. Procedural History  \nThe instant consolidated action originated as two related derivative cases.  On May 10 \nand 12, 2022, res\npectively, Pl aintiffs William Shafer and Peter Morse filed verified shareholder \nderivative complaints on behalf of nominal Defendant Cerence against various current and \nformer officers and directors.  [ECF No. 1] ; see also  Morse v. Dhawan et al. , No. 1:22- cv-01073 Case 1:22-cv-10723-ADB     Document 47     Filed 06/18/25     Page 1 of 222 \n \n (D. Mass.) .  On Jun e 10, 2022, the parties stipulated to the consolidation of the two derivative \ncases, and the Court endorsed  the stipulation.  [ECF Nos. 13, 14].  The same day, the parties \nstipulated to stay ing the consolidated action pending the outcome of the Company’s anticipated \nmotion to dismiss in a related securities class action, City of Miami Firefighters’ & Police \nOfficers’ Retirement Tr. v. Cerence Inc. , No. 1:22-10321 (D. Mass.)  (the “Securities Action”) ; \n[ECF No. 15].  In accord with the stipulation, t he Court stayed the consolidated action on June \n27, 2022.  [ECF No. 16].  On September 12, 2023, during the stay, Plaintiffs filed the operative \nConsolidated Amended Complaint.  See generally  [CAC].   \nAnother derivative case was filed in Delaware Court of Chancery on August 17, 2023,  \nFleming v. Dhawan, No. 2023-0845 (Del. Ch.) (the “Delaware Action”), with substantially \nsimilar allegations.  The Delaware Action was also stayed pending the decision on the motion to dismiss in the Securities Action.  [ECF No. 32- 5].  \nOn March 25, 2024, the Court entered an order  gra\n nting in part and denying in part \nDefendants’ motion to dismiss the Securities Action.  City of Miami Fire Fighters’ & Police \nOfficers’ Ret. Tr. v. Cerence Inc. , No. 22- cv-10321, 2024 WL 1258149, at *18 (D. Mass. Mar. \n25, 2024) (“ Cerence I ”).  The order dismissed all but three alleged misstatements.  Id.1  As a \nresult, the stay in this action was lifted, and the Court ordered briefing on whether the action should be dismissed in light of any relevant forum-selection clause.  [ECF No. 29].  Defendants filed their motion to dismiss on May 24, 2024, [ECF No. 30], which Plaintiffs opposed on June 7, 2024, [ECF No. 33].  The Court denied Defendants’ motion to dismiss under the applicable forum -selection clause on December 20, 2024.  [ECF No. 34].  \n \n \n1 The Securities Action was ultimately settled, with this Court approving that settlement on \nDecember 18, 2024.  [ECF No. 41-20].  Case 1:22-cv-10723-ADB     Document 47     Filed 06/18/25     Page 2 of 223 \n \n Defendants filed the present motion to dismiss  the Consolidated Amended Complaint on \nFebruary 3, 2025, [ECF No. 39], Plaintiffs opposed on March 20, 2025, [ECF No. 43], and \nDefendants filed a further reply in support of their motion on April 3, 2025, [ECF No. 45].  \nB. Factual Background \n The following facts are taken from the Consolidated Amended Complaint, the well -\nplead\ned factual allegations of which are assumed to be true when considering a motion to \ndismiss , see Ruivo v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., 766 F.3d 87, 90 (1st Cir. 2014) , as well as  \n“documents incorporated by reference in [the complaint], matters of public record, and other matters susceptible to judicial notice.”\n2  Giragosian v. Ryan, 547 F.3d 59, 65 (1st Cir. 2008) \n(alteration in original) (quoting In re Colonial Mortg. Bankers Corp., 324 F.3d 12, 20 (1st Cir. \n2003)). \n \n \n2 Of note, Plaintiffs appear to contend that this Court cannot consider the exhibits Defendants \nattached to their motion to dismiss unless the motion is converted into one for summary \njudgment.  [ECF No. 43 at 10, n.5]; see also  [ECF No. 43- 1 ¶¶ 4–6].  This is incorrect.  \nDefendants’ exhibits consist of Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) filings, earnings call transcripts and press releases, earnings video presentations, and documents referenced in Plaintiffs’  complaint, which Cerence produced pursuant to Del. Code Ann. tit. 8, § 220, \npermitting stockholders to make a written demand to inspect a corporation’s “books and records” for certain purposes.  Del. Code Ann. tit. 8, § 220.  As it may, the  Court takes  judicial notice of \nthe public SEC filings, earnings call transcripts, and press releases under Federal Rule of Evidence 201(b)(2).  See  Metzler Inv. GMBH v. Corinthian Colleges, Inc., 540 F.3d 1049, 1064 \nn.7 (9th Cir. 2008); see also  Primo v. Pac. Biosciences of Cal., Inc., 940 F.Supp.2d 1105, 1115 \nn.1 (N.D. Cal. 2013) (taking judicial notice of earnings call transcripts because they are “capable of immediate determination by resort to accurate sources and not subject to reasonable dispute”); In re Bare Escentuals, Inc. Sec. Litig. , 745 F. Supp. 2d 1052, 1067 (N.D. Cal. 2010) (“The court \nis also permitted to take judicial notice of the content of relevant public disclosure documents required to be filed with the SEC, as well as of press releases and conference call transcripts cited in the complaint.”).  It also takes judicial notice of the §  220 documents as incorporated by \nreference , given that they are discussed at length in the Consolidated Amended Complaint, [CAC \n¶¶ 71–92], and Plaintiffs do not dispute their authenticity.  Watterson v. Page, 987 F.2d 1, 3 (1st \nCir. 1993).   Case 1:22-cv-10723-ADB     Document 47     Filed 06/18/25     Page 3 of 224 \n \n The Court writes  fo r the parties  and assumes the reader ’s familiarity with the facts of this \naction , which it has set out in detail in its order  on the motion to dismiss the Securities Action  \nand which are incorporated herein.  Cerence I , 2024 WL 1258149, at *1–7.  The following \nsupplements that prior writing with facts relevant to this derivative action.  \n1. Cerence, Defendants, and the Demand Board  \nNominal Defendant Cerence is a Delaware corporation headquartered in Burlington, \nMassachusetts which builds artificial intelligence -powered virtual assistants, and it derives most \nof its revenue from selling software licenses for its technology which is integrated into \nautomobiles .  [CAC ¶¶ 30, 41–47].  It became a public company on October 1, 2019 as the result \nof a tax -free spin- off from Nuance Communications, Inc.  [ Id. ¶ 30].  \nThe Individual Defendants are nine of the Company’s current and form er executive \nofficers and directors.  [CAC ¶¶ 1, 31–39].  Sanjay Dhawan was President, Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”), and a member of the Board from the spin-off until he resigned on December 15, 2021.  [ Id. ¶ 31].  Mark Gallenberger was Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”)  from the spin- off \nuntil his retirement in March 2022.  [ Id. ¶ 32].  Stefan Ortmanns was Cerence’s Executive Vice \nPresident for its Core Product business group until he succ eeded Dhawan as President and CEO \nin December 2021, and he was a member of the Board when this action was filed on May 10, 2022.  [ Id. ¶ 34].  Tom Beaudoin served on Cerence’s Board as a director throughout the relevant \ntime period and also became Cerence’s CFO on May 5, 2022.  [ Id. ¶ 35].  The remaining \nDefendants (Arun Sarin, Marianne Budnik, Sanjay Jha, Kristi Ann Matus, and Alfred Nietzel) were independent, outside members of the Board  when this action was filed on May 10, 2022.  \n[Id. ¶¶ 33, 36–39, 172 n.3].  The seven Individual Defendants who were serving on the Board at Case 1:22-cv-10723-ADB     Document 47     Filed 06/18/25     Page 4 of 225 \n \n the time this action was filed, 3 along with non-party Douglas Davis, are known as the “Demand \nBoard.”  [ Id. ¶ 173]. \n2. Fixed and Variable Licenses  and the “Pull- Forward” Scheme  \nAs discussed at length in the Securities Action, Cerence’s licensing business is divided \ninto “variable” and “fixed” license agreements.  [CAC ¶¶  7, 48].  Pursuant to variable license \nagreements, Cerence receives quarterly “royalty reports” from customers detailing the number of \nlicenses  utilized, and, using these royalty reports, Cerence charges the customer on a “pay- as-\nyou-go” basis and recognizes the revenue in the subsequent quarter.  [ Id. ¶ 5].  Fixed license \ndeals, on the other hand, require customers to purchase upfront a predetermined quantity of licenses, typically at a discount, and Cerence recognizes the revenue at the time of signing.  [ Id. \n¶ 6].  Cerence utilizes two types of fixed license deals: 1) traditional “prepaid” deals, which require customers to pay the discounted rate in full and up front, [id.], and 2) “minimum \ncommitment” deals, which Cerence introduced in 2021 and which, while requiring customers to commit to purchase a certain quantity of licenses within a fixed time period, permit the customer to pay for the licenses when they are actually utilized, [ id. ¶¶  12–13].  \nAlthough fixed agreements have the benefit of providing immediate revenue, they also \nleave the customer with a large inventory of licenses, hindering further purchases until that stock is depleted.  [ CAC  ¶ 7].  As a result, fixed license agreements curtail future demand for licenses, \nnegatively impacting  revenue flow and the Company’s prospective financial performance.  [ Id.].  \nVariable license deals, by contrast, provide for consistent and predictable revenue flow, making them Cerence’s preferred method fo r generating revenue.  [ Id. ¶¶ 5, 48].   \n \n \n3 For clarity, those Individual Defendants again are: Ortmanns, Beaudoin, Sarin, Budnik, Jha, \nMatus, Nietzel .  Case 1:22-cv-10723-ADB     Document 47     Filed 06/18/25     Page 5 of 226 \n \n Both the Securities Action and this derivative action center on the same general alleged \nmis\nconduct, namely that by November 2020, because of threats to revenue caused by a global \nsemiconductor shortage, the Individual Defendants were artificially inflating the Company’s \nshort-term revenues by 1) pushing customers into fixed contracts  and 2) converting existing \nvariable contracts to fixed contracts.  [CAC ¶¶ 8, 58].  This “pull- forward” scheme permitted the \nIndividual Defendants to recognize more revenue up front, tout revenue growth to the market, and claim that Cerence outperformed financial expectations in fiscal year 2021, while, \nunbeknownst to investors, current and future variable licenses were being cannibalized, harming long- term revenue prospects .  [Id.].  \n3. Communications with the Board  \nOne way this case differs from the Securities Action is that Plaintiffs have made \nadditional allegations concerning communications with the Board about fixed contracts.  [CAC ¶¶ 71–87].  These allegations incorporate by reference Board materials that Cerence produced to Plaintiffs pursuant to 8 Del. Code Ann. tit. 8, § 220.  \nThe Company’s Board and its Audit Committee —whic\n h was responsible for, among \nother things, oversight and monitoring of the Company’s financial statements , internal \naccounting, and financial controls, [CAC ¶ 162]— met quarterly , [id. ¶¶  72–74 (January 20, 2021 \nBoard and Audit Committee meetings); ¶  75 (April 28, 2021 Audit Committee meeting); ¶ 76 \n(April 29, 2021 Board meeting); ¶ 77 (August 3, 2021 Audit Committee meeting); ¶ 78 (August 4, 2021 Board meeting); ¶¶ 79–83 (November 8, 2021 Audit Committee meeting); ¶ 84 (November 11, 2021 Board meeting)].  At these meetings, the Board and the Audit Committee  \ndiscussed and received presentations regarding the Company’s preliminary financial results for Case 1:22-cv-10723-ADB     Document 47     Filed 06/18/25     Page 6 of 227 \n \n each quarter and key financial metrics .  Specifically, the Consolidated Amended Complaint \nalleges that the Board and the Audit Committee received the following information:  \n• At the January 2021 meetings, the Board and Audit Committee received data indicating \ntha\nt “Cerence was experiencing difficulties signing new business” but that, despite this, \n“[r]evenue grew to $65.0 million.”  [ CAC  ¶¶ 72–74].  The Board was told that the \nCompany “expect[ed] recovery in Q2.”  [ Id.].   \n \n• At the April 2021 meetings, the Board and Audit Committee received data indicating that “booki\nngs were well below plan” and that revenue for variable licenses was “flat to \nQ121.”  [ CAC ¶¶ 75 –76].  They also learned that, despite these struggles, revenue \nincreased over the prior quarter , which was “driven by fixed license (+$4.5M) [and] \nvariable license (+$6M), offset by decrease in Pro Services ( -$3M).”  [ Id.].  \n \n• At the August 2021 meetings, the Board and Audit Committee were informed that Cerence had “[e]xceeded all financial metrics” for the third quarter of 2021, that this was driven in part by fixed contracts, and that the variable license royalties continued to stagger “due to semi -chip shortage.”  [CAC ¶  77]. \n \n• At the November 2021 meeting, the Board and Audit Committee were informed that Q4 rev\nenue “increased 7% year -over-year,” which was “mainly driven by increase in fixed \nlicense (+$8M), and 1-time Apple deal (+$5.2M).”  [CAC ¶ 79] ; see also  [id. ¶ 80 (Board \nwas told that the “ [f]ixed license deals were driven by 2 Minimum Commitment deals \n[with] Elektrobit ($12M) and Pioneer ($10M) ”].  The Board  presentations also noted that \nthe increased revenue was in part  “due to higher than expected prepays/min commit deals \nin FY21,” as well as  “[c]annibalization” of variable deals , which “increase[ed] by \n$28M.”  [Id. ¶ 83].   \n  These presentations to the Board also broke down the proportion of revenue that was \nattributable to  fixed license agreements , which mirrored what the Company disclosed to \ninvestors in earnings calls  around the same time.

The Board, like investors, was also told that the Company was targeting, at most,  $50 million  in fixed contracts in fiscal year 2021, and, when fixed revenue \ngreatly exceeded this threshold for fiscal year 2021, it was informed that the Company was aiming to decrease fixed revenue in fiscal year  2022.

[CAC ¶ 141].  The 2021 Proxy solicited shareholder votes in favor of four management proposals, including, as relevant to the Consolidated Amended Complaint, 1) the election of Sarin, Matus, and Ortmanns to new terms as directors and 2) an advisory vote on executive compensation.  [ Id.].  \nAs part of the advisory vote on executive compensation, the 2021 Proxy informed \nstockholders that executive compensation was comprised of a base salary and awards under the Company’s Short- Term Incentive Plan (“STIP ”) and Long-Term Equity Incentive Plan, which in Case 1:22-cv-10723-ADB     Document 47     Filed 06/18/25     Page 8 of 229 \n \n turn were based on achie ving certain financial targets.  [CAC ¶  143]; see also  [id. ¶ 144 (“The \nSTIP was intended to ‘[f]ocus executives on achieving annual financial and non- financial results \nthat are key indicators of annual financial and operational performance[.]’”)].  The 2021 Proxy \nfurther stated that management had achieved 107% of the revenue target and 88% of the bookings target for the year.  [ Id. ¶ 145].  Based on the weighted average payout of achieving \nthese targets, Defendants Dhawan, Gallenbe rger, and Ortmanns were awarded STIP bonuses for \nfiscal year 2021.  [ Id. ¶¶ 145, 147].  Defendants Sarin, Matus, and Ortmanns were also reelected \nto new terms as directors.  [ Id. ¶ 147].  \nII. STANDARD OF REVIEW  \nA. Rule 12(b)(6)  \nOn a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), the Court \nmust\n accept as true all well -pleaded facts, analyze them in the light most favorable to the \nplaintiff, and draw all reasonable inferences from those facts in favor of the plaintiff.  United \nStates ex rel. Hutcheson v. Blackstone Med., Inc., 647 F.3d 377, 383 (1st Cir. 2011).  \nAdditionally, “a court may not look beyond the facts alleged in the complaint, documents incorporated by reference therein and facts susceptible t o judicial notice.”  MIT Fed. Credit \nUnion v. Cordisco, 470 F. Supp. 3d 81, 84 (D. Mass. 2020) (citing Haley v. City of Bos., 657 \nF.3d 39, 46 (1st Cir. 2011)).  “[A] complaint must provide ‘a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief[,]’” Cardigan Mountain Sch. v. N.H. Ins. Co., \n787 F.3d 82, 84 (1st Cir. 2015) (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2)), and set forth “factual allegations, either direct or inferential, respecting each material element necessary to sustain recovery under some actionable legal theory,” Pitta v. Medeiros, 90 F.4th 11, 17 (1st Cir. 2024) \n(quoting Gagliardi v. Sullivan, 513 F.3d 301, 305 (1st Cir. 2008)).  Although detailed factual Case 1:22-cv-10723-ADB     Document 47     Filed 06/18/25     Page 9 of 2210 \n \n allegations are not required, a complaint must set forth “more than labels and conclusions,” Bell \nAtl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007), and “[t]hreadbare recitals of the elements of a \ncause of action, supported by mere conclusory statements, do not suffice,” Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 \nU.S. 662, 678 (2009).  Rather, a complaint “must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as \ntrue, to ‘state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.’”  Id. (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at \n570). \nB. Rule 23.1 and Demand Futility  \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 23.1 imposes an additi onal pleading requirement on \nplaintiffs in stockholder derivative action.  Specifically, Rule 23.1 institutes a “demand requirement,” requiring the shareholder to “allege with particularity either that a satisfactory pre -\nsuit demand was presented to, and refused by, the board of directors or the reasons such a demand would have been futile.”  Unión de Empleados de Muelles de Puerto Rico PRSSA \nWelfare Plan v. UBS Fin. Servs. Inc. of Puerto Rico, 704 F.3d 155, 163 (1st Cir. 2013); cf.  \nKamen v. Kemper Fin. Servs., Inc., 500 U.S. 90, 96 (1991) (“Rule 23.1 clearly contemplates \nboth the demand requirement and the possibility that demand may be excused . . . .” (emphasis omitted)) .  “[T]he circumstances in which a demand is required or, conversely, excused are \ndetermined by reference to the law of the state in which the corporation is incorporated.”  Unión \nde Empleados, 704 F.3d at 163.  Where, as here, that state is Delaware, the court “must decide, \nas a matter of law, whether a pre- suit demand was necessary” or whether the demand was \nexcused because it would have been futile (often referred to as “demand futility”).  Yu Liang v. \nBerger , No. 13- cv-12816, 2015 WL 1014525, at *5 (D. Mass. Mar. 9, 2015).  \nPlaintiffs in this case chose not to make a pre-suit demand.  As such, the question under \nRule 23.1 is whether demand is excused because it was  futile.  Under Delaware law , to Case 1:22-cv-10723-ADB     Document 47     Filed 06/18/25     Page 10 of 2211 \n \n successfully allege demand futility, a plaintiff must plead  “on  a director -by-director basis,” that \n“at least half of the members” of the board of directors  at the time the suit was initiated (or, the \n“Demand B oard”) either: (i) “ received a material personal benefit from the alleged misconduct \nthat is the subject of the litigation demand ;” (ii) “ faces a substantial likelihood of liability on any \nof the claims that would be the subject of the litigation demand;” or (iii) “ lacks independence \nfrom someone who received a material personal benefit from the alleged misconduct that would \nbe the subject of the litigation demand or who would face a substantial likelihood of liability on any of the claims that are the subject of the litigation demand .”  United Food & Com. Workers \nUnion & Participating Food Indus. Emps. Tri-State Pension Fund v. Zuckerberg, 262 A.3d 1034, \n1059 (Del. 2021).  In so pleading, “the plaintiff must comply with stringent requirements of factual particularity that differ substantially from permissive notice pleadings,” pursuant to which “conclusionary allegations of fact or law not supported by allegations of specific fact may not be taken as true.”  IBEW Loc. Union 481 Defined Contribution Plan & Tr. on Behalf of \nGoDaddy, Inc. v. Winborne, 301 A.3d 596, 617 (Del. Ch. 2023) (cleaned up).   \nIII. DISCUSSION  \nA. Demand Futility  \nDefendants move to dismiss Plaintiffs’ Consolidated Amended Complaint on the grounds \nthat Pla\nintiffs  have failed to adequately allege that a pre-suit litigation demand on Cerence’s \nBoard would have been futile.  [ECF No. 40 at 18].  Specifically, Defendants assert that 1) “Plaintiffs cannot establish demand futility based on a lack of independence, because they do not even challenge the independence of six out of eight Demand Board members ,” [id. at 18 –20]; 2) \nthe Consolidated Amended Complaint “does not expressly allege that any member of the Demand Board  received a material personal benefit from the alleged misconduct, ” [id. at 20]; Case 1:22-cv-10723-ADB     Document 47     Filed 06/18/25     Page 11 of 2212 \n \n and 3) Plaintiffs do not adequately plead that at least a majority of the Demand Board  fa ces a \nsubstantial likelihood of liability, [ id. at 20 –29].  In their opposition, Plaintiffs abandon their \nargument that any member of the Demand Board received a material personal benefit from the \nalleged misconduct, see generally  [ECF No. 43], and they only contend that two directors \n(Ortmanns and Beaudoin) lacked independence, [ id. at 25 –27], which is far from a majority of \nthe Demand Board.4  As such, the key inquiry is whether a majority of the Demand Board faced \na substantial likelihood of liability on any of Plaintiffs’ claims.5  \n1. Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act (Count I) \nPlaintiffs  contend that a majority of the Demand Board faces a substantial likelihood of \nliability on their claim that Defendants violated  Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. \n§ 78(n)(a),  and Rule 14a-9, 17 C.F.R. § 240.14a- 9(a), promulgated thereunder, [CAC ¶¶ 187–94 \n(Count I) ], which  together prohibit solicitation by means of a proxy statement containing “any \nstatement which, at the time and in the light of the circumstances under which it is made , . . . \nomits to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein not false or misleading ,” id.  To prevail on a claim under Section 14(a), a plaintiff must show that : 1) the \n \n \n4 Plaintiffs argue that the Court should address whether Ortmanns and Beaudoin lacked \nindependence, despite not constituting a majority of the Demand Board, because the demand \ninquiry “proceeds on a director-by-director basis, and directors can be disqualified for different reasons.”  [ECF No. 43 at 25 n.14].  As  discussed supra, the Consolidated Amended Complaint \nfails to plead that the six remaining members of the Demand Board face a substantial likelihood of liability on Plaintiffs’ claims.  Thus,  the Court need not assess whether demand was futile as \nto Ortmanns and Beaudoin for lack of independence, as , even assuming that it was, the majority \nof the Board would still have been able to independently consider a pre-suit demand.   \n5 Plaintiffs’ Consolidated Amended Complaint brings one count for contribution.  [CAC ¶¶ 202–\n08 (Count III)].  Plaintiffs concede that this claim has been mooted by the settlement of the Securities Class Action.  [ECF No. 43 at 16 n.13].  Thus, the Court need not and will not address it in analyzing whether the Demand Board faces a substantial likelihood of liability.  Case 1:22-cv-10723-ADB     Document 47     Filed 06/18/25     Page 12 of 2213 \n \n proxy statement contained a material misstatement or omission, that 2) caused plaintiff ’s i njury, \nand 3) the proxy solicitation was an essential link in the accomplishment of the transaction.  \nMills v. Elec. Auto -Lite Co. , 396 U.S. 375, 384 (1970).  A misrepresentation or omission is \nmaterial “if there is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable shareholder would consider it important in deciding how to vote.”  TSC Indus., Inc. v. Northway, Inc., 426 U.S. 438, 449 \n(1976). \nAs to the first prong, Plaintiffs assert that the Demand Board faces a substantial \nlikel\nihood of liability under Section 14(a) because the December 30, 2021 Proxy Statement \n“contained material omissions, directly attributable to the Individual Defendants, that made statements co ntained [within it]  materially misleading.”  [ECF No. 43 at 16].  Specifically, \nPlaintiffs contend that the 2021 Proxy “included information about Cerence’s short and long-term incentive targets and the performance of certain executives —including defendants Dhawan, \nGallenberg er, and Ortmanns—in achieving those targets, but failed to disclose any information \nabout the pull-forward scheme and[,] by extension, the fact that but for that scheme’s conversion of variable licenses and use of minimum commitment deals, the incentive t argets would not have \nbeen met.”  [ Id. at 16 –17 ( citing CAC ¶¶  143–46, 190)].   \nDefendants respond that this Court “already rejected this argument  [i]n its opinion in the \nSecurities Class Action,” where it held that “general statements about ‘Cerence’s overall sales pipeline and ability to meet its overall future revenue projection [s]’ were not misleading.”  [ECF \nNo. 45 at 8 (quoting Cerence I , 2024 WL 1258149, at *15)].  They further contend that the \nargument has “a fatal timing problem [, as]  the challenge d Proxy came out on December 30, \n2021,” which is over a month after the Consolidated Amended Complaint alleges Cerence “announced $71 million in FY2021 fixed revenues, warning that these levels ‘put a little bit of a Case 1:22-cv-10723-ADB     Document 47     Filed 06/18/25     Page 13 of 2214 \n \n damp around growth rates for [2022] and possibly into fiscal 2023 as well, as those licenses get \nconsumed.’” 6   [Id. at 8–9 (citing CAC ¶  116)].   \nThe Court agrees with Defendants.  This Court previously held in ruling on the Securities \nClass Action that, pursuant to Section 10(b), omission of the alleged “pull- forward scheme”  from \ngeneric statements about the Company’s “strong pipeline for future business” and “strong \nfinancial position based on market factors” did not render those statements materially false or misleading .  Cerence I , 2024 WL 1258149 at *15.  Instead , this Court endorsed the much \nnarrower theory that the failure to disclose the alleged pull- forward scheme  was only actionable \nwhere the underlying statements “w ere specific to revenue from fixed and/or variable licenses ,” \nsuch that the omission altered the “total mix” of information available to reasonable investors.  Id. at *14–15 (holding omission of alleged pull- forward scheme actionable where omission \nsuggested to a reasonable investor that the Company had a “bias toward limiting the number of fixed license agreement s” or that  “the increase in fixed licenses was an aberration ”).  Plaintiffs \noffer no  compelling  explanation for why, pursuant to this rationale , the Court should find the \n2021 Proxy materially false or mi sleading.  As alleged  in the Consolidated Amended Complaint, \n \n \n6 Defendants additionally move to dismiss on the grounds that Plaintiffs’ Section 14(a) claim is \nnot a proper derivative claim as a matter of Delaware law  and rather must be brought directly by \nthe shareholder .  [ECF No. 40 at 21].  Defendants’ cited case law, however, addresses whether a \nstrong public policy exists in favor of plaintiffs being permitted to bring derivative actions under \nSection 14(a) such that Delaware law should decline to enforce corporate b ylaws that would \npreclude those claims.  Lee v. Fisher , 70 F.4th 1129, 1146–47 (9th Cir. 2023).  It does not speak \nto whether Plaintiffs’ Section 14(a) claim, as pleaded, should properly be considered direct or derivative under Delaware law, which requires analysis of “(1) who suffered the alleged harm (the corporation or the suing stockholders, individually); and (2) who would receive the benefit of any recovery or other remedy (the corporation or the stockholders, individually) .”  Tooley v. \nDonaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, Inc., 845 A.2d 1031, 1033 (Del. 2004).  Defendants do not engage \nin this analysis, and this Court need not reach it, given that it finds that the Demand Board does not face a substantial likelihood of liability on the merits of the Section 14(a) claim.   Case 1:22-cv-10723-ADB     Document 47     Filed 06/18/25     Page 14 of 2215 \n \n the 2021 Proxy made no statements regarding the past or future importance of fixed and/or \nvari\nable license contracts to revenue results, nor is it alleged to have misstated any results.  See \n[CAC ¶¶  141–47].  Rather, the 2021 Proxy accurately reported on the Company’s success in \nmeeting financial targets  for fiscal year 2021, such that shareholders could vote on compensation \nand elect board members , without, however, making any guarantees or representations regarding \nthe role  of the fixed and variable license businesses  to those past results or future performance.  \n[CAC ¶¶ 143–47].  As such,  the Court declines to find the 2021 Proxy actionable for the same \nreasons that it found similar statements non -actionable in the Securities Action.   Cerence I , 2024 \nWL 1258149, at *15. \nMoreover, even assum ing the 2021 Proxy did carry some duty to disclose the alleged \npull- forward scheme, any inference that the omission was material to the shareholder vote is \nweakened  by virtue of other information available to those shareholders at the time of the vote.  \nBaron v. Smith, 380 F.3d 49, 57 (1st Cir. 2004) (“It is not a material omission to fail to point out \ninformation of which the market is already aware.”) ; see also  Savoy v. Bos. Priv. Fin. Holdings, \nInc., 626 F. Supp. 3d 242, 250 (D. Mass. 2022) (“ The total mix of information available to a \nshareholder also includes information outside of the proxy statement where the information is already in the public domain and readily available to shareholders. ”).  In particular, the \nConsolidated Amended Complaint alleges that, one month before the 2021 Proxy, the Company disclosed  the breakdown of fixed revenue in each quarter and for all of FY2021 on an earnings \ncall.  [CAC ¶  116 (“On November 22, 2021, Cerence revealed that its fixed license revenue had \nskyrocketed to $71 million, a 42% increase over the purported maximum amount of fixed license revenue that the Company could manage (i.e., a range of $40 to $55 million.”)].  By virtue of this breakdown, and without any additional information on the alleged pull- forward  scheme, voting Case 1:22-cv-10723-ADB     Document 47     Filed 06/18/25     Page 15 of 2216 \n \n shareholders were aware that incentive compensation targets were met in  FY2021 in large part \nbecause of  the number of fixed license agreements as compared to variable.  N onetheless , they \nchose to reward  the performance through their shareholder vote.  Thus, any inference that more \ninformation regarding management’s push to sign fixed license agreements in fiscal year 2021 \nwould have altered the vote is tenuous at best.  \nAs such, based on the materials properly before it, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have not \nsufficiently alleged that the Demand Board faces a substantial likelihood of liability as to the \nSection 14(a) claim such that demand would have been futile.  \n2. Breach of Fiduciary Duty (Count II) \nPlaintiffs further contend that a majority of the Demand Board faces a substantial \nlikelihood of liability on their claim for breach of fiduciary duty.  [ECF No. 43 at 20]; [CAC ¶¶ 195–200 (Count II)].  They assert two  separate theories for breach of fiduciary duty: 1) \nalleged ly false and misleading disclosures, and 2) failure to exercise proper oversight  (also \nknown as a “ Caremark ” claim ).\n7  \ni. Disclosure Claim \nPlaintiffs contend that the Demand Board faces a substantial likelihood of liability for \nmaking or approving false and misleading statements that the Company issued regarding fixed and variable license agreements .  [CAC ¶  198]. “Whenever directors communicate publicly or \ndirectly with shareholders about the corporation’s affairs, with or without a request for shareholder action, directors have a fiduciary duty to shareholders to exercise due care, good faith and loyalty.”   In Re Camping World Holdings, Inc. S’ holder Derivative Litig ., No. 2019- cv-\n \n \n7 In re Caremark Int ’l Inc. Derivative Litig. , 698 A.2d 959 (Del. Ch. 1996).  Case 1:22-cv-10723-ADB     Document 47     Filed 06/18/25     Page 16 of 2217 \n \n 00179, 2022 WL 288152, at *12 (Del. Ch. Jan. 31, 2022) (quoting Malone v. Brincat, 722 A.2d \n5, 10 (Del. 1998)), aff’d, 285 A.3d 1204 (Del. 2022).  That said, when, as here,  the Company’s \ncharter includes an exculpat ion provision,8 “the plaintiffs must plead particularized allegations \nthat support the inference that the [alleged] disclosure violation was made in bad faith, \nknowingly or intentionally,” which  “requires an analysis of the state of mind of the individual \ndirector defendants.”  Id. at *12–13 (cleaned up) ; Zuckerberg , 262 A.3d at 1052 (holding that \n“exculpated care violations do not excuse demand”).  “Delaware courts infer scienter for such claims where a plaintiff pleads with particularity that directors had knowledge that any disclosures or omissions were false or misleading or . . . acted in bad faith in not adequately informing themselves and were sufficient[ly] . . . involve[d] in the preparation of the disclosures or that the director defendants were otherwise responsible for the disclosures.”  Camping World, \n2022 WL 288152, at *13 (cleaned up).  \nPlaintiffs assert  that  the Demand Board’s disclosures regarding the pull- forward scheme \nwere inadequate and that, as such, “[s]ubstantial likelihood of liability thus turns on the Demand Board’s knowledge of the scheme.”  [ECF No. 43 at 20–21].  On that front, Plaintiffs a ssert that \nthe Consolidated Amended Complaint “specifically plead[s] the Demand Board’s involvement with and knowledge of the pull- forward scheme .”  [Id. at 21].  As to knowledge of the alleged \nscheme, Plaintiffs rely on Board and Audit Committee meetings, at which the Board discussed:  \n(1) “that bookings were ‘chal lenged’ ”; (2) that “ variable royalty was lower than \nexpected ” yet during the same period, Cerence posted record revenues ahead of the \nBoard plan, putting the Board on notice that Cerence was reliant on fixed deals  to \n \n \n8 Specifically, the Demand Board is protected by an exculpation provision in Cerence’s corporate \ncharter concerning “the limitation or elimination of the liability of directors” for non -loyalty \nbreaches, which provides that “no director of the Corporation shall be liable to the Corporation \nor its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director” pursuant to Delaware General Corporation Law (“DGCL”) Section 102(b)(7).  [ECF No. 41-2 at 6].

Defendants counter that Plaintiffs fail to allege that \nthe Demand Board had knowledge of  or participated  in any alleged material misstatements \nor omissions , including those  statements that this Court found actionable in the Securities \nAction .  [ECF No. 40 at 25–26]; [ECF No. 45 at 11].  They contend that Plaintiffs’ \nallegations regarding the information the Board received do not “remotely suggest[] that \nthe Board learned of some secret plan to increase the level of fixed contracts over time,” [ECF No. 45 at 11], and that, in actuality, “Board materials show that the directors received exactly  the same information as investors about Cerence’s hist orical and projected \nrevenue,” [ id.], such that the Board was deceived to the same extent as the public, [ECF \nNo. 40 at 9].   \nAt the outset, the Court notes that it is unclear which misrepresentations or omissions in \npar\nticular Plaintiffs are contending the Demand Board made or approved in bad faith.  To the \nextent they intend to rely on the 2021 Proxy, it cannot support a purported breach of fiduciary duty given that, as discussed supra , Plaintiffs have not adequately alleged that it was materially \nfalse or misleading.  Assuming Plaintiffs also intend to rely on the three statements  this Court \nfound actionable in the Securities Action, Plaintiffs have not pleaded any facts to support an inference that the Demand Board members were at all “involve[d] in” or “otherwise responsible \nfor” those disclosures such that their involvement could plausibly constitute a breach of their \nduty of loyalty.  Camping World, 2022 WL 288152, at *13; see also  In re Zimmer Biomet \nHoldings, Inc. Derivative Litig., No. 2019- cv-00455, 2021 WL 3779155, at *14 (Del. Ch. 2021) \n(finding no liability for statements “during earnings calls or at conferences where the Board is Case 1:22-cv-10723-ADB     Document 47     Filed 06/18/25     Page 18 of 2219 \n \n not alleged to have played any role”); Ellis v.

AbbVie Inc. v. Gonzalez, 205 A.3d 821 (Del. 2019).  Plaintiffs’ Opposition points \nonly to involvement by Defendants Dhawan and Gallenberger , [ECF No. 43 at 21], neither of \nwhom were member of the Demand Board, and this Court’s independent review of the Consolidated Amended Complaint did not unearth any allegations which would give rise to an inference that the Demand Board was  involved in (or even aware) of the potentially fraudulent \nstatements.   \nTo the extent Plaintiffs  b\n ase the alleged violation on a purported failure to correct the \nfalse and misleading statements after they were made, [ECF No. 43 at 22 n.10], the Consolidated Amended Complaint similarly does not provide any particularized allegations to support an inference that any member of the Demand Board knew of the alleged pull- forward  scheme or \nacted in bad faith in not adequately becoming informed about it or not correcting statements about it.  To the contrary, Board -level documents produced pursuant to Section  220 and \nincorporated by reference in the Consolidated Amended Complaint demonstrate that the Board and the Audit Committee received detailed quarterly reporting about fixed and variable license agreements, including breakdowns of the proportion of revenue attributed to each, and that the numbers mirrored what the Company disclosed to the public.  See supra.  To be sure, the Board \nand the Audit Committee, by virtue of these presentations, certainly knew that the Company was experiencing heightened fixed revenue at the expense of variable revenue.  Id.   This general \nawareness, however, is a far cry from knowledge of a management -level fraudulent scheme to \npull forward fixed revenue, inflate financial metrics, tout growth, and receive related incentive Case 1:22-cv-10723-ADB     Document 47     Filed 06/18/25     Page 19 of 2220 \n \n bonuses.  On this front, the Consolidated Amended Complaint lacks any particularized , director-\nby-director allegations raising an inference that the Board knew or otherwise should have known \nthat the Company’s potential fixed revenue issue was the product of a fraudulent scheme, and, as such, the Court finds that the Demand Board does not face a substantial likelihood of liability as to the disclosure theory.  \nii. Caremark Claim  \nPlaintiffs additionally assert that a majority of the Demand Board faces a substantial \nlikelihood of liability under Caremark .  To plead a Caremark  claim, Plaintiffs must allege with \nparticularity that directors “acted in bad faith” by (1) “completely fail[ing] to implement any reporting or information system or controls,” or (2) “consciously fail[ing] to monitor or oversee” the C ompany’s operations.  Marchand v. Barnhill, 212 A.3d 805, 820–21 (Del. 2019); see also  \nHorman v. Abney, No. 12-cv-12290, 2017 WL 242571, at *7 (Del. Ch. Jan. 19, 2017) (board \nmust have either 1) “utterly failed to implement any reporting or information system or controls ” \nor 2) “ kn[own] of evidence of corporate misconduct —the proverbial ‘red flag’—yet acted in bad \nfaith by consciously disregarding its duty to address that misconduct” (cleaned up)).  “Delaware courts routinely reject the conclusory allegation that because illegal behavior occurred, internal controls must have been deficient, and the board must have known so.   Rather, the plaintiff must plead with particularity a sufficient connection between the corporate trauma and the board.”  In \nre Boeing Co. Derivative Litig., No. 2019- cv-00907, 2021 WL 4059934, at *24 (Del. Ch. Sept. \n7, 2021) (cleaned up).  “As often stated, oversight liability under Caremark  is possibly the most \ndifficult theory in corporation law upon which a plaintiff might hope to win a judgment.”  Firemen’s Ret. Sys. of St. Louis ex rel . Marriott Int’l, Inc. v. Sorenson, No. 2019- cv-00965, 2021 \nWL 4593777, at *11 (Del. Ch. Oct. 5, 2021) ( citation  omitted).  Case 1:22-cv-10723-ADB     Document 47     Filed 06/18/25     Page 20 of 2221 \n \n Plaintiffs do not to argue that the Demand Board members face liability under the first \nprong of \nCaremark  for failure to implement internal controls .  [ECF No . 43 at 23].  Rather, \nPlaintiffs contend that “the Demand Board knew of the pull-forward scheme, and yet ‘ acted in \nbad faith by consciously disregarding its duty to address that misconduct.’ ”  [Id. (quoting \nHorman , 2017 WL 242571, at *7) ].  As discussed supra , however, the CAC lacks particularized \nallegations that any member of the Demand Board knew of the alleged pull -forward scheme, and  \nPlaintiffs  fail to point to a ny “red flags” that the Demand Board alleged ly disregarded in \ndischarging its fiduciary duties.  [ECF No. 43 at 223–24] ; see also  Boeing, 2021 WL 4059934, at \n*24 (“[O]ur law will hold directors personally liable only where, in failing to oversee the \noperations of the company, ‘the directors knew that they were not discharging their fiduciary obligations.”’ (quoting Stone v. Ritter, 911 A.2d 362, 370 (Del. 2006)) ).  Plaintiffs ’ conclusory \nallegation that,  because misconduct occurred, the Demand Board must have known and failed to \nact is insufficient to state a Caremark  claim.  City of Birmingham Ret. & Relief  Sys. v. Good, \n177 A.3d 47, 59 (Del. 2017) (plaintiffs may not simply “equate a bad outcome with bad faith”).   \n3. Brophy (Count IV) \nPlaintiffs assert that  a majority of the Demand Board faces a substantial likelihood of \nliability on Plaintiffs ’ insider trading claim (commonly referred to as a “Brophy” claim).9  Only \none Demand Board member (Ortmanns) is alleged to have committed a Brophy violation , which, \nas Defendants observe, necessarily does not raise a substantial likelihood of Brophy liability for \na majority of the Demand Board.  [CAC ¶¶ 209–15].  As  to these other Demand Board members, \nPlaintiffs  merely  contend that they are “interested as to Count IV” such that demand is futile \n \n \n9 Brophy v. Cities Serv. Co., 70 A.2d 5 (Del. Ch. 1949). Case 1:22-cv-10723-ADB     Document 47     Filed 06/18/25     Page 21 of 2222 \n \n “because they cannot pursue a Brophy claim without implicating themselves on the other \nclaims” —i.e., for a non-exculpated breach of fiduciary duty.  [ECF No. 43 at 24].  Having found, \nhowever, that “none of the Demand Board directors face a substantial likelihood of liability with \nrespect to ” the fiduciary duty claims, the Court has “no reason to doubt [the Demand Board’s] \nimpartiality to consider a demand as to [the Brophy] claim. ”  In re TrueCar, Inc. S’holder \nDerivative Litig. , No. 2019- cv-00672, 2020 WL 5816761, at *23 (Del. Ch. Sept. 30, 2020).   \n4. Unjust Enrichment (Count V) \nPlaintiffs and Defendants agree that Plaintiffs’ remaining unjust enrichment claim “rises \nor falls with Plaintiffs’ breach of fiduciary duty claims as a matter of demand futility.”  [ECF No. 43 at 25]’ [ECF No. 40- at 29 –30].  Because Plaintiffs have not shown that the Demand Board \nfaces a substantial likelihood of liability on the fiduciary duty claims, demand is similarly not excused as to the unjust enrichment claim.  \nB. Failure to State a Claim  \nBecause Plaintiffs failed to make a demand on the Board, the Court need not reach \nDef\nendants’ arguments on the merits.   \nIV. CONCLUSION \nFor the reasons set forth above, Defendants’ motion to dismiss is GRANTED.   \nSO ORDERED.         \n             \nJune 18, 2025 /s/  Allison D. Burroughs   \n ALLISON D.

    "summary": "1. **Summary:**\n   This case involves a derivative suit brought by shareholders of Cerence, Inc., a company that develops AI-powered virtual assistants for automakers, against certain officers and directors, citing violations of the Exchange Act, breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, and insider trading. The dispute primarily centers around which forum (federal or Delaware courts) is appropriate for these proceedings, as highlighted by a conflict between the company's Charter and Bylaws regarding forum selection. Ultimately, the court denied the defendants' motion to dismiss, allowing the case to proceed in federal court due to the language in the Bylaws permitting federal court jurisdiction for claims under the Exchange Act.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue:**\n   The main legal issue is whether the forum-selection clause in Cerence’s Charter, mandating Delaware as the forum for derivative actions, overrides the subsequent Bylaws clause that allows for federal court jurisdiction for Exchange Act claims.\n\n3. **Court's Holding:**\n   The court held that the Bylaws, which allow derivative suits alleging Exchange Act violations to be brought in any federal court, apply. Consequently, the court denied the defendants' motion to dismiss, enabling the case to proceed in the current federal jurisdiction.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation:**\n   Imagine a company has rules about where people can sue them (like saying \"you have to argue with us in the kitchen\"). The company's old rule said you have to go to a specific place to argue (like saying you have to argue in the kitchen in their house), but a newer rule from a different company paper said arguments about certain laws could happen anywhere in the house. The judge looked at these rules and decided that since the new rule was clear enough, people could indeed sue the company where they were suing them now, not just in that specific place. So, the judge let the lawsuit continue where it was.",

(“Cerence” or “the Company”) and \nvarious officers and directors (collectively with Cerence, “Defendants”), alleging violations of \nvarious provisions of the Exchange Act, as well as asserting claims for breach of fiduciary duty, \nunjust enrichment, and insider trading.  See generally  [ECF No. 18 (“Consolidated Amended \nComplaint ” or “CAC ”)].  Before the Court is Defendants’ motion to dismiss, seeking to enforce \na forum -selection clause in the Company’s 2019 Charter  that designates Delaware state or \nfederal court as the exclusive venue for this action .  [ECF No. 30].  For the reasons set forth \nbelow, Defendants ’ motion is DENIED.  \nI. BACKGROUND  \nA. Factual Background1 \n Cerence, a Delaware corporation headquartered in Burlington, Massachusetts, is a \ntechnology company that builds artificial intelligence-powered virtual assistants for automakers \n \n \n1 The following facts are taken from the Consolidated Amended Complaint, the well -pleaded \nfactual allegations of which are assumed to be true when considering a motion to dismiss, see \nRuivo v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., 766 F.3d 87, 90 (1st Cir. 2014) , as well as  “documents \nincorporated by reference in [the complaint], matters of public record, and other matters \n Case 1:22-cv-10723-ADB     Document 34     Filed 12/20/24     Page 1 of 72 \n \n and other manufacturers.  [CAC ¶¶ 30, 41].  It became a standalone public company on October \n1, 2019, when i\nt was spun off from Nuance Communications, Inc.  [ Id. ¶ 30].   \n Since the spin -off, Article X of  Cerence’s Charter has provided that,  \nUnless the Corporation consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the \nsole and exclusive forum for (a) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the Corporation, (b) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any current or former director, officer or other employee or stockholder of the Corporation to the Corporation or the Corporation’s stockholders . . . shall be the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, in all cases to the fullest extent permitted by law, or, if the Court of Chancery or the State of Delaware does not have jurisdiction, any other state or federal court located within the State of Delaware.   \n [ECF No. 32- 1 at\n  7 (“the Charter”) ].  The bylaws put in place at the time of the spinoff in 2019 \ndid not have any relevant forum-selection provision.  See generally  [ECF No. 32-2].   \n On April 28, 2023, Cerence adopted amended bylaws with a new Section 12.6, titled \n“Exclusive Jurisdiction of United States Federal District Courts.”  [ECF No. 32 -3 at 27 (“the \nBylaws”].  Section 12.6 provides:  \nUnless the Corporation consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the \nfederal district courts of the United States of America shall be the sole and exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, the Exchange Act, or the respective rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. \n [Id.].   \n \nB. Procedural History  \nThe instant consolidated action originated as two related derivative cases.  On May 10 \nand 12, 2022, re\nspectively, plaintiffs William Shafer and Peter Morse filed verified shareholder \n \n \nsusceptible to judicial notice.”  Giragosian v. Ryan, 547 F.3d 59, 65 (1st Cir. 2008) (alteration in \noriginal) (quoting In re Colonial Mortg. Bankers Corp., 324 F.3d 12, 20 (1st Cir. 2003)).  \nBecause the dispute involves clauses with in the Company’s charter and bylaws, many facts are \ntaken from the Company’s public filings, which are susceptible to judicial notice.  See, e.g. , \nMahoney v. Found. Med., Inc., 342 F. Supp. 3d 206, 216 n.4 (D. Mass. 2018).  Case 1:22-cv-10723-ADB     Document 34     Filed 12/20/24     Page 2 of 73 \n \n derivative complaints on behalf of nominal Defendant Cerence against various current and \nforme\nr officers and directors.  [ECF No. 1] ; see also  Morse v. Dhawan et al. , No. 1:22- cv-1073 \n(D. Mass.) .  On June 10, 2022, the parties stipulated to the consolidation of the two derivative \ncases, and the Court endorsed  the stipulation.  [ECF Nos. 13, 14].  The same day, the parties \nstipulated to stay the consolidated action pending the outcome of the Company’s anticipated motion to dismiss in a related securities cla ss action, City of Miami Firefighters’ & Police \nOfficers’ Retirement Tr. v. Cerence Inc. , No. 1:22-10321 (the “Securities Action”); [ECF No. \n15].  In accord with the stipulation, the Court stayed the case on June 27, 2022.  [ECF No. 16].  On September 12, 2023, during the stay, Plaintiffs filed the operative Consolidated Amended Complain t.  See generally  [CAC].   \nAnother derivative case was filed in Delaware Court of Chancery on August 17, 2023.  \nCatherine Fleming v. Sanjay Dhawan, et. al., No. 2023-0845 (Del. Ch.) (the “Delaware Action”), \nwith substantially similar allegations.  The Delaware Action was also stayed pending the decision on the motion to dismiss in the Securities Action.  [ECF No. 32- 5].  \nOn March 25, 2024, the Court entered an order granting in part and denying in part \nDefen \ndants’ motion to dismiss the Securities Action.  [Securities Action, ECF No. 51].  As a \nresult, the stay in this action was lifted, and the Court ordered briefing on whether the action should be dismissed in light of any relevant forum-selection clause.  [ECF No. 29].  Defendants filed their motion to dismiss on May 24, 2024, [ECF No. 30], which Plaintiffs opposed on June 7, 2024, [ECF No. 33].  \nII. STANDARD OF REVIEW  In the First Circuit, courts “treat a motion to dismiss based on a forum selection clause as \na mot \nion alleging the failure to state a claim for which relief can be granted under Rule Case 1:22-cv-10723-ADB     Document 34     Filed 12/20/24     Page 3 of 74 \n \n 12(b)(6).”  Claudio-De León v. Sistema Universitario Ana G. Mendez, 775 F.3d 41, 46 (1st Cir. \n2014) (quoting Rivera v. Centro Medico de Turabo, Inc., 575 F.3d 10, 15 (1st Cir. 2009)) ; see \nalso Rivera v. Kress Stores of P.R., Inc., 30 F.4th 98, 102 (1st Cir. 2022) (holding that it is \n“permissible” to enforce a forum -selection clause via Rule 12(b)(6)). \nUnder Rule 12(b)(6), a complaint “must provide ‘a short and plain statement of the claim \nshow\ning that the pleader is entitled to relief.’”  Cardigan Mountain Sch. v. N.H. Ins. Co., 787 \nF.3d 82, 84 (1st Cir. 2015) (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2)).  This pleading standard requires \n“more than labels and conclusions,” Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007), and \n“[t]hreadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of action, supported by mere conclusory statements, do not suffice,” Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009).  Rather, a complaint \n“must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to ‘state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.’”  Id. (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 570).   \nIII. DISCUSSION  \nTypically, a motion to dismiss pursuant to a forum selection clause requires a three- part \ni\nnquiry.  First, “the threshold question in interpreting a forum selection clause is whether the \nclause at issue is permissive or mandatory.”  Claudio- De León , 775 F.3d at 46 (quoting Rivera, \n575 F.3d at 17).  Permissive forum -selection clauses “authorize jurisdiction and venue in a \ndesignated forum, but do not prohibit litigation elsewhere,” whereas mandatory forum- selection \nclauses require that litigation occur “excl usively in the designated forum.”  Id.  (quoting Rivera, \n575 F.3d at 17).  “The next step in evaluating the applicability of a forum selection clause is ascertaining its scope,” id. at 47, namely, whether the forum selection clause covers the claims at \nissue.   “[T]he final step in evaluating the clause involves asking ‘whether there is some reason Case 1:22-cv-10723-ADB     Document 34     Filed 12/20/24     Page 4 of 75 \n \n the presumption of enforceability should not apply.’”  Id. at  48 (quoting Rafael Rodriguez Barril, \nInc. v. Conbraco Indus., Inc., 619 F.3d 90, 93 (1st Cir. 2010)). \n A s briefed by the parties, the present  motion turns not on the enforceability of a forum \nselection clause but rather on which forum selection clause applies to this action – Article X of \nthe Charter or Section 12.6 of the Bylaws .2  Defendants argue that the Charter  controls because, \nunder Delaware law, 3 “the charter always wins; a ‘bylaw that conflicts with the charter is void,’” \n[ECF No. 31 at 14 (quoting Manti Holdings, LLC v. Authentix Acquisition Co., Inc., 261 A.3d \n1199, 1240 (Del. 2021) ], and, because of this, “Delaware courts attempt to reconcile corporate \ncharters and bylaws wherever possible,” [id.].4  The Charter requires derivative actions to be \nbrought in Delaware state or federal court, while the Bylaws provide exclusive jurisdiction to \n \n \n2 If the Charter governs over Section 12.6, Plaintiffs do not offer any argument that it is \npermissive, rather than mandatory, that it does not encompass their claims, or that it is otherwise \nunenforceable.  See generally  [ECF No. 33].  If Section 12.6 applies, Defendants similarly offer \nno argument on these points.  Thus, the Court’s analysis focuses on which document governs, rather than on the traditional enforceability factors.   \n3 The parties agree that Delaware law applies to the contractual analysis of the forum selection \nclauses.  [ECF No. 33 at 9].   \n4 Defendants argue  (briefly) that the Bylaws cannot serve as the forum selection clause in this \naction because they were not in effect when Plaintiffs filed their original complaints , [ECF No. \n31 at 14], although they were in effect when Plaintiffs filed the Consolidated Amended Complaint.   Defendants do not provide any authority to support the proposition that the Bylaws \nmust predate the original actions, rather than the consolidated action, and courts frequently enforce forum selection clauses pursuant to bylaws that were not in effect when litigation was filed.  See, e.g. , Goldstein v. Neuman, No. A161727, 2021 WL 5317198, at *3 (Cal. Ct. App. \nNov. 16, 2021) (“Plaintiff has not cited, and we have not located, any authority holding that a newly enacted forum selection bylaw cannot be applied to pending litigation as a matter of law.”); City of Providence v. First Citizens BancShares, Inc., 99 A.3d 229, 241 (Del. Ch. 2014) \n(rejecting argument that forum selection bylaw could not be enforced because it sought to regulate the forum for asserting claims that arose before it was adopted  (citing Kidsco Inc. v. \nDinsmore, 674 A.2d 483, 492 (Del. Ch. 1995) ); id. at 241 n. 50 ( “[W]here a corporation’ s \narticles or bylaws ‘put all on notice that the by- laws may be amended at any time, no vested \nrights can arise that would contractually prohibit an amendment.’” ).  Case 1:22-cv-10723-ADB     Document 34     Filed 12/20/24     Page 5 of 76 \n \n federal courts, in Delaware or elsewhere, for “any complaint” — derivative or direct — asserting \na cause of action under the Exchange Act.  Defendants  argue that, because the Bylaws “conflict” \nwith the Charter by permitting derivative actions in federal courts outside of Delaware, the Bylaws must be read “harmoniously” with the Charter to require any derivative actions against the Company to be brought in the federal district court for the District of Delaware.  [ ECF No. 31 \nat 7, 14–15].  Plaintiffs , on the other hand, a ssert that there is no conflict, pointing to language in \nthe Charter that Defendants ignore – namely, that derivative claims are to be brought in Delaware “ [u]nless the Corporation consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum.”  \n[ECF No. 33 at 11–12].  \n Ultimately, Plaintiff s’ argument is more availing.  The Charter , enacted in 2019, \ncontemplated that the Board might “consent [ ] in writing”  to derivative actions being brought in \nan alternative forum .  [ECF No. 32-1 at 7].  T he Bylaws , instituted four years later, provide (in \nwriting) that  for derivative actions , including those that bring Exchange Act claims, any federal \ncourt may serve as such an alternative forum .  [ECF No. 32-3 at 27].  Read this way, the Charter \nand the Bylaws do not conflict, and Defendants provide no argument or authority (nor is the Court aware of any) as to why the Board’s adoption of the Bylaws would not constitute the precise written consent contemplated in Article X .    \nIn the absence of a conflict, at best, Defendants ’ arg\n ument is that the Bylaws are \nambiguous as they do not specify whether “any complaint” includes those brought derivatively and contemplated under Article X.  In that instance, however, Delaware courts are clear that “[c]orporate charters and bylaws are contracts among a corporation’s shareholders [such that Delaware] rules of contract interpretation apply,” Airgas, Inc. v. Air Prods. & Chems ., Inc., 8 \nA.3d 1182, 1188 (Del. 2010), including that “any ambiguity . . . must . . . be construed against the Case 1:22-cv-10723-ADB     Document 34     Filed 12/20/24     Page 6 of 77 \n \n drafter ,” Lions Gate Ent. Corp. v. Image Ent m ’t Inc., No. 2011-N, 2006 WL 1668051, at *6 \n(Del. Ch. June 5, 2006).  As Plaintiffs argue, “[w]hen the Board adopted Section 12.6, it was \naware of shareholder derivative actions and that Article X applied to shareholder derivative actions generally,” and, despite this, “it chose not to carve derivative actions out of Section 12.6 or to narrow its language to apply only to claims  arising under the Exchange Act.”  [ECF No. 33 \nat 12].  The Board did not do that, and, as they stand, the Bylaws are clear : “[F]ederal  courts” \nhave exclusive jurisdiction over “any complaint” bringing claims under the Exchange Act, which includes any derivative complaint bringing Exchange Act claims.   The Court need go no further.  \nZimmerman v. Crothall, 62 A.3d 676, 690 (Del. Ch. 2013) (“When interpreting a contract, the \ncourt’s role is to effectuate the parties’ intent based on the parties’ words and the plain meaning of those words.” ). \n  Because Section 12.6 permits derivative complaints alleging claims for violations of the Excha\nnge Act to be brought in any federal court, and because Plaintiffs’ Consolidated Amended \nComplaint brings such claims, Defendants ’ motion to dismiss is DENIED.  \nIV. CONCLUSION \nFor the reasons set forth above, Defendants’ motion to dismiss is DENIED.   \nSO ORDERED.         \n             \nDecember 20, 2024 /s/  Allison D. Burroughs   \n ALLISON D.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: The U.S. District Court for the District of Utah denied Defendant Donald Perry's motion to dismiss in a case involving a securities fraud scheme orchestrated by John Clayton. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) accused Clayton of manipulating stock ownership of microcap companies through various nominees and using a transfer agent he controlled to illegally sell the stock. Perry, accused of aiding and abetting the scheme, allegedly acted as a middleman and provided false documentation to facilitate stock sales. The case involves the artificial intelligence (AI) sector as Clayton sought to bring an AI company public through a reverse merger.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether Donald Perry knowingly or recklessly aided and abetted securities fraud by providing substantial assistance to primary violator John Clayton.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court denied Perry's motion to dismiss, ruling that the SEC adequately pled its claims with sufficient particularity under Rule 9(b) and that the allegations supported a plausible inference that Perry acted with the requisite scienter (knowledge or reckless disregard).\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine a person named John who comes up with a sneaky plan to trick others by secretly controlling and selling stocks without following the rules.

Dkt. 1, \nComplaint .  At the motion to dismiss stage, the court accepts as true SEC’s well- pleaded factual allegations and \nviews them in the light most favorable to the SEC.

(Flexpoint) , ForeverGreen  Worldwide Corp. \n(ForeverGreen) , KwikClick, Inc., and LZG International , Inc.

Instead, Perry takes aim \nat whether the SEC  has satisfied  Rule 9(b) and whether it has adequately pled he acted with \nscienter.  He contends  the SEC’s allegations against him are insufficient in both respects.55  The \nSEC, on the other hand, contends it pled  particularized allegations  against Perry and \ndemonstrated  Perry was at least reckless with respect to  the assistance he rendered to Clayton , \nwhich the Commission argues is sufficient to state its aiding and abetting claims against  Perry .56 \nThe court agrees with the Commission.  The SEC ple d the circumstances of Perry’s \ninvolvement in Clayton’s scheme with sufficient particularity to “afford [Perry] fair notice of [the SEC’s] claims and the factual ground upon which they are based.”\n57  And viewing the Complaint \nas a whole, the court can fairly infer  at this stage  that Perry’s mental state —which need not be \npled with particularity —was at least  reckless as to the services he rendered in furtherance of \nClayton’s scheme.  \nI.

The court is required at this stage  to view the Complaint in the light most \nfavorable to the SEC, not to Perry.  Perry is correct that  the SEC equivocates as to whether Perry \nor Clayton was ultimately responsible for affixing Perry’s wife’s signature to the brokerage deposit forms  in one instance  related to Empire’s deposit of Flexpoint stock in 2019.\n94  But \nviewing the Complaint as a whole, the SEC elsewhere alleges Perry forged his wife’s signature on documentation “relating to a brokerage account”\n95 and that  Perry reached out to Clayton to \nask him to affix Perry’s wife’s signature on a letter giving Perry authority to trade in Empire’s brokerage account.\n96  Construing the Complaint in the light most favorable to the SEC, as the \ncourt must, the court finds it is reasonable to conclude that Perry affixed his wife’s signature to effectuate certain deposits of stock to brokerage firms without her knowledge or authorization.   \nBut even if the court were to  discount the SEC’s allegation that Perry forged his wife’s \nsignature as part of this scheme —which would be highly probative of Perry’s knowing \nparticipation in Clayton’s  scheme—other facts also give rise to an inference that Perry acted at \nleast recklessly.   The Complaint alleges Perry had robust knowledge about  and control over the \nClayton Nominees.\n97  Perry objects to the SEC’s characterization that he had a “global view ” and \n“broader visibility”  of the Clayton Nominees’ finances  because those characterizations are \n \n93 Complaint  ¶¶ 57, 63 –64, 84 –85, 102.  \n94 Id. ¶ 84. \n95 Id. ¶ 7. \n96 Id. ¶ 57. \n97 Id. ¶¶ 57, 63–64, 84–85, 102.

The SEC demonstrates Perry’s “ global view ” \nof Clayton’s affairs , for example, in its allegations concerning Perry’s conduct regarding \nClayton’s acquisition of LZG International stock.99  Perry recommended to Clayton’s staff which \nClayton Nominee should purchase LZG International stock , and he did so based on his \nunderstanding of the financial positions of all of the Clayton Nominees.100  One day later, \nClayton’s staff heeded Perry’s recommendation.101  Given Perry’s alleged  management of  the \nClayton Nominees,102 and his ostensible  understanding of t heir financial positions ,103 it is \nreasonable for the court to infer that Perry knew the documentation he provided to brokerage \nfirms was fraudulent , or at least that he was reckless in providing such documentation.104   \nAdditionally,  when the brokerage firm initially found Jackson’s documentation to be \ndeficient, Clayton “directed Perry to further assist in obtaining” corrected documentation from Jackson.\n105  Even accepting that Perry was not involved in the signing of brokerage deposit \nforms that he ultimately supplied to brokerage firms, he was evidently responsible for seeking out attorney opinion letters from Jackson, letters for which he  was on notice from the brokerage \nfirms as  being deficient .  This, combined with Perry’s  understanding and management of the \nClayton Nominees and the fact that his wife was enlisted as a nominal officer for one such \n \n98 Reply  at 3 (citing Opposition  at 4–5). \n99 Complaint  ¶¶ 110–112. \n100 Id. ¶ 112.  \n101 Id. \n102 Id. ¶ 57. \n103 Id. ¶ 112.  \n104 See SEC v.

Perry nowhere grapples with the fact that \nscienter may be inferred where there is strong evidence of substantial assistance, nor does he \ndeny that his conduct constitute d substantial assistance.  He never meaningfully engages with the \nrelevant definitions of scienter, which include  recklessness.  And he flips the relevant Rule 12 \nburden by asking the court to infer facts favorable to him concerning his alleged participation in \nforging documents.  Because of thes e failings, the court finds it can reasonably infer that Perry at \nleast acted recklessly in aiding and abetting Perry’s scheme.  \nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, Perry’s Motion to Dismiss is DENIED.107   \nSO ORDERED this 16th day of June 2025.  \n       BY THE COURT:  \n \n      ________________________________________ \n     ROBERT J.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: In the case of Joseph Friel v. Line 5, LLC and Headstart Warranty Group, LLC, the plaintiff, Joseph Friel, alleges that the defendants made unsolicited prerecorded telemarketing calls to numbers including his own, which was registered on the National Do Not Call Registry, without his consent, to sell extended car warranties. The court was presented with motions to strike class allegations and bifurcate discovery, which it ultimately denied, allowing the class action suit to proceed with discovery. The case prominently involves automated systems, as it centers around the defendants’ use of robocalls and artificial or prerecorded voice messages to solicit customers, raising issues under the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA).\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: The key legal issue is whether the defendants' use of automated, prerecorded telemarketing calls to numbers on the National Do Not Call Registry, without consent, violated the TCPA, and whether the plaintiff’s proposed class action is certifiable under federal rules.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court denied the motion to strike the class allegations and the motion to conduct discovery in separate phases. It found that it was premature to dismiss the class allegations before discovery had taken place and that the class allegations were not facially infirm under the criteria provided by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine you've signed up for a list that says \"no unwanted sales calls,\" but you keep getting those annoying, pre-recorded phone calls trying to sell you car warranties. These calls are made by machines and you didn't say it was okay to call you. Joseph, like you, got fed up and took the companies to court saying, \"Hey, stop these calls. They are breaking the rules about not bothering people who don't want to hear sales pitches.\" The judge listened to the companies ask to ignore this complaint without really looking into it, but the judge said, \"No, let's check it out first and see if Joseph's right.\"",
    "full_text": "IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE MIDDLE DISTRICT OF PENNSYLVANIA \nJOSEPH FRIEL, \nindividually and on behalf of others \nsimilarly situated, \nPlaintiff \nv. \nLINE 5, LLC and HEADSTART \nWARRANTY GROUP, LLC, \nDefendants No. 3:24cv1866 \n(Judge Munley) \n............................................................ ................................................. ..................................... ................... ................................................... \nMEMORANDUM \nThis putative class action case involves automated telephone calls \nallegedly sent by companies selling, guaranteeing , and/or financing vehicle \nservice contracts , otherwise known as extended car warranties. After receiving \nnumerous unsolicited extended-warranty calls over a two-month period, Plaintiff \nJoseph Friel filed this action pursuant to the Telephone Consumer Protection Act \nof 1991, 47 U.S.C. § 227, (\"TCPA\"), seeking to represent a nationwide class of \nrobocall recipients and a class of recipients on the National Do Not Call Registry \n(\"DNCR\"). Before the court is a motion to strike the class allegations from Friel's \ncomplaint prior to discovery . Also pending is a motion to bifurcate discovery , \nwhich actually requests that discovery be conducted in three separate phases. \nBoth motions are ripe for disposition . Case 3:24-cv-01866-JKM     Document 55     Filed 08/21/25     Page 1 of 21Background1 \nFriel's TCPA complaint alleges that former defendant JEA Management \nServices d/b/a Covered Auto (\"JEA\") sent prerecorded telemarketing calls on \nbehalf of Defendants Headstart Warranty Group, LLC (\"Headstart \") and Line 5, \nLLC (\"Line5\"), including to recipients on the DNCR without the call recipient's \nexpress written consent. (Doc. 1, Compl. 11 5). \nAs for the extended car warranties involved in this TCPA litigation, Friel's \ncomplaint details a joint enterprise among the JEA, Headstart , and Line5 entities. \nlll 1117. As alleged, JEA and Headstart sell vehicle service contracts with JEA \nacting as a sales agent and Headstart acting as the guarantor of the contracts. \nlll 111114-15 . Line5 handles customer management , payment processing , and \nprovides financing for the contracts sold by JEA and guaranteed by Headstart . lll \n1116. To generate business, JEA places telemarketing calls, some of which are \nprerecorded , on behalf of Headstart and Line5. lll 1117. \nFriel further alleges that he maintains a personal residential telephone \nnumber, which has been on the DNCR since 2011. lg. 111118-20 . According to \nthe plaintiff, he has never been a customer of JEA, Headstart, or Line5 and never \ninquired into being a customer of these entities. lll 1121. Nevertheless, Friel \n1 This background section derives from the facts alleged in plaintiff's complaint. The court \nmakes no determination as to the veracity of these allegations . \n2 Case 3:24-cv-01866-JKM     Document 55     Filed 08/21/25     Page 2 of 21received at least fourteen (14) telemarketing calls from JEA between August 8, \n2024 and September 27, 2024. kl ,i 22. The caller IDs from these incoming calls \nreflected different phone numbers from area codes associated with the \nPhiladelphia , Allentown-Bethlehem-Easton, and Scranton-Wilkes -Barre \nmetropolitan areas. kl ,i,i 22, 27. \nFriel answered the calls. They all began with a prerecorded voice message \nwith fake typing and office background noise. kl ,i,i 23, 24. A robotic voice \ngreeted Friel by name, identified that it was calling on behalf of the \"vehicle \nservice department ,\" and asked how the plaintiff was doing. kl ,i 24. Friel hung \nup on most of the calls. kl ,i 26. \nFriel answered one of the calls on September 27, 2024. kl ,i 27. Plaintiff \nheard the above prerecorded message , responded to questions posed by the \nartificial intelligence agent, and was then transferred to a human representative. \nkl ,i,i 23-32. Next, Friel listened to that representative 's sales speech about a \nvehicle service contract and the financing program offered by Defendant Line5. \nkl ,i,i 32-33. Subsequently , Friel received various emails and text messages \nfrom Line5 and a copy of a vehicle service contract for signature. kl ,i 36. From \nthese communications , Friel discerned JEA, Headstart, and Line5's roles in the \ntelephone calls. kl ,i,i 37-39. \n3 Case 3:24-cv-01866-JKM     Document 55     Filed 08/21/25     Page 3 of 21Approximately one month later, on October 29, 2024, Friel initiated this \nputative class action against JEA, Headstart , and Line5 under 47 U.S.C. § 227(b) \nand 47 U.S.C. § 227(c)(5) seeking to represent himself and other similarly \nsituated individuals . (Doc. 1, Compl. ,m 90-99). JEA responded by filing three \nmotions: 1) a motion to strike class allegations , (Doc. 29); 2) a motion to dismiss \nfor failure to state a claim, (Doc. 31 ), and 3) a motion to trifurcate discovery , \n(Doc. 33). JEA filed briefs in support of each motion. (Docs. 30, 32, 34). \nDefendant Line5 joined JEA's motion to strike and motion to trifurcate discovery . \n(Docs. 45-46). \nOn March 25, 2025, Friel filed a notice of voluntary dismissal regarding \nJEA. (Doc. 50). JEA's dismissal rendered the motion to dismiss moot. (Doc. 51 ). \nThe court determined that Line5's joinder to the other motions required \noppositional briefing. kl Friel subsequently filed his briefs in opposition as \nordered. (Docs. 52-53). Line5 then filed a reply brief regarding the motion to \ntrifurcate discovery , (Doc. 54 ), but not the motion to strike. Based on the briefs of \nJEA and Friel, the motion to strike plaintiff's TCPA class allegations is ripe for \ndisposition . Similarly, the motion seeking phased discovery is ready for a \ndecision based upon the briefs of JEA, Friel, and Line5. \n4 Case 3:24-cv-01866-JKM     Document 55     Filed 08/21/25     Page 4 of 21Jurisdiction \nBecause Friel brings suit under a federal statute, the court has subject \nmatter jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331. See Mims v. Arrow Fin. Servs., \nLLC, 565 U.S. 368, 387 (2012) (holding that nothing in the text, structure, or \nlegislative history of the TCPA calls for displacement of federal question \njurisdiction) . \nAnalysis \n1. The TCPA and the Proposed Classes \nThis putative class action concerns alleged violations of the TCPA. \"The \nTCPA protects businesses and consumers from intrusive telemarketing \ncommunications .\" McLaughl in Chiropractic Assocs., Inc. v. McKesson Corp., 606 \nU.S. 146, 149 (2025). The TCPA \"makes it unlawful to use an automatic \ntelephone dialing system or an artificial or prerecorded voice message, without \nthe prior express consent of the called party, to call any ... cellular telephone , or \nother service for which the receiver is charged for the call.\" Mims, 565 U.S. at \n373 (citing 47 U.S.C. § 227(b)(1 )(A)). The TCPA also \"forbids using artificial or \nprerecorded voice messages to call residential telephone lines without prior \nexpress consent.~ (citing 47 U.S.C. § 227(b)(1 )(B)). \"In plain English, the \nTCPA prohibited almost all robocalls to cell phones.\" Barr v. Am. Ass'n of Pol. \nConsultants, Inc., 591 U.S. 610, 615 (2020) (footnote omitted). \n5 Case 3:24-cv-01866-JKM     Document 55     Filed 08/21/25     Page 5 of 21Additionally , Section 227(b) contains a private right of action based on \nviolations of that subsection or the regulations prescribed under that subsection . \n47 U.S.C. § 227(b)(3) . Under Section 227(b)(3), a person or entity may: 1) \nobtain injunctive relief; 2) recover actual monetary loss or receive $500 in \ndamages , whichever is greater; or 3) both. See 47 U.S.C. § 227(b)(3)(A)-(C) . \n\"The TCPA imposes tough penalties for violating the robocall restriction ,\" \nincluding trebling the above damages for willful or knowing violations , \"which can \nadd up quickly in a class action.\" Barr, 591 U.S. at 616. \nSection 227(c) concerns further protections of residential telephone \nsubscribers ' privacy rights and directs the Federal Communications Commission \n(\"FCC\") to prescribe regulations regarding do-not-call systems. See 47 U.S.C. § \n227(c)(1 )-(4 ). Section 227(c) \"authorizes a private right of action for violation of \nthe FCC's implementing regulations[]\" related to do-not-call. See 47 U.S.C. § \n227(c)(5); Mims, 565 U.S. at 375 & n.5. Section 227(c)(5) permits a civil action \nby \"[a] person who has received more than one telephone call within any 12-\nmonth period by or on behalf of the same entity in violation of the regulations[ .]\" \n47 U.S.C. § 227(c)(5) .2 Under Section 227(c)(5) , a person or entity may: 1) \n2 Pursuant to FCC regulations , \"[n]o person or entity shall initiate any telephone solicitation to: \n... A residential telephone subscriber who has registered his or her telephone number on the \nnational do-not-call registry of persons who do not wish to receive telephone solicitations that \nis maintained by the Federal Government. \" 47 C.F.R. § 64.1200(c)(2) . \n6 Case 3:24-cv-01866-JKM     Document 55     Filed 08/21/25     Page 6 of 21obtain injunctive relief; 2) recover actual monetary loss or receive $500 in \ndamages , whichever is greater; or 3) both. See 47 U.S.C. § 227(c)(5)(A)-(C) . A \nplaintiff may also seek treble damages for willful or knowing violations of the do­\nnot-call regulations . kt \nThese statutory provisions and attendant regulations form the basis of \nFriel's complaint against the defendants. They also form the basis of his two \nproposed classes. The proposed Robocall Class stems from the alleged Section \n227(b) and related regulatory violations , while the proposed National Do Not Call \nRegistry Class (\"DNCR Class\") derives from the alleged Section 227(c) and \nrelated regulatory violations . \n2. Motion to Strike Class Allegations \nThere are two motions presently pending before the court. First, as \nmentioned above, Lines joined in JEA's motion to strike the class allegations \nfrom Friel's complaint. The motion to strike is partly premised upon Rule 12(f) of \nthe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure . Rule 12(f) provides that the court \"may \nstrike from a pleading an insufficient defense or any redundant , immaterial , \nimpertinent , or scandalous matter.\" FED. R. CIv. P. 12(f). Rule 12(f) motions are \ndesigned to clean up the pleadings , streamline litigation, and avoid unnecessary \nforays into immaterial matters. Goode v. LexisNexis Risk & Info. Analytics Grp., \nInc., 284 F.R.D. 238, 243 (E.D. Pa. 2012) (citations omitted); see also Mcinerney \n7 Case 3:24-cv-01866-JKM     Document 55     Filed 08/21/25     Page 7 of 21v. Moyer Lumber and Hardware, Inc., 244 F.Supp.2d 393, 402 (E.D. Pa. 2002). \nProviding relief under Rule 12(f) is largely disfavored and such motions are \ntypically denied \"unless the material bears no possible relation to the matter at \nissue and may result in prejudice to the moving party.\" Miller v. Group Voyagers, \nInc., 912 F.Supp. 164, 168 (E.D. Pa. 1996). In the class action context, however, \nit is unlikely that a defendant can show that a plaintiff's class allegations \nconstitute matters usually contemplated by Rule 12(f). See In re Ry. Indus. Emp. \nNo-Poach Antitrust Litig., 395 F. Supp. 3d 464, 496 (W.D. Pa. 2019) (citations \nomitted). \nThe motion to strike is also premised upon Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \n23, which governs the administration of class actions in federal courts. See \nPerrigo Institutional Inv. Grp. v. Papa, No. 24-2861, ---F.4th ----, 2025 WL \n2315977, at *4 (3d Cir. Aug. 12, 2025). Although \"an ingenious procedural \ninnovation[, ]\" Eubank v. Pella Corp., 753 F.3d 718, 719 (7th Cir. 2014), \"[t]he \nclass action is 'an exception to the usual rule that litigation is conducted by and \non behalf of the individual named parties only.'\" Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, \n564 U.S. 338, 348 (2011) (quoting Califano v. Yamasaki , 442 U.S. 682, 700-701 \n(1979)). Thus, to ensure that named plaintiffs are appropriate representatives of \nthe class whose claims they wish to litigate, Rule 23(a) contains four \nrequirements : numerosity, commonality, typicality, and adequacy of \n8 Case 3:24-cv-01866-JKM     Document 55     Filed 08/21/25     Page 8 of 21representation. See id. at 348-49. Additionally, for a class to be certified, the \nrequirements of Rule 23(b)(1 ), (2), or (3) must also be met. Marcus v. BMW of N. \nAm., LLC, 687 F.3d 583, 590 (3d Cir. 2012). \nFriel brings this putative TCPA class action pursuant to Rule 23(b)(2) \nand/or Rule 23(b)(3). (Doc. 1, Compl. ,i 73). Rule 23(b)(2) is used to pursue \ninjunctions in class actions. See In re: Google Inc. Cookie Placement Consumer \nPriv. Litig., 934 F.3d 316, 323 (3d Cir. 2019). The complaint requests injunctive \nrelief to prohibit defendants from using prerecorded voices in the future and from \nmaking telemarketing calls to telephone numbers on the DNCR. (Doc. 1, Compl. \n,i,i 94, 99). Friel, however, also seeks statutory damages on behalf of himself \nand the putative classes. kl_ ,i,i 92-93, 98. Rule 23(b)(2) certification is not \nauthorized when each individual class member would be entitled to a different \ninjunction or declaratory judgment against the defendant , or when each class \nmember would be entitled to individualized award of monetary damages . Wal­\nMart Stores, Inc., 564 U.S. at 360. Rather, \"individualized monetary claims \nbelong in Rule 23(b)(3).\" kl_ at 362. Under Rule 23(b)(3), a class action may be \nmaintained if the numerosity , commonality , typicality, and adequacy of \nrepresentation requirements of Rule 23(a) are satisfied and \"the court finds that \nthe questions of law or fact common to class members predominate over any \nquestions affecting only individual members , and that a class action is superior to \n9 Case 3:24-cv-01866-JKM     Document 55     Filed 08/21/25     Page 9 of 21other available methods for fairly and efficiently adjudicating the controversy .\" 3 \nFED. R. CIv. P. 23(b)(3). \nRule 23(c) further provides that \"[a]t an early practicable time after a person \nsues ... as a class representative , the court must determine by order whether to \ncertify the action as a class action.\" FED. R. CIv. P. 23(c)(1 )(A). Additionally, Rule \n23(d) permits the court to issue orders that: 1) \"determine the course of \nproceedings or prescribe measures to prevent undue repetition or complication in \npresenting evidence or argument[,]\" FED. R. CIv. P. 23(d)(1 )(A), and/or 2) \"require \nthat the pleadings be amended to eliminate allegations about representation of \nabsent persons and that the action proceed accordingly[,)\" FED. R. CIv. \n23(d)(1 )(D). Consequent ly, where the goal of the motion to strike is to eliminate \nclass allegations prior to discovery , other district courts have concluded that such \nmotions should be considered under the above provisions of Rule 23, not under \nRule 12(f). See In re Ry. Indus. Emp. No-Poach Antitrust Litig., 395 F. Supp. 3d \nat 496; see also Johnson v. Ally Fin. Inc., No. 1:16-CV-1100 , 2017 WL 3433689, \n3 At this juncture, it is unknown how Friel will proceed if this matter reaches a motion for class \ncertification. Given the availability of statutory damages of up to $1500 per class member \nunder the TCPA, it may be later determined that this case is more driven by money damages \nthan equitable relief, which would make certification under Rule 23(b)(2) inappropriate . See \nM.:. Jackson v. Locust Med., LLC, No. 4:22-CV-00424, 2024 WL 2701695, at *5 (M.D. Pa. May \n24, 2024) (Brann, C.J.)

Aug. 10, 2017) (Conner, J.) (concluding that a motion to strike \nclass allegations is not an improper procedural device). \nTo determine whether the requirements of Rule 23 have been satisfied, \"a \ndistrict court must conduct a 'rigorous analysis.'\" Landsman & Funk PC v. \nSkinder-Strauss Assocs., 640 F.3d 72, 93 (3d Cir. 2011) (quoting In re Hydrogen \nPeroxide Antitrust Litig., 552 F.3d 305, 309 (3d Cir. 2008)).4 There are \"rare \nfew\" instances in which \"the complaint itself demonstrates that the requirements \nfor maintaining a class action cannot be met.\"~ at 93, n.30. Thus, \"delving into \nthe propriety of class certification \" can be \"the wrong focus\" at an early stage of a \nproceeding where there has been no motion for class certification and no \ndiscovery. ~ at 93-94. After all, \"[a]n order striking class allegations is \nfunctionally equivalent to an order denying class certification[ .]\" Microsoft Corp. v. \nBaker, 582 U.S. 23, 34, n.7 (2017). \nOne of the \"rare few\" instances where an early motion to strike class \nallegations may be granted is where the class definitions create impermissible \nfail-safe classes. See Zarichny v. Complete Payment Recovery Servs., Inc., 80 \nF. Supp. 3d 610, 624 (E.D. Pa. 2015). \"A fail-safe class is 'one that is defined so \nthat whether a person qualifies as a member depends on whether the person has \n4 Landsman is an opinion that has been reinstated in part, to the extent it is consistent with \nMims.

Friel's DNCR Class is defined as: \nAll persons within the United States: (1) whose residential \ntelephone numbers were on the National Do Not Call \nRegistry for at least 31 days; (2) but who received more \nthan one telephone solicitation call from Defendants or a \nthird party acting on Defendants ' behalf; (3) within a 12-\nmonth period; (4) within the four years prior to the filing of \nthe Complaint. \nThe motion to strike asserts that the proposed class definitions are facially \nuncertifiable. Line5 has adopted JEA's arguments that the proposed class \ndefinitions are overbroad , lack commonality , and are defined vaguely. There are \nno specific arguments that the proposed classes are fail-safe, yet this \nconsideration hangs over the analysis. \n12 Case 3:24-cv-01866-JKM     Document 55     Filed 08/21/25     Page 12 of 21a. Overbreadth Arguments \nDefendant Lines has joined in former defendant JEA's argument that both \nthe proposed Robocall Class and the DNCR Class are overbroad . The Robocall \nClass definition is challenged as overbroad because it fails to exclude calls to \nindividuals who consented to their receipt.5 Similarly, the DNCR Class is \nchallenged because th is proposed class may include calls made to individuals \nwith an established business relationship (\"EBR\") with the defendants and may \ninclude individuals who did not personally place their number on the DNCR.6 \nAfter careful considera tion, however, Friel appears to be in a situation \nwhere he is forced to choose between two vulnerable alternatives in proposing \nclass definitions at the outset of the litigation. On one hand, Friel must define his \n5 To succeed with a cause of action under 47 U.S.C. § 227(b)(1) under the circumstances \nalleged in the complaint, Friel must show that defendants: 1) made \"any call ... using any \nautomatic telephone dialing system or an artificial or prerecorded voice[;]\" 2) to \"any telephone \nnumber assigned to a ... cellular telephone service[;] 3) without \"the prior express consent of the \ncalled party[.]\" 47 U.S.C. § 227(b)(1 )(A)(iii). \n6 There are certain regulatory defenses to TCPA actions premised upon 47 U.S.C § 227(c) and \nthe do-not-call regulations. Pursuant to the regulations, a \"telephone solicitation\" does not \ninclude a call to any person with whom the caller has an EBR. 47 C.F.R. § 64.1200(f)(15)(ii). \nEBR is separately defined in 47 C.F.R. § 64.1200(f)(5) . Furthermore , pursuant to the do-not­\ncall regulations , \"[n]o person or entity shall initiate any telephone solicitation to ... [a] residential \nsubscriber who has registered his or her telephone on the national do-not-call registry of \npersons who do not wish to receive telephone solici tations that is maintained by the Federal \nGovernment. \" 47 C.F.R. § 64.1200(c)(2). Defendant Line5 adopts JEA's argument that this \nrequires individuals to personally register their phones on the DNCR. Friel counters that \npersonal registration is not required and would be impossible to prove in any case. (Doc. 53, \nPl. Br. in Opp. at 15-17). The court need not reach this issue in disposing of the motion to \nstrike. \n13 Case 3:24-cv-01866-JKM     Document 55     Filed 08/21/25     Page 13 of 21classes with reference to objective criteria. See Lewis v. Gov't Emps. Ins. Co., \n98 F.4th 452, 462 (3d Cir. 2024) (citing Byrd v. Aaron's Inc., 784 F.3d 154, 163 \n(3d Cir. 2015)). On the other hand, if Friel uses certain qualifiers , his proposed \ndefinitions could be deemed to advance i mproper fail-safe classes. 7 \nAs indicated above, \"[a] fail-safe class bases its membership upon the \nvalidity of putative members' legal claims, meaning that 'a class member either \nwins or, by virtue of losing, is defined out of the class and is therefore not bound \nby the judgment.'\" Jackson, 2023 WL 2472606, at *3 (quoting Messner, 669 \nF.3d at 825). More simply stated, fail-safe classes preclude membership in the \nclass unless a putative member would prevail on the merits. See Orduno v. \nPietrzak, 932 F.3d 710, 716 (8th Cir. 2019). \nFail-safe classes cannot satisfy the ascertainability requirement of some \nclass actions. See Zarichny, 80 F. Supp. 3d at 625 (citation omitted); see also \nByrd, 784 F.3d at 163 & n.7 (explaining that a plaintiff seeking certification under \nRule 23(b)(3) must prove by a preponderance that the class is ascertainable , but \nthat ascertainability is not a requisite of a Rule 23(b)(2) class). The \nascertainability standard requires a plaintiff to show that: (1) the class is defined \n7 \"Although the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit has not explicitly \nconsidered whether fail-safe classes are permissible , it has approvingly cited rulings by other \ncircuits that categorically disallow fail-safe classes.\" Jackson v. Meadowbrook Fin. Mortg. \nBankers Corp .. No. 4:22-CV-01659, 2023 WL 2472606, at *3 (M.D. Pa. Mar. 10, 2023) (Brann, \nC.J.) (citing Byrd, 784 F.3d at 167; In re Nexium Antitrust Litig., 777 F.3d 9, 22 (1st Cir. 2015); \nMessner, 669 F.3d at 825)). \n14 Case 3:24-cv-01866-JKM     Document 55     Filed 08/21/25     Page 14 of 21with reference to objective criteria; and (2) there is a reliable and administratively \nfeasible mechanism for determining whether putative class members fall within \nthe class definition. Byrd, 784 F.3d at 163 (citations omitted). \nIn Zarichny. the Honorable Stewart R. Dalzell in the Eastern District of \nPennsylvania determined that a putative TCPA class was defined in a fail-safe \nmanner and granted a motion to strike. 80 F .Supp. 3d at 623-26. The proposed \nTCPA class was comprised of \"those people 'who received one or more \ntelephone calls from [d]efendants on the individual's cellular telephone that was \ninitiated using an automatic telephone dialing system' without prior con[s]ent[ .]\" \nkl at 623. Because the class was defined in a manner which only would include \nthose who did not provide the defendant with prior consent, the court determined \nthat \"there is no way to provide notice to that putative class without the sort of \nextensive fact-finding that class actions should avoid,\" and \"at the conclusion of \nthe litigation, should [the defendant] prevail against [the plaintiff], any other \nputative class recipient would be free to litigate the same claim against [the \ndefendant] .\" kl at 625-26. In other words, the TCPA class could not be certified \nas defined in the initial pleading because the issue of consent was central to the \nmerits of the underlying dispute. \nAccordingly , many district courts within the Third Circuit have determined \nthat TCPA class definitions avoid fail-safe concerns by omitting the issue of \n15 Case 3:24-cv-01866-JKM     Document 55     Filed 08/21/25     Page 15 of 21consent or other merits-based criteria. See Jackson v. Direct Bldg. Supplies LLC, \nNo. 4:23-CV-01569, 2024 WL 184449, at *9 & n.101 (M.D. Pa. Jan. 17, 2024) \n(Brann, C.J.) (collecting cases); see also Abella v. Student Aid Ctr.1 Inc., No. CV \n15-3067, 2015 WL 6599747, at *4 (E.O. Pa. Oct. 30, 2015) (noting the lack of \nreference to an automatic telephone dialing system in the proposed class \ndefinition since that is a required element of a Section 227(b)(1 )(A) claim)).8 \nConsequently , to avoid fail-safe issues with his proposed Robocall Class in this \ncase, Friel asserts that he intentionally did not include consent language in his \nclass definition. (Doc. 53, Pl. Br. in Opp. at 13). \nAs indicated above, Line5 has adopted arguments challenging the \nproposed Robocall Class definition because it fails to exclude calls made with \nconsent. In joining the motion to strike, Line5 also finds fault in the proposed \nDNCR Class definition because it fails to exclude calls to individuals with an \nEBR. Adding these qualifiers to the class definitions would incorporate more \nelements of liability into the definitions . That would then arguably require all \nputative class members to have winning TCPA claims before being included in \n8 On the other hand, the Honorable Christopher C. Conner reached a slightly different result \nwhen faced with this issue on a motion to strike in Johnson. 2017 WL 3433689 at *2-*3. \nAlthough the proposed TCPA class in Johnson included reference to consent, Judge Conner \ndetermined that it was not a facially uncertifiable fail-safe class because the proposed class \ndefinition contained reference to business records, which, with discovery , could reveal an \nascertainable class. ~ at *1, *4. \n16 Case 3:24-cv-01866-JKM     Document 55     Filed 08/21/25     Page 16 of 21the class. Although non-binding , the above cases discussing fail-safe classes \nwould provide defendants with different arguments to strike the class allegations \nif Friel included reference to a lack of consent or an EBR in his proposed \ndefinitions . The court cannot fault Friel for choosing to define his classes around \nTCPA merits-based criteria. \nAs for authority binding on this court, \"in the specific context of claims filed \nunder the TCPA statute, it is difficult to resolve without discovery whether there \nare factual issues regarding class members' business relationships with \ndefendants or whether they consented to the receipt of [automated phone calls].\" \nLandsman , 640 F.3d at 93-94. Friel's complaint alleges that the proposed \nclasses are identifiable as presently defined through defendants ' dialer records, \nother phone records, and phone number databases. (Doc. 1, Compl. ,I 79). In \nthe absence of discovery into these records, the court is unwilling to determine \nwhether Friel's classes are defined too broadly or whether they fall short of \nascertainability . Line5 thus has not demonstrated a valid reason to strike Friel's \nclass allegations based on the potential breadth of the proposed classes. \nb. Commonality Arguments \nLine5 has also adopted JEA's arguments that Friel's proposed classes lack \ncommonality , that is, \"the rule requiring a plaintiff to show that \"there are \nquestions of law or fact common to the class.\" Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 564 U.S. at \n17 Case 3:24-cv-01866-JKM     Document 55     Filed 08/21/25     Page 17 of 21349 (citing FED. R. CIv. P. 23(a)). Commonality requires the plaintiff to \ndemonstrate that the class members have suffered the same injury, not merely \nthat they have all suffered violation of the same provision of law. See id. \n(citations omitted). The claims \"must depend upon a common contention[,]\" \nwhich \"must be of such a nature that is capable of classwide resolution[, ]\" \nmeaning that the \"determination of its truth or falsity will resolve an issue that is \ncentral to the validity of each one of the claims in one stroke.\" kl \nAs observed , \"[t]he commonality requirement is not especially arduous.\" \nJohnson, 2017 WL 3433689, at *4. \nFor his part, Friel's complaint alleges that he received calls related to some \nextended -warranty sales effort using an artificial or prerecorded voice without his \nconsent in violation of the TCPA. (Doc. 1, Campi. ,m 18-31 ). Only discovery will \nreveal whether Friel's proposed classes sustained the same injuries from those \nsales efforts. Accordingly , the court also rejects arguments that the proposed \nclasses are facially uncertifiable based on a lack of commonality. \nc. Vagueness Arguments \nLastly, Line5 has adopted JEA's arguments that the Robocall Class must \nbe stricken for vagueness because that proposed definition uses the phrase \n\"same, or substantially similar\" when describing the prerecorded messages \nallegedly sent by the defendants . In support, the motion to strike argues that, as \n18 Case 3:24-cv-01866-JKM     Document 55     Filed 08/21/25     Page 18 of 21presently defined, there would be no way for defendants to know which putative \nclass members received the exact message that Friel received, and which \nputative class members received a \"substantially similar\" message. (Doc. 30, \nJEA Br. in Supp. at 20-21 ). Furthermore , per the arguments advanced in the \nmotion to strike, the \"substantially similar\" definition uses improper subjective \ncriteria and is improperly imprecise for a class action. ~ \nFriel counters that such a definition is not vague under the circumstances \nbecause it essentially contemplates that defendants could have violated the \nTCPA as to other putative class members through the same sales efforts, but by \nusing a different robotic voice, for example, or the same voice with a different \nscript. (Doc. 53, Pl. Br. in Opp. at 21 ). Moreover , Friel explains that, even with \nthis definition, his proposed Robocall Class is limited to calls that presumably had \nthe same factual predicate for being sent, i.e., sales calls. ~ at 22. \nFriel's argument signals that he is open to adding more qualifiers to his \nclass definitions as this case moves forward. The court, however, will not strike \nthe definitions or adjust any portion sua sponte. Discovery has not yet \ncommenced and no motion to certify the class has been filed. To the extent that \nthere are critical vagueness issues with Friel's proposed Robocall Class \ndefinition, those issues would be more easily understood following a period of \n19 Case 3:24-cv-01866-JKM     Document 55     Filed 08/21/25     Page 19 of 21discovery . Accordingly , the motion to strike Friel's class allegations will be \ndenied. \n3. Motion to Trifurcate Discovery \nOn the issue of discovery, Defendant Line5 also joined in JEA's motion \nseeking to conduct discovery in three separate stages, that is, 1) discovery into \nFriel's individual claims; 2) discovery into the appropriateness of class \ncertification if Friel's claims proceed; and 3) if any class is ultimately certified, \nmerits discovery for the class or classes. (Doc. 34, JEA Br. in Supp.; Doc. 45, \nLine5 Joinder Notice). Friel opposes, arguing that, if this TCPA action has merit, \na trifurcated course of discovery will lead to three rounds of written discovery , \nthree rounds of depositions (with the same witnesses being deposed three \ntimes), three rounds of potential discovery disputes, and then three rounds of \ndis positive motions. 9 (Doc. 52, Pl. Br. in Opp. at 1-3 ). \nUnlike JEA, which has been dismissed , Defendant Line5 filed an answer to \nFriel's complaint. (Doc. 20). Line5's answer does not raise any defenses unique \nto Friel's individual claims, only defenses common across the putative TCPA \nclasses. (See Doc. 20, Affirmative and Other Defenses , 1J 1 (\"Line5 did not make \n9 Defendant Line5 indicates in its reply brief (filed after JEA's dismissal) that it only wishes to \nbifurcate, not trifurcate discovery . (Doc. 54). After review of Line5's reply brief, Line5 proposes \na course of discovery that has no discernable distinction from the one proposed by JEA in the \nmotion as initially filed. \n20 Case 3:24-cv-01866-JKM     Document 55     Filed 08/21/25     Page 20 of 21or authorize any calls on its behalf.\"), ,I 3 (\"Upon information and belief, the \nalleged calls were not selling Line5's services, but rather the calls were made for \nthe purpose of selling an extended car warranty provided by another of the \ndefendants .\")). Line5 has not otherwise demonstrated why Friel's specific TCPA \nclaims would be any different from the claims of the putative class members . \nThe court thus sees no reason to bifurcate, trifurcate, or otherwise order that \ndiscovery be conducted in phases at this time. Accordingly , the discovery motion \nwill be denied, and this case will be scheduled for a case management \nconference . \nConclusion \nFor the reasons set forth above, JEA's motion to strike class plaintiff's \nallegations and motion to trifurcate discovery will be denied. An appropriate \norder follows. \n21 Case 3:24-cv-01866-JKM     Document 55     Filed 08/21/25     Page 21 of 21",

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: This case involves Shift4 Payments, LLC and its founder Jared Isaacman suing Cloudflare, and unnamed individuals and corporations, for hosting websites that allegedly contain false information about a fictitious lawsuit involving Shift4. These websites, employing AI-generated content, fabricate litigation documents and attribute false statements to Isaacman. The court denied the preliminary injunction, ruling that Isaacman's name does not qualify as a protected mark under the Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act (ACPA).\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether Jared Isaacman's personal name can be considered a protected mark under the ACPA, allowing for a claim of cybersquatting against domains using his name.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court held that Isaacman's personal name does not qualify as a protected mark under the ACPA, as the plaintiffs failed to demonstrate it has acquired secondary meaning or fame as required by the statute, and thereby denied the motion for a preliminary injunction.\n\n4. **ELI5 explanation**: Imagine someone makes a fake website about you, saying you did bad things, and they use your name in the website link. You want them to stop, but the rules say your name must be super famous, like a trademark, to win. The court said your name isn’t famous enough for these rules, so they won't force the website to stop.",

The order also required Defendants to show \ncause as to why a preliminary injunction should not be issued  and permitted limited  discovery \nfrom Defendant Cloudflare and third -party Hostinger to identify the owner (s) of the websites .  Id.  \nPlaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction on  September 1, 2025  to enjoin Defendants \nfrom operating, using or transferring to a different registrar all three of the websites .  ECF. No. 15 .  \nPlaintiffs also seek to have Defendants Cloudflare and third party Hostinger disable the domain \nnames, and cease to provide services to the Defendants.  Id.  The motion is unopposed.    \nOn September 8, 2025, counsel for Plaintiffs filed a status report indicating that “ Plaintiffs \nmet and conferred with defendant Cloudflare, Inc. (“Cloudflare”) on September 3, 2025 ” and that \n“Cloudflare informed us that it takes no position on the Preliminary Injunction Motion and does \nnot intend to  oppose that motion or appear at the September 9, 2025 hearing, absent further \ndirection from the Court. ”  ECF No. 21 at 1.  \nII. JURISDICTION  \nThis Court has original jurisdiction over this matter under 28 U.S.C. § 1331 because this \nmatter arises under the federal laws of the United States, the Anticybersquatting and Consumer \nProtection Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1125(d).  Th e Court has jurisdiction over the in rem  action involving \nDefendant Isaacman Website under 15 U.S.C. § 1125(d)(2) because the registrar of the website, \nCloudflare Inc., is located within this judicial district . \nIII. LEGAL STANDARD  \nInjunctive relief is “an extraordinary remedy  that may only be awarded upon a clear \nshowing that the plaintiff is entitled to such relief.”  Winter v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc. , 555 \nU.S. 7, 22 (2008).  A plaintiff seeking a preliminary injunction “must establish that he is likely to \nsucceed on the merits, that he is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary \nrelief, that the balance of equities tips in his f avor, and that an injunction is in the public interest.”  \nAm. Trucking Ass’ns , Inc. v. City of Los Angeles , 559 F.3d 1046, 1052 (9th Cir. 2009) (quoting \nWinter , 555 U.S. at 20).   Case 4:25-cv-06724-JST     Document 23     Filed 09/09/25     Page 4 of 9 \n5 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  To grant preliminary injunctive relief, a court must find that “a certain threshold showing \n[has been] made on each factor.”  Leiva -Perez v. Holder , 640 F.3d 962, 966 (9th Cir. 2011) (per \ncuriam).  As to the first factor, a plaintiff is “not required to prove their claim, but only must show \nthat they [are] likely to succeed on the merits.”  Glossip v. Gross , 135 S.Ct. 2726, 2792 (2015).   \nThe Ninth Circuit employs a “sliding scale” approach to the four factors relevant to \npreliminary injunctive relief.   All. for the Wild Rockies v. Cottrell , 632 F.3d 1127, 1131 (9th Cir. \n2011) .  Under the sliding scale approach, “‘serious questions going to the merits’ and a balance of \nhardships that tips sharply towards the plaintiff can support issuance of a preliminary injunction, \nso long as the plaintiff also shows that there is a likelihood o f irreparable injury and that the \ninjunction is in the public interest.”   Id. at 1135.    \nIV. ANALYSIS  \nPlaintiffs  seek a preliminary injunction pursuant to the ACPA to prevent Defendants’ \nillegal cybersquatting  over the domain name JaredIsaacmanCourtCase.com .  15 U.S.C. § 1125 (d).  \nBecause Mr. Isaacman ’s personal name  is unlikely to be a mark entitled to protection  under \n§ 1125 (d), the court does not find that the Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits of their \nACPA claim and  denies the motion for a preliminary injunction.  \nCongress passed the ACPA in 1999, amending the Lanham Act and adding two new \ncauses of action aimed specifically at cybersquatting.  Petroliam Nasional Berhad v. \nGoDaddy.com , Inc., 737 F.3d 546, 549 (9th Cir. 2013).  “[C]ybersquatting  occurs when a person \nother than the trademark holder registers the domain name of a well -known trademark and then \nattempts to profit from this by either ransoming the domain name back to the trademark holder or \nby using the domain name to divert business from the trademark holder to the domain name \nholder.”   Bosley Med. Inst., Inc. v. Kremer , 403 F.3d 672, 680 (9th Cir.2005) (quoting \nDaimlerChrysler v. The Net, Inc. , 388 F.3d 672, 689 (6th Cir.2004)) .  To prevail on a \ncybersquatting claim under the ACPA, “ the owner of a mark, including a personal name which is \nprotected as a mark under this sec tion, if, without regard to the goods or services of the parties ” \nmust show that the  defendant:  \n(i) has a bad faith intent to profit from that mark, including a Case 4:25-cv-06724-JST     Document 23     Filed 09/09/25     Page 5 of 96 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  personal name which is protected as a mark under this section; \nand \n(ii) registers, traffics in, or uses a domain name that —\n(a)in the case of a mark that is distinctive at the time of\nregistration of the domain name, is identical or\nconfusingly similar to that mark;\n(b)in the case of a famous mark that is famous at the time of\nregistration of the domain name, is identical or\nconfusingly similar to or dilutive of that mark; or\n(c)is a trademark, word, or name protected by reason of\nsection 706 of title 18 or section 220506 of title 36.\n15 U.S.C. § 1125 (d)(1)(A).  \nHere, defendants have used Plaintiffs’ personal name in the domain name of the website, \nJaredIsaacmanCourtCase.com.  While the ACPA can apply to personal names, § 1125(d)(1)(A) \nclarifies that a cause of action is available only when the infringing domain includes “ a personal \nname which is protected as a mark under this section  [the Lanham Act].”   Plaintiffs admit that as a \ngeneral matter, personal names are not inherently distinctive and  therefore are not entitled to \ntrademark protection under the Lanham Act .  Mot. at 15.  They  contend , however, that § 1125(d)  \napplies  when the alleged cybersquatting is with regard to personal name that has  acquired a \nsecondary meaning or distinctiveness.   Id.  In the alternative, Plaintiffs argue that Mr. Isaacman’s \nname is protected because it is famous.  While the Court agree s that a  person ’s name that is not \ntrademarked could  be considered a protected mark under ACPA  if it acquires  secondary meaning , \nit finds that the plaintiffs have not established at this stage that Mr. Isaacman’s name is a mark \nwith secondary meaning.  \nUnder the Lanham Act,  a personal  name is a descriptive term.  Cairns v. Franklin Mint \nCo., 107 F. Supp. 2d 1212, 1222 (C.D. Cal. 2000) .  “A descriptive mark receives trademark \nprotection only when it establishes ‘secondary meaning ’ in the marketplace. ”  Black v. Irving \nMaterials, Inc. , 2019 WL 1995342, at *5 (N.D. Cal. May 6, 2019 ) (citing Yellow Cab Co. of \nSacramento v. Yellow Cab of Elk Grove, Inc. , 419 F.3d 925, 927 (9th Cir. 2005) ; see also  2 J. \nThomas McCarthy, McCarthy on Trademarks and Unfair Competition , § 13 :2 (5th ed. 2025 ).  \nSecondary meaning  only “occurs  when ‘in the minds of the public, the primary significance of [the \nname]  is to identify  the source of the product rather than the product itself.’”   Polin v. Behrman , \n2010 WL 11545054 at *4 (C.D. Cal. Dec. 13, 2010), aff'd, 429 F. App ’x 682 (9th Cir. 2011)  Case 4:25-cv-06724-JST     Document 23     Filed 09/09/25     Page 6 of 9 \n7 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  (citing Wal–Mart Stores, Inc. v. Samara Bros., Inc. , 529 U.S. 205, 211 (2000 )).   \nEstablishing that a personal name has acquired a secondary meaning is not easy .  In a case \nwhere Plaintiffs alleged  that the name  “Princess Diana of Wales” had acquired  the secondary \nmeaning of identifying  charitable and humanitarian services rather than the individual herself, the \ncourt wrote  that secondary meaning is not established “until the goods o r services submerge the \nprimary meaning of the name as a word identifying a person .”  Cairns , 107 F. Supp. 2d at 1222  \n(citing Visser v. Macres , 214 Cal.App.2d 249, 253  (1963) ).  The court went on to say that “[a] \nfinding of secondary meaning in this case would mean that the words ‘Diana,  Princess of Wales’ \nwould no longer primarily identify the individual, Princess Diana, but instead identify plaintiffs' \ncharitable activities.  This is an absurd contention to say the least.”   Cairns  at 1222.  \nMaking a finding that a personal name  has acquired a secondary meaning  therefore  \nrequires substantially more than a general allegation that the name of a proprietor is synonymous \nwith the services offered by a company he founded.  See Polin , 2010 WL 11545054 at *4  (finding \nthat the name of a plaintiff who  practiced family law  had not gained secondary meaning as long as \nthe name identified the plaintiff rather than services she offered).  Here, o ther than conclusory \nassertions in a declaration  filed in suppo rt of the Motion  that “Jared Isaacman”  is synonymous \nwith Shift4 , Plaintiffs provide no evidence that Mr. Isaacman’s  personal name has obtained \nsecondary meaning  such that  his name references Shift4 and its services rather than identifying \nMr. Isaacman himself .  ECF No. 16 -1 ¶4.  Instead, as is apparent from Plaintiffs ’ own declaration \nthat Mr. Isaacman is known for being an astronaut, pilot and potential NASA nominee , his \npersonal name  seems to reference only the man himself —a private citizen , albeit one of some \nnotoriety—rather than the payment processing offerings of Shift4 .  See ECF No. 16 -1 ¶5.  As a \nresult, the Court cannot conclude at this stage that Plaintiffs  possess a mark that is covered under \nthe ACPA.  \nPlaintiffs also contend that Mr. Isaacman’s name  is a mark under the ACPA  because the \nprovisions in § 1125(d)(1)(A)(ii) referencing  “famous” marks  offer protections  against \ncybersquatting  concerning the personal name of a famous person .  Mot at 15.  The statute , \nhowever , requires both that the defendant be utilizing “a mark, including a personal name Case 4:25-cv-06724-JST     Document 23     Filed 09/09/25     Page 7 of 9 \n8 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  protected as a mark under this section ” and that the statute applies to marks that are either \n“distinctive ,” “famous ,” or otherwise statutorily protected.   § 1125(d)(1)(A) (emphasis added).  \nSince Mr. Isaacman’s name has not gained secondary meaning, § 1125(d) does not offer \nprotection against cybersquatting by a domain utilizing his name simply because he is a famous \nperson .  \nEven if the fame of a name was sufficient to grant it status as a protected mark , Plaintiffs \nalso have not provided evidence to support the contention that Mr. Isaacman’s name is a “famous  \nmark” as designated by the Lanham Act .  The Lanham Act  provides that “a mark is famous if it is \nwidely recognized by the general consuming public of the United States as a designation of source \nof the goods or services of the mark's owner. ”  15 U.S.C. § 1125 (c)(2).  The Act provides that \ncourts can consider the following factors in determining whether a mark “ possesses the requisite \ndegree of recognition ” including  “(i) The duration, extent, and geographic reach of advertising and \npublicity of the mark, whether advertised or publicized by the owner or third parties ; (ii) The \namount, volume, and geogra phic extent of sales of goods or services offered under the mark ;  (iii) \nThe extent of actual recognition of the mark ;  (iv) Whether the mark was registered under the Act \nof March 3, 1881, or the Act of February 20, 1905, or on the principal register. ”  Id.  Plaintiffs do \nnot provide evidence that Mr. Isaacman’s name has been advertised or publicized widely ; that \ngoods or services have been provided for sale under Mr. Isaacman’s name specifically ; or any \nevidence of the extent of the actual recognition of h is name .  Therefore, even if fame w ere \nsufficient to establish protection for a name , Plaintiffs have not demonstrated that Mr. Isaacman’s \nname is famous for the purposes of being recognized as a mark under the Lanham Act.  \nAs a result, the Court cannot conclude, at least at this stage of the proceedings, that the Mr. \nIsaacman’s  personal name  is a “mark” for purposes of the ACPA .  While Plaintiffs’ may  be able to \nestablish that Defendants have a “ bad faith intent to profit ” utilizing Mr. Isaacman’s name in \npromoting The Lucky Trigger book  through the Books Website and Lucky Website, this does not \nsurmount the threshold showing that the Plaintiffs’ must be the owner of the protected mark that is \nbeing exploited.  § 1125(d)(1)(A).  Accordingly, the Court finds that Plaintiff has not established a \nlikelihood of success on the merits of their claims, or even raised “serious questions going to the Case 4:25-cv-06724-JST     Document 23     Filed 09/09/25     Page 8 of 99 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  merits ,” such that the Court need examine the other prongs of the preliminary injunction test. See \nWild Rockies , 632 F.3d at 1131 -1132 (9th Cir. 2011).    \nCONCLUSION  \nFor the reasons stated above, the Court DENIES Plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary \ninjunction and dissolves the temporary restraining order previous ly issued .1 \nIT IS SO ORDERED.  \nDated:   September 9, 2025  \n______________________________________  \nJON S.

    "summary": "1. **Summary:**\n   In this bankruptcy case, the Trustee, Lowell T. Cage, alleges that fraudulent transfers totaling over $7 million were made by Giant Gray, Inc. involving Ray Davis and his family, as well as several associated defendants. The court denies the Defendants' motions to dismiss, allowing the Trustee to amend the complaints to better identify unsecured creditors. The case involves a software company's proprietary artificial intelligence software, AISight, which, as significant financial investments and transactions were made regarding the company, highlights the complex interplay of technology and legal financial obligations in bankruptcy proceedings.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue:**\n   The key legal issue is whether the Trustee can establish standing and sufficiently plead claims under the Texas Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act (TUFTA) to avoid and recover alleged fraudulent transfers made by the debtor, particularly where fraudulent transfers involve intricate transactions linked to artificial intelligence assets.\n\n3. **Court's Holding:**\n   The court holds that the Trustee's complaints were initially deficient in identifying specific unsecured creditors who could avoid the transfers under applicable state law, thus granting the Trustee leave to amend his complaints to address these deficiencies. Moreover, the court finds that the initial transfer of AISight stock need not be avoided before seeking recovery from subsequent transferees.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation:**\n   Imagine a company invented a cool AI app, and people invested lots of money in it. The boss of the company allegedly took money out in a sneaky way and shared it with friends and family. The person in charge of sorting out the company's mess wants to get that money back by proving it shouldn't have been given away like that. The court says, \"Okay, try again. Just make sure to tell us clearly how it all went down and who might be missing out because of it.\" This case shows how important it is to get things clear when money and high-tech stuff are involved.",

Cage, the Chapter 7 Trustee, filed two separate but similar complaints seeking \nto avoid $591,322.68 in transfers from Debtor to Charles C. Davis and to avoid and recover \n$6,672,950 from Charles C. Davis, Racheal Johnson, Nicholas Davis, and Pepperwood Fund I, \nLLC, Assed “Ozzie” Kalil, and Michael J. O’Donnell, collectively. The Defendants filed \nmotions to dismiss the respective complaints.  For the reasons set forth herein, the Court denies \nboth mot ions to dismiss and denies Pepperwood Fund I, LLC, Assed “Ozzie” Kalil, and Michael \nJ. O’Donnell’s motion for a more definite statement.  The Court grants Trustee’s request for \nleave to amend his complaints.  \nI. Procedural History \nENTERED \n 10/22/2020\nCase 20-03127   Document 21   Filed in TXSB on 10/22/20   Page 1 of 54On May 12, 2020, Lowell T. Ca ge, the Chapter 7 Trustee (“ Trustee ”), filed a complaint \nagainst Charles C. Davis, Racheal Johnson, and Nicholas Davis (the “ Davis Defendants ”).1  On \nJune 14, 2020, the Davis Defendants filed a motion to dismiss Trustee’s complaint pursuant to \nFederal Rule  Of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) (“ Davis Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss ”).2  On July 2, \n2020, Trustee filed an objection to the motion to dismiss (“ Objection ”).3  Finally, on August 19, \n2020, Trustee filed a supplemental brief in support of his Objection.4   \nOn May 12, 2020, Trustee filed a separate complaint against Pepperwood Fund I, LLC, \nAssed “Ozzie” Kalil, and Michael J. O’Donnell (the “ Pepperwood Defendants ,” and together \nwith the Davis Defendants, the “ Defendants ”).5  On July 8, 2020, the Pepperwood Defen dants \nlikewise filed a motion to dismiss the Trustee’s complaint pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 12(b)(6), and in the alternative, a motion for a more definite statement pursuant to \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(e) (“ Pepperwood Defendants’  Motion to Dismiss ”).6  On \nAugust 19, 2020, the Trustee filed an objection to the Pepperwood Defendants’ Motion to \nDismiss (“ Objection ”).7  On September 21, 2020, the Court held a combined hearing on both \nmotions to dismiss (the “ Hearing ”).  At the conclus ion of the Hearing, the Court took both \nmatters under advisement and now issues the instant Memorandum Opinion.  \nII. Conclusions of Law  \nA. Jurisdiction and Venue  \nThis Court holds jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §  1334 , which provides “the district \ncourts shall have original and exclusive jurisdiction of all cases under title 11.”   Section 157 \n                                            \n1 20-3127, ECF No. 1.  \n2 20-3127, ECF No. 5.  \n3 20-3127, ECF No. 6.  \n4 20-3127, ECF No. 16.  \n5 20-3129, ECF No. 1.  \n6 20-3129, ECF No. 6.  \n7 20-3129, ECF No. 12.  \nCase 20-03127   Document 21   Filed in TXSB on 10/22/20   Page 2 of 54allows a district court to “refer” all bankruptcy and related cases to the bankruptcy court, wherein \nthe latter court will appro priately preside over the matter.8  This court determines that pursuant to \n28 U.S.C. § 157(b)(2)(H), this Adversary Proceeding contains core matters, as it primarily \ninvolves proceedings to recover fraudulent conveyances.9   \nFurthermore, this Court may onl y hear a case in which venue is proper.10  Pursuant to 28 \nU.S.C. §  1409(a) , “a proceeding arising under title 11 or arising in or related to a case under title \n11 may be commenced in the district court in which such case is pending.”  Debtor’s main \nChapter 7 case is presently pending in this Court and therefore, venue of this adversary \nproceeding is proper.  \nB. Constitutional Authority to Enter an Interlocutory Order  \nThis Court must evaluate whether it has constitutional authority to enter an order in this \ncase.   In Stern,  which involved a core proceeding brought by the debtor under 28 U.S.C. \n§ 157(b)(2)(C) , the Supreme Court held that a bankruptcy court “lacked the constitutional \nauthority to enter a final judgment on a state law counterclaim that is not  resolved in the process \nof ruling on a creditor’s proof of claim.”11  However, Stern is inapplicable to the instant case.  \nStern concerned final orders entered by the bankruptcy court and here, the Court need only enter \nan interlocutory order because motio ns to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), like those filed by \nthe Defendants, are interlocutory.  Entering an interlocutory order does not implicate “the \nconstitutional limitations on the Court’s authority to enter final judgments.”12  Therefore, this \nCourt need not determine whether it has constitutional authority to enter a final order because an \n                                            \n8 28 U.S.C. § 157(a); see also  In re: Order of Reference to Bankruptcy Judges, Gen. Order 2012 -6 (S.D. Tex. May \n24, 2012).   \n9 See 28 U.S.C. § 157(b)(2)(H).  \n10 28 U.S.C. §  1408.   \n11 564 U.S. at 503.  \n12 West v. WRG Energy Partners LLC (In re Noram Res., Inc.) , 2011 Bankr. LEXIS 5183, at *3 (Bankr. S.D. Tex. \nDec. 30, 2011).  \nCase 20-03127   Document 21   Filed in TXSB on 10/22/20   Page 3 of 54interlocutory order is all that is required by the instant case.13 \nIII. Analysis  \n \nA. Whether Trustee’s Request for Leave to File Amended Complaints Should be \nGranted  \n \nThis Court must first decide whether Trustee’s motion for leave to file amended \ncomplaints should be permitted.  In his replies to the Defendants’ Motions, Trustee requested \nleave, if necessary, to specifically identify which unsecured c reditors with allowable claims may \nbe able to avoid a fraudulent transfer under applicable state law, pursuant to §  544(b)(1).14  \nTrustee reiterated this request at the Hearing.  Additionally, Trustee requested leave in his reply \nto the Pepperwood Defendant s’ Motion to Dismiss to “replead more specific allegations” \nregarding Defendants Kalil and O’Donnell’s status as mediate transferees under §  550. 15  As \ndiscussed infra , the Court finds that Trustee’s current pleadings regarding the identification of \nunsecu red creditors pursuant to §  544(b)(1) are insufficient and must be amended as to Count 1 \nfor all Defendants and Count 3 for Defendant Charles Davis.  Conversely, the Court finds below \nthat Trustee pled sufficient facts as to his §  550 claim against Defenda nts Kalil and O’Donnell.   \nTrustee should be granted leave so that he can remedy the deficiencies alleged by the \nDefendants.  Because there is no valid justification to deny Trustee leave to amend, Trustee’s \nrequest is granted for the reasons hereunder.  Trustee’s request relies upon Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 15 , made applicable here through Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure 7015 .  Rule \n15 governs motions to amend a complaint made before trial and provides that “[t]he court should \n                                            \n13 See Shelton v. Aguirre & Patterson, Inc.

In his Objections, Trustee identifies 53 creditors with \nclaims totaling $6,676,262.33 based upon unpaid promissory notes Debtor executed before \nissuance of the Series A Stock to Ray Davis a nd the transfers to Charles Davis.23   \n“If proper notice was given, the court may consider such factors as undue delay, bad faith \nor dilatory motive on the part of the movant, repeated failure to cure deficiencies by amendments \npreviously allowed, undue pre judice to the opposing party, and futility of amendment when \n                                            \n16 FED.

Trustee filed his Objection eighteen days after the Davis \nDefend ants filed their Motion to Dismiss and filed his Objection to the Pepperwood Defendants’ \nMotion forty -two days after they filed.  Neither constitutes undue delay. 25  \nMoreover, Trustee’s amendments would cure the deficiencies complained of by the \nDefendants  and would not include any new claims or parties, thereby dispelling any notion that \nthis amendment is in bad faith or prejudicial to the Defendants.  Additionally, Trustee has not \npreviously sought amendments to cure deficiencies —this would constitute Tru stee’s first \namended complaint.  Lastly, the amended complaints would not be futile.  \nTo determine whether the amendment would be futile, courts apply “the same standard of \nlegal sufficiency as applies under Rule 12(b)(6) .”26  In order to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6) , \na plaintiff must meet Rule 8(a)(2) ’s pleading requirements. Rule 8(a)(2)  requires a plaintiff to \nplead “a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.”  In \nAshcroft v. Iqba l, the Supreme Court held that Rule 8(a)(2)  requires that “well -pleaded facts . . . \npermit the court to infer more than a mere possibility of misconduct.”27  Trustee’s proposed \namendments indicate who holds an allowable claim and could have brought an action under the \napplicable state law and provides the bankruptcy claim numbers for those 53 unsecured \ncreditors.28  Therefore, Trustee’s request for leave to fi le an amended complaint is granted.29 \nB.

Rule 8(a)(2) requires a plaintiff to \nplead “a short and plain stateme nt of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.”35  In \nAshcroft v.

Whether Trustee Lacks Standing to State a Claim to Avoid the Transfers Under \nApplicable State Law Pursuant to §  544(b)(1).  \n \nAs a preliminary matter and und er § 544(b)(1), Trustee must demonstrate the existence of \nan unsecured creditor that holds an allowable claim and who could avoid the transfers under state \nlaw.81  And while Trustee need not identify the creditor(s) by name, he must establish that there \nis at least one unsecured creditor who meets those criteria.82 \nIn his companion complaints, Trustee alleges that the transfers are avoidable under Texas \nUniform Frau dulent Transfer Act (“TUFTA ”) sections 24.005(a)(1), 24.005(a)(2), and 24.006(a), \nbut Trustee merely recites those statutes and does not list a single unsecured creditor who meets \nthe required criteria.83  Instead, Trustee alleges that at the time of the is suance of the Series A \nStock, there were millions of dollars owed to noteholders that Debtor could not pay,84 and in his \nObjections, Trustee alleges more specifically that there are 53 creditors with claims totaling \n$6,776,262.33, based on promissory notes that were issued before the allegedly fraudulent \ntransfers.85  Trustee provides the bankruptcy claim numbers for each of those creditors in his \nObjection to the Davis Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss, but not in his Objection to the \nPepperwood Defendants’ Moti on to Dismiss.86  Additionally, Trustee requests leave to file an \namended complaint to specifically identify creditors.87  The Court finds that Trustee has not met \nhis pleading burden because his complaints do not demonstrate the existence of an unsecured \n                                            \n81 See Katchadurian v.

Trustee’s First Cause of Action: Recovery of Immediate or Mediate Transfers \nUnder §  550 as to all Defendants.  \nTo sustain a recovery action against the Defendants, Trustee must prove each of the \nelements of 11 U.S.C. § 550.  Defendants attack each of these elements in thei r respective \nMotions to Dismiss.  The Court will consider each one in turn.   Section  550 states:  \n(a) . . . to the extent that a transfer is avoided u nder \nsection  544, 545, 547, 548, 549, 553(b) , or 724(a)  of this title, the trustee \nmay recover, for the benefit of the estate, the property transferred, or, if \nthe court so orders, the value of such property, from — \n(1) the initial transferee of such transfer or the entity for whose \nbenefit such transfer was made; or  \n(2) any immediate or mediate transferee of such initial transferee .88   \n \na. Whethe r § 550 requires actual avoidance of an initial transfer before \nrecovery is sought from immediate or mediate transferees.  \n \nThe Defendants contend that Trustee must first avoid the initial transfer of the Series A \nStock from Debtor to Ray Davis prior to seeking recovery from the Defendants because the plain \nlanguage of §  550 says “to the extent a transfer is avoided ,” not “to the extent a transfer is \navoidable .”89  The Pepperwood Defendants also compare the definition of avoid (“[t]o render \nvoid”) with avoidable or voidable (“an adjective that describes a transaction that can be avoided \n                                            \n88 11 U.S.C. §  550(a)(1) –(2). \n89 20-3127, ECF No. 5 at 3 –5 (citing Enron Corp. v.

Therefore, they conclude, because Trustee pled that the transfer is \navoidable but did not seek to avoid the transfer as to Ray Davis before this recovery action and \nhas not asked this Court to actually avoid that transfer now, the first element of §  550 has not \nbeen met.91  \nIn his Objections, Trustee counters that the initial transfer from Ray Davis need not be \navoided prior to seeking recovery from any immediate or mediate transferees92 and says that the \nsources cited by the Davi s Defendants support Trustee’s contention that the initial transfer need \nnot actually be avoided before he can recover from the Defendants.93  Trustee notes that in In re \nEnron , the bankruptcy court was reversed by the district court because the district co urt found \nthat “the plaintiff need only make ‘a declaration of avoidance against the initial transferee’ if the \ncircumstances show that no recovery against the [mediate] transferees can be accomplished \notherwise.”94  Trustee argues that no recovery could be  made against mediate transferees in this \ncase if the initial transfer had to be avoided because the initial transferee, Ray Davis, is \ndeceased.95  However, Trustee continues, the majority of cases “ require no actual avoidance of \n                                            \n90 20-3129, ECF No. 6 at 18 (citing BLACK ’S LAW DICTIONARY  (11th ed. 2019).  \n91 20-3127, ECF No. 5 at 4; 20 -3129, ECF No. 6 at 18 –19.  This Court notes that in the Summary of Complaint \nportions of Trustee’s complaints, he explicitly seeks to avoid and recover the transfers made to the Defendants \npursuant to §§ 544 and 550. See 20 -3127, ECF No. 1 at 2; 20 -3129, ECF No. 1 at 3.  The Defendants’ argument, \nhowever, is that Trustee did not seek to avoid the transfers as to Ray Davis and has not joined his estate in this \naction. Trustee, however, is not required to do so to recover from the  Defendants as discussed by the Court in this \nMemorandum Opinion.   \n92 20-3127, ECF No. 6 at 2 –4; 20 -3129, ECF No. 12 at 9 –11. \n93 20-3127, ECF No. 6 at 3.  \n94 Id. \n95 Id. \nCase 20-03127   Document 21   Filed in TXSB on 10/22/20   Page 16 of 54the initial transfer and no  showing that the initial transfer cannot practicably be avoided.”96  \nTrustee points to Richmond , cited by the Davis Defendants, as support for his position that he \nneed only prove that the initial transfer is avoidable before seeking recovery.97 \nFurther, Tr ustee argues that the sources cited by the Pepperwood Defendants either \nreflect the minority view, that a transfer must be avoided before recovery ensues, or that those \nsources actually favor Trustee’s view.98  First, Trustee cites In re Brooke Corporation , which \ncriticizes the holding in In re Slack -Horner Foundries Company and finds that the “better view” \nof § 550 is that of COLLIERS : “that a transfer may be found avoidable and a recovery may be had \nfrom a subsequent transferee without suing the initial tr ansferee.”99  Second, Trustee points out \nthat while In re Black Elk  states, “[o]nce a transfer is avoided as a preference or fraudulent \ntransfer, a trustee may then recover from ‘any immediate or mediate transferee of an initial \ntransferee,’” the very next line of the opinion says, “‘[t]o plead a subsequent transfer claim, the \nTrustee must plead that the initial transfer is avoidable, and the defendant is a [mediate] \ntransferee of that initial transfer.’”100  Therefore, Trustee concludes, he properly pleaded t hat the \ninitial transfer is avoidable and the Defendants’ motions to dismiss should be denied.101 \nAs illustrated by the parties’ contentions, courts diverge as to whether an initial transfer \nmust be avoided prior to or simultaneously with a recovery action o r whether a trustee must merely \nprove that it is avoidable before seeking recovery.  Fifth Circuit case law, what little exists, \ndiverges as well.

First, \nTrustee listed the dates and amounts of the transfers from Debtor to Charles Davis and alleged \nthat these were in addition to the salary increase Charles Davis received under a 2015 \nemployment agreement and hi s commissions for soliciting investments.  This evidence, Trustee \nalleges, proves Debtor did not receive equivalent value for the $591,322.68 in transfers. 297  \nTrustee also asserts that these transfers were made at a time when Debtor was struggling to meet \npayroll and on the verge of failing,298 when Ray Davis was looking for an “exit strategy” due to \n                                            \n290 Id. at 8. \n291 Id. \n292 Id. at 8–9. \n293 20-3127, ECF No. 12 at 17.  \n294 In re Life Partners Holdings, Inc. , 926 F.3d at 120  (declining to decide whether Rule 9(b) applies to claims of \nconstructive fraud because plaintiff’s pleadings satisfied both the Rule 8(a) standard and the Rule 9(b) standard).  \n295 See id.  \n296 20-3127, ECF No. 1 at 12 –13. \n297 Id. at 11.  \n298 Id. \nCase 20-03127   Document 21   Filed in TXSB on 10/22/20   Page 50 of 54the financial condition of Debtor and his failing health,299 and as a way to make sure Charles \nDavis was “taken care of,” in case Debtor was sold.300  Therefore, Tru stee provided the who, \nwhat, when, where, how, and why of the alleged fraud.301  These allegations also satisfy the \n“lack of reasonably equivalent value” and “financially vulnerable” prongs of Trustee’s \nconstructive fraud claims.  Second, in addition to alle ging “on information and belief” that \nDebtor “was engaged in, or was about to engage in, a business or transaction for which its \nremaining assets were unreasonably small,” Trustee alleges that Debtor was transferring large \nsums of money to Charles Davis (a  transaction),302 in addition to the salary and commissions he \nwas already being paid while Debtor was financially vulnerable, evidenced by Debtor owing \nmillions of dollars to investors on promissory notes, struggling to provide a return to investors \nbecause  it lacked a commercially viable product, and having difficulty meeting payroll \n(unreasonably small assets remaining).303  These allegations, if proven, satisfy section \n24.005(a)(2)(A).  \nLastly, as discussed thoroughly in III.C.1., Trustee’s complaint did no t sufficiently plead \nthat a creditor exists who would have standing to bring suit under TUFTA sections 24.005(a)(2) \nand 24.006(a) into whose shoes Trustee could step.  Section 24.005(a)(2) requires Trustee to \nplead that there is a creditor with an allowabl e claim that arose before or within a reasonable \ntime of the allegedly fraudulent transfer.  Section 24.006(a) requires Trustee to plead that there is \na creditor with an allowable claim that arose solely before  the fraudulent transfer.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: This court opinion involves a securities fraud class action brought against Upstart Holdings, Inc. and associated parties, concerning allegations under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Plaintiffs claim that Upstart made misleading statements about their AI underwriting model and business risks. The court partially granted and partially denied motions to dismiss, keeping certain claims against Upstart regarding misleading statements on their AI model's capabilities in the lawsuit. Upstart's AI model is central to the case as it was allegedly promoted to be superior to traditional credit scoring but did not adapt well to changing economic conditions, leading to financial losses for investors.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether Upstart Holdings misled investors by making false statements about the effectiveness and adaptability of their AI-driven lending model, causing investors to suffer losses.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court granted the Third Point Defendants' dismissal motion and partially granted the Upstart Defendants' motion. It allowed claims to proceed against Upstart regarding specific statements about the AI model's superiority, adaptability to economic changes, and temporary nature of borrowing issues, while dismissing other claims and all claims against Third Point Defendants.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine a company that uses a smart computer program to decide who gets a loan, instead of the old way using credit scores. The company told its investors how amazing and adaptable this smart program was, which caused stock prices to rise. But as the economy changed, the program didn't work as well as promised, causing stock prices to drop and investors to lose money. Investors sued, saying the company wasn't truthful about the program's capabilities. The court decided some parts of the investors' complaints had potential merit and should continue, especially about the praises sung about the computer program, while other parts of the lawsuit were dismissed.",

Marbley    : Magistrate Judge Elizabeth P. Deavers    :            :   \nOPINION & ORDER \nI. INTRODUCTION \nThe economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic  are manifold.  Th e precipitous climb \nin COVID-19 cases in the United States and arou nd the world in the spring of 2020 led to massive \nlayoffs and the hollowing out of densely-popul ated urban cores.  The federal government \nresponded with a massive stimulus program intend ed to boost an economy that had lost 23 million \njobs between January and April 2020.  And as jobs bounced back, the tightening of the labor \nmarket, combined with a sharp increase in the costs of many goods and serv ices, disruption to \nsupply chains, and other factors, led to a spike in inflation beginning in mid-2021.  To combat \ninflation, which has yet to abat e fully, the Federal Reserve (“the Fed”) began increasing interest \nrates to levels not seen since the 1980s.   \nFortunes have been made and lost during th is period.  For example, on December 16, 2020, \nUpstart Holdings, Inc. (“Upstart”), a consumer le nding startup completed its initial public offering \n(“IPO”) at $20.00.  In less than a year, its stoc k rose to a peak of $401.49; its early investors—\nincluding the investment firm, Third Point LLC (“Third Point”)—executives, and shareholders \nprofited immensely by selling high.  But as th e pandemic stimulus fundi ng came to an end and \ninterests rates began to rise, increasing the cost s of borrowing and hamper ing demand for loans, Case: 2:22-cv-02935-ALM-EPD Doc #: 68 Filed: 09/29/23 Page: 1 of 56  PAGEID #: <pageID> \n2 \n Upstart’s business flagged.  By November 8, 2022, its stock had dropped to $19.04 per share; \ninvestors who had bought in during the glory days in the fall of 2021 were left with massive losses. \nPlaintiffs, Universal-Invest ment-Gesellschaft mbHaft, a German investment firm, \nEmmanuel Sebag, and Kathy Brooks, now bring a put ative securities fraud class action, alleging \nviolations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“the Exchange Act” ), 15 U.S.C. §§ 77a–78pp, \nand the regulations promulgated thereunder, agai nst Defendants Upstart; David J. Girouard, co-\nfounder and chief executive officer (“CEO”) of Upst art and chair of its boa rd; Sanjay Datta, the \nchief financial officer (“CFO”) of Upstart; Pa ul Gu, co-founder and Senior Vice President of \nProduct and Data Science of Upstart and a member  of its board of directors; Anna Counselman, \nco-founder and Senior Vice President of People and Operations at Up start; Third Point; Third Point \nVentures LLC, the Menlo Park-based venture capita l arm of Third Point; Daniel S. Loeb, the CEO \nof Third Point; and Robert Schwar tz, the Managing Partner of Thir d Point Ventures  and a former \nmember of the Upstart board.  The Upstart Defendants1 and the Third Point Defendants2 have now \nmoved to dismiss Plaintiffs’ C onsolidated Amended Complaint (h ereinafter, “the Complaint”) \n(ECF No. 45).  Plaintiffs oppose, and additionally  seek to strike a port ion of the Third Point \nDefendants’ reply brief.   \nFor the reasons set forth more  fully below, this Court GRANTS IN PART and DENIES \nIN PART the Upstart Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss (ECF No. 58) and GRANTS  the Third Point \nDefendants’ Motion to Dismiss (ECF No. 60).  A dditionally, Plaintiffs’ Mo tion to Strike, or, in \nthe Alternative, for Leave to File a Sur-Reply (ECF  No. 65) (hereinafter “Motion to Strike”) (ECF \nNo. 65) is GRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART .   \n \n1 The Upstart Defendants consist of Upstart, Girouard, Datta, Gu, Counselman and Schwartz.  Plaintiffs \ndispute the inclusion of Schwartz in the Upstart Defendants, arguing that he is instead a Third Point Defendant.  This \nCourt rejects that characterization, for the reasons described infra .  \n2 The Third Point Defendants consist of Third Point, Third Point Ventures, and Loeb.   Case: 2:22-cv-02935-ALM-EPD Doc #: 68 Filed: 09/29/23 Page: 2 of 56  PAGEID #: <pageID> \n3 \n II. BACKGROUND \nA. Disrupting the FICO Standard \nUpstart was founded in 2012 by Gi rouard, Gu, and Counselman w ith the goal of disrupting \nthe unsecured personal loan market.  ( See Compl. ¶ 58, ECF No. 45).  Traditionally, lenders have \nevaluated a prospective borrower’s creditworthine ss by looking at her “FICO” score, which was \ndeveloped by the Fair Isaac Corporation in 1989; lenders have also relied on the FICO score to \ndetermine the interest rate to charge on loans.  Some broad contours of what goes into a FICO \nscore are known, though the precise details are no t: the score is intende d to incorporate an \nindividual’s payment hi story, amount owed, length of credit history, new credit accounts, and types \nof credit used.  See Jason Steele, How FICO Scores Are Calculated , INVESTOPEDIA  (Apr. 30, \n2022), https://perma.cc/52PK-HNXE.  The Fair Is aac Corporation has created software used by \nthe three major credit bureaus, Equifax, Experian, and Tran sUnion, who calculate credit scores \nand run credit reports.   \nGirouard, Gu, and Counselman posited that th e traditional FICO score had some serious \nlimitations—that it consider ed only a subset of the relevant variables and therefore failed to \nidentify accurately a prospective borrower’ s credit risk or price loans accurately.  ( See Compl. ¶ \n58, ECF No. 45).  An artificial  intelligence (“AI”) underwr iting model could overcome these \nlimitations by taking into account a far greater volume of variable s while also adapting on the fly \nto changing conditions.  ( See id.  ¶¶ 59, 126).  And the model coul d divine a prospective borrower’s \nfinancial potential, and not rely on their (potentially outda ted) financial history.  ( Id. ¶ 59). \nThat’s where Upstart comes in to play, with its “cloud-base d AI lending platform.”  ( Id. ¶ \n22).  Upstart’s platform matche s would-be borrowers of unsecured personal and auto loans and \nlenders, and charges a fee for fa cilitating the connection.  The pl atform is powered by an AI Case: 2:22-cv-02935-ALM-EPD Doc #: 68 Filed: 09/29/23 Page: 3 of 56  PAGEID #: <pageID> \n4 \n underwriting model, which looks at more than 1,600 variables and was trained on more than nine \n(9) million repayment events.  ( Id. ¶ 59).  Prospective borrowers, t ypically seeking a personal loan \nbetween $1,000 to $50,000, arrive at the Upstart platfo rm either directly through Upstart’s website \n(Upstart.com) or through Upstart’s bank partners .  (Upstart IPO S-1 at  8, ECF No. 58-4).  To \nreceive a loan, they apply on the Upstart platfo rm, the AI model evalua tes the borrower and the \nrequest, and the model then de cides whether to issue the lo an and at what rate.  ( See Compl. ¶ 3, \nECF No. 45).  If the request is  approved, one of Upstart’s banking partners originates the loan.  \nNormally, the banking partner would then hold on to the loan.  But Upstart also had an agreement \nwith its partners, pursuant to whic h the banks were not required to re tain the loans they originated: \nthey could choose to keep only those loans that th ey wanted, and sell any undesired loans back to \nUpstart.  ( See id.  ¶ 65).  Upstart would then turn around and sell the loans to inst itutional investors, \nas whole loans, pass-thro ugh certificates, or re-pac kaged as asset-backed securities (“ABSs”).  ( See \nid. ¶¶ 61, 66, 73).   \nIn other words, Upstart’s business model is to “partner[] with traditi onal banks and . . . not \n[to] use its own balance sheet.”  ( Id. ¶ 63).  As Jim Cramer, host of  CNBC’s “Mad Money” program \nsummarized: “Upstart uses data and its AI technol ogy to facilitate [loans]. . . . They don’t lend \nmoney themselves.  They’re a ma rketplace that matches borrowers  and lenders.  They take a \nreferral fee.”  ( Id.) (alteration in original) (emphasis omitte d).  The referral fee is paid by the banks \nin exchange for access to Upstar t’s AI lending platform, and its lo an application data, underwriting, \nfraud detection, and documentation delivery services.  ( Id. ¶ 62).   \nIn theory, this setup provides  substantial value to  everyone involved.  Up start claimed that \nits AI underwriting model would generate “better” loans for Upstart’s bank partners than \ntraditional FICO-based models—with “higher approva l rates and lower interest rates at the same Case: 2:22-cv-02935-ALM-EPD Doc #: 68 Filed: 09/29/23 Page: 4 of 56  PAGEID #: <pageID> \n5 \n loss rate.”  ( Id. ¶ 126).  It would also insulate Upstart from the credit risk associated with the loans \nthemselves, since Upstart would simply facilita te lending between borrowers and its banking \npartners, without holding any long-te rms loans on its balance sheet.  ( Id. ¶¶ 3, 60, 63).  \nB. Upstart’s Stock Skyrockets Post-IPO \nIn 2015, Upstart closed a $35 million Series C fundraising round led by Third Point, at a \nvaluation of $145 million.  ( See id.  ¶ 67).  Upstart continued to gr ow and raise more capital in \nsubsequent funding rounds; Third Point continued to invest.  ( See id. ).  In total, Third Point \ncommitted $66 million to Upstart prior to the IPO.  ( Id.).  And it was not a hands-off investor.  \nRather, Plaintiffs allege that Third Point activel y advised Upstart on various  aspects of corporate \nstrategy, including its organizational devel opment, staffing, and business plans.  ( See id.  ¶ 68).  \nSchwartz, the Managing Partner of Third Point Ventures, took a seat on Upstart’s board of \ndirectors.  ( Id. ¶¶ 69–70).  Third Point also contributed in  other ways, purchasing loans generated \nby the Upstart platform.  ( Id. ¶¶ 72–73).   \nDespite the immediate economic downturn cau sed by the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic \nin March and April 2020, the second half of the year was rife with  major technology startup IPOs.  \nCompanies like DoorDash and Airb nb went public in early December;  Upstart soon followed suit.  \n(See id.  ¶ 83).  Almost all of Upstar t’s revenue, at this point, was ge nerated through the fees it was \ncharging its banking partners for access to the platfo rm, loan referrals, and servicing the loans.  \n(See id.  ¶ 64).  It held very few loans: approximately 22% of th e loans generated by the Upstart \nplatform were funded ( i.e., held) by Upstart’s banking partners , and 76% by credit investors.  ( Id.).  \nIn other words, Upstart held on to only 2% of th e loans generated via its platform, despite the buy-\nback arrangement it had with its  banking partners.  Demand for its loans from credit investors \nremained robust, so it coul d move any repurchased loans off its books quickly.  ( See id.  ¶¶ 61, 66, Case: 2:22-cv-02935-ALM-EPD Doc #: 68 Filed: 09/29/23 Page: 5 of 56  PAGEID #: <pageID> \n6 \n 73).  Revenue generated from interest payments on the loans it retained represented a negligible \nportion of its overall revenue.  ( Id.).   \nUpstart debuted on the Nasdaq exchange on December 16, 2020, at $20.00 per share under \nthe symbol “UPST.”  ( Id. ¶ 83).  Third Point immediately pur chased 1.2 million additional shares \nof Upstart stock.  ( Id.).  Analysts were bullis h on Upstart stock from th e beginning, as they were \nimpressed with Upstart and its platform—especia lly the “best-in-class” AI underwriting model \nand the low rate of loans held by Upstart.  ( See id.  ¶¶ 85–86).  These attr ibutes suggested that \nUpstart would be able to continue keeping risk low (by virtue of having  few volatile liabilities, \nlike personal loans), while main taining strong fee revenue.   \nExternal factors also contribu ted to Upstart’s early post-IPO success.  In response to the \neffects of the pandemic on the economy, the federa l government pulled a se ries of levers to \nstimulate the economy, including interest rate cu ts, monetary benefits (including direct cash \npayments, subsidies, and tax credits) to individu als, loans to businesses, and a moratorium on \nmortgage foreclosures and loan repayments.  ( See id.  ¶¶ 74–81).  Because of the stimulus, the \neconomy was “awash in money”: indi viduals had extra cash in hand, we re not obligated to service \nstudent loan payments immediately,  and enjoyed easy access to credit. \nImmediately after the passage of  the American Rescue Plan Act (“ARPA”) in early April \n2021, which consisted of a $1.9 trillion stimulus p ackage, Upstart announced a secondary public \noffering (“SPO”), i.e., the sale of further sh ares of the company on the public market.  ( Id. ¶ 92).  \nThis time, Upstart marked its share price at $120.00 per share.  ( Id.).  Upstart, its executives, and \ndirectors once again touted the strength of the Upstart business model, platform, and AI model, \nreiterating in both public disclosures filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and its first public earnings cal l that the AI underwriting model was nimble and “able to respond Case: 2:22-cv-02935-ALM-EPD Doc #: 68 Filed: 09/29/23 Page: 6 of 56  PAGEID #: <pageID> \n7 \n to the sort of macroeconomic changes on really a dime,” and that Upstart carried very little loan \nrisk because demand for Upstart-generated loan s from banks and investor s remained strong.  ( Id. \n¶ 94; see id.  ¶¶ 91, 93–96).     \nUpstart’s stock price continued to climb af ter the SPO, reaching a high of $401.49 per share \non October 15, 2021.  ( See id.  ¶ 97).  The continued optimism wa s driven at leas t in part by the \nlack of credit exposure that Up start continued to maintain and by the outstanding re putation of the \nAI model.  ( See id.  ¶¶ 98–99).  The Upstart Defendants cont inued to tell inve stors, through public \nfilings and statements, that both remained true, even as the stimulus programs came to a close and interest rates began to rise.  It was also driven  by impressive increases in  Upstart’s revenue, rising \nfrom $86.7 million in the fourth qua rter of 2020, to $194 million for the second qua rter of 2021, \n$228 million for the third quart er, and $305 million for the fi nal quarter of the year. \nBehind the scenes, however, Upstart executives a nd insiders had begun to sell their stock.  \nThe executives had been subject to a 181- day lock-up period after the IPO.  ( See IPO S-1 at 80, \n210, ECF No. 58-4).  Upon the expiration of the lock-up period, Girouard, Gu, and Counselman \nall sold substantial amounts of their Upstart stock.  ( See Compl. ¶ 275, ECF No. 45).  Counselman \nsold 608,355 shares on August 19, 2021, raking in over $122 million in proceeds.  ( Id.).  Girouard \nsold approximately 90,000–140,000 shares at the beginning of each month from September 2021 \nto May 2022; in total, he sold approximately one (1) million shares for nearly $204 million.  ( Id.).  \nAnd Gu also sold shares on a regular schedul e: 155,000 shares in the middle of the month in \nAugust, September, and October 2021, and smalle r chunks in November 2021 and the March 2022.  \n(Id.).  His stock sales ge nerated $143.6 million.  ( Id.).  \nThird Point also exited its Upstart position ar ound the same time.  In total, it had acquired \nnearly 20% control of Upstart th rough its early investments and th e IPO.  It sold around one (1) Case: 2:22-cv-02935-ALM-EPD Doc #: 68 Filed: 09/29/23 Page: 7 of 56  PAGEID #: <pageID> \n8 \n million shares over three days in  August 24, then sold the remain ing 12 million shares it owned \nbetween November 15 and December 20, 2021.  ( Id.).  Third Point earned over $2.2 billion from \nfully liquidating its position in Upstart.  ( Id.).  \nC. The Stock Plummets as Interest Rates Rise \nIn retrospect, the fall of  2021—when Girouard, Gu, and C ounselman began selling their \nshares in Upstart stock, and Third Point fully sold its position—was when Up start’s stock peaked.   \nOn November 9, 2021, Upstart announced its financ ial results for the thir d quarter of 2021 (“Q3 \n2021”).  While total revenue and total fee revenue  had both risen dramatically, so too had the \namount of loans that Upstart retained on its balance sheet.  ( See id. ¶ 298).  Upstart’s stock price \nfell by over 18% in the wake of the announcement, from $313.71 at closing on N ovember 9, 2021, \nto $256.59 the following day.  ( Id. ¶ 299).  Girouard explained on the earnings call that followed \nthat this increase was not a concern, because Upstart’ s bank partners continued to have faith in the \nAI underwriting model and demand for the loans remained  strong (despite the fact that Upstart \nwas holding on to more loans).  ( See id.  ¶ 104).  The bulk of Third Point’s stock sales occurred in \nthe month following the release of Q3 financial results.  ( See id.  ¶¶ 106–108).   \nIn the months that followed, Up start’s financial results continued to worsen as loans on the \nbalance sheet continued to grow, from $130 million at the end of Q3 2021 to $252 million at the \nend of Q4 2021, and then to $604 million at the end of Q1 2022.  ( Id. ¶¶ 108, 112).  During the \nFebruary 2022 earnings call, Upstar t executives maintained that the increase in loans held during \nQ4 2021 was not a cause for concern, that the lo ans were priced correc tly, and that the AI \nunderwriting model had no problem accounting fo r rapidly increasing interest rates.  ( See id.  ¶¶ \n110–111).  Datta explained the increase in loans as a “temporary” issue, associated entirely with \nresearch and development for a planned expans ion into the automobile lending sector.  ( Id. ¶ 109).  Case: 2:22-cv-02935-ALM-EPD Doc #: 68 Filed: 09/29/23 Page: 8 of 56  PAGEID #: <pageID> \n9 \n The Upstart executives also waved away concerns a bout rising loan default rates, which had been \nabnormally low as the stimulus package buoyed the economy but had begun to creep up to \n“normal,” pre-stimulus levels.  ( See id.  ¶ 110). \nIt turned out that there was in fact cause fo r concern.  After Upstar t announced the massive \nincrease in loans held during Q1 2022, Datta explained on an earnings call that Upstart had started \nto use its balance sheet as a “fundi ng buffer” to hold on to loans th at it could not immediately off-\nload.  ( See id.  ¶ 112).  That is, Upstart was being forced to  retain loans that ha d been sold back to \nit by its banking partners and that it was unabl e to repackage and sell to investors.  ( Id. ¶ 114).  \nThis, in turn, exposed the company to interest and credit risk.   \nThe market responded negatively in the wake of  the earnings report and call.  The price of \nUpstart stock dropped a further 56%, and analysts suggested that Upstart’s value proposition as a \nmarketplace lender— i.e., as a facilitator between  borrowers and lenders—was  untenable if it could \nnot pass on the loans generated by its platfo rm to external funding partners.  ( See id.  ¶¶ 115–117).  \nThe stock price continued to drop after Upstart cut its earnings guidance for Q2 2022 on July 7, \n2022, and Girouard admitted that Upstart was “fu nding-constrained” vis-à- vis the loans, and had \nconverted some loan on its balan ce sheet into cash at a loss.  ( See id.  ¶¶ 118–119).   \nOn November 8, 2022, Upstart announced a 31% decrease in revenue for Q3 2022 \ncompared to the prio r year, and a net loss of $58.1 million.  ( Id. ¶ 305).  This was attributed \nprimarily to a substantial decrease in loans ge nerated by Upstart’s platform, due to the Fed’s \ndecision to continuing raising inte rest rates, which in turn incr eased the costs of borrowing and \ndepressed demand for loans.  ( See id.  ¶ 305).  Previously, Girouard ha d indicated that the AI model \nwas “rate agnostic,” but he and Datta, in disc ussing Upstart’s Q3 2021 performance, acknowledged Case: 2:22-cv-02935-ALM-EPD Doc #: 68 Filed: 09/29/23 Page: 9 of 56  PAGEID #: <pageID> \n10 \n that higher interest rates had led to the AI model underwriting pricing loans at higher annual \npercentage rates (“APRs”), i.e., higher loan interest payments.  ( Id. ¶¶ 111, 305–06).   \nThe next day, Upstart stock dropped to a low of $17.06.  ( Id. ¶ 122).   \nD. Procedural Background  \nIn the wake of the events described above, se veral individuals and i nvestment firms filed \nsuit in this Court and in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California alleging \nviolations of federal securi ties laws and regulations.3  The plaintiffs in each of these cases asserted, \non behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated, that Upstart, its executives and other \ninsiders, and Third Point had engaged in securi ties fraud, including the disse mination of material \nmisstatements.  Plaintiffs in the Northern District of California voluntarily dismissed their cases.  \n(See Unopposed Mot. for Appointment as Lead Counsel  at 2 n.3, ECF No. 17).  Plaintiffs in this \nCourt consolidated their efforts behind Univer sal-Investment-Gesellschaft mbHaft as Lead \nPlaintiff, pursuant to 15 U. S.C. § 78u-4(a)(1).  ( See generally id. ).  Separately, several individuals \nalso filed derivative actions nomin ally on behalf of Upstart in th is Court; those cases have been \nconsolidated and stayed pending a decision in this case.  ( See also ECF, No. 2:22-cv-02961).   \nOn December 5, 2022, Lead Plaintiff Univer sal-Investment-Gesellschaft mbHaft and \nPlaintiffs Sebag and Brooks submitted their Cons olidated Amended Complaint (ECF No. 45).  The \ncomplaint asserts a putative class action, involvi ng three counts: (1) viola tions of § 10(b) of the \nExchange Act and SEC Rule 10b-5 against all defendant s; (2) violations of § 20(a) of the Exchange \nAct against Girouard, Gu, Counselman, Datta, Schw artz, Third Point, and Third Point Ventures; \nand (3) violations of § 20A of the Exchange Act against Girouar d, Gu, Counselman, Third Point, \nThird Point Ventures, and Loeb.  ( See generally id. ).  Plaintiffs pro pose a Class Period of \n \n3 Upstart is co-headquartered in San Francisco, within th e jurisdiction of the Northern District of California, \nand in Columbus, within the jurisdiction of this Court. Case: 2:22-cv-02935-ALM-EPD Doc #: 68 Filed: 09/29/23 Page: 10 of 56  PAGEID #: <pageID> \n11 \n December 16, 2020, through November 8, 2022.  (Compl. ¶ 1, ECF No. 45).  The Upstart \nDefendants and the Third Point Defendant s have each filed a motion to dismiss.4  Plaintiffs oppose, \nand separately move to strike a portion of the Third Point Defenda nts’ reply brief in support of \ntheir motion to dismiss.  All motions are now ripe for review. \nIII. STANDARD OF REVIEW \nA motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) operates to evaluate the sufficiency of the \ncomplaint and permits dismissal of  a complaint for “fai lure to state a clai m upon which relief can \nbe granted.”  F ED. R. CIV. P. 12(b)(6).  Such a motion “is a test of the plaintiff’s cause of action as \nstated in the complaint, not a challenge to the plaintiff’s factual allegations.”  Golden v. City of \nColumbus , 404 F.3d 950, 958–59 (6th Cir. 2005) (citation o mitted).  Accordingly, the Court must \n“construe the complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, accept its allegations as true, \nand draw all reasonable inferences  in favor of the plaintiff.”  In re Travel Agent Comm’n Antitrust \nLitig. , 583 F.3d 896, 903 (6th Cir. 2009) (quoting Jones v. City of Cincinnati , 521 F.3d 555, 559 \n(6th Cir. 2008)).  Although the c ourt’s primary focus will be on th e allegations in the complaint, \nthe court may also consider “any exhibits attached  thereto, public records, items appearing in the \nrecord of the case and exhibits attached to the de fendant’s motion so long as  they are referred to \nin the Complaint and are central to the claims contained therein.”  Bassett v. Nat’l Collegiate \nAthletic Ass’n , 528 F.3d 426, 430 (6th Cir. 2008) (citation omitted). \nTo survive a motion to dismiss, “the plaintiff must allege facts that, if accepted as true, are \nsufficient to raise a right to relief above the specul ative level and to state a claim to relief that is \nplausible on its face.”  Hensley Mfg. v. ProPride, Inc. , 579 F.3d 603, 609 (6th Cir. 2009) (internal \nquotation marks omitted) (citing Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly , 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007)).  A \n \n4 The Third Point Defendants incorporated by refere nce the Upstart Defendants’ motion to dismiss. Case: 2:22-cv-02935-ALM-EPD Doc #: 68 Filed: 09/29/23 Page: 11 of 56  PAGEID #: <pageID> \n12 \n claim is considered plausible on its face “when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the \ncourt to draw the reason able inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.”  Id. \n(quoting Ashcroft v. Iqbal , 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009)).  And th ough the court “must accept all well-\npleaded factual allegations in the complaint as tr ue,” the court “need not ‘accept as true a legal \nconclusion couched as a factual allegation.’”  Id. (quoting Twombly , 550 U.S. at 555).   \nBut when a plaintiff’s claims sound in fraud, she must sa tisfy a more stringent burden.  \nRule 9(b) requires that allegations of fraud “state  with particularity the circumstances constituting \nfraud or mistake.”  F ED. R. CIV. P. 9(b); see also United States ex rel. SNAPP, Inc. v. Ford Motor \nCo., 532 F.3d 496, 504 (6th Cir. 2008)  (noting that this  heightened require ment “reflects the \nrulemakers’ additional understand ing that, in cases involving fraud and mistake, a more specific \nform of notice is necessary to permit a defendant to draft a responsive pleading” (internal quotation \nmarks and citation omitted)).  Particularity, in this context, requires at mini mum allegations of “the \ntime, place, and content of the alleged misrepresentation on which he  or she relied; the fraudulent \nscheme; the fraudulent intent of the defendants;  and the injury resulting from the fraud.”  Bennett \nv. MIS Corp. , 607 F.3d 1076, 1100 (6th Cir. 2010) (quoting Yuhasz v. Brush Wellman, Inc. , 341 \nF.3d 559, 563 (6th Cir. 2003)).  \nAdditionally, the Private Secu rities Litigation Re form Act of 1995 (“PSLRA”), Pub. L. \nNo. 104-67, 109 Stat. 737 (codified as amended in scattered sections of 15 U.S.C.), sets out \nadditional standards applicable specifically to al legations of securities fraud.  The PSLRA requires \nplaintiffs to “specify each statement alleged to have been misleading, the reason or reasons why \nthe statement is misleading, and, if an allegation regarding the statement or omission is made on \ninformation and belief, . . .  [to] state with partic ularity all facts on which that belief is formed.”  \n15 U.S.C. § 78u-4(b)(1)(B).  She must also “state with particularity facts giving rise to a strong Case: 2:22-cv-02935-ALM-EPD Doc #: 68 Filed: 09/29/23 Page: 12 of 56  PAGEID #: <pageID> \n13 \n inference that the defendant acted with the required state of mind”— i.e., with the requisite scienter.  \nId. § 78u-4(b)(2)(A); see also Tellabs, Inc. v. Makor Issues & Rights, Ltd. , 551 U.S. 308, 313 \n(2007).  This “strong inference” of scienter “must be cogent and at leas t as compelling as any \nopposing inference of nonfraudulent intent.”  Tellabs , 551 U.S. at 314; see also id.  at 324.  Taken \ntogether, “Rule 9(b) and the PSLRA require a co mplaint to allege the ‘who, what, where, when, \nand why’ of the fraudulent statements.”  City of Taylor Gen. Emps. Ret. Sys. v. Astec Indus. , 29 \nF.4th 802, 810 (6th Cir. 2022) (citation omitted).   \nIV. LAW & ANALYSIS \nA. Preliminary Matters \nThis Court first addresses Plai ntiffs’ Motion to Strike (ECF No. 65) before turning to the \nmotions to dismiss.  In the Third Point Defend ants’ opening brief in support of their motion to \ndismiss, they argue inter alia that the stock sales that Plaintiffs  allege are evidence of insider \ntrading were, in fact, co nducted in the ordinary course of business for a venture capital firm like \nThird Point.  ( See Third Point Memo. in Supp. of Mot. to  Dismiss (“TP MTD” ) at 5, 12, ECF No. \n60-1).  Instead, they write, th e stock sales “strongly support th e competing inference of non-\nfraudulent conduct.”  ( Id. at 12).  Plaintiffs opposed this ar gument, countering th at the Third Point \nDefendants had failed to present a non-fraudulent e xplanation for the stock sales, which Plaintiffs \nview as “anything but normal or rou tine” and as “suspi ciously timed.”  ( See Resp. in Opp’n to \nThird Point Mot. to Dismiss (“TP Opp’n”) at 15,  ECF No. 62).  The Third Point Defendants reply, \nexplaining that the stock sales were routine, re ferencing the firm’s “exit[] [from] several other \ntechnology companies around the same time as it exited Upstart.”  (Third Point Reply Br. at 14, \nECF No. 64).  They suggest that their SEC filings corroborate this trading pattern.   Case: 2:22-cv-02935-ALM-EPD Doc #: 68 Filed: 09/29/23 Page: 13 of 56  PAGEID #: <pageID> \n14 \n Plaintiffs now assert that th is line of argument and the inco rporation of the December 2021 \nand March 2022 Form 13F documents “impermissibl y attempt[] to offer ne w legal arguments and \ninformation from new extrinsic materials.”  (Mot. to Strike at 1, ECF No. 65).   Their motion poses \nthree questions: (1) whether the Third Point Defe ndants have improperly raised an argument for \nthe first time on reply; (2) whethe r this Court may take judicial notice of Third Point’s Forms 13F; \nand (3) whether Plaintiffs should be permitted to fi le a sur-reply if this Court decides not to strike \nthe argument and the forms.  This Court addresses each question in turn. \nFirst , it is well-settled that a m ovant “cannot raise new issues in a reply brief; [s]he can \nonly respond to arguments raised for the first time  in [the nonmovant’s] br ief” or issues already \ndiscussed in her opening brief.  United States v. Jerkins , 871 F.2d 598, 602 n.3 (6th Cir. 1989) \n(citation omitted); In re FirstEnergy Corp. Sec. Litig. , 316 F. Supp. 2d 581, 599 (N.D. Ohio 2004) \n(same).  This rule is not meant to prevent a movant from elaborating on her prior arguments, \nproposing new examples that illustrate her point, or parrying her opponent’s  thrusts in her reply \nbrief.  Rather, it bars only those arguments that are genuinely new.  See, e.g. , United States v. \nCampbell , 279 F.3d 392, 401 (6th Cir. 2002) (disposing of an ar gument that the liti gant “failed to \nraise, even perfunctorily . . . in his original brief”).   And this makes sense.  The rule is in place to \nensure that the non-movant is on noti ce and has an opportunity to respond.  See also Knighten v. \nComm’r of Internal Revenue , 702 F.2d 59, 60 n.1 (5th Cir. 1983), cert. denied , 464 U.S. 897 \n(1983).  When a movant is simply discussing a vari ation on a theme in her re ply brief rather than \na new melody, the non-movant has already been placed on notice and there is no prejudice.   \nThat is the case here.  The allegedly new argument (that Third Point’s stock sales coincided \nwith its exit from other holdings) is  a continuation of an issue alre ady discussed in the Third Point \nDefendants’ opening brief (that Thir d Point’s stock sales were consis tent with its ordinary business Case: 2:22-cv-02935-ALM-EPD Doc #: 68 Filed: 09/29/23 Page: 14 of 56  PAGEID #: <pageID> \n15 \n dealings), and is directly responsive to the count erarguments raised in Pl aintiffs’ opposition (that \nthe opposite is true).  That is, the Third Poin t Defendants’ opening brie f clearly signaled their \ndisagreement with the inferences Plaintiffs drew from the stock sale, and their reply brief provided \nfurther explanation for that disagreement.  Cf. In re FirstEnergy , 316 F. Supp. 2d at 599 \n(dismissing an attack on scienter th at “Defendants failed to even passi ngly raise . . . in their original \nmotion”).  Hence, the challenged argument was not  improperly raised for the first time in a reply \nbrief.  \nSecond , courts are generally prohibited from cons idering materials outside the pleadings \non a motion to dismiss, but can consider “other s ources courts ordinarily examine when ruling on \nRule 12(b)(6) motions to dismiss, in particular , documents incorporated into the complaint by \nreference, and matters of which a court may take judicial notice.”  Tellabs , 551 U.S. at 322 (citation \nomitted).  Courts may take judicial notice of “a fact that  is not subject to reasonable dispute because \nit: (1) is generally known within the trial court’s te rritorial jurisdiction; or  (2) can be accurately \nand readily determined from sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned.”  F ED. R. \nEVID. 201(b).  While document s filed with the SEC ar e typically considered public records subject \nto judicial notice, see Lovelace v. Software Spectrum Inc. , 78 F.3d 1015, 1018 (5th Cir. 1996) \n(allowing for judicial notice of “public disclosure documents whic h (1) are required to be filed \nwith the SEC, and (2) are actually filed with the SE C”), it is important to remember that courts can \n“not consider the statements contained in [an SEC filing] for the truth of the matter asserted [] at \nthe motion-to-dismiss stage.”  In re Omnicare, Inc. Sec. Litig. , 769 F.3d 455, 467 (6th Cir. 2014) \n(citations omitted); see also Lovelace , 78 F.3d at 1018.   \nThe documents the Third Point Defendants seek to introduce—Form s 13F—were filed by \nThird Point with the SEC.  Thus, they fall into th e category of public documents that can be subject Case: 2:22-cv-02935-ALM-EPD Doc #: 68 Filed: 09/29/23 Page: 15 of 56  PAGEID #: <pageID> \n16 \n to judicial notice.  But the Third Point Defendant s rely on the Forms 13F for the truth of the matter \nasserted therein.5  They suggest that the stock transacti ons listed therein, ta ken as true, support \ntheir argument that their trades vis- à-vis Upstart were not suspicious.  ( See Third Point Reply Br. \nat 14, ECF No. 64).  Because this is an improper use of the documents, th is Court strikes these \nForms 13F exhibits.  See In re FirstEnergy , 316 F. Supp. 2d at 592; In re Omnicare , 769 F.3d at \n467; see also Khoja v. Orexigen Therapeutics, Inc. , 899 F.3d 988, 999 (9th Cir. 2018) (“Just \nbecause the document itself is susceptible to judi cial notice does not mean that every assertion of \nfact within that document is judi cially noticeable for its truth.”); Passa v. City of Columbus , 123 \nF. App’x 694, 697 (6th Cir. 2005) (collecting cases). \nFinally , Plaintiffs ask to submit a sur-reply if this C ourt finds that striki ng the Third Point \nDefendants’ argument is unwarrant ed.  (Mot. to Strike at 7–8, EC F No. 65).  Although the Federal \nRules of Civil Procedure do not ex plicitly contemplate the filing of sur-replies, this Court’s Local \nRules permit additional memoranda “upon l eave of court for good cause shown.”  S.D.  OHIO CIV. \nR. 7.2(a)(2).  The Rules do not define good cause, but  the Sixth Circuit has noted that additional \nfilings “may be allowed in the appropriate ci rcumstances, especially ‘[w]hen new submissions \nand/or arguments are included in a reply brief, and a non-movant’s ability to respond to the new \nevidence has been vitiated.’”  Key v. Shelby Cnty. , 551 F. App’x 262, 265 (6th Cir. 2014) (alteration \nin original) (quoting Seay v. Tenn. Valley Auth. , 339 F.3d 454, 481 (6th Cir. 2003)).  But a party’s \ndesire to point out mischaracteriza tions or misrepresentations of caselaw, even if helpful, does not \nprovide grounds for the filing of sur-replies.  See Little Hocking Water Ass’n, Inc. v. E.I. Du Pont \nde Nemours & Co. , No. 2:09-cv-01081, 2014 WL 12651139, at *2 (S.D. Ohio Oct. 31, 2014).   \n \n5 By contrast, it would be permissible to rely on the co ntents of SEC filings to de monstrate what statements \nor disclosures were made by corporate defendants in assessi ng whether they have violated their duty to disclose under \nRule 10b-5.  See, e.g. , In re Direct Gen. Corp. Sec. Litig. , 398 F. Supp. 2d 888, 893 (M.D. Tenn. 2005).   Case: 2:22-cv-02935-ALM-EPD Doc #: 68 Filed: 09/29/23 Page: 16 of 56  PAGEID #: <pageID> \n17 \n Because this Court concludes that the Thir d Point Defendants’ alleged “new argument” \nwas not an improper new argument, c ontrary to Plaintiffs’ assertions, see supra , Plaintiffs have \nfailed to demonstrate “good cause” justifying the fi ling of a sur-reply.  Moreover, even a cursory \nreview of Plaintiffs’ proposed su r-reply reveals that the filing is  dedicated almost entirely to \ndistinguishing the Third Point De fendants’ cited cases and explaining how they have improperly \ncharacterized the reasoni ng in those decisions.  ( See generally  Proposed Sur-Reply, ECF No. 65-\n1).  Permission to file a sur-reply is not warranted under such circumstances. \nAccordingly, Plaintiffs’ Motion to Strike (ECF No. 65) is GRANTED IN PART and \nDENIED IN PART .  This Court STRIKES  the Forms 13F proffered by the Third Point \nDefendants.  This Court will nevertheless consider all arguments raised in th eir reply brief, but not \nthose contained in Plaint iffs’ proposed sur-reply.  \nB. Securities Fraud (Count I) \nSection 10(b) of the Exchange  Act prohibits “directly or indirectly . . . us[ing] or \nemploy[ing], in connection with the purchase or sa le of any security re gistered on a national \nsecurities exchange . . . any manipulative or dece ptive device or contrivance in contravention of \nsuch rules and regulations as the [Securiti es and Exchange] Commission may prescribe as \nnecessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of inve stors.”  15 U.S.C. § \n78j(b).  Pursuant to this directive, the SEC has promulgated Rule 10b-5, which prohibits three \ntypes of actions: (1) “employ[ing] any device, sc heme, or artifice to defraud,” (2) “mak[ing] any \nuntrue statement of a material fact  or [] omit[ting] to state a mate rial fact necessary in order to \nmake the statements made, in the light of th e circumstances under which they were made, not \nmisleading,” and (3) “engag[ing] in any act, prac tice, or course of business which operates or \nwould operate as a fraud or deceit up on any person.”  17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5. Case: 2:22-cv-02935-ALM-EPD Doc #: 68 Filed: 09/29/23 Page: 17 of 56  PAGEID #: <pageID> \n52 \n and abetted the deceptive scheme and not that thei r actions were themselves deceptive, fail to state \na claim under Rule 10b-5(a) and (c).  Th e scheme liability claim is therefore DISMISSED as to \nthe Third Point Defendants.  \nD. Control Liability (Count II) \nSection 20(a) of the Exchange Act allows plaintiffs to hold liable “[e]very person who, \ndirectly or indirectly, co ntrols any person liable under any provisi on of this chapter or of any rule \nor regulation thereunder.”  15 U. S.C. § 78t(a).  A plai ntiff asserting a claim pursuant to Section \n20(a) must show that the contro lled individual committed “an underlyi ng violation of the securities \nlaws or the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder” and that “the ‘controlling person’ \ndefendant . . . directly or indirectly controlled the person liable fo r the securities law violation.”  \nPR Diamonds, Inc. , 364 F.3d at 696 (citation om itted).  “Control” is defi ned by regulation as “the \npossession, direct or indirect, of th e power to direct or cause the direction of the management and \npolicies of a person, whether through the ownership of  voting securities, by cont ract, or otherwise.”  \n17 C.F.R. § 230.405.  Courts have read this provisi on as requiring plaintiffs  to plead that the \ndefendant had “the practical ab ility to direct the actions of  the people who committed the \nviolation.”  In re Nat’l Century Fin. Enters., Inc. , 504 F. Supp. 2d 287, 300 (S.D. Ohio 2007) \n(internal quotation marks a nd citation omitted).  Some  courts further require that plaintiffs prove \nthe actual exercise of control;  the Sixth Circuit has not spoke n on whether this is required.16  See \nalso In re FirstEnergy , 2022 WL 681320, at *30. \n \n16 In Sanders Confectionary Prods., Inc. v. Heller Fin., Inc. , the Sixth Circuit cited approvingly the Eighth \nCircuit’s test, which requires a plaintiff show both the authority to control and actual control.  973 F.2d 474, 486 (6th \nCir. 1992) (citing Metge v. Baehler , 762 F.2d 621, 631 (8th Cir. 1985)).  As this Court once noted:  \n \nIn Sanders,  the Sixth Circuit described the standard applied in Metge  as the “least rigorous” one \navailable.  Since Sanders  was decided, courts in the Fifth and Ninth Circuits have applied a less \nrigorous standard.  Though other district courts in this circuit view Sanders  as approving the Metge  \nstandard, the Sixth Circuit expressly declined to adopt a standard for controlling person liability.  Case: 2:22-cv-02935-ALM-EPD Doc #: 68 Filed: 09/29/23 Page: 52 of 56  PAGEID #: <pageID> \n53 \n In seeking to dismiss this claim, the Upstart Defendants argue that Plai ntiffs have failed to \nplead adequately a predicate violation of federal securities laws and regulations.  The Third Point \nDefendants adopt that argument, a nd further suggest that Plaintif fs’ allegations of control are \ninadequate.  ( See Upstart MTD at 37, ECF No. 58-1; TP MTD at 13–17, ECF No. 60-1).  The first \nargument can be dealt with easily: as discussed a bove, Plaintiffs have ade quately pled that the \nUpstart Defendants violated Sectio n 10(b) of the Exchange Act, which satisfies the “underlying \nviolation” requirement of a control liability claim.  \nAs to the second argument, the Third Point Defendants challenge both the premise that \nthey possessed the power to control Upstart’s acti ons and the proposition that they exercised that \npower.  The following facts, acco rding to Plaintiffs, show that the Third Point Defendants had the \npower to control Upstart: first, that Third Point held almo st 20% of Upst art’s stock; second , that \nSchwartz sat on Upstart’s board; and third , that Third Point was actively involved in Upstart’s \norganizational development, staf fing and talent acquisition, and go-to-market and capital market \nstrategies.  ( See Compl. ¶¶ 44, 67–73, ECF No. 45).  But it is difficult to see how these allegations \ngive rise to a “reasonable infere nce” of control.  Ownership of a minority of stock interest in a \ncompany has rarely been deemed sufficient for cont rol liability, especially when the stake is as \nlow as 20%.  See In re Alstom SA Sec. Litig. , 406 F. Supp. 2d 433, 492 (S.D .N.Y. 2005) (“Minority \nstock ownership and the ability to appoint a minor ity of the board do not create power to direct \nmanagement and policies, and thus do not cons titute sufficient control under Section 20(a).” \n(citations omitted)); see, e.g. , In re Flag Telecom Holdings, Ltd. Sec. Litig. , 352 F.

Nor does Third Point’s righ t to appoint a single director to Upstart’s board \nof eight directors move the needle.  See In re Flag Telecom , 352 F. Supp. 2d at 458–59 (no control \nliability against defendan t who appointed three of nine board members).   \nFinally, the Third Point Defenda nts’ involvement in Upstart’ s managerial affairs, while \nsubstantial, cannot be classifi ed as “functional intertwinement ” or “direct and supervisory \ninvolvement in [] day- to-day operations.”  See In re FirstEnergy , 2022 WL 681320, at *31; In re \nFirstEnergy , 316 F. Supp. 2d at 600–01.  Plaintiffs’ alle gations suggest only that Third Point \n“delivered value” on Upstart’s strategy and ope rations, purchased loans, and had “intimate \nknowledge of their management team s.”  (Compl. ¶¶ 69–70, ECF No. 45; see also id.  ¶ 73).  Vague \ncorporate phrases like “delivering value” do not demonstrate “heavy involvement,” let alone so \nclose a degree of involvement that  Third Point could exercise cont rol, direct or indirect, over \nUpstart’s operations or  strategic decisions.  Cf. In re FirstEnergy , 2022 WL 681320, at *32 \n(sustaining control liability cl aim based on “direct oversight and responsibility”).     \nBecause Plaintiffs have failed to plead allegations giving rise  to a “reasonable inference” \nthat the Third Point Defendants possessed “the pow er to direct or cause the direction of the \nmanagement and policies of” the Upstart Defendants, Iqbal , 556 U.S. at 678; 17 C.F.R. § 230.405, \nthe control liability claim is DISMISSED as to the Third Point Defendants.  \nE. Contemporaneous Trading Liability (Count III) \nThis Court turns at last to Plaintiffs’ clai m for contemporaneous trading liability pursuant \nto Section 20A of the Exchange Act, which “p rovides a private right of action to buyers of \nsecurities who buy ‘contemporaneo usly’ with anyone who purchases or sells a secu rity while in Case: 2:22-cv-02935-ALM-EPD Doc #: 68 Filed: 09/29/23 Page: 54 of 56  PAGEID #: <pageID> \n55 \n possession of material, nonpublic information.”  Beach v. Healthways, Inc. , No. 2:08-0569, 2009 \nWL 650408, at *5 (M.D. Tenn. Mar. 9, 2009) (citing 15 U. S.C. § 78t-1(a)).  A plaintiff alleging a \nviolation of § 20A must: “(1) al lege a requisite independent, pred icate violation of the Exchange \nAct (or its rules and regulations), e.g., § 10(b), a nd (2) show that he has standing to sue under § \n20A because he ‘contemporaneously with the purchase or sale of securities that is the subject of \nsuch violation has purchased . . . or sold . . . securiti es of the same class’ as  the insider defendant.”  \nIn re Enron Corp. Sec., Derivative & ERISA Litig. , 258 F. Supp. 2d 576, 599 (S.D. Tex. 2003) \n(quoting 15 U.S.C. § 78t–1(a)).  What is co nsidered a “contemporaneous” trade has been the \nsubject of vigorous debate; the te rm is not define d by statute.  See id.  at 600–01 (noting the lack \nof “clear agreement”).  “Different courts have  found that ‘contemporaneity ’ requires the insider \nand the investor/plaintiff to have  traded anywhere from on the same day, to less than a week, to \nwithin a month, to ‘the entire period while  relevant and nonpublic information remained \nundisclosed.’”  Id. (collecting cases).   \nThis Court need not wade into that debate  today.  The Upstart Defendants challenge the \ncontemporaneous trading claim not for a lack of contemporaneous trading, but on the same \ngrounds that they make against the Section 10(b) claim.  ( See Upstart MTD at 37, ECF No. 58-1) \n(incorporating by reference their argu ments that Plaintiffs failed to allege a predicate violation of \nthe Exchange Act).  But this Court has not dismi ssed Plaintiffs’ Section 10(b) claim (at least not \nentirely).  Put differently, this Court has not dismissed the alleged predicate violation of the \nExchange Act underlying the Section 20A claim against the Upstart Defendants.  The Upstart \nDefendants’ arguments that the Sect ion 20A claim fails for lack of a predicate violation is not well \ntaken.  See Ross v. Abercrombie & Fitch Co. , 501 F. Supp. 2d 1102, 1120 (S.D. Ohio 2007).   Case: 2:22-cv-02935-ALM-EPD Doc #: 68 Filed: 09/29/23 Page: 55 of 56  PAGEID #: <pageID> \n56 \n \nOn the other hand, this Court has concluded th at Plaintiffs failed to plead adequately a \nsecurities fraud claim under § 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 against the Third Point Defendants (or any \nother claims under the securi ties laws or the rules and regulations thereunder).  See supra  Part \nIV.B–D.  Without a predicate vi olation, Plaintiffs’ Section 10A claim against the Third Point \nDefendants fails.  \nV. CONCLUSION \nFor the reasons set forth herein, this Court GRANTS IN PART and DENIES IN PART  \nPlaintiffs’ Motion to Strike (ECF No . 65).  The Forms 13F are therefore STRICKEN .  This Court \nalso GRANTS IN PART and DENIES IN PART the Upstart Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss \n(ECF No. 58) and GRANTS the Third Point Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss (ECF No. 60).  All \nclaims against the Third Point Defendants are DISMISSED , as are claims of securities fraud \npursuant to § 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 against the Upstart Defenda nts except those based on the \nfollowing statements: (1) statements  about the advantages of Upst art’s AI underwriting model over \ntraditional, FICO-based models; (2) statements about  the ability of the model to “quickly adjust” \nto changing macroeconomic conditions; (3) th e November 9, 2021, and February 15, 2022, \nstatements that demand for Upstart loans is “the re”; (4) the November 9, 2021, and February 15, \n2022, statements that loans were only being reta ined for R&D purposes; and (5) statements that \nthe loan problem was a temporary concern. \nIT IS SO ORDERED. \n                                                             \n     ALGENON L.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: The case involves the bankruptcy proceedings of Giant Gray, Inc., with the trustee seeking to recover funds allegedly transferred fraudently to various parties, including Charles C. Davis and Pepperwood Fund I, LLC. The court denied defendants’ motions to dismiss, allowing the trustee to amend the complaints to specifically identify creditors who could have originally brought these claims. The case mentions the development of AI software by Giant Gray, Inc., but the legal issues do not focus directly on the AI aspect.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the trustee can recover alleged fraudulent transfers made by Giant Gray, Inc. without first having to avoid the initial transfer from the company to Ray Davis, especially when he is deceased, and subsequently pursue the recovery from the transferees.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court held that while the trustee did not adequately identify creditors in the initial complaints, he should be allowed to amend the complaints to meet legal standing requirements. The court denied the defendants' motions to dismiss and the motion for a more definite statement, permitting the trustee to pursue claims against the transferees.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine a company, Giant Gray, went bankrupt and there's a mix-up with money being moved around by the owner wrongly before he passed away. The person put in charge, the trustee, wants to get back the mishandled money from a few people it was wrongly given to. The judge told the trustee, \"You can continue trying to get the money back and fix your paperwork to show which people actually lost out.\" The story is a bit about following the rules to make sure the poor choices get sorted out and everyone is treated fairly.",

Procedural History \nENTERED \n 10/22/2020\nCase 20-03129   Document 17   Filed in TXSB on 10/22/20   Page 1 of 54On May 12, 2020, Lowell T. Ca ge, the Chapter 7 Trustee (“ Trustee ”), filed a complaint \nagainst Charles C. Davis, Racheal Johnson, and Nicholas Davis (the “ Davis Defendants ”).1  On \nJune 14, 2020, the Davis Defendants filed a motion to dismiss Trustee’s complaint pursuant to \nFederal Rule  Of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) (“ Davis Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss ”).2  On July 2, \n2020, Trustee filed an objection to the motion to dismiss (“ Objection ”).3  Finally, on August 19, \n2020, Trustee filed a supplemental brief in support of his Objection.4   \nOn May 12, 2020, Trustee filed a separate complaint against Pepperwood Fund I, LLC, \nAssed “Ozzie” Kalil, and Michael J. O’Donnell (the “ Pepperwood Defendants ,” and together \nwith the Davis Defendants, the “ Defendants ”).5  On July 8, 2020, the Pepperwood Defen dants \nlikewise filed a motion to dismiss the Trustee’s complaint pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 12(b)(6), and in the alternative, a motion for a more definite statement pursuant to \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(e) (“ Pepperwood Defendants’  Motion to Dismiss ”).6  On \nAugust 19, 2020, the Trustee filed an objection to the Pepperwood Defendants’ Motion to \nDismiss (“ Objection ”).7  On September 21, 2020, the Court held a combined hearing on both \nmotions to dismiss (the “ Hearing ”).  At the conclus ion of the Hearing, the Court took both \nmatters under advisement and now issues the instant Memorandum Opinion.  \nII. Conclusions of Law  \nA. Jurisdiction and Venue  \nThis Court holds jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §  1334 , which provides “the district \ncourts shall have original and exclusive jurisdiction of all cases under title 11.”   Section 157 \n                                            \n1 20-3127, ECF No. 1.  \n2 20-3127, ECF No. 5.  \n3 20-3127, ECF No. 6.  \n4 20-3127, ECF No. 16.  \n5 20-3129, ECF No. 1.  \n6 20-3129, ECF No. 6.  \n7 20-3129, ECF No. 12.  \nCase 20-03129   Document 17   Filed in TXSB on 10/22/20   Page 2 of 54allows a district court to “refer” all bankruptcy and related cases to the bankruptcy court, wherein \nthe latter court will appro priately preside over the matter.8  This court determines that pursuant to \n28 U.S.C. § 157(b)(2)(H), this Adversary Proceeding contains core matters, as it primarily \ninvolves proceedings to recover fraudulent conveyances.9   \nFurthermore, this Court may onl y hear a case in which venue is proper.10  Pursuant to 28 \nU.S.C. §  1409(a) , “a proceeding arising under title 11 or arising in or related to a case under title \n11 may be commenced in the district court in which such case is pending.”  Debtor’s main \nChapter 7 case is presently pending in this Court and therefore, venue of this adversary \nproceeding is proper.  \nB. Constitutional Authority to Enter an Interlocutory Order  \nThis Court must evaluate whether it has constitutional authority to enter an order in this \ncase.   In Stern,  which involved a core proceeding brought by the debtor under 28 U.S.C. \n§ 157(b)(2)(C) , the Supreme Court held that a bankruptcy court “lacked the constitutional \nauthority to enter a final judgment on a state law counterclaim that is not  resolved in the process \nof ruling on a creditor’s proof of claim.”11  However, Stern is inapplicable to the instant case.  \nStern concerned final orders entered by the bankruptcy court and here, the Court need only enter \nan interlocutory order because motio ns to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), like those filed by \nthe Defendants, are interlocutory.  Entering an interlocutory order does not implicate “the \nconstitutional limitations on the Court’s authority to enter final judgments.”12  Therefore, this \nCourt need not determine whether it has constitutional authority to enter a final order because an \n                                            \n8 28 U.S.C. § 157(a); see also  In re: Order of Reference to Bankruptcy Judges, Gen. Order 2012 -6 (S.D. Tex. May \n24, 2012).   \n9 See 28 U.S.C. § 157(b)(2)(H).  \n10 28 U.S.C. §  1408.   \n11 564 U.S. at 503.  \n12 West v. WRG Energy Partners LLC (In re Noram Res., Inc.) , 2011 Bankr. LEXIS 5183, at *3 (Bankr. S.D. Tex. \nDec. 30, 2011).  \nCase 20-03129   Document 17   Filed in TXSB on 10/22/20   Page 3 of 54interlocutory order is all that is required by the instant case.13 \nIII. Analysis  \n \nA. Whether Trustee’s Request for Leave to File Amended Complaints Should be \nGranted  \n \nThis Court must first decide whether Trustee’s motion for leave to file amended \ncomplaints should be permitted.  In his replies to the Defendants’ Motions, Trustee requested \nleave, if necessary, to specifically identify which unsecured c reditors with allowable claims may \nbe able to avoid a fraudulent transfer under applicable state law, pursuant to §  544(b)(1).14  \nTrustee reiterated this request at the Hearing.  Additionally, Trustee requested leave in his reply \nto the Pepperwood Defendant s’ Motion to Dismiss to “replead more specific allegations” \nregarding Defendants Kalil and O’Donnell’s status as mediate transferees under §  550. 15  As \ndiscussed infra , the Court finds that Trustee’s current pleadings regarding the identification of \nunsecu red creditors pursuant to §  544(b)(1) are insufficient and must be amended as to Count 1 \nfor all Defendants and Count 3 for Defendant Charles Davis.  Conversely, the Court finds below \nthat Trustee pled sufficient facts as to his §  550 claim against Defenda nts Kalil and O’Donnell.   \nTrustee should be granted leave so that he can remedy the deficiencies alleged by the \nDefendants.  Because there is no valid justification to deny Trustee leave to amend, Trustee’s \nrequest is granted for the reasons hereunder.  Trustee’s request relies upon Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 15 , made applicable here through Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure 7015 .  Rule \n15 governs motions to amend a complaint made before trial and provides that “[t]he court should \n                                            \n13 See Shelton v. Aguirre & Patterson, Inc. (In re Shelton) , 2014 Bankr. LEXIS 1722, at *11 (Bankr. S.D. Tex. Apr. \n18, 2014) (explaining that a bankruptcy court may not di smiss a cause of action with prejudice because that would \nconstitute adjudication on the merits and thus a final order dismissing the plaintiff’s suit. However, the court \ncontinued, a court may issue an interlocutory order even where it does not have autho rity to enter a final order.)  \n14 20-3127, ECF No. 6 at 8; 20 -3129 ECF No. 12 at 9.  \n15 20-3129, ECF No. 12 at 16.  \nCase 20-03129   Document 17   Filed in TXSB on 10/22/20   Page 4 of 54freely give leave when justice so requires.”16  The Fifth Circuit observed that “ Rule 15(a)  \n‘evinces a bias in favor of granting leave to amend.’”17   \nUnder Rule 15(a)(1), Trustee had 21 days after the Defendants filed their Rule 12(b)(6) \nMotions to amend hi s complaints without consent from the Defendants or a grant of leave from \nthis Court.18  Because that deadline passed, Trustee requests leave and “leave shall be freely  \ngiven [if] justice so requires.”19  Absent a formal motion for leave, a requesting party must set \nforth with particularity the grounds for the amendment and the relief sought.”20  This requires a \nmovant to give the court some notice of the nature of his proposed amendments.21  Although no \nstrict guidelines exist as to what constitutes a sufficient request for leave to amend, it is clear that \nsome specificity is required.22  Here, Trustee provided adequate notice of his proposed \namendment regarding the unsecured creditors with allowable claims who could bring avoidance \nactions under the applicable state law.  In his Objections, Trustee identifies 53 creditors with \nclaims totaling $6,676,262.33 based upon unpaid promissory notes Debtor executed before \nissuance of the Series A Stock to Ray Davis a nd the transfers to Charles Davis.23   \n“If proper notice was given, the court may consider such factors as undue delay, bad faith \nor dilatory motive on the part of the movant, repeated failure to cure deficiencies by amendments \npreviously allowed, undue pre judice to the opposing party, and futility of amendment when \n                                            \n16 FED.

Trustee filed his Objection eighteen days after the Davis \nDefend ants filed their Motion to Dismiss and filed his Objection to the Pepperwood Defendants’ \nMotion forty -two days after they filed.  Neither constitutes undue delay. 25  \nMoreover, Trustee’s amendments would cure the deficiencies complained of by the \nDefendants  and would not include any new claims or parties, thereby dispelling any notion that \nthis amendment is in bad faith or prejudicial to the Defendants.  Additionally, Trustee has not \npreviously sought amendments to cure deficiencies —this would constitute Tru stee’s first \namended complaint.  Lastly, the amended complaints would not be futile.  \nTo determine whether the amendment would be futile, courts apply “the same standard of \nlegal sufficiency as applies under Rule 12(b)(6) .”26  In order to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6) , \na plaintiff must meet Rule 8(a)(2) ’s pleading requirements. Rule 8(a)(2)  requires a plaintiff to \nplead “a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.”  In \nAshcroft v. Iqba l, the Supreme Court held that Rule 8(a)(2)  requires that “well -pleaded facts . . . \npermit the court to infer more than a mere possibility of misconduct.”27  Trustee’s proposed \namendments indicate who holds an allowable claim and could have brought an action under the \napplicable state law and provides the bankruptcy claim numbers for those 53 unsecured \ncreditors.28  Therefore, Trustee’s request for leave to fi le an amended complaint is granted.29 \nB.

Rule 8(a)(2) requires a plaintiff to \nplead “a short and plain stateme nt of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.”35  In \nAshcroft v. Iqbal , the Supreme Court held that Rule 8(a)(2) requires that “the well -pleaded facts . \n. . permit the court to infer more than the mere possibility of misconduct.”36  “Only a complaint \nthat states a plausible claim for relief survives a motion to dismiss.”37  “A claim has facial \nplausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable \ninference that the defendant is liable for  the misconduct alleged.”38  “The plausibility standard is \nnot akin to a ‘probability requirement,’ but it asks for more than a sheer possibility that a \ndefendant has acted unlawfully.”39 \n                                            \n30 FED.

Whether Trustee Lacks Standing to State a Claim to Avoid the Transfers Under \nApplicable State Law Pursuant to §  544(b)(1).  \n \nAs a preliminary matter and und er § 544(b)(1), Trustee must demonstrate the existence of \nan unsecured creditor that holds an allowable claim and who could avoid the transfers under state \nlaw.81  And while Trustee need not identify the creditor(s) by name, he must establish that there \nis at least one unsecured creditor who meets those criteria.82 \nIn his companion complaints, Trustee alleges that the transfers are avoidable under Texas \nUniform Frau dulent Transfer Act (“TUFTA ”) sections 24.005(a)(1), 24.005(a)(2), and 24.006(a), \nbut Trustee merely recites those statutes and does not list a single unsecured creditor who meets \nthe required criteria.83  Instead, Trustee alleges that at the time of the is suance of the Series A \nStock, there were millions of dollars owed to noteholders that Debtor could not pay,84 and in his \nObjections, Trustee alleges more specifically that there are 53 creditors with claims totaling \n$6,776,262.33, based on promissory notes that were issued before the allegedly fraudulent \ntransfers.85  Trustee provides the bankruptcy claim numbers for each of those creditors in his \nObjection to the Davis Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss, but not in his Objection to the \nPepperwood Defendants’ Moti on to Dismiss.86  Additionally, Trustee requests leave to file an \namended complaint to specifically identify creditors.87  The Court finds that Trustee has not met \nhis pleading burden because his complaints do not demonstrate the existence of an unsecured \n                                            \n81 See Katchadurian v.

Trustee’s First Cause of Action: Recovery of Immediate or Mediate Transfers \nUnder §  550 as to all Defendants.  \nTo sustain a recovery action against the Defendants, Trustee must prove each of the \nelements of 11 U.S.C. § 550.  Defendants attack each of these elements in thei r respective \nMotions to Dismiss.  The Court will consider each one in turn.   Section  550 states:  \n(a) . . . to the extent that a transfer is avoided u nder \nsection  544, 545, 547, 548, 549, 553(b) , or 724(a)  of this title, the trustee \nmay recover, for the benefit of the estate, the property transferred, or, if \nthe court so orders, the value of such property, from — \n(1) the initial transferee of such transfer or the entity for whose \nbenefit such transfer was made; or  \n(2) any immediate or mediate transferee of such initial transferee .88   \n \na. Whethe r § 550 requires actual avoidance of an initial transfer before \nrecovery is sought from immediate or mediate transferees.  \n \nThe Defendants contend that Trustee must first avoid the initial transfer of the Series A \nStock from Debtor to Ray Davis prior to seeking recovery from the Defendants because the plain \nlanguage of §  550 says “to the extent a transfer is avoided ,” not “to the extent a transfer is \navoidable .”89  The Pepperwood Defendants also compare the definition of avoid (“[t]o render \nvoid”) with avoidable or voidable (“an adjective that describes a transaction that can be avoided \n                                            \n88 11 U.S.C. §  550(a)(1) –(2). \n89 20-3127, ECF No. 5 at 3 –5 (citing Enron Corp. v.

Therefore, they conclude, because Trustee pled that the transfer is \navoidable but did not seek to avoid the transfer as to Ray Davis before this recovery action and \nhas not asked this Court to actually avoid that transfer now, the first element of §  550 has not \nbeen met.91  \nIn his Objections, Trustee counters that the initial transfer from Ray Davis need not be \navoided prior to seeking recovery from any immediate or mediate transferees92 and says that the \nsources cited by the Davi s Defendants support Trustee’s contention that the initial transfer need \nnot actually be avoided before he can recover from the Defendants.93  Trustee notes that in In re \nEnron , the bankruptcy court was reversed by the district court because the district co urt found \nthat “the plaintiff need only make ‘a declaration of avoidance against the initial transferee’ if the \ncircumstances show that no recovery against the [mediate] transferees can be accomplished \notherwise.”94  Trustee argues that no recovery could be  made against mediate transferees in this \ncase if the initial transfer had to be avoided because the initial transferee, Ray Davis, is \ndeceased.95  However, Trustee continues, the majority of cases “ require no actual avoidance of \n                                            \n90 20-3129, ECF No. 6 at 18 (citing BLACK ’S LAW DICTIONARY  (11th ed. 2019).  \n91 20-3127, ECF No. 5 at 4; 20 -3129, ECF No. 6 at 18 –19.  This Court notes that in the Summary of Complaint \nportions of Trustee’s complaints, he explicitly seeks to avoid and recover the transfers made to the Defendants \npursuant to §§ 544 and 550. See 20 -3127, ECF No. 1 at 2; 20 -3129, ECF No. 1 at 3.  The Defendants’ argument, \nhowever, is that Trustee did not seek to avoid the transfers as to Ray Davis and has not joined his estate in this \naction. Trustee, however, is not required to do so to recover from the  Defendants as discussed by the Court in this \nMemorandum Opinion.   \n92 20-3127, ECF No. 6 at 2 –4; 20 -3129, ECF No. 12 at 9 –11. \n93 20-3127, ECF No. 6 at 3.  \n94 Id. \n95 Id. \nCase 20-03129   Document 17   Filed in TXSB on 10/22/20   Page 16 of 54the initial transfer and no  showing that the initial transfer cannot practicably be avoided.”96  \nTrustee points to Richmond , cited by the Davis Defendants, as support for his position that he \nneed only prove that the initial transfer is avoidable before seeking recovery.97 \nFurther, Tr ustee argues that the sources cited by the Pepperwood Defendants either \nreflect the minority view, that a transfer must be avoided before recovery ensues, or that those \nsources actually favor Trustee’s view.98  First, Trustee cites In re Brooke Corporation , which \ncriticizes the holding in In re Slack -Horner Foundries Company and finds that the “better view” \nof § 550 is that of COLLIERS : “that a transfer may be found avoidable and a recovery may be had \nfrom a subsequent transferee without suing the initial tr ansferee.”99  Second, Trustee points out \nthat while In re Black Elk  states, “[o]nce a transfer is avoided as a preference or fraudulent \ntransfer, a trustee may then recover from ‘any immediate or mediate transferee of an initial \ntransferee,’” the very next line of the opinion says, “‘[t]o plead a subsequent transfer claim, the \nTrustee must plead that the initial transfer is avoidable, and the defendant is a [mediate] \ntransferee of that initial transfer.’”100  Therefore, Trustee concludes, he properly pleaded t hat the \ninitial transfer is avoidable and the Defendants’ motions to dismiss should be denied.101 \nAs illustrated by the parties’ contentions, courts diverge as to whether an initial transfer \nmust be avoided prior to or simultaneously with a recovery action o r whether a trustee must merely \nprove that it is avoidable before seeking recovery.  Fifth Circuit case law, what little exists, \ndiverges as well.

First, \nTrustee listed the dates and amounts of the transfers from Debtor to Charles Davis and alleged \nthat these were in addition to the salary increase Charles Davis received under a 2015 \nemployment agreement and hi s commissions for soliciting investments.  This evidence, Trustee \nalleges, proves Debtor did not receive equivalent value for the $591,322.68 in transfers. 297  \nTrustee also asserts that these transfers were made at a time when Debtor was struggling to meet \npayroll and on the verge of failing,298 when Ray Davis was looking for an “exit strategy” due to \n                                            \n290 Id. at 8. \n291 Id. \n292 Id. at 8–9. \n293 20-3127, ECF No. 12 at 17.  \n294 In re Life Partners Holdings, Inc. , 926 F.3d at 120  (declining to decide whether Rule 9(b) applies to claims of \nconstructive fraud because plaintiff’s pleadings satisfied both the Rule 8(a) standard and the Rule 9(b) standard).  \n295 See id.  \n296 20-3127, ECF No. 1 at 12 –13. \n297 Id. at 11.  \n298 Id. \nCase 20-03129   Document 17   Filed in TXSB on 10/22/20   Page 50 of 54the financial condition of Debtor and his failing health,299 and as a way to make sure Charles \nDavis was “taken care of,” in case Debtor was sold.300  Therefore, Tru stee provided the who, \nwhat, when, where, how, and why of the alleged fraud.301  These allegations also satisfy the \n“lack of reasonably equivalent value” and “financially vulnerable” prongs of Trustee’s \nconstructive fraud claims.  Second, in addition to alle ging “on information and belief” that \nDebtor “was engaged in, or was about to engage in, a business or transaction for which its \nremaining assets were unreasonably small,” Trustee alleges that Debtor was transferring large \nsums of money to Charles Davis (a  transaction),302 in addition to the salary and commissions he \nwas already being paid while Debtor was financially vulnerable, evidenced by Debtor owing \nmillions of dollars to investors on promissory notes, struggling to provide a return to investors \nbecause  it lacked a commercially viable product, and having difficulty meeting payroll \n(unreasonably small assets remaining).303  These allegations, if proven, satisfy section \n24.005(a)(2)(A).  \nLastly, as discussed thoroughly in III.C.1., Trustee’s complaint did no t sufficiently plead \nthat a creditor exists who would have standing to bring suit under TUFTA sections 24.005(a)(2) \nand 24.006(a) into whose shoes Trustee could step.  Section 24.005(a)(2) requires Trustee to \nplead that there is a creditor with an allowabl e claim that arose before or within a reasonable \ntime of the allegedly fraudulent transfer.  Section 24.006(a) requires Trustee to plead that there is \na creditor with an allowable claim that arose solely before  the fraudulent transfer.  Therefore, \nTrustee must amend his pleadings to establish standing.

The Pepperwood Defendants’ Motion for a More Definite Statement  \nThe Pepperwood Defendants request that in the event this Court  denies their Motion to \nDismiss, the Court order the Trustee to address the alleged infirmities by a proper repleading.305   \nLike a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), “a motion for a more definite statement is \ngenerally disfavored.”306  Federal Rule of Civ il Procedure 12(e), as incorporated by Federal Rule \nof Bankruptcy Procedure 7012, states, “[a] party may move for a more definite statement of a \npleading to which a responsive pleading is allowed but which is so vague or ambiguous that the \nparty cannot rea sonably prepare a response.”307  Under Rule 12(e), this Court must consider \n“whether the complaint is such that a party cannot reasonably be required to frame a responsive \npleading.”308  That is because a motion for a more definite statement “is used to provid e a \nremedy only for an unintelligible pleading rather than a correction for lack of detail.”309  The \n“complaint does not contain sufficient information to allow a responsive pleading”310 if the \nresponsive party is “unable to determine how to frame a response” and “cannot respond, even \nwith a simple denial, in good faith, or without prejudice to himself.”311  In its 12(e) motion, a \nparty must “point out the defects complained of and the details desired.”312 \n                                            \n304 20-3127, ECF No. 6; 20 -3129, ECF No. 12.  \n305 20-3129, ECF No. 6 at 28.  \n306 Davenport v.

It “is not to be \nused to assist in getting the facts in preparation for trial.”318  Those facts must be gleaned through \nthe appropriate discovery methods.319  Therefore, “[i]f the detail sought by a motion for more \ndefinite statement is obtainable through discovery, the motion should be denied.”320  \nDetermining whether to grant a motion for a more definite statement necessarily involves the \ndiscretion of the Cou rt;321  “[a]s [the trial judge] presides over the continuous process of \n                                            \n313 Id.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: In a bankruptcy case, siblings of the debtor, James B. Whittaker, sought to have their claims against him excepted from discharge due to fraudulent and inappropriate handling of family trusts and funds. Whittaker had misappropriated funds to purchase a personal timeshare and invested trust funds in high-risk options trading, contrary to the conservative strategy mandated by the parents’ trusts. The court found that certain debts, specifically those related to misappropriation and defalcation, were excepted from discharge due to their willful and malicious nature.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the debtor’s liabilities arising from breaches of fiduciary duty and unauthorized appropriation of trust funds should be excepted from discharge under sections 523(a)(2)(A), 523(a)(4), and 523(a)(6) of the Bankruptcy Code.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court held that the debtor’s liabilities for embezzlement of trust funds and failures in fiduciary duty, which involved deliberate and wrongful acts, were excepted from discharge under sections 523(a)(4) and 523(a)(6). Conversely, claims based on reckless or fraudulent investment choices were not excepted from discharge as they did not show a willful intent to cause harm.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine you are given money by your family to keep safe and only invest in safe things like government bonds. Instead, you secretly use some of it to buy something nice for yourself and gamble the rest on risky investments. Your family finds out and wants a judge to ensure you don't get away with it by just declaring bankruptcy to erase the debt you owe them. The judge agrees you acted wrongly with the money you took for yourself, so you still owe them that part, but the part about the risky investments, the judge says wasn't clearly intending harm, so it might be let go.",

 (“Jay” or “the Debtor”) filed a petition for \nrelief under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy  Code. On January 21, 2014, and in the bankruptcy  case thereby \ncommenced,  the plaintiffs filed the complaint  that commenced  the present adversary  proceeding.1 The \ncomplaint  includes a count objecting  to discharge  under 11 U.S.C. § 727(a), and for that reason alone, \nthe Debtor has not yet received a discharge.  The plaintiffs have since withdrawn  the count objecting  to \nentry of discharge,  and therefore  upon resolution  of this proceeding,  the Debtor will receive a discharge.  \nThe purpose of the present proceeding  is to determine  whether the plaintiffs’

 the Debtor opposed the motion, and, after a hearing held on \nJanuary 14, 2014, the Court denied the motion. However,  by local rule of this court, the deadline was nonetheless  \nautomatically

 is organized  into four counts. In Count I, the Plaintiffs assert that their claims \nagainst the Debtor should be excepted from discharge  under § 523(a)(2)(A),  as debt arising from false \npretenses,  false representations,  or actual fraud. This count is based on allegations  that, by affirmative  \nmisrepresentations  to the Plaintiffs of the financial health of the inter vivos trusts, and also by failure to \napprise them of dramatic changes in his investment  strategy, the Debtor prevented  the Plaintiffs from \nintervening  and thereby averting losses.  \nCount II contains four separate sub‐counts, each for a determination  of nondischargeability  \nunder § 523(a)(4).  In the first (“Count II.i”), the Plaintiffs contend that the Debtor’s liability to them for \nfailing to invest the funds as a “prudent investor” is excepted from discharge  under § 523(a)(4) as a debt \nfor a defalcation  while acting in a fiduciary capacity.  In the second and third (“Counts II.ii and II.iii”), the \nPlaintiffs contend that the Debtor’s liability to them for his unauthorized  appropriation

 And in the fourth (“Count II.iv”), the Plaintiffs \ncontend that the Debtor’s failure to inform them of the declining balances in his trust accounts \namounted  to, and should be excepted from discharge  under § 523(a)(4) as, fraud or defalcation  while \nacting in a fiduciary capacity.   \n   Count III also contains four sub‐counts, each for a determination

 The Plaintiffs withdrew  this count on the record at trial.2  \nBefore trial, the Plaintiffs moved for partial summary  judgment.  The Court granted the motion \nas to Count II.ii and denied it as to the remainder  of the relief sought. As to Count II.ii, the Court held \nthat the Debtor’s liability for his unauthorized

The Debtor, James Whittaker,  known to his siblings, as Jay, is the oldest of the four \nsiblings. His siblings, all plaintiffs herein, are Benjamin  H. Whittaker  III (“Ben”), Carol Bell (“Carol”),  and \nJoan Mummery  (“Joan”). Jay, Ben, Carol, and Joan are the children of Benjamin  H. Whittaker  (“the \nFather”) and Mary S. Whittaker  (“the Mother”).     \n2. The Debtor received a Bachelor of Science degree in Economics  from Miami University  \nof Ohio in 1965 (Stipulation  of Facts, ¶ 1) and a Master in Business Administration  degree in Economics  \nfrom the same institution  (Stipulation  of Facts, ¶ 2).3 He completed  all coursework  and the exam for a \nPh.D. in Economics  from Case Western Reserve University  but chose not to finish his dissertation.  \n(Stipulation  of Facts, ¶ 3)  In 1974, he received an M.B.A. in Finance from Case Western Reserve. \n(Stipulation  of Facts, ¶ 4) He is a Chartered  Financial Analyst, which is a credential  often held by people \nin the investment  industry who oversee mutual and pension funds. (Stipulation  of Facts, ¶ 5) \n3. The Debtor was a Credit Manager for Medusa Cement Company  from approximately  \n1971 to 1974 (Stipulation  of Facts, ¶ 6) and then was employed  by Digital Equipment  Corporation  from \n1974 through 1991 (Stipulation  of Facts, ¶ 7). He began his employment  with Digital Equipment  \nCorporation  as a credit manager and subsequently  headed up their computer  leasing operation.  \n(Stipulation  of Facts, ¶ 8) The Debtor subsequently  took a position as corporate  finance manager,  where \nhe was involved with convertible  bond issues, stock issues, financing of real estate and multi‐million \ndollar purchases  of equipment  for the purposes of depreciation.  (Stipulation  of Facts, ¶ 9) In 1982, the \nDebtor was made Chief Economist  for the company and held that position until 1991. (Stipulation  of \n                                                           \n3 At trial, the Debtor testified credibly that his master’s degree in economics  from Miami University  was a master \nof arts degree, not a master of business administration.  The discrepancy  is of no consequence.  Case 14-01017    Doc 132    Filed 01/17/17    Entered 01/17/17 14:04:51    Desc Main\n Document      Page 5 of 516 \n Facts, ¶ 10) He was also a security analyst for several industries  during that time period. (Stipulation  of \nFacts, ¶ 11) \n4. In or about 1995, the Debtor decided to become a financial advisor so he went to \nBentley College and got a certificate  in Financial Planning.  (Stipulation  of Facts, ¶ 12) He then started a \nfinancial advisory firm for individuals  called Alden Associates  that operated from 1996 to 1997. \n(Stipulation  of Facts, ¶ 13) Alden Associates  did financial planning and managed  investments  by \nobtaining  power of attorney from individuals  to invest their money with larger investment  firms such as \nCharles Schwab or Fidelity. (Stipulation  of Facts, ¶ 14) \n5. In the late 1990s the Debtor started a company called Deep Green Research with Glenn \nE. Frank. (Stipulation  of Facts, ¶ 15) Deep Green Research was formed to develop artificial intelligence  \nsoftware for optimizing  investments  to minimize taxes with the objective to sell the software to a large \ninvestment  firm. (Stipulation  of Facts, ¶ 16) In approximately  2000, the Debtor decided to sell his \ninterest in Deep Green Research to his partner. (Stipulation  of Facts, ¶ 17) The Debtor has not held a \nsalaried position since this time. (Stipulation  of Facts, ¶ 18) \n6. About this time, in or around 2000, the Debtor started to do research on trading \noptions. (Stipulation  of Facts, ¶ 19) The Debtor’s research on options trading was limited to reading \nbooks on the subject, taking three courses or seminars and online training offered by brokerage  firms. \n(Stipulation  of Facts, ¶ 20) He considers  himself to have greater knowledge  than the average individual  \nwith respect to investments  in general. \n7. The Debtor has acknowledged  that investing in options is a high risk endeavor.  \n(Stipulation  of Facts, ¶ 21) He described  an option as a contract, either a “call” or a “put.” Without \ngetting into much detail at all, he explained  that a call contract pays off when an underlying  stock goes \nup, and a put contract pays off when the underlying  stock goes down. He further explained  that an \noption contract is a “derivative,”  meaning its value is contingent  on the performance  of another stock or Case 14-01017    Doc 132    Filed 01/17/17    Entered 01/17/17 14:04:51    Desc Main\n Document      Page 6 of 517 \n asset. For example, he explained,  “in put contracts,  you’re betting the stock will go down.” The Debtor \nexplained  that an option “is a highly leveraged  vehicle” and conceded  at several junctures  that it is a \nhigh risk investment.4 Asked to explain his use of the word “bet” to explain an option trade, he stated \nthat he had used the term as it is used colloquially  in the financially  industry, to mean “an investment  \njudgment.”  Although he distinguished  it from betting in the sense that roulette is betting, he did not \nexplain how or to what extent they differed. He never shrunk from conceding  that, whatever  measure of \n“investment  judgment”  an options contract may involve, it remains highly risky.   \n8. From 2000 to 2003, the Debtor began trading on options for himself on an account with \na specialized  brokerage  firm called TradeStation.  (Stipulation  of Facts, ¶ 22)  In or around 2000 to 2002, \nhe lost a “huge amount” of money trading options, quit doing it, and went back to “studying.”5 \n(Stipulation  of Facts, ¶ 23) The Debtor testified credibly that the amount he lost during this period was \n“more than half a million” dollars, all of it his own, and that this constituted  most of his money at that \ntime. \n9. He began trading options again in or around 2007, this time with his own money and \nalso with money belonging  to his wife, which she held in a Roth IRA.  \n10. In or about 2009 or 2010, the Debtor lost approximately  $200,000  of his wife’s Roth IRA \nby investing in options (Stipulation  of Facts, ¶ 24). In this same period he also lost other monies of his \nown from trading in options. He admitted credibly that his options trading losses of his own and his \nwife’s funds in the periods 2000‐2003 and 2009‐2010 totaled “over a million dollars of our retirement  \naccounts,  including all of mine.”   \n  \n                                                           \n4 Aside from this testimony  by the Debtor, the Plaintiffs submitted  no evidence as to what precisely an option is \nand how option trading works. \n5 The word studying appears in quotation  marks in the parties Stipulation  of Facts. The purpose of the quotation  \nmarks is not evident.  Case 14-01017    Doc 132    Filed 01/17/17    Entered 01/17/17 14:04:51    Desc Main\n Document      Page 7 of 518 \n B.  The Family Trusts  \n11.

Each Family Trust included the following  regarding  the powers of its trustee: \nIn the administration  of the trusts created hereunder  and in addition to the powers \nexercised  by trustees generally,  the Trustee shall have the following  powers and \nauthorities  without any court order or proceeding,  exercisable  in the discretion  of the \nTrustee: . . . \n \n4.  To invest and reinvest the properties  from time to time comprised  in \nthe trust estate or estate in stocks, common and/or preferred,  bonds, \nnotes, debentures,  loans, mortgages,  common trust funds, or other \nsecurities  or property,  real or personal,  all limitations  now or hereafter  \nimposed by law, statutory or judicial, or by any rule or practice of court \nnow or hereafter  in force specifying  or limited the permissible  \ninvestment  of trustees, trust, companies  or fiduciaries  generally or \nrequiring the diversification  of investment,  being hereby expressly  \nwaived, it being the intent hereof that the Trustee shall have full power \nand authority  to deal with the trust estate or estates in all respects as \nthough it were the sole owner thereof, without order of court or other \nauthority;  . . . [and]  \n 10.  To hold title to stocks, bonds, or other securities  or\n property,  real or \npersonal,  in its own name or in the name of its nominee and without Case 14-01017    Doc 132    Filed 01/17/17    Entered 01/17/17 14:04:51    Desc Main\n Document      Page 9 of 5110 \n indication  of any fiduciary capacity or to hold any such bonds or \nsecurities  in bearer form; the Trustee shall assume full responsibility  for \nthe acts of any nominee elected by it[.] \nFather’s Trust, Article IX, ¶ B.4; Mother’s Trust, Article IX, ¶ B.4. \n  \n17. Each Family Trust included the following  regarding  the duties of its trustee: \nThe Trustee shall keep accurate records showing all receipts and disbursements  \nand other transactions  involving the trust estate or estates and shall furnish to \neach income beneficiary  of the trust estates annually a statement  of the \nreceipts and disbursements  affecting such beneficiary’s  interest in the trust \nestate and a complete  inventory  of the trust estate then held for the benefit of \nsuch beneficiary.  \n \n18. The Family Trusts contain a choice of law clause whereby Florida law is to govern. \n(Stipulation  of Facts, ¶ 28) The choice of law clause in each Family Trust states “[t]his amendment  to \nTrust Agreement  shall be construed  under and in accordance  with the laws of the State of Florida.”  \n19. Each Trust indicates that it was entered into and signed at Key West, Florida, and each \nidentifies  its settlor as being “of Key West, Florida.”  \nC.  Debtor’s Role of Trustee and Attorney in Fact  \n20.  In the fall of 2006, the Parents moved from their home to an assisted living facility \noutside of Cleveland,  Ohio.  \n21. On September  19, 2006, Carol resigned as trustee under both the Father’s Trust and the \nMother’s Trust, effective as to each trust upon acceptance  of its trusteeship  by the successor  trustee.  \nCarol did not testify at trial. The Debtor testified credibly, and without contradiction,  that Carol resigned \nbecause the trusteeship  required more direct involvement  on her part than she had thought it would. \nCarol was the only one involved in asking the Debtor to take over as trustee of both trusts.    \n22. In October of 2006, the Debtor became the trustee of each Family Trust. (Stipulation  of \nFacts, ¶ 29)  On October 3, 2006, the Debtor, by execution  of an Acceptance  of Trusteeship  as to each \nFamily Trust, accepted the duties and obligations  of the trustee under each Family Trust, accepted the Case 14-01017    Doc 132    Filed 01/17/17    Entered 01/17/17 14:04:51    Desc Main\n Document      Page 10 of 5111 \n trust estates, and agreed to hold the same upon the trusts and for the purposes and on the terms and \nprovisions  set forth in their respective  trust agreements.    \n23. The Debtor held the position of trustee of each Family Trust until June of 2012, when he \nresigned. (Stipulation  of Facts, ¶ 30) \n24. On October 3, 2006, the Debtor also agreed to serve as his parents’ Attorney in Fact \nand, in connection  therewith,  executed Power of Attorney agreements  related to the Family Trusts. \n(Stipulation  of Facts, ¶ 31) The Durable Powers of Attorney required the Debtor to exercise his \nauthority,  power, and discretions  in a fiduciary capacity in observance  of the standards  of care \napplicable  to trustees under Florida law. (Stipulation  of Facts, ¶ 32) The Powers of Attorney also elected \na higher standard of care to be exercised  by the Debtor in his fiduciary capacity as his Parents’ Agent. \n(Stipulation  of Facts, ¶ 33)  \n25. Moreover,  the Debtor’s parents required that the funds in the Trust be invested \nconservatively.   (Stipulation  of Facts, ¶ 34) The Debtor agreed that his parents’ instruction  to him was to \ninvest their funds conservatively.  He acknowledged  that high‐risk investments  were against his father’s \nwishes. \nD.  Trust Assets \n26. When the Debtor took over as Trustee, the Trust contained  two bank accounts,  one with \nKeyBank and another with First State Bank. (Stipulation  of Facts, ¶ 36)  The Trust also contained  three \n(3) investment  accounts,  held with Fidelity, Merrill Lynch, and Vanguard.  (Stipulation  of Facts, ¶ 37)  \nFurther, the Trust contained  two pieces of real estate, one in Euclid, Ohio and one in Key West, Florida. \n(Stipulation  of Facts, ¶ 38) The Key West house had four rental units that generated  income for the \nTrust, though not always a net profit.  Case 14-01017    Doc 132    Filed 01/17/17    Entered 01/17/17 14:04:51    Desc Main\n Document      Page 11 of 5112 \n 27. In October of 2006, the Defendant  combined  his Parents’ Merrill Lynch, Fidelity, and \nVanguard  investment  accounts into one single Fidelity account titled in Father’s name. (Stipulation  of \nFacts, ¶ 39) \nE.  First Two Reports to Siblings \n28. The Debtor gave a total of three (3) reports to his siblings during his time as Trustee. \n(Stipulation  of Facts, ¶ 60)  All three were in writing. The Debtor never gave an oral report to any of his \nsiblings, and none of them ever asked for an oral report or contacted  him to discuss any of the three \nwritten reports.   \n29. On or about January 31, 2007, the Debtor sent a report to his siblings (the “January 2007 \nReport”).  (Stipulation  of Facts, ¶ 61) This report, a single‐page document  in memorandum  format, \naddressed  to his three siblings, was the first of the three reports. It begins: “Dad has authorized  me to \ngive you a summary  of their [the Parents’] assets.”  \n30. The January 2007 Report summarized  the assets at that time and also outlined the \nDebtor’s father’s investment  strategy to invest most of their assets in U.S. Government  Bonds and \nMoney Market instruments.  (Stipulation  of Facts, ¶ 62)  Regarding  investments,  it stated: “For the past \n15 years or so Dad has invested most of their assets in U.S. Government  Bond and U.S. Government  \nMoney Market Instruments.  He also has relatively  small positions in a utilities mutual fund and stock in \nBP and Exxon‐Mobile which he bought about 3 years ago[.]” It also indicated  that the values of the \ninvestments  as of December  31, 2006 were as follows: \nMerrill Lynch—Dad  $433K \nFidelity—Dad    $167K \nVanguard—Mom   $472K Case 14-01017    Doc 132    Filed 01/17/17    Entered 01/17/17 14:04:51    Desc Main\n Document      Page 12 of 5113 \n This report is credible and not contradicted,  and accordingly  I find that the investments  had a combined  \nvalue on December  31, 2006, of $1,072,000.  At the time of this report, the investments  remained  \nexactly as the Debtor had received them in October 2006; he had made no changes.  \n31. Regarding  the Trust’s real estate, the January 2007 Report stated: “Real estate \nestimates  are rough based on discussions  people [sic] who know better than I. The Key West market is \ncurrently depressed  and there is a glut of inventory  on the market.” It also indicated  that the value of \nthe real estate as of December  31, 2006, was as follows: \nEuclid House   Est: ~$100K \nKey West House     Est: ~$1‐1.5 million \n32. The January 2007 Report also indicated  that the Debtor’s father had instructed  him to \ninvest only in U.S. Government  Instruments,  that this was not expected to change much, and that he \nwould report to the siblings if there were a material change. (Stipulation  of Facts, ¶ 63)  Specifically,  the \nreport stated: “Dad has instructed  me to continue investing only in U.S. Government  Instruments.  As \nthis isn’t expected to change much, I will update you in one year unless there is a material change in the \nmeantime.”    \n33. Joan and Ben received the January 2007 Report shortly after it was issued. On account \nof this report, Joan “took it very positively  in that things seemed to be stable and going well and great.” \nShe testified credibly that she believed that the Debtor indeed was only investing in U.S. Government  \ninterests and that she relied on this document  to guide her as to how investments  were being made \nduring his trusteeship.  Ben, too, testified credibly that he understood  this report to mean that the \nmoney was secure and that Jay was following  their father’s directive.    \n34. On or about March 10, 2008, the Debtor transmitted  a 2007 Year End report to his \nsiblings (the “March 2008 Report”).  (Stipulation  of Facts, ¶ 64)  This was the second of his three reports \nto them. Case 14-01017    Doc 132    Filed 01/17/17    Entered 01/17/17 14:04:51    Desc Main\n Document      Page 13 of 5114 \n 35. The report discussed  the real estate, indicated  that the investments  were worth \n$1,145,305.00,  and indicated  that their Parents’ financial position was “strong and secure.” (Stipulation  \nof Facts, ¶ 65) Regarding  the investment  accounts,  this report said only: “Total financial Assets: \n$1,145,305.”  Regarding  income and expenses,  this report stated that “income exceeds expenses  and \nshould continue to do so”; and it further stated that estimated  income and expenses  for 2007 were \nincome of $99,316 and expenses  of $88,000. Regarding  the Euclid house, the report indicated  that it had \nbeen on the market for almost a year with “very little interest due to the weak real estate market.” And \nregarding  the Key West house the report indicated  all four of its units remained  rented and generating  \nalmost $60,000 per year in income, but repairs and maintenance  brought the 2007 net income from that \nhouse to $18,000.  \n36. Joan and Ben received the March 2008 Report shortly after its transmittal  on March 10, \n2008. Both indicated  that they read it upon receiving it, and both further noted, correctly,  that its report \nregarding  the investment  account gave no idea of a material change in the manner in which its funds \nwere invested. There is no evidence that, as of the date of this report, the Debtor had changed the \nmanner in which he was investing the funds in the investment  account or planned to begin investing \ndifferently.  To the contrary, the evidence is that the funds remained  very conservatively  invested.  \nF.  New Investment  Strategies  \n37. The Debtor’s strategy for investing the Trusts’ funds began to change in September  or \nOctober of 2008.  It changed in two phases. The series of trades that comprised  the first phase quickly \n“paid off big time,” but it emboldened  the Debtor and set up the second phase, which proved \ndisastrous.      \n38. The Debtor described  credibly his first departure  from the conservative  strategy that his \nfather had enjoined him to follow. “In the summer and fall of 2008 you recall there was a stock market \ncrash. The stock market went down by 40‐some percent. My parents’ account was largely in very liquid Case 14-01017    Doc 132    Filed 01/17/17    Entered 01/17/17 14:04:51    Desc Main\n Document      Page 14 of 5115 \n assets, such as cash or bonds, and there was a ‐‐ I saw a historical buying opportunity  for stocks. And I \nsold much of their fixed income and bought high‐quality stock issues . . . in the September  or October \nrange. These were like Caterpillar  and General Electric and JPMorgan  and so forth, Apple. And these \nsubsequently  went up about 30 to 40 percent and I was concerned  with another dip in the market, so I \nsold all or most of them late 2008 or early 2009.” Commenting  on these investment  moves, the Debtor \ntestified: “that was an opportunistic  thing to do and I thought reasonable  and rational and it paid off big \ntime.”  \n39. Though the amount of the profit from these trades is not in evidence,  I credit the \nDebtor’s testimony  that they “paid off big time.” They left the estate with a considerable  profit and, in \nthe Debtor’s words, “a lot of cash.” The Debtor testified that the value of the investment  account had \nincreased  to around $1.2 or $1.3 million. \n40. The Debtor continued  as to the second phase of his departure:  “So after I sold the stocks \nI had a lot of cash and decided . . . to take a portion of the funds and manage it as I was managing  my \nown money in options to get a larger return. So initially I set aside about 200,000 or about 20 percent of \nthe portfolio and decided to trade options[.]”  In short, at some point the Debtor decided to begin \ninvesting Trust funds in options. \n41. It is not clear when he made this decision and when precisely he began investing in \noptions. The Debtor testified: “I don’t recall exactly when it started, but it was around the end of ‘08, \nbeginning  of ’09[.]” However,  at another point, the Debtor also testified that he did not begin investing \nTrust funds in options until August 2009. I have no corroborating  evidence that he invested Trust funds \nin options earlier than August 2009. I find that he did invest Trust Funds in options at least as early as \nAugust 2009, and, while I do not find that he did not invest Trust funds in options before August 2009, \nthe Plaintiffs have not established  that he did invest, or decide to invest, Trust funds in options earlier \nthan August 2009.  Case 14-01017    Doc 132    Filed 01/17/17    Entered 01/17/17 14:04:51    Desc Main\n Document      Page 15 of 5116 \n G.  Third Report to Siblings \n42. Sometime  after December  31, 2008, the Debtor submitted  his final report regarding  the \nTrust to his siblings the “Third Report”).  (Stipulation  of Facts, ¶ 66)  The precise date of this report is \nunclear. The Debtor testified it was probably before April 15, 2009, because in the report he stated that \nhe had not yet finished the Parents’ tax returns for 2008. Still, it is unclear precisely how early in the \nyear it was made and whether it was made before the Debtor made his decision to begin trading Trust \nmonies in options.  \n43. Regarding  financial assets (the investment  and the bank accounts),  the Third Report \nstates only the following:  “Financial  assets totaled $904,551.  At 12/31/08  including bank accounts.  [sic] \nThis is after distributing  $120,000  to the children and grandchildren.”    \n44. In the Third Report, the Debtor also indicated  that he had finally sold the Euclid house in \nMay 2008, for $58,000. \n45. When the Debtor issued the Third Report, he had already departed from the investment  \nstrategy that he had previously  told his siblings he would follow: at the very least, he had, after the fall \nof the stock market in 2008, sold some or all of the Trusts’ conservative  investments  and, with the \nproceeds,  purchased  what he called “high‐quality stock issues.” The Debtor deliberately  omitted any \nmention of this change of strategy from this report.  \n46. It is unclear whether, by the date of this report, he had also sold that stock at a gain and \nbegun investing a portion of the portfolio in options. I cannot find by a preponderance  of the evidence \nthat, by the date of this report, he had begun trading in options or decided to do so, and therefore  that \nthe Debtor had anything to disclose to his siblings about option trading in this report . \n47. Nonetheless,  the Debtor did eventually  decide to invest Trust funds in options. The \nDebtor acknowledged,  and in any event I find, that this constituted  a material change in investment  \nstrategy and that he did not update his siblings as to that material change. This withholding  of Case 14-01017    Doc 132    Filed 01/17/17    Entered 01/17/17 14:04:51    Desc Main\n Document      Page 16 of 5117 \n information  from his siblings was not merely negligent—he  did not simply forget—but  intentional  and \ndeliberate.   \n48. In the three reports he made to his siblings, he did not indicate that he planned to \ndepart from his father’s wish of conservative  investment  of the Trust Assets. (Stipulation  of Facts, ¶ 67) \n49. The Debtor acknowledged  that he did not intend to keep supplying  reports to his \nsiblings because he did not want to report negative results to them and did not want them to find out \nwhat was going on with the Trust. (Stipulation  of Facts, ¶ 68)  \nH.  Misappropriation  of Funds for Timeshare   \n50. On April 27, 2009 and on May 1, 2009, the Debtor wrote two checks against the Fidelity \ninvestment  account in which he maintained  the Trusts’ investments,  both payable to himself:  the first \nfor $58,500 and the second for $49,000.  He used the funds thereby transferred  to pay for a timeshare  \nin Mexico that he purchased  and owned jointly with his wife.  \n51. The Debtor acknowledged  that these withdrawals  were unauthorized  and made for \npersonal use.  (Stipulation  of Facts, ¶ 58) \n52. The total amount of unauthorized  Trust funds that the Debtor admitted were used to \npay for the timeshare  purchased  by the Debtor and his wife was $107,500.00.  (Stipulation  of Facts, ¶ 55) \n53. Both the Debtor and his wife have visited the timeshare  over the years. (Stipulation  of \nFacts, ¶ 56) \n54. The funds taken from the Trust by the Debtor to pay for the timeshare  purchased  by the \nDebtor and his wife have never been paid back into the Trust. (Stipulation  of Facts, ¶ 57)  \nI.  Funds Diverted to TradeStation  Account  \n55. On four separate dates, beginning  July 12, 2009, the Debtor transferred  funds totaling \n$38,000 from the Fidelity investment  account in which he maintained  the Trusts’ investments  into an Case

 by failing to invest the funds as a prudent investor is \nexcepted from discharge  as a debt for willful and malicious  injury.  This sub‐count fails because the \nPlaintiffs have not established  that the injury satisfies the requirement  of willfulness.  I have found that \nthe Debtor did not intend, by his investment  of Trust funds in options, to injure the Trusts or their \nbeneficiaries.  Nor have the Plaintiffs shown that the Debtor’s investment  of Trust funds in options was \nsubstantially  certain to lead to loss of the funds.  Judgment  shall enter for the Debtor on this sub‐count. \n  Count III.ii: Misappropriation  of $107,500  as Willful and Malicious  Injury \n  In their second sub‐count under § 523(a)(6),

 of the funds. The injury \nin question was willful within the meaning of § 523(a)(6):  the Debtor deliberately  transferred

 it was an unauthorized  use and clearly inconsistent  with \nthe terms of the Trusts. And, as he appropriated  these monies as his own, the Debtor fully understood  \nthe wrongfulness  of his actions. His actions were wrongful,  without just cause or excuse, and committed  \nin conscious  disregard  of his duties.  Accordingly,  the resulting liability, already excepted from discharge  \nunder § 523(a)(4),  is also excepted from discharge  under §523(a)(6).  \n  Count III.iii: Misappropriation  of $38,000 as Willful and Malicious  Injury \n  In their third sub‐count under § 523(a)(6),  the Plaintiffs seek a determination  that the Debtor’s \nliability to them for unauthorized  appropriation  for his own use of $38,000 of entrusted  monies, all of \nwhich he deposited  into his and his wife’s joint TradeStation  account and, from that platform,  lost \nthrough investing in options, is excepted from discharge  as a debt for willful and malicious  injury. Again, \nthe underlying  liability is essentially  for tortious conversion,  this time of $38,000 transferred  to the \nTradeStation  account in four separate checks. He used the funds to invest in his own name and for his \nown benefit. These acts, which removed the funds in question from the Trusts and thus injured the \nTrusts, were willful; the Debtor intended the injury. And the injury was also malicious  within the \nmeaning of § 523(a)(6).  Use of the funds for his own benefit was unauthorized  and clearly inconsistent  \nwith the terms of the Trusts, and this would be so even if he merely borrowed  the monies and intended \nto repay them.  As he appropriated  these monies as his own, the Debtor fully understood  the \nwrongfulness  of his actions. His actions were thus wrongful,  without just cause or excuse, and \ncommitted  in conscious  disregard  of his duties.  Accordingly,  the resulting liability, already excepted \nfrom discharge  under § 523(a)(4),  is also excepted from discharge  under §523(a)(6).  \nCount III.iv: Losses from Failure to Account and from False Representations   \n        as Willful and Malicious  Injury \n \nIn the fourth sub‐count under § 523(a)(6),  the Plaintiffs contend that the Debtor’s liability to \nthem for failing to account to them for his losses from options trading and for failing to inform them that Case 14-01017    Doc 132    Filed

 strategy and instead investing in options, should be excepted \nfrom discharge  as a debt for willful and malicious  injury. The Plaintiffs contend that, had the Debtor not \nmisled them into believing that he was continuing  to follow their father’s conservative  investment  \nstrategy, they would have intervened  and prevented  the option trading and some or all of the resulting \nlosses. \nThis sub‐count fails for the same reason as did Count III.i. The injury it complains  of is the same; \nand though the present count is based on a separate basis for liability—misrepresentation,  or breach of \nduty to report and account—it  necessarily  and ultimately  involves the same proximate  cause of injury: \nthe Debtor’s investment  of Trust funds in options.  As I found above, the Debtor did not intend by this \nact to cause injury to the Trusts or their beneficiaries,  and the act was not substantially  certain to lead to \nloss of the funds.  Therefore,  even if the Debtor deliberately  deceived his siblings and/or breached  a \nduty to inform them, and even if they would certainly have intervened,  the resulting injury cannot have \nbeen willful within the meaning of § 523(a)(6).  Judgment  shall enter for the Debtor on this sub‐count. \nAttorney’s  Fees \n  The Plaintiffs have demanded  an award of attorney’s  fees for their attorney’s  efforts in the \npresent adversary  proceeding.  They also seek a determination  that any attorney’s  fees to which they \nmay be entitled under state law on the claims excepted from discharge  are themselves  also excepted \nfrom discharge.   \nWith respect to the demand for an award of attorney’s  fees in the present adversary  \nproceeding,  the Debtor responds correctly that, except as set forth in 11 U.S.C. § 523(d) (permitting  \naward to debtors against consumer  creditors in certain circumstances),  which does not apply here, there \nis no basis in law for a shifting of attorney’s  fees in nondischargeability  litigation.  I know of no basis on \nwhich I may award attorney’s  fees to the plaintiff in a proceeding  to determine  the dischargeability  of a \ndebt.  Accordingly,  I will deny the Plaintiffs’  request for attorney’s  fees.  Case 14-01017    Doc 132    Filed 01/17/17    Entered 01/17/17 14:04:51    Desc Main\n Document      Page 49 of 5150 \n However,  attorney’s

 fees, including but not limited those incurred in this adversary  proceeding,  are \namong the damages or relief to which the Plaintiffs are entitled on the claims that are excepted from \ndischarge,  those attorney’s  fees are likewise excepted from discharge.  See Cohen v. de la Cruz, 523 U.S. \n213, 223 (1998) (holding that any debt for fraud “encompasses  any liability from money, property,  etc., \nthat is fraudulently  obtained,  including treble damages,  attorney's  fees, and other relief that may exceed \nthe value obtained by the debtor”). Although Cohen involved a debt for fraud that was excepted from \ndischarge  under § 523(a)(2)(A),  its reasoning  applies equally well to debts for defalcation  while acting in \na fiduciary capacity and for embezzlement  that are excepted from discharge  under § 523(a)(4) \n(excepting  from discharge

 from discharge  “any debt for” willful and malicious  injury). If the Plaintiffs are \nentitled under applicable  nonbankruptcy  law to attorney’s  fees for the acts that constitute  defalcation  \nwhile acting in a fiduciary capacity, embezzlement,  and willful and malicious  injury, then those \nattorney’s  fees are “debt for” defalcation,  embezzlement,  and willful and malicious

    "summary": "1. **Summary:** This opinion from the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey addresses a securities fraud lawsuit against Exscientia P.L.C. and its former executives. Plaintiffs claimed that failures to disclose inappropriate conduct by former executives Andrew Hopkins and David Nicholson violated federal securities laws, rendering the company's public statements false or misleading. The Court dismissed the case, ruling that the plaintiffs did not demonstrate the statements were materially false or misleading, as they often referred to aspirational goals or were otherwise inactionable under securities law. The involvement of AI is noted only as part of Exscientia’s drug discovery process, not directly connected to the claims in the case.\n   \n2. **Key Legal Issue:** Whether Exscientia and its former executives made false or misleading statements or omissions actionable under federal securities laws due to their failure to disclose inappropriate conduct by former executives.\n\n3. **Court's Holding:** The court dismissed the plaintiffs' claims without prejudice, finding that the statements challenged were either inactionable puffery or not shown to be false or misleading when made. Thus, there was no viable claim of securities fraud under Section 10(b) or Rule 10b-5 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation:** Imagine a company promised to be super nice and create a happy place for everyone at work. Later, some bosses at that company behaved badly, and the company didn't tell everyone about it. Some people thought this made the company's promises untrue. But the court said that saying you want to be nice and actually being nice are different things, and just because the bosses didn't follow the rules doesn't mean the company lied to investors. So, for now, the court threw out the case, but it said the people could try again if they found more proof. ",

Levinson , 485 U.S. 224, 230 (1988) .  Not all \ncorporate wrongdoing is covered by the Exchange Act.  See generally  Santa Fe Indus., Inc. v. \nGreen , 430 U.S. 462, 47 3-80 (1977) .  Plaintiffs Frank Campanile and Robert Sullivan seek to \nextend the Exchange Act’s reach to include  inappropriate workplace relationships and \nconduct.   \nAccording to Plaintiffs , Defendants Exscientia P.L.C., Andr ew Hopkins (Exscientia’s \nformer Chief Executive Officer), and David Nicholson (Exscientia’s former Chairman of the \nBoard of Directors) violated federal securities law  because  Hopkins had inappropriate \nrelationships with two female subordinates and  sexually harassed them.   Plaintiffs contend \nthat Hopkins ’ inappropriate conduct  not only violated Exscientia’s code of conduct, but \ncontravened the company’s statements about fostering an inclusive workplace and promoting \ndiversity.   An employee  reported Hopkins ’ conduct to Nicholson,  who, according to \nPlaintiffs, did nothing —despite his obligations  to report that complaint under the code of \nconduct and various company committee charters.  Hence, Plaintiffs claim , Defendants \nviolated federal securities law by not disclosing Hopkins ’ and Nicholson’s misconduct, and Case 1:24-cv-05692-RMB-AMD     Document 36     Filed 10/10/25     Page 1 of 48 PageID:\n<pageID>2 \n that failure to disclose rendered Defendants’ statements in public filings about, among other \nthings,  Exscientia’s code of conduct and fostering an inclusive workplace  false and \nmisleading.  \nFor the reasons that follow, m ost statements  Plaintiffs challenge are inactionable \npuffer y—meaning, they are immaterial because no reasonable investor would rely on them  \nwhen deciding to invest.  Most  statements contain aspirational language  like “we are \ncommitted to,” “expect,” “strive,” “aim,” and so on, which amount to Exscientia’s \nstatements of goals —not material facts.   These a spirational statements cannot be measure d \nfor compliance .  To hold a company liable for securities fraud for failing to live up to it s stated \naspirations could turn all corporate wrongdoing  into securities fraud.  The law requires more.  \nThe alleged inappropriate conduct here was not so pervasive  as to suggest  Exscientia held \nnone of its  stated aspirations.   \nDefendants’ failure to disclose Hopkins’ and Nicholson’s misconduct did not render \nthe challenged statements false or misleading  either .  That an executive ha d an inappropriate \nrelationship  with a subordinate —without more —does not render a company’s statement \nabout having a code of conduct false or misleading.  Nothing in Exscientia’s statements  that \nPlaintiffs challenge  suggest s or impl ies Hopkins or Nicholson would not violate  Exscientia’s  \ncode of conduct or would not engage in misconduct.    \nTherefore, for the reasons  below , the Court grants Defendants’ motion to dismiss.  The \nCourt dismisses Plaintiffs’ claims without prejudice.    \n   Case 1:24-cv-05692-RMB-AMD     Document 36     Filed 10/10/25     Page 2 of 48 PageID:\n<pageID>3 \n I. BACKGROUND1 \n \nA.

[Code at 1.]  It applies to “directors, ex ecutive s, \nemployees, and independent contractors of Exscientia and its subsidiaries.”  [ Id.] \nThe “Code is a statement of certain fundamental principles, policies and procedures \nthat govern Exscientia personnel in the conduct of [its]  business.”  [ Id. at 3.]  It says Exscientia \nis “committed to maintaining the highest standards of business conduct and ethics.”  [ Id. at \n1.]  The Code declares, “It is unacceptable to cut legal or ethical corners for  the benefit of \n[Exscientia] or for personal benefit.”  [ Id.]  The  Code is “designed to ens ure” that Exscientia \nand its employees:  (1) “operate . . . business ethically and with integrity;” (2) “avoid actual \nor apparent conflicts of interest;” (3) “comply with the letter and spirit of all laws and Exscientia policies . . . .;” and (4) “promptly internally report suspected violations of this \nCode.”  [Id.]  The Code also says, “ Consistent with our core values, Exscientia personnel \nmust act and perform their duties ethically, honestly and with integrity – doing the right thing \neven when ‘no one is looking .’”  [Id.]    \nExscientia  “will” investigate “[r]eported violations of the Code” and take “appropriate \naction.”  [ Id. at 3.]   Any violations of the Code “may result in disciplinary  action[, ]” which \n \n2 Defendants have offered the Code and other documents containing the  statements referenced in the Amended \nComplaint, like Exscientia’s Annual Reports .  [See generally  Wright Decl.]  “[W]hen a complaint references \nextrinsic documents, courts can consider the documents so long as they are ‘ undisputedly authentic ’ and ‘the \ncomplainant's claims are based upon [those] documents. ’” Premier Orthopaedic Assocs. of S.

Plaintiffs have not challenged the authenticity of any document Defendants have \nproffered , and as such, the Court will consider them.  \n \n \n Case 1:24-cv-05692-RMB-AMD     Document 36     Filed 10/10/25     Page 4 of 48 PageID:\n<pageID>5 \n includes “termination of employment and legal proceedings if warranted.” [ Id.]  The Code \nalso provides a repo rting system for Code violations.  [ Id. at 3-4.] And it says Exscientia \n“expects  [its] employees to do their best  to comply with this [reporting] policy.”  [ Id. at 4.]   \nThe Code also says that employees who know about a violation of the Code and fail to report \nit, “may be subject to disciplinary action [.]”  [Id.]   \nGiven their positions, Hopkins and Nichol son were “ required to execute” the \nacknowledgment annexed to the Code.  [Am. Compl. ¶ 93.]   Plaintiffs claim that “Class \nPeriod investors were told” Hopkins and Nicholson “each certified that they understood and \nwould comply with the Code and report [any] possible violations of the Code.”  [ Id.]   \nIn addition to the Code , Exscientia had written charters for three “standing \ncommittees ” for the Board :  the Nomination Committee, the Audit Committee , and the \nRemuneration Committee.  [ Am. Compl. ¶  118; Wright Decl. ¶¶  8-10, Exs. G -I (Docket Nos. \n26-3).]  Like a code of conduct, NASDA Q requires companies to adopt and file board \ncommittee charters.  NASDAQ Rule 5605.  \n The Nomination Committee ’s Charter says the Committee’s purpose is to:   (1) “help \nthe Board oversee the Company’s corporate governance functions[;]”  (2) “identify, evaluate, \nrecommend, and communicate with candidates qualified to become Board members or nominees for directors of the Board[;]”  and (3) “ make other recommendations to the Board \nrelating to the directors of the Company.”  [Nomination Committee Charter at 1.]  The Charter also says, “[t]he [Nomination] Committee will communicate with the Board, \nCommittee chairpersons, members of senior management, and independent professional \nadvisors to the Board and its various committees, as appropriate.”  [ Id. at 2.]   And it allows \nthe Nomination  Committee  to “retain legal, accounting, or other outside advisors ” if the Case 1:24-cv-05692-RMB-AMD     Document 36     Filed 10/10/25     Page 5 of 48 PageID:\n<pageID>6 \n Committee “concludes that it must” do so.  [Id.]  The Charter also lays out the Nomination  \nCommittee ’s responsibilities , which according to the Charter, “are a guide and should remain \nflexible to account for changing circumstances and needs.”  [ Id.]  \nThese  responsibilities  include the Nomination Committee ’s responsibility “to identify \nand evaluate candidates, including nomination of incumbent directors for re -election and \nnominees recommended by shareholders to serve on the Board.”  [ Id.]  For this task, the \nCharter says the Nomination Committee must use certain “criteria approved by the Board,” \nand consider “ potential conflicts of interest, director independence, and other requirements.”  \n[Id.]  The Charter also says the Nomination Committee must “periodically review” the \nBoard’s  performance.   [Id.]  And in making this assessment, the Committee  must evaluate \n“the Board’s contribution as a whole and the Board’s effectiveness in serving the best interests \nof the Company and its shareholders, specific areas in which the Board and/or management believe contributions could be improved, and overall Board composition and makeup.”  [ Id. \nat 2-3.]  This requires the Nomination Committee to consider  “whether the directors, both \nindividually and collectively, can and do provide the integrity, experience,  judgment, \ncommitment, skills, diversity and expertise appropriate for the Company .”  [Id. at 3.]  And \nfor “Environmental, Social and Corporate Governance (E SG) Matters” the Charter says the \nNomination Committee  must “oversee and periodically review [such] matters relevant to the \nCompany’s business, including policies and practices concerning[,]” among other things, \n“corporate social responsibility” and “employee diversity .”  [Id.]   \nAccording to its Charter, the Audit Committee’s purpose is to help the Board  “in \nfulfilling its legal and  fiduciary obligations with respect to matters involving the accounting, \nauditing, financial reporting,  internal controls and legal compliance functions of the Case 1:24-cv-05692-RMB-AMD     Document 36     Filed 10/10/25     Page 6 of 48 PageID:\n<pageID>7 \n Company and its subsidiaries[.]  [Audit Committee Charter at 1.]  This includes helping the \nBoard’s  oversight of, among other things, Exscientia’s “corporate accounting and financial \nreporting process,” the selection of accountants to serve as “independent outside auditors[,]” compliance with “legal and regulatory requirements required by English law” o r SEC and \nNASDAQ rules and regulations.  [ Id.]  The Charter also says the Audit Committee must \nprovide “regular reports and information to the Board with res pect to material issues.”  [ Id.]    \nIt also tasks the Audit Committee with revie wing “ management’s efforts to monitor \ncompliance with the Company’s programs and policies adhering to applicable laws and rules, including the [Code].”  [ Id.]     \nExscientia ’s Remuneration Committee helps the Board  oversee, among other things, \nthe company’s compensation policies, and executive officer compensation.  [Remuneration Committee Charter at 1.]  The Committee’s  Charter lays out the Committee’s responsibilities , \nbut the responsibilities —like those  listed in  the Nomination Committee’ s Charter —\"are a \nguide and should remain flexible to account for changing circumstances and needs.”  [ Id. at \n2.]  These responsibilities  include , among other things, “ reviewing, evaluating, and approving \nemployment agreements ” of Exscientia’s executive officers.  [Id.]  The Charter also says the \nRemuneration Committee  must review and approve compensation for the company’s CEO, \nand “evaluate the [CEO’s] performance in achieving corporate performance goals and \nobjectives.”  [ Id. at 2.]   In evaluating the CEO’s performance, t he Charter says the \nRemuneration  Committee must consider, among other things,  the CEO’s “ fostering [of] a \ncorporate culture that promotes the highest level of integrity and the highest ethical standards.”  [ Id.]  \n Case 1:24-cv-05692-RMB-AMD     Document 36     Filed 10/10/25     Page 7 of 48 PageID:\n<pageID>8 \n C. The # MeToo Movement  \nPlaintiffs frame  their claims around the # MeToo movement.   [Am. Compl. ¶¶ 10-11, \n47-57.]  As Exscientia grew to new heights,  so too did the # MeToo movement.   Originally \ncoined in 2006, M eToo is a phrase used “to promote awareness of sexual assault and sexual \nharassment. ”  Michael Conklin, #metoo Effects on Juror Decision Making , 11 Cal. L. Rev. Online \n179, 180 (2020).    In response to reports of sexual assault or harassment, s ocial media users \nwould use the hashtag “Me Too” to share that they have been victims of sexual assault or \nharassment.   Ann Nenoff, #metoo: A Look at the Influence and Limits of “Hashtag Activism” to \nEffectuate Legal Change , 2020 U. Ill. L. Rev. 1327, 1335 (2020).   The  #MeToo movement \nspread .  Coupled with investigative journalism, the # MeToo movement led  to the downfall \nof prominent executives , from the movie  studio to the newsroom to the boardroom.   [Am. \nCompl. ¶ 47.]   See also  Eleana Nicolaou & Courtney Smith, A #MeToo Timeline to Show How \nFar We’ve Come — & How Far We Need to Go , Refinery29, Oct. 5, 2019 (last updated) , \nhttps://www.refinery29.com/en -us/2018/10/212801/me -too-movement- history -timeline -\nyear-weinstein (last visited Aug. 24, 2025).   \nThe #MeToo movement made its way to the UK  and led to the outing and eventual \nouster of prominent CEOs.  [Am. Compl. ¶ ¶ 47-51.]  The UK reacted, creating regulatory \nframeworks to address sexual harassment in the workplace.  [ Id. ¶ 48.]  Since 2017, the UK \nhas require d public, private, and volunteer sector employers with 250 or more employees to \nreport annually on their gender pay .  [Id. ¶ 55.]   Employers  need not provide  a narrative to \ndescribe the contexts of the pay gap or explain any actions the company will take to address \nthe gap.   [Id.]  \n Case 1:24-cv-05692-RMB-AMD     Document 36     Filed 10/10/25     Page 8 of 48 PageID:\n<pageID>9 \n D. Exscient ia’s Public Filings  \n \n1. The Form 20 -Fs  \n \n Because Exscientia is a foreign company whose securities trade on the NASD AQ, see \nAm. Compl. ¶¶ 2, 4,  the SEC requires it to file annual reports on a Form 20 -F.  See generally  \n17 C.F.R. §§ 240.13a- 1, 240. 15d-1, 249.220f .  In March 2022, Exscientia filed its 2021 Annual \nReport on Form 20 -F with the SEC reporting the company’s financial and operational res ults \nfor 2021.  [Am. Compl. ¶ 89.]  Hopkins signed the Form 20 -F, and provided a certification \nrequired by the  Sarbanes -Oxley Act of 2002 (SOX Certification), attesting to, among other \nthings, the accuracy of the financial reporting  and disclosure of all fraud involving \nmanagement.  [ Id.; see also  Wright Decl. ¶ 7,  Ex. F  (2021 20- F).]     \n In that 20 -F, Exscientia stated the Code applies “ to all of our employees, officers and \ndirectors and is available on our website.”  [Am. Compl. ¶ 90; see also  2021 20- F at 227.]   \nExscientia also described its “Culture” by stating:  \nDiversity is an important area of focus for us. We are a global \ncompany, and our internationalism is reflected in our workforce \nwhich represents  more than 30 nationalities, from six continents. \nWe will continue to work on our internal initiatives and \nprocesses to ensure that Exscientia  remains an inclusive and \nwelcoming place to work for all while working to improve our sex, racial and cultural diversity at all levels in the  organisation.  \n \n[Am. Compl. ¶ 102; 2021 20- F at 125.]  \n The 2021 20- F also disclosed commercial risks , including the risks of  losing personnel \nand reputational harm.  [Am. Compl. ¶¶ 98, 100; 2021 20- F at 62 -63.]  For example, \nExscient ia stated, “Our future success depends on our ability to retain key executives and to \nattract and motivate qualified personnel.”  [ Id.]  Exscient ia stated it is “highly dependent” on, \namong others, “principal members of our management.”  [ Id.]  It added:  Case 1:24-cv-05692-RMB-AMD     Document 36     Filed 10/10/25     Page 9 of 48 PageID:\n<pageID>10 \n The loss of the services of our executive officers or other key \nemployees could impede the achievement of our development \nand sales goals in  our software business and the achievement of \nour research, development and commercialisation objectives in \nour drug discovery business. In either case, the loss of the services \nof our executive officers or other key employees could seriously harm our ability to successfully implement our business strategy. \nFurthermore, replacing executive officers and key employees \nmay be difficult and may take an extended period of time  because \nof the limited number of individuals with the breadth of skills and experience required to successfully develop, gain regulatory \napproval  of, and commercialise products in  the life sciences \nindustry.  \n \n[Id.]   \nExscient ia also said, “Our employees, independent contractors, consultants and vendors may \nengage in misconduct or other improper activities, including non- compliance with regulatory \nstandards and requirements and insider trading laws, which could cause significant liability \nfor us and harm our reputation.”  [Am. Compl. ¶ 100; 2021 20- F at 6 0.]  \n In March 2023, Exscientia filed its 2022 Annual Report on Form 20 -F with the SEC \nreporting the company’s financial and operational results for 2022.  [Am. Compl. ¶ 108.]  Like \nthe 2021 Form 20- F, Hopkins signed a SOX Certification for the 2022 Form 20- F.  [Id.; see \nalso Wright Decl. ¶ 11,  Ex. J (2022 20-F).]    Exscientia ’s statements in the 2021 20- F mirrored \nthose in the 2022 20- F.  [Am. Compl. ¶ 109.]  Hopkins’ SOX Certifications for the 2021 and \n2022 20-Fs matched.  [ Id.]  \n2. The Annual Reports  \nIn April 2022, Exscientia filed a Form 6 -K with the SEC announcing, among other \nthings, its distribution of its  annual report to its shareholders.  [ Id. ¶ 106.]  Exscientia directed \nits shareholders to its website where they could find the company’s 2021 Annual Report.  [ Id.]  \nIn that report, when discussing Exscientia’s “Culture [,]” Exscientia referenced the Code , its Case 1:24-cv-05692-RMB-AMD     Document 36     Filed 10/10/25     Page 10 of 48 PageID:\n<pageID>11 \n policies “that promote the principles of human rights[,]”  and its efforts to “undertake an \nannual review of its policies and procedures to establish its position with regard to compliance and best practice, and monitor and promote a healthy corporate culture.”   [Id.; see also  Wright \nDecl. ¶ 3, Ex. B (2021 Annual Report).]  For the Code, Exscienti a stated : \nThe Group maintains and operates pursuant to a Code of \nConduct and Business Ethics, which is designed to ensure the \nGroup operates its business ethically and with integrity and to \navoid actual or apparent conflicts of  interests. The Group also \nmaintains an Anti -Bribery Policy. The Code of Conduct and \nBusiness Ethics and Anti -Bribery Policy applies to all directors, \nofficers, and employees of the Group.  \n \n[2021 Annual Report at 53.]    \nAnd for its employees’ “human rights[,]” Exscientia “will respect” those rights, by, among \nother things, “ensuring employees are free from discrimination and coercion[.]”  [ Id.]   \n In April 2023, Exscientia filed a Form 6 -K with the SEC that was very similar  to its \n2022 Form 6- K.  [Am. Compl.  ¶ 110. ]   It too directed shareholders to  Exscientia’s 2022 \nAnnual Report available on its  website.  [ Id.]   The 2022 Annual Report’s statements on the \nCode, respecting its employees’ “human rights[,]” and its practice of policy review to “monitor and promote a healthy corporate culture ” mirrored the 2021 Annual Report.  [ Id.; \nsee also  Wright Decl. ¶  4, Ex. C (2022 Annual Report).]  \n3. The Gender Pay Gap Report  \nIn April 2023, Exscientia published its UK Gender Pay Gap Report as required by \nUnited Kingdom law.  [Am. Compl. ¶  111; see also  Wright Decl. ¶ 5, Ex. D (the Gender Pay \nGap Report). ]  Hopkins authored the  Gender Pay Gap Report ’s introduction, writing, “At \nExscientia [,] we are committed to offering fair, equal, and  unbiased recruitment, promotion, \nand reward mechanisms  and an inclusive work environment.”  [Gender Pay Gap Report at Case 1:24-cv-05692-RMB-AMD     Document 36     Filed 10/10/25     Page 11 of 48 PageID:\n<pageID>12 \n 2.]  When discussing Exscientia’s “[a]ctions ” taken to close the gender pay gap, Exscientia \nsaid,  \nWhilst we all need to recognise that  [there]  are no ‘quick fixes’ \nto resolving our Gender Pay Gap, we are committed to building  \non our progress so far and to continuing to foster a diverse \nworkforce both within and beyond Exscientia. There are  several \nactions we have been taking as a business and we will continue \nto focus on them to help improve the diversity of our workforce \nwhich will impact factors such as our gender pay gap.  \n [Id. at 6.]    \nThose actions include , among other things, “aim[ing] to ensure at least 50% of all \nvacant Executive Director and above roles are filled by women[ ,]” and working with “[a] non-\nprofit organization supporting girls, young men, and non -binary people into [STEM] subjects \nor careers.”  [ Id.]  And in describing future actions, Exscientia wrote,  \nLooking ahead . . . We need to play our part in encouraging girls \nto consider STEM  (Science, Technology, Engineering, \nMathematics) careers. Inspiring  young women to work in STEM \nin our community will build a female  talent pipeline for the long \nterm. It’s going to take some time for  Exscientia and our peers to \nimprove senior female representation.   Bringing these issues to \nlife through initiatives like UK gender pay  gap reporting is \nimportant for making sure we continue to progress  in the right \ndirection.  \n \n[Id. at 7.]   \nE. Complaint s about Hopkins ’ Inappropriate Conduct and Hopkins’ Downfall  \nAs CEO, Hopkins had  several  assistants.  [Am. Compl. ¶¶ 58, 65.]  From November \n2021 to December 2022, a female employee  (who Plaintiffs have not identified) worked as the \nStrategic Assistant to Hopkins .  [Id. ¶ 58.]   The Court refers to this employee as “Female 1” \n(FE1).  During her time  as Strategic Assistant to Hopkins, Hopkins “behav[ed] \ninappropriately” towards FE1  (Plaintiffs have not identified what Hopkins did or said to her).  \n[Id. ¶ 59.]  Hopkins ’ inappropriate  behavior “traumatized her.”  [Id.] According to FE1, Case 1:24-cv-05692-RMB-AMD     Document 36     Filed 10/10/25     Page 12 of 48 PageID:\n<pageID>13 \n “Hopkins displayed a pattern of toxic behavior towards  women.” [Id. at 63 (internal quotation \nmarks omitted).]     \n Sometime around August 2022, FE1  reported Hopkins ’ “inappropriate behavior \ntowards her[]” to Nicholson.  [ Id. ¶ 60.]  According to FE1 , Nicholson “did nothing at all \nabout it.”  [ Id.]  Nicholson did not report Hopkins’  misconduct to the Board , but i nstead,  \nengaged outside counsel.  [ Id. ¶ 61.]    Given Hopkins’ conduct and Nicholson’s “refusal to \nact” on her  report, FE1 felt she “had no choice but to leave” Exscientia.   [Id.]  She not only \nleft Exscientia , “she move [d] hundreds of miles to get away from Hopkins” and “left the \nbiotech industry” altogether .  [Id. ¶ 62.]   \nFE1 knows that Hopkins had a relationship with another of his female assistants.  [ Id. \n¶ 65.]  Plaintiffs have not identified the name of this employee so the Court refers to her as  \n“Female 2 ” (FE2).  According to FE1, FE2 was the “Executive Assistant to the CEO” from \nJuly 2017 to October 2021.  [ Id.]  FE1 claims that Hopkins had a relationship with FE2  \n“years” before Hopkins ’ “inappropriate behavior towards” her.   [Id. ¶ 66.]   \nIn February 2024, Exscientia filed a Form 6 -K with the SEC and issued a press release \nannouncing that Exscientia had terminated Hopkins’ employment as CEO and Principal \nExecutive Officer  and removed him from the Board  “for cause .”  [Id. ¶ 128; see also  Wright \nDecl. ¶ 6, Ex. E ( 2024 Form 6 -K) (Docket No. 26 -3).]  Exscientia’s Board terminated Hopkins \nafter an investigation uncovered he “had engaged in relationships with two employees that \nthe Board determined were inappropriate and inconsistent with the Company’s standards and \nvalues.”  [ Id.]  FE1 claims that she and FE2  are the two employees referenced in that press \nrelease.  [Am. Compl. ¶¶ 59, 65.]   Case 1:24-cv-05692-RMB-AMD     Document 36     Filed 10/10/25     Page 13 of 48 PageID:\n<pageID>14 \n A Board  special committee  had retained outside counsel to investigate Hopkins’ \nconduct.  [ 2024 Form 6 -K.]  During that investigation, the Board  learned that Nicholson knew \nabout Hopkins’ relationship s and “had addressed the situation directly, and with the \ninvolvement of other outside counsel, rather  than in consultation with the Board .”  [Id.]  After \n“discussions with the Board,” Nicholson chose to resign.  [ Id.; see also  Am. Compl. ¶ 129.]  \nFollowing the press release, Exscientia’s stock price plummeted, declining about 23% \nby the close of the day of the press release.  [ Am. Compl. ¶ 1 30.]  This decline is “the largest \nsingle -day decline Exscientia stock experienced in the Company’s history[.]”  [ Id.]  \nF. The Lawsuit  \nMonths after Exscientia announced the firing of Hopkins and departure of Nicholson, \nlitigation ensued.  [ See generally  Compl. (Docket No. 1).]  Plaintiffs sue  Exscientia, Hopkins, \nand Nicholson for committing securities fraud.  [ See generally  Am. Compl.]  Plaintiffs claim \nthat they made several misrepresentations or misleading statements  that violated federal \nsecurities law.  [ Id. ¶¶ 89-127.]   Those statements can be grouped into five categories :  \nstatements about  (1) the Code ( referenced  in the 20 -Fs and Annual Reports  and the Code \nitself)  (the Code Statements) ; (2) Exscientia’s corporate culture and diversity efforts (found in \nthe 20 -Fs, Annual Reports, and the Gender Pay Gap Report)  (the Corporate Culture and \nDiversity Statements); (3) the risk disclosure (contained in the 20 -Fs) (the Risk Disclosure \nStatements); (4) Exscient ia’s committees, like the Nomination Committee (contained in the \nCommittee Charters) (the Charter Statements); and (5) the SOX Certifications.  \n1. The Code Statements  \nPlaintiffs claim that the Code Statements  “were false and materially misleading when \nmade” because when Exscientia made the statements about the Code,  Hopkins had sexually Case 1:24-cv-05692-RMB-AMD     Document 36     Filed 10/10/25     Page 14 of 48 PageID:\n<pageID>15 \n harassed and engaged in in appropriate relations with company employees, and as such, \nHopkins did not comply with the Code.  [ Am. Compl. ¶ 97.]   Nicholson  did not comply with \nthe Code either because he knew about Hopkins ’ inappropriate relationship and failed to act.  \n[Id.]  According to Plaintiffs, “the statements in the Code were not reflective of the true policy \nin place at Exscientia because Exscientia had an unwritten policy of condoning Hopkins ’ \nethical transgressions and predatory behavior towards female employees[.]”  [Id.]   \n2. The Corporate Culture and Diversity Statements  \nPlaintiffs  also challenge the Corporate Culture and Diversity Statements  as false and \nmisleading .  [Am. Compl. ¶¶  103, 107, 113- 15.]  For example, Plaintiffs claim that \nExscientia ’s statement in  the 2021 20-F, depicting Exscientia  as an inclusive and welcoming \nplace to work , was false given Hopkins’ misconduct and inappropriate relationships with \nsubordinates.  [ Id. ¶ 103.]    They also assert Exscientia’s statement in the 2021 Annual Report \nabout “respect[ing]” its employees’ “human rights” by “ensuring employees are free from \ndiscrimination and coercion” was false and misleading given Hopkins’ conduct.  [ Id. ¶ 103.]    \nLikewise, Plaintiffs claim Exscientia’s statements in the Gender Pay  Gap Report —that the \ncompany is “committed to offering . . . an inclusive work environment” and “to continuing \nto foster a diverse workforce ”—were false and misleading given Hopkins’ conduct towards \nwomen.  [ Id. ¶¶ 113-17.] \n3. The Risk Disclosure Statements  \nFor the Risk Disclosure Statements , Plaintiffs assert those statements are misleading \nand incomplete  because Exscientia failed to disclose Hopkins’ and Nicholson’s conduct.   [ Id. \n¶¶ 99-101.]   For example, Plaintiffs claim that Exscientia’s disclosure —that “loss of the \nservices of our executive officers or other key employees could seriously harm our ability to Case 1:24-cv-05692-RMB-AMD     Document 36     Filed 10/10/25     Page 15 of 48 PageID:\n<pageID>16 \n implement our business strategy”—was mi sleading because when Exscientia made that \ndisclosure, Hopkins had inappropriate relationships with subordinates, and as such, expose d \nExscient ia to the loss of Hopkins’ services as CEO, which in turn, could harm Exscientia’s \nbusiness.  [ Id. ¶ 99.]    \n4. The Charter Statements  \nThey also challenge the Committee Charters  as false and misleading.  [Id. ¶¶ 118-127.]   \nPlaintiffs claim statements in the Committee Charters are  false because Nicholson failed to \nfollow them by not reporting Hopkins to the Board  when FE1 disclosed  Hopkins’ misconduct \nto him.  [ Id. ¶ 122, 124.]    \n5. The Sox Certifications  \nLastly, Plaintiffs challenge the Sox Certifications as false and misleading because \nHopkins signed the certifications knowing he had been violating the Code . [Id. ¶¶ 105, 109.]   \nAccording to Plaintiffs, the Sox Certifications are false and misleading because the \ncertification s attest to the accuracy of the underlying SEC filing, like the Annual Report s or \n20-Fs, and the underlying filing contains  false or misleading statements given Hopkins’ \nmisconduct.  \nII. DISCUSSION  \n \nDefendants now move to dismiss this lawsuit, arguing Plaintiffs have not stated a \nplausible federal securities law claim.  [Defs.’ Mem. of Law in Supp. of Mot. to Dismiss 9 -30 \n(Defs.’ Br.) (Docket No. 26 -1).]   \nA.

Sec. Litig., ____ F. 4th ___, ___, 2025 WL 2406864, at \n*5 (3d Cir. Aug. 20, 2025) (alteration in original) (quoting 17 C.F.R. § 240.10b- 5(b)).   \n“Together, § 10(b) and Rule 10b- 5 imply a private cause of action for securities fraud.”  \nCity of Warren Police & Fire Ret. Sys. v. Prudential Fin., Inc., 70 F.4th 668, 679 (3d Cir. 2023).   \nTo prevail on a private securities fraud claim, a plaintiff must show:  “ (1) a material \nmisrepresentation or omission by the defendant; (2) scienter; (3) a connection between the misrepresentation or omission and the purchase or sale of a security; (4) reliance upon the \nmisrepresentation or omission; (5) economic loss; and (6) loss causation.” Matrixx Initiatives, \nInc. v. Siracusano , 563 U.S. 27, 37–38 (2011) (quoting Stoneridge Investment Partners, LLC v. \nScientific –Atlanta, Inc., 552 U.S. 148, 157 (2008)).  \nA plaintiff bringing a  Section 10(b) claim must satisfy  the “heightened pleading \nstandards” imposed by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b) and the Private Securities \nLitigation Reform Act of 1995 (PSLRA).  City of Warren , 70 F. 4th at 680.  Rule 9(b) and the \nPSLRA “ require facts to be pleaded ‘with particularity.’”  Institutional Invs. Grp. v. Avaya, Inc ., \n564 F.3d 242, 253 (3d Cir. 2009) .  When pleading false and misleading statements , the \nPSLRA requires a plaintiff to “specify each statement alleged to have been misleading, the Case 1:24-cv-05692-RMB-AMD     Document 36     Filed 10/10/25     Page 17 of 48 PageID:\n<pageID>44 \n b. The Charter Statements are not false or misleading.  \nCourts have found company statements about its committee’s functions actionable \nwhere the committee s were fictitious or entirely nonfunctional .  See, e.g. , SEC v. Falstaff Brewing \nCorp. , 629 F.2d 62, 75 (D.C. Cir. 1980) (finding statements about audit committee in prox y \nstatement false and misleading where  audit committee did not exist, reasoning “ [s]tating that \nan audit committee, with its implication of careful oversight, existed when it did not thus is \nmisleading ”); see also  Craig , 2024 WL 4979234, at *9 (finding proxy statements that company’s \nboard “was monitoring for social and political risks” and delegated that task to a committee \nwere false and misleading where plaintiff alleged committee was not monitoring for social or \npolitical risks relating to c ompany’s pride campaign).   But courts have  found statements  that \nmerely describ e a committee’s functions or recite an executive’s  responsibilities —without \nmore —not false or misleading.  See Kooker ex rel. Hecla Mining Co. v. Baker , 497 F. Supp. 3d 1, \n7 (D.  Del. 2020) . \nThe Charter Statements here are not false or misleading.  To start, Plaintiffs do not \nclaim the Committees did not exist or that the Committee  Charters misrepresent committee \nmembers’ responsibilities.  Rather, they claim  the Charter Statements are false and misleading \nbecause Nicholson did not perform  his responsibilities  as required by the Charters.  [Pls.’ \nOpp’n Br. at 29 -30.]  Said simply , Nicholson did not  do his job.   But nothing in the Charters \nsuggest s or impl ies that committee members will always fulfill their stated responsibilities.   \nThe Charters make no historical representations about compliance.  \n  Committee charters are like codes of conduct because companies are required to \nadopt them  by law.   NASDAQ Rule 5605; NYSE Rule 303A.   Like codes of conduct, the \nmere adoption of a committee charter “ simply does not imply that all of its directors and Case 1:24-cv-05692-RMB-AMD     Document 36     Filed 10/10/25     Page 44 of 48 PageID:\n<pageID>45 \n officers ” will abide by the charter.  See  Andropolis , 505 F. Supp. 2d at 686; see also  City of \nRoseville , 686 F. Supp. 2d at 415.    An executive ’s violation of a  committee charter —by itself —\ndoes not render a company’s statements about the charter or the committee’s responsibilities \nfalse or misleading.  Cf.  Braskem , 246 F. Supp. 3d at 756 (“There is an important difference \nbetween a company's announcing rules forbidding bribery and it[] factually representing that \nno officer has engaged in such forbidden conduct.”).    \nAt best, Plaintiffs only allege that Nicholson did not adequately perform his committee \nresponsibilities  because he did not immediately report FE1 ’s complaint to the Board and \nrecommend that Hopkins be fired.   [Am. Compl . ¶¶ 118- 27.]   FE1 complained to Nicholson  \nabout Hopkins’ misconduct in August 2022.  [ Id. ¶ 60.]   Plaintiffs offer no allegation as to \nwhat FE1 specifically told Nicholson.  At any rate, Plaintiffs admit that at some point in time, \nNicholson retained outside counsel.  [ Id. ¶ 61.]   Plaintiffs ’ allegation s that Nicholson did so \nto conceal Hopkins ’ misconduct from the Board  are conclusory  at best , which the Court need \nnot accept.   See  Ashcroft v. Iqbal , 556 U.S. 662, 678- 79 (2009).   Companies retain outside \ncounsel  to investigate internal malfeasance all the time.  Indeed, the Board  itself retained \noutside counsel to investigate Hopkins ’ misconduct.   [2024 Form 6- K.]   In fact, the \nCommittee Charters authorize d committee members to retain outside counsel t o perform \ncommittee functions.  [See, e.g ., Nomination Committee Charter at 2.]    That Nicholson did \nnot perform his job to Plaintiffs ’ liking does not mean Exscientia’s statements about its \ncommittees and their responsibilities are false or misleading.    \nAnd Craig  cannot save the day for Plaintiffs. There, the court found Target’s proxy \n“oversight statements” plausibly misleading because Target affirmatively represented that its Board and Governance & Sustainability Committee were “fulfilling the oversight” Case 1:24-cv-05692-RMB-AMD     Document 36     Filed 10/10/25     Page 45 of 48 PageID:\n<pageID>46 \n responsibility for social/political risks and “conducting regular priority assessments” —\npresent‑tense attestations about actual monitoring in an area where plaintiffs pleaded prior \nboycotts and an executive admission that Target had not adequately assessed the risk, leading \nto “self‑inflicted”  backlash.   2024 WL 4979234, at *9.   Unlike Craig , the Committee Charters  \ndo not state the committees were presently “fulfilling” their responsibilitie s; they expressly \nsay the committees’ responsibilities “are a guide  and should remain flexible .”  [See, e.g.,  \nNomination Committee Charter at 2.]   The Charters are mandated governance  frameworks , \nnot performance attestations .   \n5. The SOX Certifications  \na. Parties’ Arguments  \nDefendants contend Plaintiffs’ challenge to the SOX Certifications fails because they  \nhave  not shown that any of the other challenged statements were false or misleading.  [ Defs.’ \nBr. at 21. ]  They assert that Plaintiffs base their entire challenge to the SOX C ertification s on \nthe underlying SEC filings, like the 20 -Fs.  [ Id.]  Because Plaintiffs have not shown the \nunderlying SEC filings contain an actionable false or misleading statement, the SOX \nCertifications are inactionable.  [ Id.]   \nPlaintiffs push back, arguing the SOX C ertifications  are false or misleading because \nExscientia’s SEC filings contain false or misleading statements.  [ Pls.’ Opp’n Br. at 30 -31.]  \nThey claim the SOX C ertifications are actionable because when Hopkins signed them, he \nknew Exscientia’s 20 -Fs contained  false statements.  [ Id. at 31.]  \nb. The SOX Certifications are  inactionable.  \n“SOX certifications are not disclosure documents per se .”  Zhengyu He v. China Zenix \nAuto Int'l Ltd. , 2020 WL 3169506, at *7 (D.N.J. June 12, 2020) . “[T]hey verify the accuracy Case 1:24-cv-05692-RMB-AMD     Document 36     Filed 10/10/25     Page 46 of 48 PageID:\n<pageID>47 \n and completeness of disclosures,” like the information contained in an underlying SEC filing , \nsuch as an annual report.  Id.; accord  Rosi v. Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc., 2021 WL 1177505, at *21 \n(S.D.N.Y. Mar. 29, 2021) (“Either the SEC filings contain materially misleading statements \n(in which case those statements can form the basis for liability) or they do not contain such \nstatements. An allegation that the certification is false and misleading adds nothing. ”).  So, to \ndetermine whether a SOX certification is false or misleading, courts must look to the \nunderlying filing accompanying the certification.   Zhengyu He , 2020 WL 3169506, at *7 \n(finding 2015 and 2016 SOX certifications inactionable where plaintiffs failed to  show the \nunderlying annual reports were false or misleading); accord Burns v. UP Fintechup Fintech \nHolding Ltd., 2025 WL 936539, at *8 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 27, 2025) (“Because Plaintiff fails to adequately plead an actionable misstatement or omission regarding the Annual Reports, \nPlaintiff's claim based on the SOX certifications necessarily fails.”) . \nPlaintiffs ’ challenge to the SOX Certifications  rests on Exscientia’s 20 -Fs, which, in \nturn, contain, among other things, the Code Statements  and Risk Disclosure  Statements .  \n[Am. Comp l. ¶¶ 89- 109.]   As explained above, the statements Plaintiffs challenge are  either \ninactionable puffery or Plaintiffs have not shown that those statements were  false or \nmisleading  when made.    Consequently , the SOX Certifications are inactionable.  Rosi, 2021 \nWL 1177505, at *21 (“Absent any material misstatements or omissions in [company’s] SEC filings, Defendants cannot be liable through their SOX certifications.”).   \n*  *  *  \n To sum up, Plaintiffs have not plausibly alleged that Defendants made a false or \nmisleading statement of material fac t.  Matrixx Initiatives, 563 U.S. at  38.  Thus, they have \nfailed to state a claim under Section 10(b) and Rule 10b -5. Case 1:24-cv-05692-RMB-AMD     Document 36     Filed 10/10/25     Page 47 of 48 PageID:\n<pageID>48 \n C. Section 20(a) Liability  \nSection 20(a) of the Exchange Act imposes joint and several liability on “one who \ncontrols a violator of Section 10(b). ”  In re Suprema Specialties, Inc. Sec. Litig. , 438 F.3d 256, \n284 (3d Cir. 2006) (citing 15 U.S.C. § 78t(a)).  Section 20(a) liability “is derivative of an \nunderlying violation of Section 10(b) by the controlled person. ”  Rahman v. Kid Brands, Inc., \n736 F.3d 237, 247 (3d Cir. 2013) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).   So a Section \n20(a) claim can rise or fall with a Section 10(b) claim. See, e.g. , Feldman v. Scynexis, Inc., 2025 \nWL 2158517, at *12 (D.N.J. July 30, 2025) (dismissing Section 20(a) claim where plaintiff \nfailed to state a claim under Section 10(b)).   \n Because Plaintiffs have not plausibly alleged that Defendants  violat ed Section 10(b) or \nRule 10b- 5, Plaintiff s’ Section 20(a) claim fails  as well .  In re Bio -Tech. Gen. Corp. Sec. Litig., \n380 F. Supp. 2d 574, 597 (D.N.J. 2005) ( dismissing  Section 20(a) claim because plaintiff failed \nto plead violation of Section 10(b) or Rule 10b -5). \nIII.  CONCLUSION  \nFor the above reasons, the Court GRANTS  Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss ( Docket \nNo. 26).  The Court  DISMISSES  the Amended Complaint WITHOUT PREJUDICE, and \ngrants Plaintiffs  leave to amend  within thirty days  from the date of the accompanying Order  \nto address the foregoing deficiencies if they can.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: This is a securities fraud putative class action where plaintiffs Tonya Hills and Oklahoma Law Enforcement Retirement System allege that BioXcel Therapeutics, Inc., along with its executives, made materially misleading disclosures that caused an artificial inflation of BioXcel’s stock value. These claims are centered on the use of artificial intelligence by BioXcel to find new therapeutic uses for pre-existing drugs, particularly BXCL501. The artificial intelligence element emerges in BioXcel's efforts to secure FDA approval through clinical trials where protocol violations and data integrity issues were not disclosed to investors, correlating to significant stock price drops when these issues were later revealed.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether BioXcel and its executives made materially misleading statements regarding the clinical trial enrollment and subsequent results affected by FDA Form 483 issues, thus violating Section 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court granted in part the plaintiffs' motion to file a third amended complaint as it found that the plaintiffs plausibly alleged actionable misstatements regarding trial enrollment and false information has been disseminated to the market, leading to investor losses. However, loss causation was only established for disclosures made on June 29, 2023, not August 14, 2023.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Think of a company promising its investors that their new product is a hit and making good progress through testing phases. However, behind the scenes, there's a mess-up in the testing process which they didn't tell investors. When eventually these problems came to light, it lowered the value of their product, leading to a drop in the company's stock price, hurting investors' wallets. The court found the company was not honest enough about the testing problems, so investors can proceed with some complaints about losing money when this secret was revealed.",

Nagala, United States District Judge.  \n In this securities fraud putative  class action, Plaintiff s Tonya Hills (“Hills”) and Oklahoma \nLaw Enforcement Retirement System  (“OLERS”) , on behalf  of themselves and all others similarly \nsituated,  assert claims against Defendants BioXcel Therapeutics, Inc. (“BioXcel ” or the \n“Company” ), Vima l Mehta (BioXcel’s  Chief Executive Officer), Richard Steinhart (BioXcel’s \nChief Financial Officer), and Robert Risinger (BioXcel’s Chief Medical Officer) (together the \n“Individual Defendants,” and, with BioXcel, “Defendants”) .  Plaintiffs  allege that between March \n9, 2023, and August 11, 202 3, Defendants made materially misleading disclosures which caused \nthe artificial inflation of BioXcel’s stock value , in violation of Section 10(b) of the Securities \nExchange Act, 15 U.S.C. § 78j(b),  and Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. § 78t(a) , and \nthat they suffered losses when those disclosures were corrected and the stock’s value fell \nsignificantly .   Case 3:23-cv-00915-SVN     Document 163     Filed 09/29/25     Page 1 of 392  Pending before the Court are Defendants’ motion to dismiss Plaintiffs’ second amended \ncomplaint and Plaintiffs’ motion for leave to file a third amended complaint that maintains the \nallegations of the second amended complaint and adds additional factual al legations.   As discussed \nat the oral argument on the motions, the Court has applied Defendants’ arguments for dismissal of \nthe second amended complaint to Plaintiffs’ third amended complaint , in addition to considering \nDefendants’ arguments regarding futility asserted in the briefing associated with the motion for \nleave to amend .  It concludes that Plaintiffs have plausibly pleaded their claims for securities fraud \nin the third amended complaint , with respect to certain statements made by Defendants .  \nAccordingly, for the reasons that follow, Defendants’ motion to dismiss the second amended \ncomplaint is DENIED AS MOOT  and Plaintiffs’ motion for leave to file the third amended \ncomplaint is GRANTED IN PART . \nI. PROCEDURAL HISTORY  \nPlaintiffs initiated this putative class action  on July 7, 2023 .  Complaint, ECF No. 1.   \nFollowing th e Court’s appointment of Plaintiffs Hills and OLERS as co-Lead Plaintiffs and of lead \nclass counsel, see Order, ECF No . 79, Plaintiffs filed an  amended complaint on December 5, 2023, \nsee Am. Comp l., ECF No. 90, which Defendants sought to dismiss, see Mot. to Dismiss, ECF No. \n106.  Th e Court granted Defendants’ motion to dismiss the amended complaint , finding that \nalthough Plaintiffs had pleaded sufficient facts to support the determination that two of \nDefendants’ statements were misleading, Plaintiffs failed  to sufficiently allege scienter .  Hills v. \nBioXcel Therapeutics, Inc. , No. 3:23 -CV-915 (SVN), 2024 WL 3374145 (D. Conn. July 11, 2024) .   \nPlaintiffs then filed a second amended complaint, see Second Am. Compl., ECF No. 130, \nwhich Defendants again sought to dismiss , see Second Mot. to Dismiss, ECF No. 134.  While that \nmotion to dismiss was pending, Plaintiffs filed a motion for leave to file a third amended complaint, Case 3:23-cv-00915-SVN     Document 163     Filed 09/29/25     Page 2 of 393 see Pls.’ Mot. to Amend/Correct , ECF No. 141, which Defendants opposed  on grounds of futility  \nonly, see Defs.’ Opp ’n, ECF No. 14 3. \nII. FACTUAL BACKGROUND  \nPlaintiffs’ proposed third  amended complaint, ECF No. 1 42-1, alleges the following facts, \nwhich are taken as true for purposes of a motion to dismiss , Ashcroft v. Iqbal , 556 U.S. 662, 678 \n(2009) , and by extension, for the purposes of the futility standard used to assess a motion for leave \nto amend, Lucente v. Int ’l Bus. Machines Corp. , 310 F.3d 243, 258 (2d Cir. 2002 ) (“An amendment \nto a pleading is futile if the proposed claim could not withstand a motion to dismiss pursuant \nto Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) .”).  \nBioXcel is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical  and biotechnology  company that focuses on \nfinding new therapeutic uses for pre -existing drugs through, among other methods, artificial \nintelligence .  ECF No. 142 -1 ¶¶ 1, 87–89.  BioXcel’s  repertoire includes four chemical compounds, \nbut its most advanced research and development plans relate to BXCL501, a chemical compound \nthat can be used to treat agitation in various patient populations  and that is approved to treat \nagitation in patients with schizophrenia and  bipolar disorders .  Id. ¶¶ 90–92.  During the Class \nPeriod, BioXcel’s  leadership team included Defendants Vimal Mehta as Chief Executive Officer \n(“CEO”), Richard Steinhart as Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, and Robert \nRisinger as Chief Medical Officer of Neuroscience.  Id. ¶¶ 15 –17.     \nA. TRANQUILITY II Clinical Trial  \nIn December of 2021, BioXcel announced that it was embarking on a “pivotal  Phase III \ntrial,” TRANQUILITY II  and TRANQUILITY III,  as part of i ts effort  to secure FDA approval for \nBXCL501 to be used to treat agitation in patients with Alzheimer’s disease.  Id. ¶¶ 2, 95, 97, 109 –\n12.  The TRANQUILITY  II clinical trial was designed in consultation with the FDA  and required \n150 participa nts to ensure the conclusions from the trial would permit researchers to understand Case 3:23-cv-00915-SVN     Document 163     Filed 09/29/25     Page 3 of 394 “the differences between the test groups and the control groups.”  Id. ¶ 99.   The trial also included \nseven specific participant inclusion criteria, which were to be measured, documented, and analyzed \nbefore the start of the study , and ten participant exclusion criteria, which were to be asse ssed before \nenrollment.  Id. ¶¶ 100–04.   \nTo fund  these research efforts, BioXcel entered into financing agreement s with Oaktree \nCapital Management, L.P. (“Oaktree”) and Qatar Investment Authority (“QIA”)  in April of 2022 , \nwhich the Company announced in a press release .  Id. ¶¶ 122–23.  As part of the announcement, \nBioXcel  explained that that these funding agreements would extend its “cash runway” into 2025.  \nId.  But under  the terms of the agreements, the funding would become available to BioXcel only \n“upon satisfaction of certain conditions,” including  meeting  certain regulatory, financial, and \npatent -related milestones.  Id. ¶¶ 125–28.  Among the relevant regulatory milestones was receiving \napproval “ from the FDA of an [New Drug Application]  in respect of the use of BXCL 501 for the \nacute treatment of agitation associated  with Alzheimer’s Disease.”  Id. ¶ 127.  Due to the \nCompany’s financial instability , its need to meet regulatory approval benchmarks in order to pay \nback Oaktree and QIA and access additional financing, and its ongoing cash flow issues, the \nTRANQUILITY trials were essential to BioXcel’s overall success.  Id. ¶¶ 2, 120–21, 127 –28, 131, \n133, 135 –39, 141.  \nBioXcel  engaged Segal Trials, a “second -rate clinical trial company,” to conduct the \nTRANQUILITY II and III trials because it believed Segal Trials would ”enable it to speed up the \nTRANQUILITY II and III trials”  and thus allow BioXcel to meet its funding benchmarks.  Id. ¶ \n139.  The principal investigator at the Segal Trials site that enrolled forty  percent  of the \nTRANQUILITY II trial participants was Dr. Caitlin Meyer, an inexperienced  researcher who had  \nnever overseen a clinical trial.  Id. ¶¶ 3, 113, 117, 140.  Because of her “incompetence and Case 3:23-cv-00915-SVN     Document 163     Filed 09/29/25     Page 4 of 395 inexperience,” Dr. Meyer improperly failed to follow protocol when enrolling patients , including \nby making “no effort to evaluate the results” of the enrollment test s for at least twenty -five patients \nto ensure they were eligible  to participate in the study , assuming such tests were ever even \nperformed .  Id. ¶ 119.  Several confidential witnesses, including Confidential Witness (“CW”) 8 \nand CW 9 , both Segal Trials employees working on the TRANQUILITY II trial in 2022 , aver that \nDr. Meyer pressured them to enroll patients in TRANQUILITY II, regardless of whether the \neligibility criteria were met , and engaged in actions to enroll unqualified participants, such as by \nintent ionally inducing agitation episodes .  Id. ¶¶ 50–75, 147–51.  As the study sponsor, BioXcel \nwas responsible for  monitoring Segal Trials and Dr. Meyer.  Id. ¶¶ 162 –67.  Indeed, CW 10, a \nSegal Trials employee who “worked closely ” with Defendant Mehta, stated that Mehta  had known \n“‘pretty much everything’  about the problems with TRANQUILITY II.”  Id. ¶ 78.   \nB. FDA Site Inspection & Form 483  \nBetween December 5, 2022, and December 21, 2022, the FDA conducted a site inspection \nof Dr. Meyer’s  TRANQUILITY II clinical trial  site.  Id. ¶¶ 169, 173 .  Site inspections allow the \nFDA to verify the accuracy, reliability, and integrity of clinical trial data submitted to the FDA \nand to evaluate compliance with FDA regulations , among other purposes .  Id. ¶¶ 155–56, 170 .  In \n“rare instances” after an investigation, the FDA  will issue a Form 483  if an inspector has observed \nconditions that may constitute viol ations of statutes or regulations .  Id. ¶ 157.  When a Form 483 \nis issued, both the site sponsor and the principal investigator are notified and must collaborate to \nresolve any identified  issues.  Id. ¶¶ 158, 167. \nOn December 21, 2022, the FDA issued a Form 483 to Dr. Meyer, which outlined flaws in \nthe trial.  Id. ¶¶ 174–88; see also Form 483, Pls.’ Ex. A, ECF No. 1 42-2.  The Form 483 listed \nthree “observations” by the FDA:  (1) 4 of 37  subjects had not provided consent using consent \nforms approved by the Institutional Review Board; (2)  Dr. Meyer had failed to prepare or maintain Case 3:23-cv-00915-SVN     Document 163     Filed 09/29/25     Page 5 of 396 adequate case histories for 25 of 37 subjects reviewed, such that there was not sufficient \ndocumentation to show that those subjects met all  inclusion  criteria for the study; and (3) Dr. \nMeyer had not followed dosing protocol for 4 of the subjects and failed to report one Serious \nAdverse Event (“SAE”) within a 24 -hour time period, as required by the trial protocol.1  ECF No. \n142-2; see also  ECF No. 142-1 ¶¶ 174–88.  The Form 483 notes  that it “do[es] not represent a final \nAgency determination regarding . . . compliance.”  ECF No. 1 42-2 at 2.  It also  provides that, if \nthe receiving entity objects  to the observation or plans to implement a corrective action in response \nto the observation, it can discuss those measures with the FDA.  Id.   \nDr. Meyer responded to each of the FDA’s Form 483 observations on January 13, 202 3.  \nECF No. 142-1 ¶¶ 192 –208; see also Meyer Response, Pls.’ Ex. B, ECF No. 1 42-3 at 5–14.  In a \ncover letter accompanying the response, Dr. Meyer acknowledged that she was “an early career \nresearcher conducting [her] first study as Principal Investigator,” described the FDA review as a \n“learning experience,” and acknowledged that the observ ation provided her “with an opportunity \nto better understand [her] role as a Clinical Investigator.”  ECF No. 142-1 ¶ 193; ECF No. 1 42-3 \nat 5.  Each response  reflected explanations for the alleged violations and reassurances that her \nactions  did not undermine the accuracy of the study data and , when possible,  had been corrected.  \nECF No. 142-1 ¶¶ 196–207; ECF No. 1 42-3 at 6–14.  Nonetheless, Plaintiffs contend that the \n“violation[s]” identified in the Form 483 observations “undermined the integrity of the entire \nTRANQUILITY II study. ”  ECF No. 142-1 ¶ 208.  They assert this determination is supported by \nthe fact that  the FDA did not issue an E stablishment Inspection Report (“EIR”), which Plaintiffs \n \n1 Additionally, i n May of 2023, BioXcel  learned that Dr. Meyer “[m]ay have fabricated email correspondence around \nthe time of the FDA inspection,  purporting to demonstrate that [she]  timely submitted to our pharmacovigilance safety  \nvendor a report of an SAE from a different subject than the one cited in the FDA Form -483, and purporting to show \nthat the vendor had confirmed receipt.”   ECF No. 142-1 ¶ 189 (emphasis in original) .  Plaintiffs allege that this possible \ndishonesty “calls into question the integrity of any results generated by Dr. Meyer’s trial site and any document or \ndata she touched.”  Id. ¶ 191.  Case 3:23-cv-00915-SVN     Document 163     Filed 09/29/25     Page 6 of 397 allege is a “full report from the FDA inspector given to the site facility ‘once the agency concludes \nthat the inspection is closed,’”  until August 1, 2024.2  Id. ¶ 195.  BioX cel knew about Dr. Meyer’s \nresponse when it was submitted to the FDA.  Id. ¶ 270.       \nC. BioXcel’s Corrective Disclosure s regarding the  Form 483  \nBioXcel first publicly disclosed the existence of the Form 483 on June 29, 2023, in a Form \n8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).  Id. ¶¶ 235–36.  With respect to \nthe Form 483, the Form 8 -K disclosed that the FDA had performed an inspection and issued a \nForm 483 with observations “related to the principal investigator’s failure to adhere to the \ninformed consent form . . ., maintain adequate case h istories for certain patients . . ., and adhere to \nthe investigational plan in certain i nstances.”  Id. ¶ 236.  It further disclosed that the principal \ninvestigator  timely  responded to the FDA observations , and that the FDA investigation remained \nopen.  Id.  On an analyst call  the same day , Defendant Risinger acknowledged BioXcel had known \nabout  the Form 483 since December of 2022 , and that it s issuance  led to an increase in monitoring \nat the relevant site.   Id. ¶ 238. \nThe June 2023 Form 8 -K also disclosed that in May of 2023, the Company learned that \nthat Dr. Meyer may have fabricated correspondence to the FDA to appear compliant with SAE \nprotocol (on a separate occasion than the SAE violation detailed in the Form 483).  Id. ¶¶ 191, 236.  \n \n2 Plaintiffs contend that the FDA must issue an EIR within forty -five days of an entity’s response to a Form 483.  See \nECF No. 1 42-1 ¶ 195.  Thus,  according to Plaintiffs,  the late issuance of an EIR suggests that Dr. Meyer’s response \nto a Form 483 was not satisfactory.  Id.  But Plaintiffs’ understanding is contradicted by the applicable FDA regulations \nthemselves.  FMD -145 - Release of the Establishment Inspection Report, Document Number DIR -000067 provides \nthat an EIR must be “transmitted within 45 calendar days of the determination that the inspection is closed per 21 \nC.F.R. § 20.64(d)(3).”   Per 21 C.F.R. § 20.64 (d)(3), “closed ” in this context means, “w hen a final decision has been \nmade not to take such action or such action has been taken and the matter has been concluded. ”  As Plaintiffs cite no \nsource to support their assertion that because the FDA did not issue an EIR within 45 days of Dr. Meyer’s  response \nto the  Form 483, BioXcel would have known that her response was insufficient —and as the text of the regulations \nthemselves do not support that conclusion —the Court is not required to accept the allegations related to an EIR (or \nlack thereof) as true.  See In re Livent, Inc. Noteholders Sec. Litig , 151 F. Supp. 2d 371, 405 –06 (S.D.N.Y. 2001) (“ a \ncourt need not feel constrained to accept as truth conflicting pleadings that make no sense, or that would render a \nclaim incoherent, or that are contradicted either by statements in the complaint itself or by documents upon which its \npleadings rely, or by facts of  which the court may take judicial notice. ”) (collecting cases).  Case 3:23-cv-00915-SVN     Document 163     Filed 09/29/25     Page 7 of 398 BioXcel initiated an investigation  into this reported anomaly , and, as of June 29, 2023, had \n“recently received confirmation” that Dr. Meyer had fabricated the email, which was  provided to \nthe FDA during the December 2022 inspection.  Id. ¶ 236.  The Company stated that it was \ninvestigating “protocol adherence and data integrity ” at Dr. Meyer’s site,  and would retain a third \nparty to audit data from that site.  Id.  Further, it stated it  had notified the FDA of all findings and \nintended  to take  corrective measures to “validate the integrity of the data generated by this \ninvestigator for the TRANQUILITY II trial.”  Id.   \nBioXcel also disclosed a new risk factor in the same Form 8 -K indicating that the issues \nwith the TRANQUILITY II clinical trial could impact FDA approval of BXCL501 for the \ntreatment of acute agitation in Alzheimer’s patients, that the issues could prevent the FDA from \nconsidering the data from the clinical trial, th at BioXcel may need to conduct a new trial, and that \nall of this could have “a material adverse effect on the Company , its financial condition, results of \noperations and prospects.”  Id. ¶ 237.  Analyst reports noted that these disclosures “overshadowed” \nthe positive study data released that same day.  Id. ¶ 240–45 (describing reactions of different \nanalysts).  The price of BioXcel stock immediately fell, from $17.67 to $6.39 per share , a 63.8  \npercent  drop, on unusually heavy trading volume .  Id. ¶ 239. \nOn August 14, 2023, BioXcel made several additional announcements.  First, it announced  \nin a press release  that, based on “recent events, ” it would likely be unable to meet the “milestones \nrequired to access the additional capital under the financing agreements” with Oaktree and QIA , \nand that it would be engaging in a “strategic reprioritization, which includes a reduction in force \nof more than 50%.”   Id. ¶¶ 247, 250.  It further stated in a Form 10 -Q filed with the SEC  that there \nwas “substantial doubt” about its ability to “continue  as a going concern for a period of at least 12 \nmonths.”   Id. ¶ 253.  In an earnings call, Mehta announced  that BioX cel had requested a meeting Case 3:23-cv-00915-SVN     Document 163     Filed 09/29/25     Page 8 of 399 with the FDA to discuss its entire TRANQUILITY program .  Id. ¶ 251.  BioXcel also disclosed a \nnew risk factor in its August 14 , 2023,  Form 10 -Q, which noted that TRANQUILITY II \ndevelopments  “may impact the timing of [the Company’s]  development plans for, and prospects \nfor seeking or obtaining regulatory approval of, BXCL 501 ” to treat agitation in Alzheimer’s \npatients .  Id. ¶¶ 248, 307.  Again, the stock price declined  from $7.40 per share to $4.33 per share , \na 41 percent  drop.  Id. ¶ 258.   \nPlaintiffs’  putative  class consists of all investors who purchased the allegedly artificially \ninflated common stock of BioXcel between March 9, 2023, and August 11, 2023.  Id. ¶ 349.     \nD. False or Misleading Statements  \nBetween the start of the class period and the allegedly corrective disclosures on June 29 \nand August 14, 2023, Defendants also made other disclosures about TRANQUILITY II and \nBioXcel’s financial health , in addition to those discussed above .  Id. ¶ 259.  Plaintiffs allege that \nsix of these statements, made during presentations, earnings calls, and in SEC filings  were false \nand/or materially misleading, largely because they made statements about the TRANQUILITY II \nstudy but failed to disclose “the integrity issues identified by the FDA .”  See id.  ¶¶ 259–79.  The \nspecific  statements are discussed further below.   \nPlaintiffs further allege that Defendants acted with scienter in making these statements \nbecause they knew, or recklessly disregarded, that these statements were false or misleading.  See \nid. ¶¶ 282–319.  Additionally, Plaintiffs allege the Individual Defendants had motive and \nopportunity to mislead investors, which provides additional grounds for finding that Defendants \nacted with the necessary scienter.  See id. ¶¶ 320 –48.  These allegations are discussed in more \ndetail below.    Case 3:23-cv-00915-SVN     Document 163     Filed 09/29/25     Page 9 of 3910 III. LEGAL STANDARD  \nAt oral argument, t he parties agreed that the Court should consider both Plaintiffs’ motion \nfor leave to file a third amended complaint and Defendants’ motion to dismiss  the second amended \ncomplaint  jointly.  The same legal standard governs the futility analysis under Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a) \nand dismissal under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6).   \nA. Rule 15(a) Leave to Amend  & Rule 12(b)(6) Dismissal for Failure to State a Claim  \nUnder Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(a), leave to amend shall be “freely give[n]… \nwhen justice so requires.”  Courts in the Second Circuit have interpreted this provision as requiring \na grant of leave to amend unless, as is relevant here, such amendmen t would be futile.  See, e.g. , \nLucente , 310 F.3d at 258.  An amendment to a complaint is considered futile if the amendment \nfails to state a claim or would be subject to a successful motion to dismiss on some other basis.  \nSee, e.g. , id.; Faryniarz v. Rami rez, 62 F. Supp. 3d 240, 249 (D. Conn. 2014).   “The party opposing \na motion to amend bears the burden of establishing that amendment would be futile.”   Brach Fam. \nFound., Inc. v. AXA Equitable Life Ins. Co. , No. 16 -CV-740 (JMF), 2018 WL 1274238, at *1 \n(S.D.N.Y. Mar. 9, 2018).  \nPursuant to  Federal  Rule  of Civil  Procedure  12(b)(6) , a defendant may move to dismiss a \ncase or cause of action for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.  When \ndetermining whether a complaint states a claim upon which relief can be granted, highly detailed \nallegations are not required, but the complaint must “contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as \ntrue, to ‘state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.’”   Iqbal , 556 U.S. at 678 (quoting  Bell \nAtl. Corp.  v. Twombly , 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007) ).  “A claim has facial plausibility when the \nplaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the \ndefendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.”   Id. at 678.  This plausibility standard is not a \n“probability requirement,” but imposes a standard higher than  “a sheer possibility that a defendant Case 3:23-cv-00915-SVN     Document 163     Filed 09/29/25     Page 10 of 3911 has acted unlawfully.”   Id.  In undertaking this analysis, the Court must “draw all reasonable \ninferences in [the plaintiff’s] favor, assume all well -pleaded factual allegations to be true, and \ndetermine whether they plausibly give rise to an entitlement to relief.”  Faber  v. Metro.  Life Ins. \nCo., 648 F.3d 98, 104 (2d Cir. 2011)  (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  \nThe Court is not “bound to accept conclusory allegations or legal conclusions \nmasquerading as factual conclusions,”  Rolon  v. Henneman , 517 F.3d 140, 149 (2d Cir. 2008)  \n(internal quotation marks and citation omitted) , and “a formulaic recitation of the elements of a \ncause of action will not do,”  Iqbal , 556 U.S. at 678 (quoting  Twombly , 550 U.S. at 555).  \nConsequently, “[t]hreadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of action, supported by mere \nconclusory statements, do not suffice.”  Id. (citing  Twombly , 550 U.S. at 555).  Ultimately, \n“[d]etermining whether a complaint states a plausible claim for relief will . . . be a context -specific \ntask that requires the reviewing court to draw on its judicial experience and common sense.”   Id. at \n679.   \nB. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 ( “PSLRA ”) and Rule 9(b)  \nTo state a claim for securities fraud, a plaintiff must “satisfy the heightened pleading \nrequirements of the PSLRA and Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(b).”  Emps .’ Ret. Sys. of Gov’t of the Virgin \nIslands v. Blanford , 794 F.3d 297, 304 (2d Cir. 2015) (citation omitted).  Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 9(b) provides that “[i]n alleging fraud or mistake, a party must state with particularity \nthe circumstances constituting fraud or mistake.”  In the context of securitie s fraud, this means a \nplaintiff must “(1) specify the statements that the plaintiff contends were fraudulent, (2) identify \nthe speaker, (3) state where and when the statements were made, and (4) explain why the \nstatements were fraudulent.”  Anschutz Corp. v. Merrill Lynch & Co. , 690 F.3d 98, 108 (2d Cir. \n2012) (quoting Rombach v. Chang , 355 F.3d 164, 170 (2d Cir. 2004)).   Case 3:23-cv-00915-SVN     Document 163     Filed 09/29/25     Page 11 of 3912 IV. DISCUSSION  \nIn their proposed third amended complaint,  as with their prior complaints , Plaintiffs have \nadvanced two causes of action: a Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act claim brought \nagainst all Defendants (Count I) and a Section 20(a)  of the Exchange Act  claim brought against \nthe Individual Defendants only (Count II).  See ECF No. 142 -1 ¶¶ 363 –78.  Section 10(b), codified \nat 15 U.S.C. § 78j (b), provides that it is unlawful for any person, directly or indirectly, by the use \nof interstate commerce or mail, to “use or employ . . . any manipulative or deceptive device or \ncontrivance”  in violation of SEC rules.  Section 20(a), codified at 15 U.S.C. § 78t (a), provides that \nevery person who controls a company that or another person who violates SEC rules shall be jointly \nand severally liable with the company or other person.   As Plaintiffs’ Section 20(a) claim rises and \nfalls with their Section 10(b) claim,  see ATSI Commc’ns, Inc. v. Shaar Fund, Ltd. , 493 F.3d 87, \n108 (2d Cir. 2007) , the Court focuses first on the latter claim.     \nA. Count One: Section 10(b) Claim  \nTo state a claim for securities fraud under Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of \n1934, 15 U.S.C. § 78j(b), a plaintiff must plead “(1) a misstatement or omission of material fact; \n(2) scienter; (3) a connection with the purchase or sale of secur ities; (4) reliance; (5) economic \nloss; and (6) loss causation.”  Plumber & Steamfitters Loc. 773 Pension Fund v. Danske Bank A/S , \n11 F.4th 90, 98 (2d Cir. 2021) (citation omitted).  Defendants contend  Plaintiffs have not \nadequately pleaded the first, seco nd, and sixth elements of their Section 10(b) claim —\nmisstatements, scienter, and loss causation.   See generally Defs.’ Br., ECF No. 134 -1, at 14 –48.   \n1. Actionable  Misstatements or Omissions  \nSEC Rule 10b -5, which implements Section 10(b), makes it unlawful to, among other \nthings “make any untrue statement of a material fact or to omit to state a material fact necessary \nin order to make the statements made, in the light of the circumstances under which they were Case 3:23-cv-00915-SVN     Document 163     Filed 09/29/25     Page 12 of 3913 made, not misleading.”  17 C.F.R. § 240.10b -5(b).  For an omitted fact to rise to the requisite level \nof materiality, there must be a “substantial likelihood that the disclosure of the omitted fact would \nhave been viewed by the reasonable investor as havin g significantly altered the ‘total mix’ of \ninformation made available.”  Matrixx Initiatives, Inc. v. Siracusano , 563 U.S. 27, 38 (2011) \n(citations omitted) ; see also Rombach , 355 F.3d at 172 n.7 ( noting that in considering  whether an \nomission is material,  the Cour t assesses whether “defendants’ representations, taken together and \nin context, would have misled a reasonable investor.”  (citation omitted) ).  “Once a company speaks \non an issue or topic, there is a duty to tell the whole truth .”  See Meyer v. Jinkosolar Holdings Co., \nLtd., 761 F.3d 245, 250 (2d Cir. 2014) .  “That is, when a company does speak, it assumes ‘a duty \nto be both accurate and complete, ’ Caiola v. Citibank, N.A., N.Y. , 295 F.3d 312, 331 (2d Cir. 2002), \nand adequate disclosure is required to make other statements, ‘in light of the cir cumstances under \nwhich they were made, not misleading, ’ Meyer , 761 F.3d at 250. ”  Gimpel v. Hain Celestial Grp., \nInc., No. 23 -7612 , slip op. at 32  (2d Cir. Sept. 29, 2025) .  Whether  a statement is misleading is \nevaluated not only by its “literal truth, ” but by its “context and manner of presentation.”  Singh v. \nCigna Corp. , 918 F.3d 57, 63 (2d Cir. 2019) (citation omitted).  Ultimately, then, the “test for \nwhether a statement is materially misleading  under Section 10(b)  is not whether the statement is \nmisleading in and of itself, but whether the defendants’ representations, taken together and in \ncontext , would have misled a reasonable investor.”  In re Vivendi, S.A. Sec. Litig. , 838 F.3d 223, \n250 (2d Cir. 2016) (internal quotation marks and citation omitt ed) (emphasis in original).   \nAs Plaintiffs contend that all  of the challenged disclosures were false because of the \nCompany’s failure to disclose the Form 483, the Court incorporates by reference its discussion in \nits ruling on Defendants’ prior motion to dismiss  that there is no standalone duty to  disclose Form \n483 letters .  See Hills , 2024 WL 3374145, at *8 .  By way of summary, there are generally two Case 3:23-cv-00915-SVN     Document 163     Filed 09/29/25     Page 13 of 3914 types of cases in which omission of a Form 483 renders a statement misleading:  cases in which \nthe Form 483 “clearly contradicts the statement being made,” and cases in which there is \n“additional factual matter to corroborate the allegedly serious nature o f the omitted Form 483,” \nsuch that a “strong inference” can be drawn of the misleading nature of the statement.  Id. (citing \nScha effer v. Nabriva Therapeutics plc , No. 19 Civ. 4183 (VM), 2020 WL 7701463, at * 12 \n(S.D.N.Y. Apr. 28, 2020) ).  The Court analyzes each of Defendants’ allegedly false or misleading \nstatements  against this standard . \na. Paragraphs 260 through  263: March 9, 2023,  and March 16, 2023,  Patient \nEnrollment Statements  \nPlaintiffs first challenge two statements relating to enrollment of the TRANQUILITY II \ntrial:  (1) Defendant Mehta’s statement on a March 9, 2023, earnings call, in which he stated that, \n“The TRANQUILITY II trial is fully enrolled” ; and (2) a statement included in BioXcel’s March \n16, 2023, Form 10 -K signed by Defendants Mehta and Steinhart, which stated that “ [p]atient \nenrollment is complete for TRANQUILITY II .”  ECF No. 142 -1 ¶¶ 260–63.  They contend that \nthe representation s that TRANQUILITY II was “fully enrolled”  or and that its patient enrollment \nwas “complete”  are false because Defendant s were on notice that  numerous  particip ants at Dr. \nMeyer’s site may have been improperly enrolled in light of  the unresolved Form 483 observations  \nand the CWs’ representations about improper enrollment.   Id. ¶¶ 261, 263 .  The Court previously \nheld that Mehta’s statement that the trial was “fully enrolled” was not actionable.  See Hills , 2024 \nWL 3374145, at *14.3   \nThe Court now agrees with Plaintiffs  that these  enrollment -related statement s are \nactionable , based on the new allegations in the proposed third amended complaint .  Previously, \n \n3 Plaintiffs did not previously advance a theory that the March 16, 2023, Form 10 -K statement that patient enrollment \nwas complete was misleading.     Case 3:23-cv-00915-SVN     Document 163     Filed 09/29/25     Page 14 of 3915 the Court held that Plaintiffs had not alleged that the trial was not fully enrolled , see id. ; now, \nPlaintiffs do.  ECF No. 142 -1 ¶ 261 (noting that because thirty -two patients should have been \nexcluded, “the TRANQUILITY II trial had enrolled only 118 out of 150 patients and was therefore \nnot ‘fully enrolled’”) ; ¶ 263 ( noting that because thirty -two patients should have been excluded, \n“at best, the TRANQUILITY II trial had enrolled only 118 out of 150 patients and therefore \n‘enrollment ’ was not ‘complete. ’”).4  This allegation is supported by the facts that f orty percent of \nstudy participants were enrolled at Dr. Meyer’s  site, see id. ¶¶ 140, 236, 240, meaning 60 of 150 \nTRANQUILITY II participants were under Dr. Meyer’s  oversight , and that, b ased on the Form \n483, more than half of the individuals at Dr. Meyer’s  site and more than 20 percent of the total \nenrollment of the study could possibly have been impacted by the FDA ’s observations, including \nby ultimately requiring their exclusion from the study.   Specifically , four patients were included \nin the study who had not signed the consent form approved by the Institutional Review Board; four \npatients did not receive a  urinalysis within the appropriate time frame prior to dosing of the study \ndrug,  which was required to screen for su bstance abuse or other conditions that would impact \nstudy results; and twenty -five patients lack ed proper documentation concerning whether they were \nproperly evaluated for  and actually satisfied the  inclusion and exclusion criteria.  Id. ¶¶ 175–88.  \nImportantly, Dr. Meyer’s January 2023 response did not dispute that these deficiencies occurred; \ninstead, it attempted to explain why the participants were still eligible to participate  and the \nintegrity of the study was intact .  ECF No. 142 -3 at 5 –14.  \n \n4 While paragraphs 261 and 263 reference 32 patients who allegedly should have been excluded from the study, the \nForm 483 referenced 4 patients who did not sign the proper consent form ; 25 patients for whom there was insufficient \ndocumentation to show they met all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria ; and 4 patients as to \nwhom the required urinalysis was not timely conducted, resulting in the possible exclusion of 33 patients, not 32 \npatients.  See ECF No. 142 -1 ¶¶ 175 –85.  It is possible that one patient was included in more than one of the Form \n483’s observations, or that Plaintiffs simply did the math wrong.  Either way, whether 32 or 33 patients would have \nbeen required to be excluded is not consequential, as either is  a significant number of trial participants, given that the \nentire trial consisted of only 150 patients.  Id. ¶ 99.   Case 3:23-cv-00915-SVN     Document 163     Filed 09/29/25     Page 15 of 3916 Although the Form 483 observations do not explicitly contradict the proposition that the \ntrial was fully enrolled, the statements that “enrollment was complete ” and the trial was “fully \nenrolled ” are misleading when considering the context of the Form 483 observations and their \npotential implications for TRANQUILITY II enrollment.  See In re Vivendi, S.A. Sec. Litig. , 838 \nF.3d at 250.  BioXcel knew about the FDA’s audit (and, by extension, the Form 483), in December \nof 2022.  ECF No. 142 -1 ¶ 238.  Thus, b y March of 2023, Defendant Mehta , and, by extension,  \nBioXcel , knew  that there were possible issues with the enrollment at Dr. Meyer’s site as identified \nby the Form 483 , and that these issues could  potentially result  in exclusion of a significant number \nof patients from the study .  Although Dr. Meyer had responded to the Form 483  in January of \n2023 , and tried to explain why the FDA’s observations did not undermine the integrity of her site’s \ndata,  it was unknown as of March of 2023 how the FDA would react to her response.5  Thus, \nDefendants’  statement s indicating that “enrollment is complete” or that the trial was “fully \nenrolled” fail to account for the real possibility that several enrolled participant s may have need ed \nto be excluded , such that enrollment would not actually be complete.  An average stockholder \ncould reasonably interpret these statements as indicating that Mehta  and BioXcel had no reason to \nanticipate that the study on which BioXcel’s financial viability turned was experiencing any \nenrollment issues  whatsoever .  Given the possibility that  several study participants could \nultimately be excluded, Mehta’s and BioXcel’s failure to disclose the Form 483 , in conjunction \nwith their statement s regarding the completion of enrollment , renders those statements materially \nmisleading.    \nMoreover, Plaintiffs now include allegations from two CWs —CWs 8 and 9 —who worked \nwith Dr. Meyer at Segal Trial s to enroll patients in TRANQUILITY II, stating that Dr. Meyer had \n \n5 That the FDA issued the EIR in August of 2024 does not negate the Court’s conclusion.  At the time of Defendants’ \nMarch 2023 statements, Defendants could not have known what the outcome of the investigation would be.

Id. ¶¶ 51 –66, 74 –75.  See Blanford , 794 F.3d at 305 (noting that CW allegations are \ntaken at true at the pleading stage so long as the CWs “are described in the complaint with \nsufficient particularity to support the probability that a person in the position occupied by the \nsource would possess the information alleged”)  (citation omitted) .  Both CWs also reported \nsignificant pressure from Dr. Meyer to enroll patients, including financial incentives to do so.   Id. \n¶¶ 54 –55, 72 –73.  As CW8 also stated that BioXcel “actively monitored the enrollment data and \nresults of TRANQUILITY II”  and CW10 stated that Mehta “had known ‘pretty much everything’ \nabout the problems with TRANQUILITY II,”  it is reasonable to infer that  Defendants knew of the \npotential enrollment issues  at Dr. Meyer’s site  raised by CW8 and CW9, particularly as CW8 went \nas far as to report their concerns to the FDA .  Id. ¶¶ 56–69, 78.  These new CW allegations further \nsupport the conclusion that Defendants’ statements about full and complete enrollment were \nmisleading.  See Abramson v. Newlink Genetics Corp. , 965 F.3d 165,  178–79 (2d Cir. 2020) \n(affirming district court’s holding that confidential witness’s information about witnessing \nenrollment of ineligible individuals and pressure to enroll patients rendered statement that patient \nenrollment was complete misleading).6  The Court recognizes that the CW in Abramson was \nemployed directly by the company defendant and allegedly reported his concerns about improper \n \n6 The Court previously held that Mehta’s statement that “the data cleaning and verification process ha[d] begun,” ECF \nNo. 142 -1 ¶ 260, suggested that “there were risks the data might not be as -expected, since it needed to undergo a \ncleaning and verification process.”  Hills , 2024 WL 3374145, at *14.  In light of the proposed third amended \ncomplaint’s new allegations noting that Dr. Meyer admitted to the deficiencies identified by the Form 483 (with \naccompanying explanations) and the CWs ’ allegations concerning improper enrollment procedures, the Court cannot \nread the “data cleaning and verification process” statement in the same light it previously did.  Now, if anything, the \nstatement supports Plaintiffs’ claims, as it doubles down on th e idea that the trial was fully enrolled and progressing \ntoward the data cleaning and verification process without issue, despite that Defendants were aware of the distinct \npossibility of enrollment problems.     Case 3:23-cv-00915-SVN     Document 163     Filed 09/29/25     Page 17 of 3935 78u-4(b)(4).  “Loss causation is the causal link between the alleged misconduct and the economic \nharm ultimately suffered by the plaintiff.”  Lentell v. Merrill Lynch & Co. , 396 F.3d 161 , 172  (2d \nCir. 2005)  (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  In other words, “ loss causation has to \ndo with the relationship between the plaintiff ’s investment loss and the information misstated or \nconcealed by the defendant. ”  Id. at 174 ; see also In  re Omnicom Grp., Inc. Sec. Litig. , 597 F.3d \n501, 510 (2d Cir. 2010) (noting that private securities fraud actions are not meant to  “provide \ninvestors with broad insurance against market losses, but to protect them against those economic \nlosses that misrepresentations actually cause”).  “The loss causation requirement is intended to fix \na legal limit on a person’s responsibility, even for wrongful acts.”  Castellano v. Young & Rubicam, \nInc., 257 F.3d 171, 186 (2d Cir. 2001)  (citation omitted) .  To plead  loss causatio n based on a \ncorrective disclosure , a plaintiff must allege that the “misstatement or omission concealed \nsomething from the market that, when disclosed, negatively affected the value of the security.”  \nLentell , 396 F.3d  at 173 , 175 (“[T]o establish loss causation, ‘a plaintiff must allege . . . that the \nsubject  of the fraudulent statement or omission was the cause of the actual loss suffered.”  \n(alteration in original ) (citation omitted) ).   \nDefendants do not challenge loss causation as to the June 29, 2023, disclosure.  See ECF \nNo. 134 -1 at 46 –48, Defs.’ Reply Br., ECF No. 137 at 14 –15; see also Defs.’ Opp ’n to Mot. to \nAmend, ECF No. 143 , at 15 n.7 .  Therefore, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have adequately pleaded \nloss c ausation for the June 29, 2023, corrective statement.    \nDefendants do, however, challenge loss causation in relation to the August 14, 2023, \nalleged corrective disclosure.  As to this latter  alleged corrective disclosure, the Court finds that \nPlaintiffs have failed to establish loss causation because they did not show that any information \ndisclosed on that date provided new details related to the alleged material misrepresentations.   Case 3:23-cv-00915-SVN     Document 163     Filed 09/29/25     Page 35 of 3936 Because the content of the June 29, 2023, corrective disclosure is relevant to the Court’s \nanalysis of the August 14, 2023, statements, the Court begins by recounting the June 29, 2023, \ndisclosures.  On June 29, 2023, BioXcel issued a Form 8 -K that disclosed, for the first time, issues \nwith the TRANQUILITY II clinical trial , including the existence of the Form 483  and Dr. Meyer’s  \nfabricated email, and reported that the Company was “in the process of conducting an \ninvestigation” into the issues at Dr. Meyer’ s site including related to protocol adherence and data \nintegrity.  See ECF No. 142 -1 ¶ 236.  BioXcel  also disclosed a new risk factor indicating that the \nissues with the TRANQUILITY II clinical trial could impact FDA approval of BXCL501 for the \ntreatment of acute agitation in Alzheimer’s patients, that the issues could prevent the FDA from \nconsidering th e data from the clinical trial, that BioXcel may need to conduct a new trial, and that \nall of this could have “a material adverse effect on [BioXcel ], its financial condition, results of \noperations and prospects.”  Id. ¶ 237.  In considering these statemen ts, Plaintiffs allege that \n“analysts recognized right away that problems of this magnitude . . . could lead to significant \ndelays, or even the Company’s absolute disability, in getting FDA approval for BXCL501 for \nAlzheimer’s and dementia patients.”  Id. ¶ 241.  \nOn August 14, 2023, BioXcel issued a press release announcing a “Strategic \nReprioritization .”  Id. ¶¶ 246 –47.  The press release stated that, “[b]ased  on recent events, the \nCompany is not likely to be in a position to meet the milestones required to access additional \ncapital under the [Oaktree and QIA] financing agreements.”  Additionally, BioXcel issued a Form \n10-Q that disclosed a new risk factor noti ng that “[d]evelopments relating to our TRANQUILITY \nII Phase 3 trial may impact the timing of our development plans for, and prospects for seeking or \nobtaining regulatory approval of , BXCL 501…”  and that the Company was facing “substantial \ndoubt” about its  “ability to continue as a going concern” for a year.  Id. ¶¶ 248, 253 .   Case 3:23-cv-00915-SVN     Document 163     Filed 09/29/25     Page 36 of 3937  Plaintiffs’ theory of the case centers around BioXcel’s failure to disclose the Form 483.  \nAs the Court concluded above, Defendants’ March and May 2023 statements regarding clinical \ntrial enrollment and completeness  were misleading because they did not reflect that the Form 483 \nhad been issued or that it potentially impacted trial enrollment or completeness .  But Defendants \ndisclosed the Form 483 as part of the Company’s June 29, 2023, corrective disclosure.  In doing \nso, Defendants recognized that the iss ues with the trial  could inhibit their ability to get FDA \napproval for BXCL501  and the Company’s financial condition moving forward .  Further, i n the \nwake of the June 29, 2023, corrective disclosure, financial analysts warned that the \nTRANQUILITY II trial issues could delay or disable the full clinical trial.  See ECF No. 142 -1 ¶ \n241.  Thus, it is reasonable to infer that , following the June 29, 2023, corrective disclosure,  \nshareholders were on notice of the potential that the enrollment -related issues discussed in the \nForm 483 could inhibit or otherwise limit the availability of funding available pursuant to the \nOaktree/QIA funding agreement.  \n Against that backdrop, the August 14, 2023, “corrective disclosure” does not support a \nfinding of loss causation, because “the subject of the fraudulent statement or omission” —here the \nForm 483  and data integrity issues it presented —had already been disclosed as of the June 29, \n2023, corrective disclosure.  A finding of loss causation turns on whether Plaintiffs’ investment \nloss was caused by Defendants’ material misrepresentation or omission.  See In re Omnicom Grp., \nInc. Sec. Litig. , 597 F.3d at 510; Lentell, 396 F.3d  at 174.  But here, the omission was corrected as \npart of the June 29, 2023, disclosure announcing the Form 483 and its possible implications for \nthe clinical trial.  At that point, Plaintiffs were aware that the clinical trial data —and thus the \nlikelihood of any FDA approval —may be in jeopardy .  What Defendants  reported on August 14, \n2023, constitutes an admission that the concerns they had warned about as part of their June 2023 Case 3:23-cv-00915-SVN     Document 163     Filed 09/29/25     Page 37 of 3938 corrective disclosure had, in fact, materialized by August.  While it is regrettable that the August \ndisclosure led to further financial losses for the Company and its shareholders, it does not constitute \na corrective disclosure for loss causation  purposes  because Defendants were not correcting any \nprior misleading or omitted statements  based on its content .  See DoubleLine Cap . LP v. Odebrecht \nFin., Ltd. , 323 F. Supp. 3d 393, 459 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 8, 2018) (where initial reports “let the cat out \nof the bag” a nd “[s]ubsequent  reports merely confirmed what the market already knew,” the later \nreports were not properly considered corrective disclosures for loss causation purposes).    \n For these reasons, the Court finds that loss causation is adequately pleaded only as to the \nJune 29, 2023, corrective disclosure.  \nB. Count Two: Violation of Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act  \nDefendants’ only argument asserting that Plaintiffs’ Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act \nviolation claim should be dismissed relies on Plaintiffs’ alleged failure  to assert a claim under \nSection 10(b).  See ECF No. 134 -1 at 48; see also generally  ECF No. 143 (addressing only the \nSection  10(b) claim) .  As th e Court has determined that Plaintiffs have stated a claim under Section \n10(b), and as Defendants assert no other arguments for dismissing Plaintiffs’ Section 20(a) claim, \nPlaintiffs’ motion for leave to am end is granted with respect to their Section 20(a)  claim.   \nV. CONCLUSION  \nFor the reasons described herein, Defendants ’ motion to dismiss is DENIED  AS MOOT \nand Plaintiffs’ motion for leave to file the third amended complaint is GRANTED  IN PART .  The \nClerk shall docket ECF No. 142 -1 as the Third Amended Class Action Complaint, though the \nparties are on notice that Plaintiffs may only proceed in the action as to those statements that this \nruling finds were plausibly misleading, and as to damages only with respect to the June 29, 2023 , \ncorrective disclosure.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: This case involves a class action lawsuit against Restoration Robotics, Inc., and others, alleging violations of the Securities Act of 1933 due to false or misleading statements in their IPO offering materials. The core issues relate to misstatements about Restoration's ARTAS System, a robotic hair transplantation technology, involving its marketing, sales strategy, and system functionality. The court granted in part and denied in part the defendants' motion to dismiss, allowing some claims to proceed while dismissing others.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: The central legal issue is whether Restoration Robotics and associated defendants made materially false or misleading statements or omissions concerning their robotic hair restoration technology and sales strategies in the company's IPO offering materials, in violation of Sections 11 and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court granted the defendants' motion to dismiss in part, finding that certain statements in the offering materials were non-actionable as they constituted opinion or corporate optimism, or lacked allegations showing knowledge of falsity. However, the court did allow other aspects of the claim to proceed, offering plaintiffs the opportunity to amend their complaint to address deficiencies identified by the court.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine a company that makes a robot for hair transplants went public and sold shares to raise money, but some investors later claimed they were misled about the robot business. They argued that the company exaggerated how good their sales and robot were. The court said some of these claims were just the company being optimistic and weren't misleading, but it allowed the investors to try again with more details to see if they could better show the company misled them.",

Id. ¶¶ 21–43.3   \nI. BACKGROUND \nA. Factual Background \n Company Overview.   Restoration Robotics is a medi cal technology company that \n“develop[s] and commercializ[es] a robotic device , the ARTAS System that assists physicians in \nperforming many of the repetitive ta sks that are part of a follicul ar unit extraction surgery, a type \nof hair restoration procedure.”  Compl. ¶ 51, Dkt.  36.  The ARTAS System is an all-in-one device \ncomprised of a patient chair, a robotic arm, an integrated vision system, artificial intelligence \nalgorithms, and a series of proprieta ry end effectors, which have a needle and punch to secure hair \nfollicles from a patient’s scalp.  Id. ¶ 52.  It is designed to “robotic ally assist[] a physician through \nmany of the most challenging steps of the hair restoration process.”  Id. ¶ 54.   \n In April 2011, Restoration rece ived clearance to market and sell the ARTAS system in 61 \ncountries.  Id. ¶ 56.  To sell the system domestically, Restoration relies on a direct sales and \n                                                 \n2 For clarity, this Court refers to Defendant Restoration Robotics as “Restoration.”  Other \nDefendants are referred to by name or as part of their collective group, i.e., “Individual \nDefendants.”   \n3 Section 11 allows a cause of action against every person who: (1) signed the registration \nstatement; (2) was a director of the company; (3 ) helped prepare the statement; or (4) was an \nunderwriter.  15 U.S.C. § 77k(a)(1–5).  Defendant s do not contest that this governs them and so \nthis Court does not address any arguments that  certain defendants are improperly joined.

This team is composed of Re gional Sales Managers (“ RSMs”), Clinical Trial \nManagers (“CTMs”), and Practice Success Managers (“PSMs”).  Id. ¶ 66.  RSMs are “responsible \nfor coordinating with execu ting the direct sales of  the ARTAS Systems.”  Id. ¶ 67.  CTMs provide \n“high quality, comprehensive training and edu cation to physicians on the use of the ARTAS \nSystem and on how to build their hair restoration practices.”  Id. ¶ 68.  PSMs work alongside \nphysician clients to help “build awareness and market the ARTAS procedure and increase ARTAS \nbrand-awareness.”  Id. ¶ 69.  This system is meant to prio ritize profits by working collaboratively \nwith physician customers to increase the number of ARTAS procedures performed.  Id. ¶ 73.  \nInternationally, the Company sell s the ARTAS System to independe nt, third-party distributors \nwho then sell the systems to end-users.  Id. ¶¶ 118–19.  As an inducement to buy the system, \nRestoration promised doctors high quality patient leads.  Id. 78–80.   \n Revenue Structure.   Restoration generates revenue from the ARTAS system in three ways: \n(1) systems, (2) procedure based, and (3) service-related fees.  Id. ¶ 59.   \nFirst, “systems” is the sale of the actual AR TAS system, which is a one-time revenue at an \naverage price of $225,000 to $240,000.  Id. ¶ 61.  Domestic sale revenue  is recorded upon delivery \nto customers.  Declaration of Gavin M. Masuda  in Support of Restoration Robotics Defendants’ \nMotion to Dismiss (“Masuda Decl.”), Ex. A at 61, Dk t. 48.  International sale revenue is recorded \nupon shipment to an international distributor.  Id.  Second, “procedure based” revenue is earned \nanytime there is a procedure; phys ician-customers must “pay in advance on a per-follicle basis for \nthe follicles to be harvested, a nd on a per procedure basis for Site Making.”  Compl. ¶ 62.  Outside \nof the United States, physician-customers pay in a dvance on a per procedure basis for both follicle \nextraction and site making.  Id.  Third, Restoration generates “service-related fees” from post-\nwarranty maintenance on the ARTAS Systems purs uant to “service and su pport contracts offered \nby the Company.”  Id. ¶ 64.  Because the purchase of an ARTAS System is a one-time occurrence, \nRestoration depended mainly on “procedure-based” revenue.  Id. ¶ 59.   \nInternationally, the revenue system  functioned a bit differently.  Plaintiff alleges that, at the Case 5:18-cv-03712-EJD   Document 65   Filed 10/18/19   Page 3 of 30 \nCase No.: 5:18-cv-03712-EJD  \nORDER GRANTING IN PART AND DENYING IN PART DEFENDANTS’ MOTION TO \nDISMISS; GRANTING DEFE NDANTS’ JOINDER MOTIONS \n \n 4 1 \n2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 \n10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 United States District Court \nNorthern District of Californi a end of the quarter, Restoration increased sales to  foreign distributors to  boost quarterly sales \nnumbers.  Id. ¶¶ 118–23.  In these foreign sales, the pr oducts did not go directly to the physician-\nconsumer; instead, a distributor pu rchased the system and then allo wed it to lay dormant in their \nwarehouses.  Id.  This resulted in “warehousing,” whic h resulted in limited “procedure based” \nprofits and oversaturated foreign markets, ultim ately causing “system” revenue to decrease.  Id. \n¶¶ 145–58.  In response, Restoration announced a pi vot to a U.S.-centric model in May 2018.  Id. \n¶ 161.   \nPre-IPO.   Plaintiff uses three confidential witn esses (“CWs”) to support its allegations.  Id. \n¶ 44.  CW 1 was a PSM, employed by Restoration before the IPO.  Id. ¶ 45.  CW 2 was a PSM \nemployed after the IPO.  Id. ¶ 48.  And, CW 3 was an RSM empl oyed before and after the IPO.  \nId. ¶ 49.  According to CW 1 and 2, Restoration was unable to provi de doctors with the promised \npatient leads and marketing support.  Id. ¶¶ 80–82.  Those that Restora tion did identif y as potential \nleads often had “no idea” how they ended up on Restoration’s list.  Id. ¶ 82.  This problem was so \nwidespread, it resulted in a number of intern al complaints among the PSMs and physicians.  Id.  \nUltimately, because patien t leads were not provided, physicians  allowed their ARTAS System to \nlay dormant, resulting in a significant  drop in procedure-based revenue.  Id. ¶¶ 85, 93.   \nBeyond the lack of patient leads, doctors also reported discontent with the amount of time \nand expense required to use the ARTAS System.  Id. ¶¶ 97–99.  Allegedly, the system had \nwidespread product issues that re sulted in lower follicle yields, which further caused doctors to \nabandon the system.  Id.  Specifically, the needles used for th e procedure suffered from a material \ndefect that caused the machine to damage a patient’s already limited number of donor grafts, \nlowering harvest yields and increasing costs to physicians, leading to more abandonment of the \nsystem.  Id. ¶ 140.  According to CW 1, thirteen per cent of doctors in he r region had abandoned \nthe system.  Id. ¶ 100.   \nFinally, before the IPO, device sales stalled b ecause interested doctors were waiting for the \nnew product (the ARTAS iX).  Id. ¶¶ 112, 152.

The Offering Materi als contained disclosures \nregarding Restoration’s sales and marketing strategy, the quality and design of the ARTAS \nSystem, and ARTAS system sales and continuing revenue.  Id. ¶¶ 130–46.   \nPost-IPO.   Following the IPO, the Company’s stock traded consistently below its offering \nprice of $7.00 per share.  Id. ¶ 13.  Plaintiff identifies three si gnificant events: first, on January 5, \n2018, Restoration announced Chris Aronson was re placing long-time Vice President of Global \nSales Brent Nixon, causing the st ock price to drop 14%.  Id. ¶¶ 163–64.  Second, on May 14, \n2018, Restoration announced its first quarter earn ings for 2018, which showed a loss and caused \nthe share price to drop 14.42% (falling to $3.68 per share).  Id. ¶¶ 150–51.  Third, on November 5, \n2018, Restoration announced quarterly earnings for the third quarter of 2018 of $4.8 million, \nbased on the sale of 11 ARTAS iX Systems.

Id. ¶¶ 130–47.  For clarity, the Court has num bered Plaintiff’s alleged actionable \nstatements.  Bold and italics are copied from Pl aintiff’s Complaint and indicate the part of the \nstatement alleged to be materially false and misleading. Statements Concerning Rest oration’s Marketing Function \nStatement 1 \n \nWe strategically market the ARTAS System to ha ir restoration surgeons, dermatologists, plastic \nsurgeons and aesthetic physicians.  We believe we  are able to reach our target physician customers \neffectively through focused marketing efforts.  Thes e efforts include particip ation in trade shows, \nscientific meetings, educational symposiums, webinars and other activities.  For physicians who \npurchase the ARTAS System, we provide comp rehensive clinical training, practice-based \nmarketing support, as well as patient leads.  Fo r example, we believe we help our physician \ncustomers increase the number of procedures  performed by assigning a practice success \nmanager, or PSM, to provide assistance in buil ding the physician-customer’s hair restoration \npractice.   Support from a PSM includes the deployment  of patient marketing materials, assisting \nwith social media and digital marketing strategi es, and other marketing and sales support.   \n Compl. ¶ 131. \nStatement 2 \n \nDrive increased utilization of the ARTAS System  by working collaboratively with our physician \ncustomers to increase the number of ART AS procedures that are performed.    \n Compl. ¶ 132.   \nStatement 3 \n \nDrive Increased Utilization . In addition to revenues from sy stem sales and servicing, we also \ngenerate revenue from procedure based fees.  We will continue to work collaboratively with our physician customers to increase utilization by introducing new functionalities, technology and \ninnovations.  In addition, we believe we can increase procedure revenues by helping physicians \nbuild their practice through our ma rketing and training support.  To achieve all of these goals, \nwe intend to utilize our teams of clinical tr aining managers, or CTMs, PSMs and field service \nengineers to work with and to support our phys ician customers in developing profitable ARTAS \npractices.   \n Compl. ¶ 133. \nStatement 4 \n \nPractice Success Managers  Our PSMs are responsible for he lping our physician customers bu ild awareness and market the \nARTAS procedure and increase ARTAS brand-awar eness.  Our PSMs average over ten years of Case 5:18-cv-03712-EJD   Document 65   Filed 10/18/19   Page 6 of 30 \nCase No.: 5:18-cv-03712-EJD  \nORDER GRANTING IN PART AND DENYING IN PART DEFENDANTS’ MOTION TO \nDISMISS; GRANTING DEFE NDANTS’ JOINDER MOTIONS \n \n 7 1 \n2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 \n10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 United States District Court \nNorthern District of Californi a experience in developing hair restora tion practices and aesthetics practices.  They form strong \nrelationships with our customers and consult on how to integrate the ARTAS System into their \npractices, while raising awareness of the procedure amon g potential patients.   This process often \nbegins before the ARTAS System is installed at the customer site .  Our PSMs work closely with \nthe team that will manage the ARTAS business at the practice level to establish goals and \ndevelop detailed strategies to achieve these goa ls.  This includes extensive training and \ncoaching with respect to the patient consultati on process.  We provide easily implemented \nmarketing tools allowing practices to create in dividually tailored website content, direct mail \nadvertisements, print ads for magazines and newspapers and brochures.   In addition, PSMs \nconsult on methods to raise awareness of the ARTAS procedure through practice events, public \nrelations, television, and radio ad vertising and other channels. \n Compl. ¶ 134.   \nStatement 5 \n \nWe sell the ARTAS System, prov ide service and generate proced ure based revenue by helping \nour physician customers build their hair restoratio n practice, through a direct sales force in the \nU.S. which, as of May 31, 2017, included seven regiona l sales managers, or RSMs, seven CTMs, \nand seven PSMs.    Compl. ¶ 135. \nStatements Concerning the Quality and Design of the ARTAS System \nStatement 6 \n \nThe ARTAS System’s image-guided robotic capabilities allow physicians to perform hair \nrestoration procedures with fewer staff required  than a traditional strip surgery or a manual \nFUE procedure .  Procedures can also be performed with  less physician and technician fatigue.  \n Compl. ¶ 138. \nStatement 7 \n \nThe needle travels at approxima tely 2,500 mm to 3,000 mm per sec ond when it contacts the skin.  \nThis provides targeted precision  and a cleanly scored incision.    \n Compl. ¶ 140.  Statement 8  The punch then spins at 3,000 rpm and loosens the graf ts from the surrounding tissue.  In a clinical \nsetting, we have observed that th e dissection cycle takes between one to two seconds per graft, \ndepending on the length of the graf t.  In a clinical setting, the ARTAS System has been shown to \nmove from graft to graft at a rate of approximately one to th ree seconds, thereby enabling the \nARTAS System to dissect a graf t every two to five seconds, or approximately 720 to over 1,800 \ngrafts per hour.  The ARTAS System enables the physicians to adjust dissection parameters to \naccommodate for different types of skin, and manipulate graft selection algorithms based on \npatient needs.  The ARTAS System can be programmed to dissect as many grafts as appropriate \nthus maximizing the use of the donor area. It can also be programmed to dissect grafts with \nmore than two hairs each, thereby increasing th e hair yield or the number of hairs per graft.

While we would expect our proced ure based fees to continue to increase as our \ninstalled base of ARTAS Systems grows worldwid e, the total number of  procedures has not \nincreased proportionally with the increase in our installed base and the number of procedures \nperformed tends to vary from quarter-to-quarter .  During the twelve months ended December 31, \n2016, we sold 32 ARTAS Systems and, during the six months ended June 30, 2017, we sold 27 additional systems representing an aggregate installed base  growth of approximately 34% from \nDecember 31, 2015, or 174 to 233 systems , yet our procedure based fe e for the six months ended \nJune 30, 2017 increased by approximately 10%, or $0.3 million, from the six months ended June 30, 2016.  Compl. ¶ 144.  \nStatement 10 \n \nWe believe that revenue from procedure based  fees has not grown proportionally with the \nincrease in our installed base and varies from  quarter-to-quarter due to a number factors, \nincluding:  \n physician uptake causing a slow ramp-up to  utilizing the ARTAS System, which is \nparticularly evident with physicians who ar e new to hair restoration procedures or \nphysicians who do not operate a solely ha ir restoration focu sed practice who are \ncommonly the profile we are targeting; \n  capacity limitations with the current inst alled base of ARTAS Systems, which can \nresult in procedure based f ees not growing as quickly as system sales, as high \nperforming practitioners are limited in the num ber of procedures that can be performed \nin any given period; \n \n limited or no utilization of the ARTAS System  after purchase as a result of a change \nin physician preference or practice  \n \n the concentration of ARTAS procedures being performed on a limited number of \nARTAS Systems leading to volatility betw een periods if particular high volume \npractitioners perform a smaller number of procedures in a given period which often \nhappens during the summer period; and \n \n the number of procedures performed vary from quarter-to-quarter as the hair \nrestoration industry is char acterized by seasonally lowe r demand during the summer \nperiod when both physicians and pros pective patients take vacations. \n Compl. ¶ 146.

Procedural Background \nFollowing the continued stock decline, multiple lawsuits were filed against Defendants.  \nOne of these— Edgardo Guerrini v. Restoration et al. —was randomly assigned to this Court.  See \nComplaint for Violations of Federal Securities Laws , Dkt. 1.  This Court consolidated this case \nwith other related ones.  See Order Granting Consolidation, Dkt. 32.  On November 30, 2018, \nPlaintiff filed a Consolidated Amended Complain t, which is the subject of Restoration and \nIndividual Defendants’ current motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6).   Restoration Robotics \nDefendants’ Motion to Dismiss (“Mot.”), Dkt. 47.  Defendants also request judicial notice \nregarding facts pertaining to  their motion to dismiss.  See Request for Judicial Notice re Motion to \nDismiss (“Req. Jud. Not.”), Dkt. 49.  Finally, both the Underwriter and Venture Capital \nDefendants seek to join this motion to dismiss.  See Motion for Joinder of Underwriter \nDefendants, Dkt. 45; Motion for Joinder of  Venture Capital Defendants, Dkt. 50.   \nII. JUDICIAL NOTICE \n Defendants ask this Court to ta ke judicial notice of Exhibit A, which is attached to the \ndeclaration of Gavin M. Masuda (the “M asuda Decl.”).  Req. Jud. Not. At 1.   \nA. Legal Standard \n Generally, district courts ma y not consider material outsid e the pleadings when assessing \nthe sufficiency of a complaint under Rule 12(b)(6 ) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  Lee v. \nCity of L.A. , 250 F.3d 668, 688 (9th Cir. 2001); Khoja v. Orexigen Therapeutics, Inc. , 899 F.3d \n988, 998 (9th Cir. 2018); see also  Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(d).  This rule does not apply to the \nincorporation by reference doctrin e or judicial notice under Fe deral Rule of Evidence 201.  Khoja , \n899 F.3d at 998 .   \n Rule 201 permits a court to take judicial no tice of an adjudicative fact “not subject to \nreasonable dispute,” that is “generally known” or “can be accurately and readily determined from \nsources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be ques tioned.” Fed. R. Evid. 201(b).  Incorporation by \nreference treats certain documents as though they are part of the complaint itself.  Daniels-Hall , Case 5:18-cv-03712-EJD   Document 65   Filed 10/18/19   Page 9 of 30 \nCase No.: 5:18-cv-03712-EJD  \nORDER GRANTING IN PART AND DENYING IN PART DEFENDANTS’ MOTION TO \nDISMISS; GRANTING DEFE NDANTS’ JOINDER MOTIONS \n \n 10 1 \n2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 \n10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 United States District Court \nNorthern District of Californi a 629 F.3d at 998.  These are situations where the complaint “necessarily re lies” upon a document or \nwhere the complaint alleges the contents of th e document and the documents authenticity and \nrelevance is not disputed.  Coto Settlement v. Eisenberg , 593 F.3d 1031, 1038 (9th Cir. 2010).  A \ndefendant may seek to incorporate a document into the complaint “if the plaintiff refers extensively to the document or the document forms the basis of the plaintiff’s claim.”  Khoja , 899 \nF.3d at 1002.  \nB. Discussion  \n Plaintiff does not object to the judicial notice of Exhib it A, which is Restoration’s \nProspectus that was filed with the SEC on Oc tober 13, 2017.  This is a publicly available \ndocument; thus, it is subject to judicial notice.  In re Extreme Networks, In c. S’holder Deriv. Litig. , \n573 F. Supp. 2d 1228, 1231 n.2 (N.D. Cal. 2008) (“Pub lic records, such as SEC filings, are \nproperly the subject of judicial not ice, and routinely considered in deciding a motion to dismiss in \na securities case.”).  Further, Pl aintiff explicitly and repeatedly refers to the Prospectus in his \nComplaint.  See Compl. ¶¶ 2 n.2, 7, 63, 65, 67–71, 77, 112–14, 131–33.  Therefore, Exhibit A is \nalso incorporated by referen ce.  Accordingly, this Court GRANTS Defendant’s request for \njudicial notice.   \nIII. JOINDER  \n The Underwriter and Venture Capital Defendant s seek to join Restor ation and Individual \nDefendants’ motion to dismiss.  Plaintiff doe s not oppose these joinder motions.  This Court \nGRANTS  these joinder motions. \nIV. MOTION TO DISMISS\n4 \n Plaintiff alleges Defendants viol ated Section 11 and 15 of the Ac t.  Plaintiff also contends \nthat Defendants violated Item 303.  Compl. ¶¶ 173–74.  The Court addresses these allegations in \n                                                 \n4 This Court disagrees with Defe ndants’ contention that Plainti ff’s Complaint was pled in “true \npuzzle style.”  Mot. at 11.  To the contrary, th e Court found Plaintiff’s complaint to be clear and \ndevoid of “long, rambling passages” without “speci fic reasons for the statements falsity.”  \nStrassman v. Fresh Choice, Inc. , 1995 WL 743728, at *4 (N.D. Cal. Dec. 7, 1995). Case 5:18-cv-03712-EJD   Document 65   Filed 10/18/19   Page 10 of 30 \nCase No.: 5:18-cv-03712-EJD  \nORDER GRANTING IN PART AND DENYING IN PART DEFENDANTS’ MOTION TO \nDISMISS; GRANTING DEFE NDANTS’ JOINDER MOTIONS \n \n 11 1 \n2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 \n10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 United States District Court \nNorthern District of Californi a turn. \n In assessing a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dism iss, courts consider the complaint in its \nentirety, “accept all factual all factual allegations . . . as true” and construe them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.  Tellabs, Inc. v. Makor Issues & Rights, Ltd. , 551 U.S. 308, 322 (2007).  \nTo survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to “state a claim for relief that is plausible on its face.”  Ashcroft v. Iqbal , 556 U.S. 662, 678 \n(2009) (discussing Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8( a)(2)).  A claim has faci al plausibility when \nthe plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the \ndefendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.  Id.  The requirement that the court must “accept as \ntrue” all allegations in the complaint is  “inapplicable to le gal conclusions.”  Id.  “Threadbare \nrecitals of the elements of a cause of action, supported by mere conclusory statements, do not \nsuffice.”  Id.   \nA. Section 11 Claim \n1. Legal Standard \n To allege a claim under Section 11, a plain tiff must prove “‘(1) that the registration \nstatement contained an omission or misrep resentation, and (2) that the omission or \nmisrepresentation was material, that  is, it would have misled a reasonable investor about the nature \nof his or her investment.’”  Rubke v. Capital Bancorp Ltd. , 551 F.3d 1156, 1161 (9th Cir. 2009) \n(quoting In re Daou Sys., Inc. , 411 F.3d 1006, 1027 (9th Cir. 2005)); see also Matrixx Initiatives, \nInc. v. Siracusano , 563 U.S. 27, 44 (2011) (noting that  fact is material when “a reasonable  \ninvestor would [view] the nondisc losed information as having significantly  altered the total mix of \ninformation made available” (citation and quotati on marks omitted)).  Section 11 creates a private \ncause of action in favor of securities purchaser s who rely upon a materia lly false or misleading \nprospectus.  In re Worlds of Wonder Sec. Litig. , 35 F.3d 1407, 1412 (9th Cir. 1994) (citing 15 \nU.S.C. § 77k(a)).  “No scienter is required for liability under § 11; defendants will be liable for Case 5:18-cv-03712-EJD   Document 65   Filed 10/18/19   Page 11 of 30 \nCase No.: 5:18-cv-03712-EJD  \nORDER GRANTING IN PART AND DENYING IN PART DEFENDANTS’ MOTION TO \nDISMISS; GRANTING DEFE NDANTS’ JOINDER MOTIONS \n \n 12 1 \n2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 \n10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 United States District Court \nNorthern District of Californi a innocent or negligent material  misstatements or omissions.”5  In re Daou , 411 F.3d at 1027. \n For a misstatement to be actionable, the st atement must be both false and material.  See \nBasic Inc. v. Levinson , 485 U.S. 224, 238 (1988).  To surviv e a motion to dismiss, a complaint \nmust “specify each statement alleged to have be en misleading, [and] the reason or reasons why the \nstatement is misleading.”  Metzler Inv. GmbH , 540 F. 3d 1049, 1070 (9th Ci r. 2008).  Statements \nare misleading only if they “affirmatively create an im pression of a state of affairs that differs in a \nmaterial way from the one that actually exists.”  Brody v. Transitional Hosp. Corp. , 280 F.3d 997, \n1006 (9th Cir. 2002).  Silence, absent a duty to disclose, “is not misleading under Rule 10b-5.”  Basic , 485 U.S. at 239 n.17; see also  City of Dearborn Heights Act 345 Police & Fire Ret. Sys. v. \nAlign Tech., Inc. , 856 F.3d 605, 616 (9th Cir. 2017) (treati ng 10(b)(5) and Section 11 claims the \nsame as to their applicability to “untrue statement[ s] of fact”).  “Often a statement will not mislead \neven if it is incomplete or does not include all relevant facts.”  Brody , 280 F.3d at 1006.   \nNot all material adverse events mu st be disclosed to investors.  See In re Rigel Pharm., Inc. \nSec. Litig. , 697 F.3d 869, 880 n.8 (9th Cir. 2012) (discussing Matrixx , 563 U.S. at 38–45).  \nConsequently, omissions are actiona ble only if a defendant has a dut y to disclose information and \nfails to do so.  Basic , 485 U.S. at 239 n.17.  Hence, if the omission does not “make the actual \nstatement[] misleading,” a company need not supp lement the statement “even if investors would \nconsider the omitted information significant.”  Rigel , 697 F.3d at 880 n.8.   \nFinally, an actionable statement must also  “be capable of objec tive verification.”  Retail \nWholesale & Dep’t Store Union Local 338 Ret. Fund v. Hewlett-Packard Co. , 845 F.3d 1268, \n1275 (9th Cir. 2017).  For example, business puffery or opinion (vague, optimistic statements) are not actionable because they do not “induce the reliance of a reasonable investor.”  Or. Pub. Emps. \n                                                 \n5 The parties agree that th is motion to dismiss is governed by Rule 8(a)(2).  See Restoration \nRobotics Defendants’ Reply (“Reply”) at 1, Dkt.  55.  While Section 11 does not contain an \nelement of fraud, a plaintiff may be subject to Rule 9(b)’s particular ity requirement if the \ncomplaint “sounds in fraud.”  In re Daou , 411 F.3d at 1027.  Here, the Complaint expressly \n“disclaims any allegation that co uld be construed as alleging fraud or intentional or reckless \nmisconduct.”  Compl. ¶ 1.  Accord ingly, Rule 8(a)(2) applies.

Fund v. Apollo Grp. Inc. , 774 F.3d 598, 606 (9th Cir. 2014).   \n2. Discussion \n In their Motion to Dismiss, Defendants challe nge the sufficiency of Plaintiff’s Section 11 \nclaim by arguing that the offering materials, which form the complaint, were not false or \nmisleading.  Mot. at 11.  The alleged material mi sstatements or omissions can be separated into \nthree categories: statements c oncerning Restoration’s marketing function, statements concerning \nthe quality and design of the ARTAS system, and statements concerning ARTAS systems’ \n“installed base.”  In order to effectively addres s these categories of statements, the Court sorts the \nstatements into headings based on Defendants arguments for dismissal, i.e., (1) General \nStatements of Corporate Optimism and (2) Falsity (including the alleged omissions).6   \ni. General Statements of Corporate Optimism \n In the Ninth Circuit, “vague, generalized asse rtions of corporate optim ism or statements of \n‘mere puffing’ are not actionable material misr epresentations under fede ral securities laws” \nbecause no reasonable investor would rely on such statements.  In re Fusion-io , 2015 WL 661869, \nat *14 (collecting cases).  When valuing corporat ions, investors do not “r ely on vague statements \nof optimism like ‘good,’ ‘well-rega rded,’ or other feel good monikers.  This mildly optimistic, \nsubjective assessment hardly amount s to a securities violation.”  In re Cutera Sec. Litig. , 610 F.3d \n1103, 1111 (9th Cir. 2010).  “Puffing” concerns expressions of opinion, as opposed to knowingly \nfalse statements of fact.  Or. Pub. Emps. Ret. Fund , 774 F.3d at 606 .  Statements that are capable \nof “objective verification” are no t “puffery” and can constitute material misrepresentations.  Id. \n Statement 1.   This statement is inherently s ubjective “puffing” and would not induce \nreliance of a reasonable investor.  See Reply at 5.  Defendants stated they “provide comprehensive  \nclinical training, practice-based ma rketing support, as well as pa tient leads” to customers and \n                                                 \n6 The Court does not address the “bespeaks cau tion” arguments because it was unnecessary to do \nso.  This should not be construed, however, as rejecting or accepting the applicability of this \nargument.

Fund , 774 F.3d at 606 (holding “[w]e \nbelieve  that our track record for enrollment and re venue growth is attributable to our offering \ncomprehensive  services combining quality educational content, teaching resources and customer \nservice with formats that are ac cessible and easy to use for studen ts as well as our corporate \nclients” inactionable (alteration in original) (s econd emphasis added)).  He re, as there, generic \nphrases like “believe” and “comprehensiv e” are too vague to be actionable.  Id.  Moreover, terms \nlike “patient leads,” “marketing support” and “increase procedures” ar e too generic to be \nactionable.  Id. (concluding terms like “educational conten t” and “teaching re sources” provided \n“nothing concrete upon which [the  Plaintiffs] could rely” (alt eration in original)).   \n Statement 2.   This statement addresses Defendants’ goals for the ARTAS System.  \nPlaintiff pleads only a phrase of the statement and omits the prefatory language, which states: \n“Our goal is to expand the commercialization of the ARTAS System . . . [by] driv[ing] increased \nutilization of the ARTAS System by working co llaboratively with our physician customers.”  \nMasuda Decl., Ex. A, at ECF 11 (emphasis added).  Investors neither rely on phrases like “goal” \nnor “increased utiliza tion”—these are too vague and cons titute “non-actionable puffing.”  See, \ne.g., Wozniak v. Align Tech., Inc. , 850 F. Supp. 2d 1029, 1037 (N.D. Cal. 2012) (holding “[w]e are \nconfident the improved features for Orthos [orthodontists] and GPS will increase  and sustain \nutilization ” to be “feel good” statements on which invest ors do not rely when valuing corporations \n(emphasis added)); In re Moody’s Corp.

Supp. 2d 493, 508 (S.D.N.Y. 2009) \n(“Statements of ‘ hope , opinion, or belief about [the company's] future performance’ are not \nactionable.” (citation omitted)).  “Hope” is a synonym of “goal.”  Both refer to vague aspirations \nfor the future and investors “know how to deva lue the optimism of corporate executives.”  In re \n                                                 \n7 Moreover, there is no allegation Defendants did not believe this.   Case 5:18-cv-03712-EJD   Document 65   Filed 10/18/19   Page 14 of 30 \nCase No.: 5:18-cv-03712-EJD  \nORDER GRANTING IN PART AND DENYING IN PART DEFENDANTS’ MOTION TO \nDISMISS; GRANTING DEFE NDANTS’ JOINDER MOTIONS \n \n 15 1 \n2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 \n10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 United States District Court \nNorthern District of Californi a Cutera , 610 F.3d at 1111.   \n Statement 3.  Much like Statement 1, Statement 3 pe rtains to Defendants’ belief in \nincreasing ARTAS’s profitability and its intention to develop th e ARTAS system.  Compl. ¶ 133 \n(“[W]e believe8 we can increase procedur e revenues . . . . [W]e intend  to utilize our teams . . . to \nwork with and to support our physician customer s in developing profitable ARTAS systems.”).  \nSuch forward-looking statements are non-actionable.  See Or. Pub. Emps. Ret. Fund , 774 F.3d at \n606.  An “intention” to do something is forward-looking and thus non-actionable.  See Scritchfield \nv. Paolo , 274 F. Supp. 2d 163, 176 (D.R.I. 2003) (holding statements in Prospectus “[w]e intend \nto become . . . .” “precisely [the] type of  exempt ‘forward-looking’” statements).   \n The cases cited by Plaintiff to show that St atements 1–3 are actionable are inapposite; they \ndeal with situations where the defendants made  reassuring statements in response to direct \nquestions from investors.  Plaintiff’s Opposition to the Motion to Dismiss (“Opp.”), Dkt. 53 at 24.  \nFor instance, in Azar v. Yelp, Inc. , “Defendants assured  investors that ‘the fundamentals are all in \nplace and really strong’ in the context of responding to a specific question  about the local \nadvertising program that Defe ndants allegedly knew was pe rforming poorly.”  2018 WL 6182756, \nat *12 (N.D. Cal. Nov. 27, 2018) (emphasis added).  Likewise, in In re Signet Jewelers Limited \nSecurities Litigation , the defendants’ made the statements “in response to direct questions  about \nSignet’s credit portfolio.”  2018 WL 6167889, at *12 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 26, 2018) (emphasis added).  \nThus, the courts could not conclude (on a motion to  dismiss) that the stat ements were so vague a \nreasonable investor would not reasonably rely on them because they were made in response to investor queries and addressed “specific aspects” of the comp any’s health.  2018 WL 6182756, at \n*12.  In contrast, here, Statements 1–3 were not made  in response to investors; they were made in \nthe Offering Materials and generally discussed Re storation’s marketing strategy.  Compl. ¶ 130.   \n                                                 \n8 Defendants argue that “belief” applies to Statement 4 as well.  Mot. at 5.  This Court disagrees.  \nNowhere before the phrase “easily implemented” is a vague, optimistic statement of belief.  Accordingly, Statement 4 does not fit w ithin the corporate optimism exception.   Case 5:18-cv-03712-EJD   Document 65   Filed 10/18/19   Page 15 of 30 \nCase No.: 5:18-cv-03712-EJD  \nORDER GRANTING IN PART AND DENYING IN PART DEFENDANTS’ MOTION TO \nDISMISS; GRANTING DEFE NDANTS’ JOINDER MOTIONS \n \n 16 1 \n2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 \n10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 United States District Court \nNorthern District of Californi a  Plaintiff further argues the statements ar e actionable because they omit material facts \nknown to the Defendants.  Opp. at 25, Dkt. 53 (citing Omnicare, Inc. v. Laborers Dist. Council \nConst. Indus. Pension Fund , 135 S. Ct. 1318, 1331 (2015) (“And the purpose of § 11 supports this \nunderstand of how the omissions clause maps onto  opinion statements.  Congress adopted § 11 to \nensure that issuers ‘tell[] the whol e truth’ to investors.” (citation om itted)).  Plaintiff contends that \nDefendants falsely represented th at the Company’s sales would help Restoration’s physician \ncustomers increase the number of procedures pe rformed, despite knowing: “(1) the Company was \nunable to provide its customers with patient lead s (¶ 82); (2) the Company’s marketing initiatives \nwere ineffective (¶¶ 82–93); and (3) the design of the geographical  regions to which a PSM was \nassigned were illogical a nd hindered practice growth (¶ 84).”  Opp. at 25.   \nPlaintiff is correct that pref atory language like “we think” or “we believe,” does not alone \nabsolve securities fraud liability because th ese phrases can preface statements capable of \nmisleading investors.  Opp. at 25.  Plaintiff, how ever, is incorrect the undisclosed “facts” listed \nabove render Defendants’ statements misl eading.  To the contrary, Defendants did provide “full \nand fair” disclosure of material information.  Id.  The Prospectus explicit ly identifies Statements \n1–3 as “forward-looking statements” and informs investors that they “may turn out to be \ninaccurate.”  Masuda Decl., Ex A at 50.  These cautionary phrases are repeated throughout.  See, \ne.g., id. at 5, 8, 12.  Indeed, just after Statement 2 is a disclosure entitled “Risks Associated with \nOur Business.”  Id. at 5.  In it, Defendants note they have had “limited commercial history and \nhave incurred significant losse s since our inception.  We anticipate that we will continue to incur \nlosses for the foreseeable future , which, together with our lim ited operating history, makes it \ndifficult to assess our future viability.”  Id. (emphasis added).  Thus, unlike In re Allied Nevada \nGold Corp. Securities Litigation , a case Plaintiff cites as supp ort, Defendants did not mislead \ninvestors as to the status of  their financial viability.  Compare 743 F. App’x 887, 888 (9th Cir. \n2018) (holding “forward-looking” optimistic stat ements actionable because Defendants made \nthem knowing they were false and omitted cautionary language about the potential risk), with Case 5:18-cv-03712-EJD   Document 65   Filed 10/18/19   Page 16 of 30 \nCase No.: 5:18-cv-03712-EJD  \nORDER GRANTING IN PART AND DENYING IN PART DEFENDANTS’ MOTION TO \nDISMISS; GRANTING DEFE NDANTS’ JOINDER MOTIONS \n \n 17 1 \n2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 \n10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 United States District Court \nNorthern District of Californi a Masuda Decl., Ex. A at 12 (discussing Restor ation’s limited financial commercial history and \nurging investors to “consider investing in [the] common stock” because of the significant risks \nfacing Restoration).   \nAccordingly, given the abundance of cautionary  language and honest disclosure regarding \nDefendants’ lack of commercial success,  Statements 1–3 were not “half-truths.”  Cf. Omnicare , \n135 S. Ct. at 1330 (“[A]n investor reads each  statement within such a document . . . in light of all \nits surrounding text  . . . . So an omission that renders misleading a statement of opinion when \nviewed in a vacuum may not do so once that stat ement is considered, as is appropriate, in a \nbroader frame.”); Mot. at 16.   \nFor these reasons, the Court holds that Stat ements 1–3 are nonactionable statements.  \nAccordingly, this Court GRANTS  Defendants’ motion to dism iss as to these claims. \nii. Material Misrepresentation or Omission \n The standard for Section 11 falsity is more le nient than pleading a Rule 10(b)(5) violation.  \nSee In re Countryside Fin. Corp. Sec. Litig. , 588 F. Supp. 2d 1132, 1156 (C.D. Cal. 2008) (noting \nthat securities plaintiffs alleging fraud must meet  “three separate pleadi ng standards”).  When a \nSection 11 complaint does not “sound in fraud,” it  must only meet Rule 8(a)’s ordinary notice \npleading requirements.  Id. at 1162.  Even without Rule 9(b), however, Plaintiff must still plead \nenough facts to state a facially  plausible claim for relief under Section 11 and Section 15.  Bell Atl. \nCorp. v. Twombly , 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007).  In a Section 11  context, this means Plaintiff must \nallege sufficient facts from which this Court can infer “a statement was either false or misleading \n(in light of omitted information), and that [the] same statement was material.”  In re \nIAC/InterActiveCorp. Sec. Litig. , 695 F. Supp. 2d 109, 117 (S.D.N.Y. 2010).  Materiality is “fact-\nspecific;” it “turns on context.”  Id.  Statements in a Prospectus, t hus, must “be read in the context \nof the whole document” and “judged based on ‘the facts as they existed when the applicable \nregistration statement became effective.’”  Id. (quoting In re Flag Telecom Holdings, Ltd. Sec. \nLitig. , 618 F. Supp. 2d 311, 320 (S.D.N.Y. 2009)).  Acco rdingly, the issue is not whether the Case 5:18-cv-03712-EJD   Document 65   Filed 10/18/19   Page 17 of 30 \nCase No.: 5:18-cv-03712-EJD  \nORDER GRANTING IN PART AND DENYING IN PART DEFENDANTS’ MOTION TO \nDISMISS; GRANTING DEFE NDANTS’ JOINDER MOTIONS \n \n 26 1 \n2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 \n10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 United States District Court \nNorthern District of Californi a Inc., 143 F.3d 1293, 1296 (9th Cir. 1998).  The Ninth Circuit has held that because Section 11 \nimposes liability if a registrant “omits to stat e a material fact required to be stated” in the \nregistration statement, “any omi ssion of facts ‘required to be st ated’ under Item 303 will produce \nliability under Section 11.”  In re Violin Memory Sec. Litig. , 2014 WL 5525946, at *15 (N.D. Cal. \nOct. 31, 2014) (quoting Steckman , 143 F.3d at 1296).   \n Defendants argue that “Item 303 is not actiona ble . . . under Section 11,” because recently, \nin In re NVIDIA Corp. Sec. Litig. , 768 F.3d 1046, 1055–56 (9th Cir. 2014), the Ninth Circuit held \nthat Item 303 “does not create a duty to disclose for the purpose s of Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-\n5.”  Mot. at 20.  Defendants cont end that because the test for whether a statement is materially \nmisleading is “identical” for both S ection 10(b) and Section 11 claims, In re NVIDIA  applies to \nSection 11 cases as well.  Reply at 10.  While it is  true the Ninth Circuit has stated Section 10(b) \nand Section 11 claims share the materiality element, City of Dearborn Heights , 856 F.3d at 616, \nthe NVIDIA  Court was explicit in noting that Steckman was still good law.  See In re NVIDIA , 768 \nF.3d at 1055–56 (“To put it differently, liability aris es from ‘an omission in contravention of an \naffirmative legal disclosure oblig ation.’  There is no su ch requirement under Section 10(b) or Rule \n10b-5.” (citation omitted)).  Thus, Plai ntiff may bring an  Item 303 claim. \n Plaintiff must establish that Defendants “failed to disclose known trends and \nuncertainties.”  17 C.F.R. §§ 229.303(a)(3)(ii).  Plaintiff argues Defendant s failed to establish \nthree trends: the trend related to warehousing by Foreign Defendants, the trend of Restoration’s \ncustomers abandoning use of ARTAS, and the trend of uncertainty related to physicians stalling \npurchases. \n1. Trend Related to Warehousing \n Plaintiff argues that leading up to the IPO,  distributors overseas began to bulk purchase \nARTAS Systems and “warehouse” them.  Opp. at 19.  This resulted in a trend of the foreign \nmarkets becoming saturated, causing system sales to  decline abroad and resulting in Restoration \npivoting to a U.S. centric model of business.  Id.   Case 5:18-cv-03712-EJD   Document 65   Filed 10/18/19   Page 26 of 30 \nCase No.: 5:18-cv-03712-EJD  \nORDER GRANTING IN PART AND DENYING IN PART DEFENDANTS’ MOTION TO \nDISMISS; GRANTING DEFE NDANTS’ JOINDER MOTIONS \n \n 27 1 \n2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 \n10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 United States District Court \nNorthern District of Californi a  The Complaint alleges only one specific instance of purported “warehousing.”  “CW 1 \nspecifically recalls [warehousing] occurring with a distributor in  Madrid, Spain, but stated the \npractice was common.”  Conclusory allegations  like “the practice was common” must be \ndisregarded.  See Iqbal , 556 U.S. at 1948–51; In re Coty Inc. Sec. Litig. , 2016 WL 1271065, *8 \n(S.D.N.Y. Mar. 29, 2016) ( holding single allegation of  “de-stocking” activity prior  to IPO was \ninsufficient as a matter of law to support plausible inference that, at the time of the IPO, products \n“were being destocked in such a ma terial way as to require disclosu re”).  Thus, Plaintiff presents \nonly one  instance of warehousing.  Reply at 11.  A trend under Item 303 requires an “observed \npattern that accurately reflects persistent conditions of the pa rticular registrant’s business \nenvironment.”  Oxford Asset Mgmt., Ltd. v. Jaharis , 297 F.3d 1182, 1191 (11th Cir. 2002).  Here, \n“nothing in the [Complaint] creates a plausible in ference that this was a trend rather than an \nisolated event” because only one instance of “warehousing” is alleged.  In re Noah Educ. \nHoldings, Ltd. Sec. Litig. , 2010 WL 1372709, at *6 (S.D .N.Y. Mar. 31, 2010).   \n To combat this, Plaintiff points to post-IPO statements and actions to show a trend of \nwarehousing.  See Opp. at 19.  These events, however, took place seven-months after  the IPO.  \nSee In re Coty , 2016 WL 1271065, at *9 (“Plaintiffs' one-two punch of poor post-IPO  earnings \ncoupled with temporally nonspecific and substa ntively vague assertions  of destocking by one \nconfidential informant is not enough to establish the falsity of th e Registration Statement or the \nexistence of an omitted known trend.” (emphasis added); In re CPI Card Group Inc. Securities \nLitigation .  2017 WL 4941597, at *4 (S.D .N.Y. Oct. 30, 2017) (findi ng actionable trend when \nover-saturation was done before  the IPO).  Id.  This is insufficient.  \n Finally, Plaintiff’s Complaint does not demonstr ate that a material impact from any such \nwarehousing trend was “reasonably likely to  occur” at the time of the IPO.  Compare  Compl. \n¶ 145 (alleging only that ARTAS Sy stems were being warehoused), with Fresno Cty. Emps. Ret. \nAss’n v. Alphatec Holdings, Inc. , 607 F. App’x 694, 695 (9th Cir.  2015) (holding no trend alleged \nbecause complaint did not specify what portion of inventory was defective or how it affected Case 5:18-cv-03712-EJD   Document 65   Filed 10/18/19   Page 27 of 30 \nCase No.: 5:18-cv-03712-EJD  \nORDER GRANTING IN PART AND DENYING IN PART DEFENDANTS’ MOTION TO \nDISMISS; GRANTING DEFE NDANTS’ JOINDER MOTIONS \n \n 28 1 \n2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 \n10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 United States District Court \nNorthern District of Californi a revenue projections).  Accordingly, no tr end related to warehousing is shown.  \n2. Trend of Abandoning Use of ARTAS \n Plaintiff next argues that De fendants failed to disclose phys ician’s widespread discontent \nwith the ARTAS System due to lack of patient leads, effective marketing support, and needle \ndefects.  Opp. at 20.  This caused physicians to abandon the ARTAS System, which widened the \ndisproportionate relationship be tween systems and procedure-based revenues.  Compl. ¶ 85.  \nPlaintiff argues this trend of cust omer dissatisfaction and non-use of  the machine is “precisely the \ntype of information an investor would attach importance in making an investment decision.”  See \nLitwin v. Blackstone Grp., L.P. , 634 F.3d 706, 722 (2d Cir. 2011).  The issue, however, is not \nwhether an investor would want to know of su ch discontent, but whethe r, at the time of the \nstatement, such a knowable trend existed.   Unlike in the Section 11 clai ms discussed above, Plaintiff must establish knowledge on the \npart of Defendants regarding any alleged trend of abandonment.  In  the Complaint, Plaintiff does \nnot state (or allow the Court to infer) that Defendants knew  of any of these problems.  To the \ncontrary, Plaintiff alle ges Defendants did not know of problem s pertaining to marketing strategy, \nproduct defects, or patient lead issues.  See Compl. ¶ 107 (“[Defendants] attended these meetings.  \nRather than re-evaluate the Company’s sales strategy or address the lead and product issues at \nthese weekly meetings  . . . .”); In re Coty , 2016 WL 1271065, at *7 (“Instead, Plaintiffs merely \nallege that there were meetings and describe onl y in broad, conclusory terms what was discussed \nat those meetings. . . . As a result, Plaintiffs' a llegations are ‘[s]ketchy at best’ and ‘do not provide \nenough detail to nudge plaintiffs’ claims across the line from conceivable to plausible.’”).   \n Finally, the Court finds  Plaintiff’s use of Panther Partners Inc. v. Ikanos Communications, \nInc. unpersuasive.  681 F.3d 114 (2d Cir. 2012).  Ther e, the court concluded the defendant failed \nto fully disclose the significance of a known chip  defect because it “knew at the time it was \nreceiving an increasing number of calls . . . it would be unable to determine which chip sets \ncontained defective chips [desp ite indicating otherwise].”  Id. at 121.  In contrast, here, Defendants Case 5:18-cv-03712-EJD   Document 65   Filed 10/18/19   Page 28 of 30 \nCase No.: 5:18-cv-03712-EJD  \nORDER GRANTING IN PART AND DENYING IN PART DEFENDANTS’ MOTION TO \nDISMISS; GRANTING DEFE NDANTS’ JOINDER MOTIONS \n \n 29 1 \n2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 \n10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 United States District Court \nNorthern District of Californi a were forthright about the limited commercial success of the ARTAS System: “We have limited \ncommercial history and we have in curred significant losses since our inception.  We anticipate that \nwe will continue to incur losses for the fores eeable future . . . . Our operating expenses may \nfluctuate significantly.”  Masuda De cl., Ex. A at 12–13.  Investors were explicitly warned of a \ndownward trend of ARTAS Systems.  Thus, unlik e Plaintiff’s assertion that Defendants were \n“touting the health and management” of Rest oration, the opposite is shown.  Opp. at 20.  \nTherefore, the Court does not find a trend shown.    \n3. Trend and Uncertainty Related to Physicians Stalling Purchases \n Finally, Plaintiff alleges that there was a know n trend of physicians st alling purchases of \nthe ARTAS System at the time of the IPO.  Co mpl. ¶¶ 112–15.  Restoration was developing a new \nrobotic implantation feature that had not received FDA approval.  Id. ¶ 114 (information about \nnew system was in Prospectus).  It was supposed to receive approval in late 2017.  Id.  However, \nin the interim, Defendant Rhodes instructed memb ers not to mention the forthcoming feature to \ncustomers so that it would not cause any mo re of a decline or delay in sales.  Id. ¶¶ 116–17.  \nDefendants first discussed this in a May 2018 conference call and indi cated customers were \nhesitant to buy the ARTAS System because of the impending new system.  Id. ¶ 167.  Plaintiff \nargues this hesitancy was shown by the negative unit-sales at the ti me of the IPO.  Opp. at 22. \nContrary to Plaintiff’s asserti on, sales were actually  increasing in the months prior to the \nIPO.  Masuda Decl., Ex. A at 65.  Plaintiff does not allege these figures were false.  Further, CW 3 \ndoes not allege when  Defendant Rhodes instructed employees  to avoid mention of the forthcoming \nimplantation feature, but only alle ges that in 2018, seven months af ter the IPO, the effect of the \nnew technology was discussed.  See Compl. ¶¶ 117, 167; Mallen v. Alphatec Holdings, Inc. , 861 \nF. Supp. 2d 1111, 1127 n.8 (C.D. Cal. 2012) (“Plainti ffs’ citation to Defendants’ subsequent \ndisclosure, on August 5, 2010, that there was a six-w eek delay in loading Sc ient’x’s products into \nAlphatec and vice versa . . . is insu fficient by itself to show that t hose delays were either known or \ncould reasonably be expected to have a materi al impact [on Prospectus Publication Date].”); Case 5:18-cv-03712-EJD   Document 65   Filed 10/18/19   Page 29 of 30 \nCase No.: 5:18-cv-03712-EJD  \nORDER GRANTING IN PART AND DENYING IN PART DEFENDANTS’ MOTION TO \nDISMISS; GRANTING DEFE NDANTS’ JOINDER MOTIONS \n \n 30 1 \n2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 \n10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 United States District Court \nNorthern District of Californi a Ronconi v. Larkin , 253 F.3d 423, 430 n.12 (9th Cir. 2001) (“Fraud by hindsight is not actionable.” \n(citation and quotation marks omitted)).  Plaintiff does not allege sufficient facts to show, at the \ntime the Prospectus was published, p hysicians were stalling purchases or that Defendants knew of \nthis trend.  Thus, the Court does not find a trend here either. \nAccordingly, Plaintiff has not pled sufficient facts to show an Item 303 violation and thus \nDefendants’ motion to dismiss is GRANTED  as to Item 303.  \nV. LEAVE TO AMEND \nWhen dismissing a complaint for failure to state a claim (either in full or in part), a court \nshould grant leave to amend “unle ss it determines that the pleadi ng could not possibly be cured by \nthe allegation of other facts.”  Lopez v. Smith,  203 F.3d 1122, 1127 (9th Cir. 2000).  The Court has \ndetermined that Plaintiffs fail to state a cl aim for Statements 1–6, 8, and 10.  Because, however, \nPlaintiffs may salvage their Complaint, the Court finds amendment would not be futile for all but \nStatement 6.  Plaintiffs' claims are therefore dismissed with leave to amend. \nVI. CONCLUSION \nDefendants’ motion to dismiss Plaintiffs' Complaint is GRANTED  in part and DENIED \nin part.  Plaintiff has leave to amend.  Should Plai ntiffs choose to file an amended complaint, they \nmust do so by November 14, 2019.

    "summary": "1. **Summary:**\n   In this case, the plaintiffs, who are investors in Opendoor Technologies, a company involved in the iBuying market using advanced technology—including a proprietary algorithm to price homes—allege that Opendoor, along with its personnel and underwriters, committed securities fraud by making misleading statements about its business model and the accuracy of its algorithm. The court ultimately dismisses the plaintiffs' complaint with leave to amend, finding insufficient evidence of scienter (intent to defraud) and negative causation due to lack of adequate pleading of a primary securities violation. The case involves AI and automation through the company's use of algorithms for pricing and forecasting future home values.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue:**\n   The primary legal issue is whether Opendoor and its affiliates made false or misleading statements about the efficacy of its algorithm and business model, which would amount to securities fraud under Sections 10(b) and 11 of the Securities Act.\n\n3. **Court's Holding:**\n   The court grants the defendants' motions to dismiss, concluding that the plaintiffs did not adequately plead facts to show scienter (intent to deceive) or loss causation (a causal connection between the alleged fraud and the economic loss). Additionally, the court finds the statements made by defendants were not sufficiently misleading and were often accompanied by adequate disclosures. The court allows the plaintiffs another opportunity to amend their complaint.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation:**\n   Imagine a company that buys and sells homes really quickly using a computer program that helps figure out how much the homes are worth. Some people who invested money in this company thought they were misled about how well this computer program worked. They sued the company, saying it wasn’t truthful about its magic home-pricing software. The court looked at it and said, \"You haven’t shown us enough to prove that this company really tricked anyone on purpose or that their mistakes caused your money problems.\" So the court told them they could try again, but they needed to explain things better next time.",

FACTS  \n  In the past decade, r apid technological development has shaped and reshaped \ncommerce . Artificial intelligence  is now disrupting industries throughout  the world \neconomy.  The ways that people shop, consume entertainment, move about , and vacation  \nhave fundamentally changed. So, t oo, has the way that people conduct major transactions  \nsuch as home selling  and buying.  \n iBuying, short for instan t buying, is a relatively recent phenomenon  intended to \nsimplify  major transactions . (Doc. 39 ¶ ¶ 51, 52 .) Powered by advanced technology , \niBuyers, or businesses engaged in iBuying,  use automated valuation models to price homes. \n(Id. ¶ 51.) Based on those valuations, iBuyers attempt to quickly purchase and resell \nhomes.  (Id.) \n Founded in 2014, Opendoor  is an iBuying company operat ing in the residential real \nestate market. ( Id. ¶¶ 51-52.) Its process follows the typical structure of an iBuying \nbusiness . Individuals looking to sell their homes  can go to Opendoor’s website or mobile \napp, input some  relevant data points , and receive an “instant ” cash offer  generated by \nOpendoor’s proprietary algorithm . (Id. ¶ 53.) After making the initial offer, Opendoor \npersonnel conduct a virtual assessment and adjust  the offer based on the home’s cond ition. \n(Id.) Then, Opendoor makes a final offer , which is reduced by  a 5% service charge. ( Id.) If \nthe homeowner accepts, Opendoor pays  the seller, takes ownership of the home , make s \nrepairs  if necessary , and lists it for resale. (Id. ¶¶ 55, 75-76.) \n Opendoor’s  algorithm is central to the success of its iBuying business. ( Id. ¶¶ 56, \n59.) To consistently sell homes at a profit, Opendoor’s algorithm must produce generally \naccurate initial offers . (Id. ¶ 4.) While those initial offers will often be adjusted after t he \nhomes’ unique defects are revealed through an inspection, the y must provide Opendoor \nwith a viable starting point. (Id. ¶¶ 4, 53.) Accordingly, the  algorithm must  account for the \nvalue of the  homes at the time of the initial offer  and accurately  forecas t their future value . Case 2:22-cv-01717-MTL     Document 86     Filed 02/28/24     Page 2 of 33 \n- 3 -  \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n (Id. ¶¶ 4, 7, 60.) The algorithm  purports to do this by relying on frequently expanding, \ncomprehensive sets of hyperlocal data. ( Id. ¶ 58.) It uses that data, according to Opendoor, \nto anticipate market changes and thereby generate offers reflec tive of a home’s true  \nvalue —not just today, but in the future. ( Id. ¶¶ 7-9.) \n Opendoor has worked toward this objective  since its inception . (Id. ¶¶ 3, 52, 56.) It \nbegan  as a private company, but in 2020, went public via a reverse merger with Defendant \nSocial Capital Hedosophia Holdings Corp. II, a Special Purpose Acquisition Company \n(“SPAC”).2 (Id. ¶ 324.) After the de -SPAC merger, the surviving entity changed its name \nto Opendoor Technologies Inc. ( Id. ¶ 325.) Then, in December of that year, Opendoor \npublished offering documents which registered the first issuance of shares of Opendoor \ncommon stock. ( Id.) On December 21, 2020, the newly issued Opendoor shares began \npublicly trading on the NASDAQ  stock exchange . (Id.) In February 2021, Opendoor \npublished new offering documents registering the issuance of additional stock.  (Id. ¶ 327.) \nOn February 9, 2021, those shares began publicly trading.  (Id.) \n As Opendoor  informed stockholders , its iBuying business is its main revenue driver. \n(Id. ¶ 55.) In evaluating the financial health of that business, Opendoor told its investors \nthat “[t]he ultimate measure [they] should hold [Opendoor] accountable for is how [it is] \ndoing on contribut ion margin delivery.” (Id. ¶ 8.) Contribution  margin  refers to a metric \nused “to understand how a specific product contributes to [a] company’s profit.” Amy \nGallo, Contribution Margin: What It Is, How to Calculate It, and Why You Need It , Harvard \nBusiness Review (Oct. 13, 2017), https://hbr.org/2017/10/contribution -margin -what -it-is-\nhow-to-calculate -it-and-why-you-need -it. In this case, th e “product” is Opendoor’s \niBuying operation.   \n Opendoor’s contribution margin was strong immediately  following its public \n \n2 A SPAC is an entity that “goes public as a shell company using an IPO for the purpose \nof merging with or acquiring a yet -to-be-identified private operating company. Generally \nwithin two years, the SPAC combines with the private company via a de -SPAC merger, \nwith the resulting company becoming public and receiving a combination of the SPAC’s \nIPO proceeds and additional capital from a private financing. ” What are the differences in \nan IPO, a SPAC, and a direct listing? , U.S. Securi ties and Exchange Commission (last \nvisited Feb. 25, 2024), https://www.sec.gov/education/capitalraising/building -\nblocks/registered -offerings .

For example, its contribution margin for the fourth quarter of 2020 was 12.6%. \n(Id. ¶ 348.)  But one year later, amidst a housing slowdown,  its contribution margin \ndecreased to 4%. ( Id.) Then, in August 2022, Opendoor lost mo ney on 42% of its \ntransactions. ( Id. ¶ 349.) That year, its third quarter contribution margin was negative 0.7%. \n(Id. ¶ 350.) Opendoor’s stock value reflected this turn of events. From December 21, 2020 \nto November 7, 2022 (the “Class Period”), it s price  dropped by 94.43%.  (Id. ¶ 351.)  \n Lead Plaintiffs  are retirement service providers that purchased Opendoor stock  on \nbehalf of  their members and beneficiaries  during the Class Period .3 (Id. ¶¶ 356 -57.) Stuart \nGraham Hereford , another Plaintiff,  purchased stock in Social Capital Hedosophia \nHoldings Corp. II and , after the de -SPAC merger , from Opendoor  on several occasions \nthroughout the Class Period . (Doc. 39 -3.) Together, Plaintiffs  allege  that Defenda nts made \nseveral  materially misleading statements during the Class Period , that those statements \nartificially inflated Opendoor’s stock price, that they relied on those statements, and that \nthey suffered damages when the stock price dropped after the truth  was revealed . (See \ngenerally Doc. 39.)  \n Against the Opendoor Defendants, Plaintiffs assert claims under Section 10(b), 15 \nU.S.C.  § 78j(b)  and Section 20(a), 15 U.S.C.  § 78t(a) of the  Exchange Act of 1934 , and \nSection 11, 15 U.S.C.  § 77k and Section 15, 15 U.S.C.  § 77o, of the Securities Act of 1933. \n(Id. ¶¶ 305-19, 480 -99.) Against the Underwriter Defendants, they assert one claim under \nSection 11. ( Id. ¶¶ 480 -92.) Defendants responde d by filing their Motions to Dismiss. \n(Docs. 48, 51.)  \nII.

Id. At the pleading stage, the Court’s duty is to accept all well -pleaded \ncomplaint allegations as true. Id. Facts should be viewed “in the light most favorable to the \nnon-moving party.” Faulkner v. ADT Sec. Servs., Inc. , 706 F.3d 1017, 1019 (9th Cir. 2013). \n“[D]ismissal . . . is proper if there is a lack of a cognizable legal theory or the absence of \nsufficient  facts alleged under a cognizable legal theory.” Conservation Force v. Salazar , \n646 F.3d 1240, 1241 -42 (9th Cir. 2011)  (internal marks omitted) .   \n Securities fraud suits face heightened pleading standards. “At the pleading stage, a \ncomplaint stating claim s under [S]ection 10(b) and Rule 10b -5 must satisfy the dual \npleading requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b) and the PSLRA.” Zucco  \nPartners, LLC v. Digimarc Corp. , 552 F.3d  981, 990 (9th Cir. 2009) .  \nBecause allegations of fraud inescapably c arry a degree of \nmoral turpitude, Rule 9(b) imparts a heightened note of \nseriousness, requiring a greater degree of pre -discovery \ninvestigation by the plaintiff, followed by the plaintiff’s \nrequired particular allegations, thereby protecting a \ndefendant’s reputation from frivolous and unfounded \nallegations and permitting a particularized basis for a \ndefendant to respond to the particularized allegations.  \nIrving Firemen’s Relief & Ret. Fund v. Uber Tech s., Inc. , 998 F.3d 397, 404 (9th Cir. 2021) \n(citation o mitted).  \nSimilarly, the PSLRA requires that “the complaint shall specify each statement \nalleged to have been misleading, the reason or reasons why the statement is misleading, \nand, if an allegation regarding the statement or omission is made on informatio n and belief, \nthe complaint shall state with particularity all facts on which that belief is formed.” 15 \nU.S.C. §  78u-4(b)(1)(B).

DISCUSSION  \nA.  Section 10( b) \n“Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act prohibits manipulative or deceptive practices in \nconnection with the purchase or sale of a security. ” In re Facebook, Inc. Sec. Litig. , 87 \nF.4th 934, 947 (9th Cir. 2023) ( internal marks omitted ). Rule 10b -5 of the Exchange Act’s \nimplementing regulations, which is coextensive with Section 10(b), “prohibits making ‘any \nuntrue statement of a material fact’ or omitting material facts ‘necessary in order to make \nthe statements made, in the light of t he circumstances under which they were made, not \nmisleading.’” Id. (quoting Glazer Cap. Mgmt., L.P. v. Forescout Techs., Inc. , 63 F.4th 747, \n764 (9th Cir. 2023) (quoting 17 C.F.R. § 240.10b -5(b))).   \nTo state a claim under Section 10(b)  and Rule 10b -5, a pl aintiff must sufficiently \nallege: “(1) a material misrepresentation or omission; (2) made with scienter; (3) in \nconnection with the purchase or sale of a security; (4) reliance on the misrepresentation or \nomission; (5) economic loss; and (6) loss causation .” In re BofI  Holding  Sec. Litig. , 977 \nF.3d 781, 786 (9th Cir. 2020) . Each of these elements must be independently satisfied. See \nOr. Pub. Emps. Ret. Fund v. Apollo Grp. Inc. , 774 F.3d 598, 607 (9th Cir. 2014) (reasoning \nthat failure to adequately plead an  element constitutes “an independent basis” on which to \naffirm dismissal of a securities fraud complaint). As explored below, Plaintiffs successfully \nplead s six misrepresentations attributable to the Opendoor Defendants. Nonetheless, they \nfail to meet their  pleading standards as to scienter and loss causation.  \n  1.  Actionable False or Misleading Statements  \nThe Opendoor Defendants first argue that Plaintiffs’ Section 10(b) claim fails \nbecause Plaintiffs  have not alleged that they made any actionable false or misleading \nstatements. (Doc. 48 at 18 -28; Doc. 60 at 7 -18.) In response, Plaintiffs point to several \ncategories of statements made by the Opendoor Defendants alleged  in the Consolidated \nAmended Complaint  to have been false or misleading. (Doc. 56 at 15 -21.) \n“A plaintiff can allege falsity by ‘point[ing] to [the] defendant’s statements that \ndirectly contradict what the defendant knew at the time.” Jaeger v.

Statements Regarding the Pricing Algorithm  \nPlaintiffs allege that the Opendoor Defendants , through their challenged statements, \n“crea ted the impression that [Opendoor’s] success was the result of its AI -powered \nalgorithm, which they claimed drove pricing decisions and kept Opendoor profitable in any \nhousing market by reacting to changing economic conditions.” (Doc. 55 at 15.) Plaintiffs \nchallenge  the following statements regarding the accuracy and operability of Opendoor’s \npricing algorithm:  \n• The algorithm u ses “machine learning to drive pricing decisions.” (Doc. 39 ¶ 169.)  \n• Opendoor’s “proprietary, machine learning -based pricing models are  key to \n[Opendoor’s] ability to acquire and resell thousands of homes per month accurately, \nprofitably, and with increasing levels of automation.” ( Id. ¶ 173.)  \n• The algorithm c an “dynamically adjust to leading market indicators and react to \nreal-time macro - and micro -economic conditions.” ( Id. ¶¶ 169, 177.)  \n• The algorithm’s ability to “dynamically price homes in response to both micro and \nmacro factors [] allows [Opendoor] to manage  . . . within [a] 4% to 6%, annual \n[contribution] margin range, [] regardless of the home cycle [Opendoor is] operating \nin.” ( Id. ¶ 186.)  \n(Doc. 55 at 15.)  \nPlaintiffs allege that these statements were misleading because  “the algorithm could \nnot accurately price homes (even in a hot market) and as such [Opendoor’s] pricing Case 2:22-cv-01717-MTL     Document 86     Filed 02/28/24     Page 7 of 33 \n- 8 -  \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n decisions w ere based on a human -driven process that led to [Opendoor’s] success.” ( Id. at \n9.) This fact has been confirmed, say Plaintiffs, by several former employees. (Doc. \n39 ¶¶ 62-73.) For example, “[a]ccording to CW 5, who was brought in to price initial \noffers,  approximately 50% of the properties were sent to human pricing analysts for \nreview.” (Doc. 55 at 16 (citing Doc. 39 ¶ 71).) Additionally, “CW 2 stated that her \nmanagers continuously told pricing analysts to not even use the algorithm to generate final \noffers because the algorithm was never accurate and would corrupt the pricing analysts’ \nassessment of market value.” ( Id. (citing Doc. 39 ¶¶ 63 -64).)  Plaintiffs also point to \nfindings made by the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) in 2019 as further evidence tha t \npeople  did the work publicly attributed to  Opendoor’s algorithm. ( Id.) \nThe Opendoor Defendants counter  that Plaintiffs’ allegations conflate their business \npractices in the initial and final offer stages.  (Doc. 48 at 20 -21 n.11.) They argue that \nOpendoor never claimed that all its pricing decisions were driven by its algorithm. ( Id. at \n20-21.) Instead, Opendoor’s initial offers were driven primarily  (though not entirely) by its \nalgorithm, but creating  final offers required the aid of  substantial human involvement. This \nmakes sense. While the pricing algorithm took the lead in generating  an initial offer  based \non available  data, that initial offer had to be adjusted by the unique characteristics  that each \nindividual property possesse d—such as damaged or aged aspects that may have \nnecessitate d repairs. This latter task naturally require d personal  intervention.  \nThe Opendoor Defendants say that they disclos ed th e existence of this human \ninvolvement  in the following statements:4 \n• “The majority of our initial offers  are algorithmically generated and do not require \nany human intervention.”  (Doc. 49 -1 at 45 .) \n \n4 The Opendoor Defendants filed several exhibits containing their prior statements. (Doc. \n49.) They request that the Court  take judicial notice of the exhibits or consider them under \nthe doctrine of incorporation by reference. ( Doc. 50. ) Plaintiffs take no position on the \nrequest, “except to the exten t Defendants offer  these exhibits for the truth of the matter \nasserted therein . . . . Similarly, Plaintiffs  object to the documents Defendants seek judicial \nnotice of , such as Ex[ hibits] 16-18, because they are offered to establish a counter -factual \nnarrative that is improper a [t] the motion to dismiss stage. ” (Doc. 55 at 16 n.5.) The Court \nfinds that it may consider the exhibits, to the extent it does so in this Order, under t he \ndoctrine of incorporation by reference.  Case 2:22-cv-01717-MTL     Document 86     Filed 02/28/24     Page 8 of 33 \n- 9 -  \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n • “After all the data has been collected and incorporat ed, each offer is reviewed and \nfinalized  by members of our pricing team, allowing us to marry the best of \nalgorithmic insights with human judgment.” (Doc. 49 -2 at 10. ) \n• “We appraise and price homes we buy and sell using data science , proprietary \nalgorithms, and analysis from specially trained employees.” (Id. at 19.) \n• “I think there’s a sense that it’s just about the model . . . . But we’ve also done a \nreally good job of integrating systematic modeling with [] the human insight and the \nhuman overlay.” (Doc. 49 -3 at 10.) \n(Doc. 48 at 20 -21.)  \nThe Opendoor Defendants also argue that Plaintiffs’ confidential witnesses \ncorroborate the disclosures. (Doc. 60 at 10.) For example , CW 2’s statement that about \n90% of final offers  were generated by pricing analysts is consistent with Opendoor’s \ndisclosure that its final offers come after  human adjustments. CW 5’s estimate that about \n50% of initial offers were reviewed by hu mans is generally consistent with Opendoor’s \ndisclosure that most , though not all,  of its initial offers do not involve human intervention.   \nPlaintiffs, however, contend that the Opendoor Defendants’ disclosures fall short \nbecause they do not  “disclose[] that Opendoor was forced to rely on humans to price its \noffers because its algorithm could not accurately price homes  . . . [or] that [Opendoor] was \nengaged in deceptive practices  . . . that contributed to [Opendoor’s] profitability.” ( Doc. 55 \nat 17.) Additionally,  Plaintiffs argue that the “[t]he instant case is strikingly analogous to \nthe securities fraud lawsuit against Zillow  [in Jaeger , 644 F. Supp. 3d 857] , which investors \nbrought after Zillow left the iBuying business in November 2021.” (Id.) In both  cases, say \nPlaintiffs, the companies relied on extensive human involvement in their pricing \nscheme  while misleading investors into believing that their algorithms drove their \nsuccess.  (Id. at 18.) \nPlaintiffs’ arguments  are unavailing . First, Jaeger is distinguishable. There, Zillow \nsought to rapidly scale up its iBuying operation in an attempt to catch up to its competitors. \nJaeger , 644 F. Supp. 3d at 865 -66. To do so, Zillow  devised a plan that it called “Project Case 2:22-cv-01717-MTL     Document 86     Filed 02/28/24     Page 9 of 33 \n- 10 -  \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n Ketchup.” Id. In Project Ketc hup, Zillow “applied systematic overlays to drive up offers \nwell above the pricing indicated by its algorithm and pricing analysts.” Id. at 866  (internal \nmarks omitted ). Put another way, Zillow purposefully raised its offer prices well beyond \nthose generat ed by its algorithm . See i d. Publicly, Zillow presented a different picture to \ninvestors  and led them to believe that it was actively relying on its algorithm. Id. Instead , \nunder Project Ketchup, Zillow was raising the offers generated by its algorithm in an \nattempt to purchase more homes more quickly, thereby increasing its market share. Id. \nThus, Zillow’s statements were misleading. Id. \nPlaintiffs’ attempt to frame Opendoor’s conduct in a similar light is unconvincing. \nThey  allege  that, like Zillow,  Opendoor concealed its practice s of adjust ing initial offers in \nthe final offer stage  and fail ing to refund deductions made for anticipated repairs  that \nbecame unnecessary . (Doc. 39  ¶¶ 170-74; Doc. 55 at 18. ) But  unlike Project Ketchup,  \nthose practices  were sufficiently disclosed to investors  and consistent with the \nOpendoor  Defendants’ public statements. (Doc. 49 -1 at 10, 45; Doc. 49 -2 at 10, 11, 19; \nDoc.  49-3 at 10.)  \nThe Court  also finds that , even taking the facts in the light most favorable to \nPlaintiffs,  the four challenged statements are not false and would not have misled a \nreasonable investor. The Opendoor Defendants’ statement that the algorithm used \n“machine learning to drive pricing decisions” is a simple st atement about Opendoor’s use \nof AI in its pricing scheme and does not suggest that Opendoor personnel  lack any  \nsignificant role in th at process . Nor does the Opendoor Defendants’ representation that \nOpendoor’s  algorithm is “key” to the success of its busin ess model. The other two \nchallenged statements —about the algorithm’s ability to dynamically adjust and keep \nOpendoor within a 4% to 6% annual con tribution  margin —likewise would not lead \nreasonable investors to conclude that Opendoor’s entire process, from initial offer to final \noffer, was driven by its algorithm. This is especially true in light of the Opendoor \nDefendants’ disclosures.  As discussed below, however,  Plaintiffs successfully pleaded  \nthese two latter statements as misleading insofar as they sugg est that Opendoor’s algorithm Case 2:22-cv-01717-MTL     Document 86     Filed 02/28/24     Page 10 of 33 \n- 11 -  \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n was accurately estimating  and forecasting home values .  \nii. Statements Regarding Profitability  \nPlaintiffs next argue that the Opendoor Defendants misled investors by guaranteeing \nOpendoor’s  “ability to remain profitable in any housing market.” (Doc. 55 at 19.) Plaintiffs \nchallenge  the following statements:  \n• The algorithm can “dynamically adjust to leading market indicators and react to \nreal-time macro - and micro -economic conditions.” ( Doc. 39  ¶¶ 169, 177.)  \n• “[O]ur model really works in upmarkets, it’s going to work in flat markets, it’s going \nto work in downmarkets.” ( Id. ¶ 181 (spelling in original).)  \n• The algorithm’s ability to “dynamically price homes in response to both micro and \nmacro factors  [] allows [Opendoor] to manage  . . . within [a] 4% to 6%, annual \n[contribution] margin range, [] regardless of the home cycle [Opendoor is] operating \nin.” ( Id. ¶ 186.)  \n• “[I]f you run the business model through the worst recession in U.S. history, we \nwould st ill have positive contribution margin.” ( Id. ¶ 189.)  \n• Opendoor “ha[s] good evidence that [it] can operate in [a] declining market.” \n(Id. ¶ 192.)  \n• Opendoor’s “systems are doing exactly what they’re designed to do, which is \nresponding very quickly, adjusting p rices to market.” ( Id. ¶ 199.)  \n(Doc. 55 at 15, 19 -20, 23. )  \nAccording to Plaintiffs, “the algorithm never worked as Defendants claimed.” (Doc. \n55 at 20.) And, according to Plaintiffs, m any of the same confidential witness statements \ncited above support this contention. ( Supra at 8; see also Doc. 39 ¶¶ 62 -73; Doc. 55 at 22 .)  \nThe Opendoor Defendants argue that  the challenged statements are not misleading \nbecause  their many disclaimers notified  reasonable investors that the algorithm could not \nguarantee profitability . (Doc. 48 at 19 -20.) They cite the fo llowing statements from the \nOpendoor Defendants as disclosing the risk that Opendoor could incur losses : \n• “Our business is dependent upon our ability to accurately price and portfolio Case 2:22-cv-01717-MTL     Document 86     Filed 02/28/24     Page 11 of 33 \n- 12 -  \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n manage inventory and an ineffective pricing or portfolio management strategy may \nhave a material adverse effect on our business.” (Doc. 49 -1 at 10 -11.)  \n• Opendoor could “incur sig nificant losses in the future” due to its “failure to \nappropriately price and manage the home inventory [it] acquire[d].” (Doc. 49 -2 \nat 17.) \n• Opendoor “may be unable to liquidate . . . inventory at prices that allow [it] to meet \n[its] margin targets or reco ver [its] costs.” (Doc. 49 -1 at 11.)  \n• Opendoor’s “success depends, directly and indirectly, on general economic \nconditions, [and] the health of the U.S. residential real estate industry, particularly \nthe single family home resale market.” ( Id. at 7-8.) \n• “Home prices can be volatile and the values of [Opendoor’s] inventory may \nfluctuate significantly.” ( Id. at 14.)  \n• “Mortgage rates are currently low as compared to most historical periods,” and rate \nincreases “could result in a decline in the deman d for [Opendoor’s] homes” and \n“adversely affect [Opendoor’s] business or financial results.” ( Id. at 15 -16.) \n• “[C]hanging market conditions are reflected in [Opendoor’s] pricing for new \nacquisitions, largely leaving previously acquired inventory at risk to po tential \nmarket volatility.” (Doc. 49 -2 at 12.) \n(Doc. 48 at 13,  19-20.) \nPlaintiffs argue that the Opendoor Defendants’ disclosures were insufficient \nbecause (1) they did not correct the impression that the algorithm “worked in all housing \nmarkets;” and (2) they did not disclose that the algorithm already failed to accurately \nestimate home value . (Doc. 55 at 21 -22.) The first argument can be quickly dismissed. It \nstands to reason  that no reasonable investor would ever believe that a particular business \nmodel, eve n one premised on impressive technology, is guaranteed to be profitable  in all \ncircumstances .  \nPlaintiffs  also rely on statements from financial analys ts writing for  Wedbush, \nInvestorPlace, and Seeking Alpha  to argue that reasonable investors believed Opendoor ’s Case 2:22-cv-01717-MTL     Document 86     Filed 02/28/24     Page 12 of 33 \n- 13 -  \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n algorithm to guarantee  profitability . (Doc. 39  ¶¶ 96-99.) Based  on the Opendoor \nDefendants ’ allegedly misleading statements  and financial success, those  writers  reported \nfavorabl y on Opendoor ’s algorithm.  (Id.) But none of th e statements, as recited in the \nConsolidated Amended Complaint,  evidence a belief that  Opendoor’s algorithm was \nguaranteed to accurately price and forecast home values  in every housing market; instead, \nthey indicate general enthusiasm that  Opendoor’s algorithm was “best in class” and the \n“best in the business.” ( Id.) The Court cannot equate  such statements with an endorsement \nthat a particular technology is perfect or unfailing.  \nThe statements  do, however,  reflect an impression that Opendo or’s algorithm was, \nat the very least, generating roughly accurate initial offers at the time the statements were \nmade.  If the algorithm was in fact already failing to accurately estimate home values, the \nanalysts cited in the Consolidated Amended Complain t were incorrect in their impressions. \nPlaintiffs adequately allege that the analysts’ erroneous conclusions were due to  the \nOpendoor Defendants’ purportedly  misleading statements regarding the efficacy of their \nalgorithm. ( Id. ¶¶ 96 -99, 112.) Because “[t]he perceptions of analysts are an acceptable \nmeasure of what reasonable investors would have understood,” Jaeger , 644 F. Supp. 3d. at \n872, the Court finds that, taking Plaintiffs’ allegations as true, a reasonable investor would \nhave been misled by  the Opendoor Defendants’ statements into believing that Opendoor’s \nalgorithm was accurately estimating  and forecasting home  values  at the time the \nstatements  were  made . \nThe Opendoor Defendants argue  that the ir misleading  statements are nonetheless \nnon-actionable puffery. ( Doc. 48  at 24-27.) “ In the Ninth Circuit, vague, generalized \nassertions of corporate optimism or statements of mere puffing are not actionable material \nmisrepresentations under federa l securities laws because no reasonable investor would rely \non such statements.” In re Restoration Robotics, Inc. Sec. Litig. , 417 F. Supp. 3d 1242, \n1255 (N.D. Cal. 2019) (internal quotations and citations omitted).  “When valuing \ncorporations , . . . invest ors do not rely on vague statements of optimism like ‘good, ’ \n‘well-regarded, ’ or other feel good monikers. ” In re Cutera Sec. Litig. , 610 F.3d 1103, Case 2:22-cv-01717-MTL     Document 86     Filed 02/28/24     Page 13 of 33 \n- 14 -  \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n 1111 (9th Cir. 2010); see also In re Verifone Sec. Litig. , 784 F. Supp. 1471, 1481 (N.D. \nCal. 1992) (“ Profe ssional investors, and most amateur investors as well, know how to \ndevalue the optimism of corporate executives, who have a personal stake in the future \nsuccess of the company. ”). Far from being a guarantee of unshakable financial success, the \nstatements, according to the Opendoor Defendants, express ed justified corporate optimism \nof the type that courts routinely deem non -actionable puffery. ( Doc. 48  at 26 -27.)  \nThe Court finds that the Opendoor Defendants’ statements are too concrete and \nverifiable to con stitute non -actionable puffery. See e.g., Jaeger , 644 F. Supp. 3d at 872 -73. \nEach of the challenged statements are premised on a concrete, verifiable            \nsupposition —Opendoor’s algorithm, at a bare minimum, can accurately estimate  and \nforecast home values . Opendoor’s algorithm either does this  in up, flat, and down markets \nor it does not. In the face of rapid economic downturn, it either responds very quickly and \nadjusts prices to market or it does not. It is either capable of keeping Opendoor  within a \n4% to 6% contribution margin range or it i s not. These elements of concreteness and \nverifiability were not present in the cases relied upon by the Opendoor Defendants. See \nPlevy v. Haggerty , 38 F. Supp. 2d 816, 827 -28 (C.D. Cal. 1998); Hutton v. McDaniel , 264 \nF. Supp. 3d 997, 1021 (D. Ariz. 2017);  Macomb Cnty. Emps.’ Ret. Sys. v. Align Tech., Inc. , \n39 F.4th 1092, 1099 (9th Cir. 2022).   \nThus, the Court finds that these six challenged statements are actionably misleading \nbecause they would have led a reasonable investor to conclude that Opendoor’s al gorithm \nwas accurately pricing homes and adjusting to changes within the market when the \nstatements were made.   \niii. Statements Regarding Opendoor’s Business Model and the \n2019 FTC Complaint  \nPlaintiffs next argue that the Opendoor Defendants misled investors b y \nmischaracterizing its business model. (Doc. 55 at 23 -24.) The Opendoor Defendants \nclaimed that Opendoor’s “business model is designed to generate margins from \n[Opendoor’s] service charge to sellers and ancillary  products and services associated wit h Case 2:22-cv-01717-MTL     Document 86     Filed 02/28/24     Page 14 of 33 \n- 15 -  \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n a transaction, and not from the spread between acquisition price and resale price.” (Doc. \n39 ¶ 175.) Plaintiffs argue that Opendoor’s business model more heavily relied upon gains \nfrom reselling houses. They  point to a 2019 FTC complaint against Opendoor  charging  that \n“gains from selling homes for more than its offer price are a key contributor to \n[Opendoor’s] revenue.” ( Id. ¶ 150 (quoting Doc. 49 -7) (alteration in original).)  \nThe Opendoor Defendants reply that investors were fully aware that Opendoor \ngenerated revenue from reselling  homes. (Doc. 48 at 25; Doc. 60 at 17 nn.10, 13 -14.) \nSpecifically, Opendoor told investors that it “aim[ed] to maximize resale margin.” (Doc. \n49-1 at 45; see also Doc. 49 -25 at 54, 62 .) Because Opendoor adequately disclosed th at it \nsought to resell homes at a profit , the Court finds that, even taking Plaintiffs’ allegations \nas true, a reasonable investor would not  have  been misled by the challenged  statement.  \nPlaintiffs next allege that the Opendoor  Defendants misled investors by reassuring \nthem that “the allegations raised by the FTC are related to activity that occurred between \n2017 and 2019.” (Doc. 39  ¶ 196.) In fact, say Plaintiffs, the activity continued throughout \nthe Class Period. But Plaintif fs do not allege that the conduct giving rise to the  FTC \ncomplaint —allegedly misleading advertising practices —continued . (See generally Doc. \n39; see also Doc. 49 -7.) Instead, they  allege, based on the detailed statements of \nconfidential witnesses, that Opendoor personnel continued to manually adjust the \nalgorithm’s offers and charge sellers for repairs that they did not make. ( Id. ¶¶ 62 -84, \n143-49.) But Opendoor  repeatedly disclosed that people  had a role  in pricing and that repair \ncredits were estimates  for which Opendoor bore the risk o r reward o f staying within  budget . \n(See e.g., Doc. 49 -2 at 10, 11.) Therefore, the  Court finds that a reasonable investor would \nnot have been misled by this challenged  statement.  \n  2.  Scienter  \nTo state a claim under Section 10(b), Pla intiffs must make a showing of scienter, \ni.e., an intent to defraud. See Ernst & Ernst v. Hochfelder , 425 U.S. 185, 193 (1976)  \n(explaining that scienter refers to the mental state embracing an “intent to deceive, \nmanipulate, or defraud ”). “Mere negligence —even head -scratching mistakes —does not Case 2:22-cv-01717-MTL     Document 86     Filed 02/28/24     Page 15 of 33 \n- 16 -  \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n amount to fraud.” Prodanova v. H.C. Wainwright & Co., LLC , 993 F.3d 1097, 1103 \n(9th Cir. 2021).  \nRule 9(b) , moreover,  requires a plaintiff to “state with particularity the \ncircumstances constitutin g fraud.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(b).  In enacting the PSLRA, Congress \nextended Rule 9(b)’s particularity requirement to allegations of scienter. Therefore, to \nadequately plead scienter, a complaint must “state with particularity facts giving rise to a \nstrong inf erence that the defendant acted with the required state of mind.” 15 U.S.C. \n§ 78u-4(b)(2)(A). To support a strong inference of scienter, a complaint must allege that a \ndefendant made false or misleading statements with an “intent to deceive, manipulate, or  \ndefraud,” or with deliberate recklessness. City of Dearborn Heights Act 345 Police & Fire \nRet. Sys. v. Align Tech., Inc. , 856 F.3d 605, 619 (9th Cir. 2017). “Deliberate recklessness \nis not mere recklessness.” Prodanova , 993 F.3d at 1106 (internal marks an d citation \nomitted) (emphasis in original). Rather, it is “an extreme departure from the standards of \nordinary care . . . which presents a danger of misleading buyers or sellers that is [] known \nto the defendant or is so obvious  that the actor must have be en aware of  it.” Id. (emphasis \nin original).  \n These standards “present no small hurdle for the securities fraud plaintiff.” \nSchueneman v. Arena Pharms., Inc. , 840 F.3d 698, 705 (9th Cir. 2016) (citation omitted); \nsee also Nguyen v. Endologix, Inc. , 962 F.3 d 405, 414 (9th Cir. 2020) (“The PSLRA’s \nstrong inference requirement has teeth. It is an exacting pleading obligation.”) (cleaned \nup). The Court must “engage in a comparative evaluation [and] .  . . consider, not only \ninferences urged by the plaintiff .  . . but also competing inferences rationally drawn from \nthe facts alleged.” Tellabs , Inc. v. Makor Issues & Rights Ltd. , 551 U.S.  308, 314 (2007) .  \nA complaint will survive a motion to dismiss “only if a reasonable person would deem the \ninference of scienter  cogent and at least as compelling as any opposing inference one could \ndraw from the facts alleged.” Id. at 324.  \n The Opendoor Defendants argue that Plaintiffs have failed to adequately plead \nscienter. (Doc. 48 at 28 -34; Doc. 60 at 18 -23.) Plaintiffs disa gree. (Doc. 55 at 25 -32.) They Case 2:22-cv-01717-MTL     Document 86     Filed 02/28/24     Page 16 of 33 \n- 17 -  \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n respond that the  Consolidated  Amended Complaint adequately pleads scienter through five \ndifferent avenues. ( Id.) But as explained below, the Court finds to the contrary . \n   i.  Defendant  Wu’s Stock Sales  \nDefendant Wu is a co-founder of Opendoor , the former Chairman of Opendoor ’s \nBoard of Directors, and Opendoor ’s former Chief Executive  Officer . (Doc. 39 ¶ 39.) \nPlaintiffs argue that his sale of a portion of his Opendoor  stock is “highly indicative of \nscienter.” (Doc. 55 at 26; Doc. 39 ¶¶ 239 -47.) Setting aside the question of whether a single \ndefendant’s trading can establish a strong inference of scienter for a group of \nco-defendants, the Court finds that Defendant Wu’s  sales do not even establish a strong \ninference of scienter as to him.  \n “‘To evaluate suspiciousness of stock stales, [the Court] consider[s], inter alia , \nthree factors: (1) the amount and percentage of shares sold; (2) timing of the sales; and (3) \nconsis tency with prior trading history.’” In re Quality Sys., Inc. Sec. Litig. , 865 F.3d 1130, \n1146 (9th Cir. 2017) (quoting Nursing Home Pension Fund, Loc. 144 v. Oracle Corp. , 380 \nF.3d 1226, 1232 (9th Cir. 2004)).  \nFirst, the amount and percentage of shares so ld by Defendant Wu do not indicate \nscienter. Plaintiffs allege that, between November 16 and 18, 2021, Defendant Wu sold 7% \nof his Opendoor stock. (Doc. 39 ¶ 239; see also Doc. 55 at 29.) They concede that this is a \nrelatively small percentage but argue th at “even sales of a relatively small percentage of an \ninsider’s holdings can support an inference of scienter if the absolute dollar value of the \ntransactions is high.” (Doc. 55 at 29 .) For example, Plaintiffs rely upon In re SeeBeyond  \nTechnologies Corp. Securities Litigation , 266 F. Supp. 2d 1150  (C.D. Cal. 2003) \n(hereinafter “ In re SeeBeyond ”). But In re SeeBeyond is readily distinguishable, as the \ncourt’s decision relied on the fact that the “defendants  . . . admittedly lied  to analysts and \ninvestors.” 266 F. Supp. 2d at 1169. Not so here. Additionally , the Court finds  that courts \nwithin the N inth Circuit routinely find that sales of similarly small percentage s of \ndefendant s’ stock holdings do not give rise to a strong inference of scienter . See e.g., In re \nAlteryx, Inc. Sec. Litig. , No. 8:20 -cv-01540 DOC (JDEx), 2021 WL 4551201, at *4 (C.D. Case 2:22-cv-01717-MTL     Document 86     Filed 02/28/24     Page 17 of 33 \n- 29 -  \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n Sientra, Inc. , No. CV 15 -07548 SJO (RAOx), 2016 WL 3360676 (C.D. Cal. June 9, 2016) , \nthe court expressly found that the plaintiffs’ fraud claims were based on “unique, \nparticularized facts.”  Id. at *17. Not so here. Accordingly, the Court applies Rule 9(b) to \nPlaintiffs’ Section  11 claims.  \n  2.  Actionable False or Misleading Statements  \nDefendants argue that Plaintiffs’ Section 11 claim s fail because Plaintiffs again  do \nnot allege that Defendants made any actionable false or misleading statements. ( Doc. 48 at \n21-28; Doc. 51 at 9 -17; Doc. 60 at 7 n.3; Doc. 62 at 9 -16.) In response, Plaintiffs point to \nseveral categories of statements made by Defendants in Opendoor’s offering documents \nalleged to be false or misleading. (Doc. 56 at 15 -21.) For the foregoing reasons, the Court \nfinds that one of the challe nged statements was misleading.  \ni. Statements Regarding the Pricing Algorithm’s Efficacy \nand Role  \n Plaintiffs object to two statements made in Opendoor’s offering documents: first, \nthat Opendoor’s “algorithms use machine learning to drive pricing decisions;”  second, that \nthe algorithm “can dynamically adjust to leading market indicators and react to real -time \nmacro - and micro -economic conditions.” (Doc. 39 ¶¶ 402, 410; Doc. 56 at 15.) They \ncontend that the statements “were false and misleading because they le d investors to \nbelieve that advancements in [Opendoor’s] algorithm drove [Opendoor’s] pricing \ndecisions and allowed Opendoor to ‘dynamically adjust’ to changing housing markets, \nwhen in reality, [Opendoor’s] algorithm was already inaccurate and [Opendoor’s ] pricing \ndecisions were driven by an undisclosed human -driven process.” (Doc. 56 at 17.)  \n The Court has already addressed whether these statements were  false or misleading \nin the Section 10(b) context. ( Supra at 7-14.) For the same reasons, the Court find s that \nthe first statement was not false or misleading, while the second statement was. (See \nsupra  at id.)  \n   ii.  Statements Regarding the Pricing Algorithm’s Importance  \n Plaintiffs next challenge the offering documents’ statement that Opendoor’s Case 2:22-cv-01717-MTL     Document 86     Filed 02/28/24     Page 29 of 33 \n- 30 -  \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n “proprietary, machine learning -based pricing models are key to [ its] ability to acquire and \nresell thousands of homes per month accurately, profitably, and with increasing levels of \nautomation.” (Doc. 39 ¶¶ 405, 412; Doc . 56 at 19.) According to Plaintiffs, that statement \n“was false and misleading because it led investors to believe that [Opendoor’s] pricing \nalgorithm was key to its profitability, when in reality, the algorithm was inaccurate, and \n[Opendoor’s] profitabili ty was driven by deceptive practices and a hot housing market.” \n(Doc. 56 at 19.)  \n The Court also considered whether this statement was false or misleading in the \nSection 10(b) context. ( Supra at 7-11.) Here, and for the same reasons, it finds that the \nstatement was not false or misleading.  (See supra at id.)  \n   iii.  Statements Regarding Opendoor’s Business Model  \n Plaintiffs finally challenge the offering documents’ statement that Opendoor’s \n“busines s model is designed to generate margins from [its] service charge to sellers and \nancillary products and services associated with a transaction, and not from the spread \nbetween acquisition price and resale price.” (Doc. 39 ¶¶ 407, 414; Doc. 56 at 20 -21.) \nPlaintiffs allege that the statement was false and misleading because, considered alongside \n“the other false and misleading statements in the offering documents, it led investors to \nbelieve that Opendoor’s business model was disrupting the real estate market , when in \nreality, Opendoor’s purportedly tech -based business was nothing more than a traditional \nreal estate company that bought low and sold high.” (Doc. 56 at 21  (cleaned up). ) \n For the reasons articulated in the Court’s discussion of the same challenge d \nstatement in the Section 10(b) discussion , the Court finds that the statement was not false \nor misleading. ( Supra at 14-15.)  \n  3.  Negative Causation  \nPlaintiffs’ claims under Section 11 do not require proof of loss causation. Hildes v. \nArthur Andersen L LP, 734 F.3d 854, 8 59 (9th Cir. 2013) ( “[Plaintiffs] need only show a \nmaterial misstatement or omission to establish [a] prima facie case.”). Defendants may \navoid liability by establishing that the alleged losses “are not attributable to the alleged Case 2:22-cv-01717-MTL     Document 86     Filed 02/28/24     Page 30 of 33 \n- 31 -  \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n misrep resentations or omission in the registration statement.” Id. at 860.  This affirmative \ndefense is known as “negative causation.” Id. \nA defendant raising the negative causation defense bears the burden of proof, and it \nis a “heavy burden.” Id. They “must show that the depreciation in value of a plaintiff’s \nstock resulted from factors other than the alleged material misstatement.” Id. (internal \nquotations omitted). Additionally, “[b]ecause an analysis of causation is often \nfact-intensive, negative causation is generally established by a defendant on a motion for \nsummary judgment or at trial .” In re Countrywide , 588 F. Supp. 2d at 1171.  \n As analyzed above, the Court finds that none of the purported corrective disclosures \ncited by Plaintiffs in their briefs withstand scrutiny. Courts within the Ninth Circuit and \nelsewhere  have found  negative causation established where the defendants have \ndemonstrated that the plaintiffs failed to allege a corrective disclosure  or any other \nindication of loss causation . See e.g., Brown v. Ambow Educ. Holding Ltd. , No. CV \n12-5062 PSG (AJWx), 2014 WL 523166, at *16 (C.D. Cal. Feb. 6, 2014) (collecting cases). \nAnd while, in some instances, it may be appropriate to reserve the issue for a later time, \nthe Court concludes that postponing the issue would serve no legitimate purpose . See id.  at \n*14 (“While the loss causation analysis is fact intensive and often mo re appropriate at the \nsummary judgment phases, courts in the Ninth Circuit routinely apply Rule 12(b)(6) when \nthe face of the complaint demonstrates that the plaintiff cannot establish loss causation.”). \nHere , the Court finds that Defendants have establish ed negative causation  because they \nhave demonstrated that Plaintiffs do not allege a corrective disclosure  or any other \nindication of loss causation in their Consolidated Amended Complaint.  \nFor these reasons, t he Court finds that Plaintiffs’ claims against Defendants brought \npursuant to Section 11 fail.  \n C.  Section s 15 and 20(a)  \nA claim under Section 15 of the Securities Act is a derivative claim: it “require[s] \n[an] underlying primary violation[] of the securities laws.” See In re Rigel , 697 F.3d at 886; Case 2:22-cv-01717-MTL     Document 86     Filed 02/28/24     Page 31 of 33 \n- 32 -  \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n see also 15 U.S.C. §  77o. \nSimilarly, Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act “imposes liability on certain \ncontrolling individuals .  . . for violations of [S]ection 10(b) and its underlying regulations.” \nProdanova v. H.C. Wainwright & Co., LLC , 993 F.3d 1097, 1113 (9th Cir. 2021) (internal \nmarks and citation omitted).  To state a claim of control person liability under Section 20(a), \na plaintiff must demonstrate “a primary violation of federal securities law” and that “the \ndefendant exercised actual power or control over the primary violator.” Zucco , 552 \nF.3d at 990.  \n Because  Plaintiffs fail to plead a primary violation of Sections 10(b) or 11 , the \nSections 15 and 20(a) control person claims necessarily fail.  \nIV.  LEAVE TO AMEND  \nPlaintiffs “request leave to replead.” (Doc. 56 at 23 n.9; see also Doc. 55 at 38 n.17.)  \nDistrict courts “shall grant leave to amend freely ‘when justice so requires.’” Lopez v. \nSmith , 203 F.3d 1122, 1130 (9th Cir. 2000) (en banc) (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 15 (a)). \nCourts in the Ninth Circuit are to apply this policy “with extreme liberality.” Moro ngo \nBand of Mission Indians v. Rose , 893 F.2d 1074, 1079 (9th Cir. 1990). The Court, however, \n“may in its discretion deny leave to amend due to undue delay, bad faith or dilatory \nmotive  . . . , repeated failure to cure deficiencies  . . . , undue prejudice to the opposing party \nby virtue of the allowance of the amendment, [and] futility of amendment.” Zucco , F.3d at \n1007. Absent a “strong showing of any of [these] factors, there exists a presumption  under \nRule 15(a) in favor of granting leave to amend.” Emin ence Capital, LLC v. Aspeon, Inc. , \n316 F.3d 1048, 1052 (9th Cir. 2003)  (emphasis in original).  \nIt is not clear to the Court that any further amendment to Plaintiffs’  Consolidated  \nAmended Complaint would be futile. See Eminence Capital , 316 F.3d at 1052 (reasoning \nthat dismissal with prejudice and “without leave to amend is not appropriate unless it is \nclear on de novo review that the complaint could not be saved by amendment”). Thus, \nPlaintiffs will be granted leave to file a Second  Consolidated  Amended Complaint.

    "summary": "**1. Summary:**  \nIn this case, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) brought action against Empire Holdings Group LLC and its officer, Peter Prusinowski, accusing them of making false and misleading earnings claims about their self-study programs and business opportunities. The case resulted in a stipulated preliminary injunction agreed upon by all parties, ordering the defendants to cease deceptive practices, preserve assets, and appoint a receiver to manage their business affairs. The case highlights the misrepresentation of using artificial intelligence (AI) to maximize revenues as one of the misleading claims involved.\n\n**2. Key Legal Issue:**  \nWhether Empire Holdings Group LLC and Peter Prusinowski violated the FTC Act and related rules by making false earnings claims, failing to disclose important information, and using non-disparagement clauses, thereby engaging in unfair or deceptive acts or practices.\n\n**3. Court's Holding:**  \nThe court issued a stipulated preliminary injunction prohibiting defendants from making unsubstantiated earnings claims, misrepresenting AI capabilities, enforcing non-disparagement clauses, and ordered the freezing of their assets, appointment of a receiver, and preservation of business records.\n\n**4. ELI5 Explanation:**  \nThe court case is about a government agency (FTC) suing a company because they told people they could make a lot of money using the company’s products, but those promises weren't true. The company also claimed its services used smart technology to make more money, which wasn't the case. The judge told the company to stop making these claims, froze its money, and assigned someone to watch over its activities to make sure the company isn't hiding anything or hurting more people.",

(Document No. 19). \nEach of the above-named Defendants has been properly served with a summons , the Complaint , \nand the Temporary Restraining Order, and Plaintiff and Defendants stipulate to the entry of this \nStipulated Preliminary Injunction. \nWHEREAS , Plaintiff and Defendants negotiated and reached a stipulation as to the form \nof such a Preliminary Injunction. \nTHEREFORE, IT IS STIPULATED AND ORDERED as follows: \nFINDINGS OF FACT \nThe Court, having considered the Complaint , the Motion for a Temporary Restraining \nOrder, declarations, exhibits, and the memorandum of points and authorities filed in support \nthereof, and being otherwise advised, finds that: \nA. This Court has jurisdiction over the subject matter of this case, and there is good \ncause to believe that it will have jurisdiction over all parties hereto and that venue in this District \n1s proper. \nB. In numerous instances, Defendants , in the advertising , marketing , and selling of \ntheir self-study programs and business opportunities (Defendants' Products and Services), with \nPlaintiff alleging they have violated the FTC Act and rules governing their conduct. Specifically , \nDefendants have (I) made false, misleading , or unsubstantiated earnings claims , (2) violated \nmultiple trade regulation rule provisions in selling Defendants ' Products and Services, and (3) \n2 8:24-mc-00412-UNA     Doc # 2     Filed: 11/13/24     Page 2 of 33 - Page ID # <pageID>Case 2:24-cv-04949-WB Document 49 Filed 11/08/24 Page 3 of 60 \nviolated the law by using non-disparagement clauses to discourage purchasers from publishing \ntruthful reviews about Defendants and Defendants' Products and Services. \nC. There is good cause based on Plaintiff's allegations to believe that Defendants \nhave engaged in and are likely to engage in acts or practices that violate Section 5(a) of the FTC \nAct, 15 U.S.C. § 45(a); the FTC's Trade Regulation Rule entitled \"Disclosure Requirements and \nProhibitions Concerning Business Opportunities\" (\"Business Opportunity Rule\" or \"Rule\"), 16 \nC.F.R. Part 437, as amended ; and the Consumer Review Fairness Act (\"CRFA\") , 15 U.S.C. § \n45b, and the Plaintiff is therefore likely to prevail on the merits of this action. As demonstrated \nby the evidence contained in the FTC's exrubits, the FTC established a likelihood of success in \nshowing that Defendants have made false, misleading , or unsubstantiated statements ; engaged in \nother unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the advertising, marketing, and sale of Defendants ' \nProducts and Services; and violated the Business Opportunity Rule and CRF A. \nD. There is good cause to believe that Defendants have taken at least$ 14 million \nfrom consumers in connection with their unlawful practices. \nE. There is good cause to believe that immediate and irreparable harm will result \nfrom Defendants' ongoing violations of the FTC Act, the Business Opportunity Rule, and the \nCRFA unless Defendants are restrained and enjoined by order of this Court. \nF. There is good cause to believe that immediate and irreparable damage to the \nCourt's ability to grant effective final relief for consumers-including monetary restitution , \nrescission, or refunds-will occur from the sale, transfer, destruction , or other disposition or \nconcealment by Defendants of their assets or records, unless Defendants are immediately \nrestrained and enjoined by order of this Court. \nG.

Weighing the equities and considering Plaintiff's likelihood of ultimate success \non the merits, a preliminary injunction with an asset freeze, the continued receivership , expedited \ndiscovery, and other equitable relief is in the public interest. \nI. This Court has authority to issue this Order pursuant to Sections l 3(b) and 19 of \nthe FTC Act, 15 U.S.C. § 53(b); Fed. R. Civ. P. 65; and the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1651. \nJ.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: In this class action lawsuit, Intrusion Inc. was accused of making false claims about its cybersecurity product, \"Intrusion Shield,\" to artificially inflate its stock price. The product reportedly used AI tools to block cyber threats, but it allegedly failed to perform as promised. The parties reached a settlement of $3,250,000, which the court approved. The proposed settlement was deemed fair, considering the complexities of the case and the potential risks of litigation.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: The key legal issue was whether Intrusion Inc. violated securities laws by making false and misleading statements about its product to inflate its stock price, thus committing fraud on the market.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court approved the settlement agreement as fair, reasonable, and adequate. It certified the class, dismissed the case with prejudice, and awarded attorney's fees and expenses to the lead plaintiff and class counsel.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine your friend's company promised that their new app could block all the bad stuff on the internet because it uses super-smart technology (AI). People got excited and bought lots of shares in the company, making the share price skyrocket. But later, it turned out the app didn't work as well as promised and the share prices dropped. People who lost money sued the company, and in the end, they all agreed on a sum of money ($3.25 million) to settle the case. This means the company puts some money aside to compensate those who bought shares and lost money, without admitting they did anything wrong.",

Joe Head,1 Gary Davis, and James Gero (collectively, “Intrusion”), \non the other.  \n The Court also GRANTS Lead Counsel’s Motion for Award of Attorneys’ Fees \nand Reimbursement of Expenses. (Dkt.  #66).  \nI. BACKGROUND  \n Bronstein and Intrusion have agreed to settle the  claims  in this consolidated \nclass action for $3,250,000.00. The proposed settlement arises from more than a year \nof litigation surrounding Intrusion’s alleged  efforts to artificially boost its share price \nthrough misrepresentations regarding a new cybersecurity product: “Intrusion \nShield.” After obtaining preliminary approval of the proposed class settlement on \nAugust 17, 2022,  Bronstein and class counsel now seek final approval and an award \nof attorney’s fees and expenses.  \nA. Intrusion’s Efforts to Artificially Boost Its S hare  Price  \n Intrusion is a publicly traded cybersecurity company.  In the summer of 2020, \nit developed a new product that would supposedly “ revolutionize the  [network \nsecurity ] industry. ” (Dkt.  #38 ¶ 58). Intrusion described this new product, Intrusion \nShield, as blocking cyberthreats more effectively  than existing technologies on the \nmarket because it combined state -of-of the -art artificial intelligence tools with a \nproprietary database of 2.7 billion malicious IP addresses. (Dkt.  #38 ¶¶ 46, 58).  \n \n 1 The Amended Class Action Complaint, (Dkt.  #38), names “P. Joe Head” as a \nDefendant as opposed to “T. Joe Head.” This Order references  the Defendant as T. Joe Head \nbecause that is the name used in the Unopposed Motion f or Final Approval of Class Action \nSettlement. (Dkt.  #65).   Case 4:21-cv-00307-SDJ     Document 74     Filed 12/16/22     Page 2 of 34 PageID #: \n<pageID>3 \n  Intrusion Shield was marketed  through promotional videos  published on the \ninternet , investor calls, government  filings, and press releases. See, e.g. , (Dkt.  #38 \n¶¶ 47–48, 58, 60, 67 ). In one press release, for example, Intrusion announced that \nduring beta testing with thirteen companies  Intrusion Shield had suc cessfully \nblocked  more than 75 million cyberthreats emanating from over 800,000 unique \nmalicious entities. (Dkt.  #38 ¶ 60). In another press release,  Intrusion allegedly  \nasserted  that the product  could prevent “zero -day” attacks: in other words, attacks \nthat exploit previously unknown cybersecurity weaknesses. (Dkt.  #38 ¶¶  42, 65). \n These representations allegedly boosted Intrusion’s stock price to over $28.00 \nper share  by April 2021.  (Dkt.  #38 ¶ 125). But within a few months, Intrusion’s stock \nprice dropped to under $4.00 per share. (Dkt.  #38 ¶ 11). Bronstein alleges that the \nstock price dropped because Intrusion Shield did not perform as investors expected. \nFar from revolutionizing the  industry, it merely repackaged existing products. \n(Dkt.  #38 ¶ 2). And instead of shutting down cyberthreats, it shut down customer \ncomputer networks. (Dkt.  #38 ¶  7). Bronstein also alleges that, based on employee \nreports and third- party research, Intrusion’s representatio ns about the product were \nnot just false but knowingly false and calculated to boost Intrusion’s stock price ahead \nof a potential sale. See, e.g. , (Dkt.  #38 ¶¶ 1, 3, 8, 41, 119– 24).  \nB. The Resulting Class Action Litigation  \n Intrusion’s alleged misrepresenta tions regarding Intrusion Shield gave rise to \ntwo federal securities class actions  in this Court:  one filed in April 2021 , and the other  \nfiled in May of the same year. (Dkt.  #1, #31). After consolidating  these cases , \n(Dkt.  #31),  appoint ing Bronstein  as Lead Plaintiff, (Dkt.  #32 at 6–7), and appoint ing Case 4:21-cv-00307-SDJ     Document 74     Filed 12/16/22     Page 3 of 34 PageID #: \n<pageID>4 \n The Rosen Law Firm, P.A.  as class counsel  (and Steckler Wayne Cochran Cherry, \nPLLC as liaison counsel),  (Dkt.  #32 at 6 –7), the Court ordered Bronstein to file an \namended complaint. (Dkt.  #37).  \n Bronstein filed the amended complaint  on February 7,  2022 , asserting t wo \ncauses of action under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 : (1) violation of Section \n10(b) against all Defendants; and (2) violation of Section 20(a) against the individual \nDefendants.  (Dkt.  #38).  The amended complaint asserted damages against Intrusion \nunder a “fraud- on-the-market” theory —seeking to hold the comp any responsible for \nartificially  boosting  its share price through alleged misstatements regarding \nIntrusion Shield . (Dkt.  #38 ¶¶  11, 125 –29); see also Halliburton Co.  v. Erica P. John \nFund, Inc. , 573  U.S. 258, 268, 134 S.Ct. 2398, 189  L. Ed. 2d 339 (2014) .   \n Class counsel diligently litigated the case, achieving a proposed class \nsettlement in June 2022.  (Dkt.  #51). Class counsel’s efforts to secure the proposed \nsettlement included an extensive pre- suit investigation, consultations with damages \nexper ts, negotiations with opposing counsel, and participation in a full- day \nmediation.  (Dkt.  #65-2 ¶ 32).   \nC. The Proposed Class Action Settlement  \n The proposed class settlement disposes of all claims in this consolidated class \naction  for $3,250,000.00. The propo sed class settlement value represents 7.61% of the \nmaximum possible damages that could have been recovered at trial , according to \nBronstein’s damages calculations . (Dkt.  #65 at 19); (Dkt.  #65-2 ¶ 21).   \n The proposed class settlement  disposes of all claims  in this consolidated class \naction  not only between Bronstein and Intrusion, but also between Intrusion and the Case 4:21-cv-00307-SDJ     Document 74     Filed 12/16/22     Page 4 of 34 PageID #: \n<pageID>5 \n proposed class members. The proposed class includes any  person or entity  who \npurchased (or otherwise acquired)  Intrusion stock between Oct ober 14, 2020,  and \nAugust 26, 2021. (Dkt. #38 ¶ 1). Under the proposed settlement, each class member \nwould receive  a pro rata share of the settlement fund based on the number of shares \npurchased during the relevant period, accounting for both the purchase price and the \nsale price.  (Dkt.  55-1 at 7–10); (Dkt.  #65 at  24).   \n Following  the Court’s  preliminary approval of the proposed class action \nsettlement on  August 17, 2022,  (Dkt.  #56),  Bronstein diligently notified the potential \nclass members of the proposed settlement. P otential class members were notified by \nseveral  methods —including postcard notice , email notice, and a published summary \nnotice2—resulting in delivery of notices to nearly 29,000 potential class members. \n(Dkt.  #72-1 ¶ 3). Over 1,000 potential class members responded to the notice. \nSignificantly, no class members objected to the proposed settlement.  (Dkt.  #72-1 ¶ 8).  \nAnd only two class members requested exclusion from th e proposed settlement. \n(Dkt.  #72-1 ¶ 7). Those two requests are invalid, however, because they did not \ncomply with basic requirements for submitting a request for exclusion. (Dkt.  #72-1 \n¶ 7).    \n Bronstein now moves for final approval of the proposed  class  settlement and \nfor attorney’s fees and expenses.  (Dkt.  #65, #66).  Intrusion does not oppose these \nmotions. The Court held a settlement fairness hearing on November 30 , 2022,  to \n \n 2 These notices were delivered through a third- party administrator. The administrator \nalso maintained a webpage and toll -free line to inform class members of the settlement and \ninstruct them on submitting claims. (Dkt.  #72-1 ¶¶ 5 –6). Case 4:21-cv-00307-SDJ     Document 74     Filed 12/16/22     Page 5 of 34 PageID #: \n<pageID>6 \n evaluate the proposed settlement’s fairness, reasonableness, and adequacy to all class \nmembers. (Dkt.  #73). No class members appeared at the hearing. The November 9, \n2022,  deadline for objecting to the proposed class settlement or requesting exclusion \nfrom  it has passed. (Dkt.  #56 ¶ 37).  \nII. LEGAL STANDARD  \n The Court’s responsibilities in evaluating a class action settlement run not only \nto the named parties, but also to the unnamed class members. The Court must ensure \nthat the class members receive adequate notice of the settlement and an opportunity \nto object or request exclusion from it . FED. R. CIV. P. 23(e)(1);  Pettway  v. Am. Cast \nIron Pipe Co. , 576 F.2d 1157, 1219 (5th  Cir. 1978) . The Court also must ensure that \nthat the settlement is “fair, reasonable, and adequate” to the class members under \nthe four factors  enumerated in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(e)(2) : (1) adequacy \nof the representation,  (2) fairness of the negotiations (i.e., whether  the negotiations \nwere at arm’s length), (3) adequacy of the relief , and (4) equitability of treatment to  \nclass members . The adequacy of relief factor turns on several considerations , \nincluding  the risks of proceeding to trial.3 FED. R. CIV. P. 23(e)(2)(C).  \n In addition to the nonexclusive Rule 23 factors, courts in this c ircuit  often  \nconsider the Reed  factors in evaluating the fairness, reasonableness, and adequacy of \na proposed class settlement: “ (1) the existence of fraud or collusion  behind t he \n \n 3 The Rule 23 factors were added by amendment in 2018. According to the Advisory \nCommittee, these factors do not “displace any factor”  sanctioned by the circuit courts. F ED. \nR. CIV. P. 23(e)(2) Advisory Committee’s Note to 2018 Amendments. Instead, they were added \nto “focus the court and the lawyers on the core concerns of procedure and substance that \nshould guide the decision whether to approve the proposal .” Id.   Case 4:21-cv-00307-SDJ     Document 74     Filed 12/16/22     Page 6 of 34 PageID #: \n<pageID>7 \n settlement ; (2) the complexity, expense, and likely duration of the litigation; (3) the \nstage of the proceedings  and the amount of discovery completed ; (4) the probability of \nplaintiffs’ success  on the merits ; (5) the range of possible recovery; and (6)  the \nopinions of class counsel, class representatives, and absent class members. ” Reed  v. \nGen. Motors Corp. , 703  F.2d 170, 172 (5th  Cir. 1983)  (citations omitted) ; ODonnell v. \nHarris Cty ., No. 16 -CV-1414, 2019 WL 6219933, at *9 (S.D. Tex. Nov. 21, 2019) \n(observing that “courts in this circuit often combine [the Rule 23 and Reed factors] in \nanalyzing class settlements.” ). \nIII. DISCUSSION  \n The Court finds that the motion for final approval of the proposed class \nsettlement should be granted. The propos ed settlement is fair, reasonable, and \nadequate to the class members. The class members each received adequate notice of \nthe settlement and the settlement will be effectively distributed through the plan of \nallocation. The Court therefore certifies the proposed class, approves the class \nsettlement, and awards Bronstein and class counsel  the requested attorney’s fees and \nexpenses.   \nA. The Proposed Class Settlement Is Fair, Reasonable, and Adequate.  \n The proposed class settlement is fair, reasonable, and adequate under both the \nRule 23 and Reed factors.  \ni. Adequacy of Class Representation  \n The record establishes that Bronstein and class  counsel adequately \nrepresented the settlement class in litigatin g this complex securities case and in \nnegotiating the proposed settlement agreement. Bronstein is an Intrusion securities Case 4:21-cv-00307-SDJ     Document 74     Filed 12/16/22     Page 7 of 34 PageID #: \n<pageID>8 \n investor who suffered the same alleged injuries as the other class members. His \nmotivations are therefore aligned with the other class  members, reducing the \nlikelihood of a conflict of interest. In re Polaroid ERISA Litig. , 240  F.R.D. 65, 77 \n(S.D.N.Y. 2006)  (“Where plaintiffs and class members share the common goal of \nmaximizing recovery, there is no conflict of interest between the clas s representatives \nand other class members.”). Bronstein also actively participated in the case by \ncommunicating with counsel and participating in settlement negotiations , further \ndemonstrating the adequacy of his representation.  (Dkt.  #65-5 ¶¶ 3– 7).  \n Class counsel diligently prosecuted the case on behalf of the class. In addition \nto drafting pleadings and negotiating the settlement agreement, counsel also \ninvestigated the claims, retained a private investigator, consulted with damages \nexperts, drafted deta iled mediation statements, and participated in a full -day \nmediation. (Dkt.  #65-2 ¶ 32). Counsel was competent and informed and ably \nrepresented not only Bronstein, but also the proposed class. See Hays v. Eaton Grp. \nAttorneys, LLC , No. CV 17-88-JWD -RLB, 2019 WL 427331, at *9 (M.D.  La. Feb. 4, \n2019) ( approving class settlement agreement negotiated by “a law firm with \nsubstantial experience in litigating complex class actions ”).  \nii. Arm’s Length Negotiations, Fraud, and Collusion  \n The propos ed settlement agreement is not the product of fraud or collusion; \ninstead, it arises from extensive arm’s length negotiations between sophisticated counsel. The parties entered the proposed settlement agreement after a full -day \nmediation —which  “suggests th e settlement was not the result of improper dealings.”  \nErica P. John Fund, Inc.  v. Halliburton Co. , No. 3:02 -CV-1152- M, 2018 WL 1942227, Case 4:21-cv-00307-SDJ     Document 74     Filed 12/16/22     Page 8 of 34 PageID #: \n<pageID>9 \n at *4 (N.D.  Tex. Apr. 25, 2018).  The mediator , Jed D. Melnick,  had substantial \nexperience mediating complex securities actions, lending further support to the \nagreement’s legitimacy. See Gordon  v. Vanda Pharm. Inc. , No. 19 -CV-1108, 2022 WL \n4296092, at *4 (E.D.N.Y.  Sept. 15, 2022) (holding that mediation conducted by Jed D. \nMelnick, “a highly qualified mediator [,] strongly supports a finding that the \nnegotiations were conducted at  arm’s length without  collusion ”); In re China Med. \nCorp. Sec. Litig. , No. 8:11 -1061- JLS, 2014 WL 12581781, at *5 (C.D.  Cal. Jan.  7, 2014) \n(“Mr. Melnick ’s involvement in the settlement supports the argument that it is non -\ncollusive.”). In any event, the Court may presume the absence of any fraud or \ncollusion when, as here, no evidence has been presented to the contrary.  See Welsh  v. \nNavy Fed. Credit Union , No. 16 -CV-1062, 2018 WL 7283639, at *12 (W.D.  Tex. Aug. \n20, 2018)  (“The Court may . . . presume that no fraud or collusion occurred between \nopposing counsel in the absence of any evidence to the contrary.”) . \niii. Adequacy of Relief ; Expected Complexity, Expense, and Duration \nof the Litigation  \n The proposed settlement agreement provides adequate relief to the class. True, \nthe proposed $3,250,000.00 settlement represents only 7. 61% of the total recovery \nthat class members could have obtained at trial based on Bronstein’s damages model.  \n(Dkt.  #65 at 19); (Dkt.  #65-2 ¶ 21).  But federal courts have long recognized that, when \nfaced with the expense and unpredictability of ongoing litigation, it often makes good \nsense to settle for ev en small fractions of the total amount in controversy. Ayers v. \nThompson , 358 F.3d 356, 369 (5th Cir. 2004) (observing that settling “avoids the risks \nand burdens of potentially protracted litigation”).  Case 4:21-cv-00307-SDJ     Document 74     Filed 12/16/22     Page 9 of 34 PageID #: \n<pageID>10 \n  That is especially true when the case involves compl ex issues like those \npresented in this consolidated securities class action. Securities claims are \nparticularly  “difficult to prove ” because of the high bar for  establishing falsity an d \nscienter. Stott v. Capital Fin. Servs., Inc. , 277 F.R.D. 316, 343 (N.D . Tex. 2011); \nFishoff v. Coty Inc. , No. 09 -CV-628, 2010 WL 305358, at *2 (S.D.N.Y.  Jan. 25, 2010) \n(“[T]he element of scienter is often the most difficult and controversial aspect of a \nsecurities fraud claim.”), aff’d , 634 F.3d 647 (2d Cir. 2011). A trial w ould therefore \nlikely be “lengthy, burdensome, and  would  consume tremendous time and resources.” \nHays, 2019 WL 427331, at * 10. After the trial concluded, the losing party would likely \nappeal the judgement, causing further delay and additional expense.  \n Because any future recovery would be burdensome and unpredictable, \nBronstein opted for a settlement that is immediate and guaranteed. That settlement \nwill adequately and fairly compensate the class. This settlement is  also in line with \nother class settlement  agreements that have been approved by federal courts.4 See, \ne.g., Erica P. John Fund, Inc.  v. Halliburton Co. , No. 3:02 -CV-1152- M, 2018 WL \n1942227, at *5 (N.D.  Tex. Apr. 25, 2018)  (observing that courts frequently approve \nclass action settlements even when the settlement amount is a small fraction of what  \nclass plaintiffs could recover at trial ); City of Omaha Police & Fire Ret. Sys. v. LHC \nGrp., No. CIV. 6:12 -1609, 2015 WL 965696, at *7 (W.D. La. Mar. 3, 2015) (“The typical \nrecovery in  most class actions generally is three -to-six cents on the dollar.”).  \n \n 4 As explained below, see infra Part III(D), the proposed settlement is also adequate \nconsidering “the terms of any proposed award of attorney’s fees.” F ED. R. CIV. P. \n23(e)(2)(C)(i ii).   Case 4:21-cv-00307-SDJ     Document 74     Filed 12/16/22     Page 10 of 34 PageID #: \n<pageID>11 \n  The proposed settlement is adequate not only in its amount  considering the \nrisks of proceeding to trial , but also in two additional ways contemplated in Rule 23’s \nadequacy factor:  \n First , the proposed settlement’s  allocation plan distributes the settlement fund \nthrough a reasonable process. Counsel has retained a third -party administrator to \nprocess the claims, assist claimants in curing deficiencies, and distribute funds on a \npro rata b asis. (Dkt.  #72-1). The Court finds that the proposed distribution process \nwill adequately deliver settlement funds to the class members.  \n Second , the proposed settlement is reasonable considering any agreements \nmade in connection with the proposed settle ment . Although Intrusion may terminate \nthe proposed settlement under a confidential agreement if enough class members \nrequest exclusion from it, (Dkt.  #50 at 14– 15), the Court finds that this agreement is \nfair under the circumstances and does not undermine  the adequacy of the proposed \nsettlement’s relief to the class. See Erica P. John F und, Inc. , 2018 WL 1942227, at * 1, \n5 (approving a class settlement with a similar confidentiality provision ). The parties \nhave also filed a stipulation that publicly discloses the proposed settlement’s terms. \n(Dkt.  #55).  \niv. Equitable Distribution  \n The proposed settlement’s allocation plan equitably distributes proceeds \nbetween the class members. When an allocat ion plan is “formulated by competent \nand experienced counsel,” it will generally be upheld if it is supported by a “reasonable, rational basis.” In re IMAX Sec. Litig. , 283 F.R.D. 178, 192 \n(S.D.N.Y. 2012) (quotations omitted).  Case 4:21-cv-00307-SDJ     Document 74     Filed 12/16/22     Page 11 of 34 PageID #: \n<pageID>12 \n  Here, the allocation plan is  supported by a reasonable basis. It was developed \nwith the assistance of a damages consultant and provides each class member a pro \nrata share of the settlement fund based on the number of shares purchased during \nthe relevant period. (Dkt.  #55-1 at 7–10); (Dkt.  #65 at  24). In calculating each class \nmember’s pro rata share of the settlement fund, the allocation plan accounts for the timing and price of each purchase, as well as the timing and price of any eventual \nsale, as is common in securities class actio ns. See, e.g. , City of Omaha Police & Fire \nRet. Sys. , 2015 WL 965693, at *15 (approving a class action allocation plan in which \neach class member would receive a pro rata share of a recognized loss); N.Y. State \nTeachers’ Ret. Sys.  v. Gen. Motors Co. , 315 F .R.D. 226, 241 (E.D.  Mich. 2016), aff’d \nsub nom. Marro  v. N.Y. State Teachers’ Ret. Sys. , No. 16 -1821, 2017 WL 6398014 \n(6th Cir. Nov. 27, 2017) (collecting cases approving similar allocation plans).  \nv. Stage of Proceedings and Discovery Efforts  \n The stage  of proceedings and discovery efforts factor also weighs in favor of \napproving the proposed settlement. In evaluating this factor, the key issue is whether the parties and court possess sufficient information to “evaluate the merits of the \ncompeting positi ons.” Ayers, 358 F.3d at 369. Even when the parties “have not \nconducted much formal discovery,” this factor can be satisfied when other information demonstrates that the settlement should be approved. Klein v. O’Neal, Inc. , \n705 F.Supp.2d 632, 65 3 (N.D. Tex. 2010); see also  Union Asset Mgmt. Holding A.G.  v. \nDell, Inc. , 669 F.3d 632, 639 (5th  Cir. 2012) (“ [F]ormal discovery is not a prerequisite \nto approving a [class] settlement as reasonable. ”). That conclusion flows naturally \nfrom the general prin ciple that early settlements should be encouraged, not hindered, Case 4:21-cv-00307-SDJ     Document 74     Filed 12/16/22     Page 12 of 34 PageID #: \n<pageID>13 \n so long as the parties have obtained the “desired quantum of information necessary \nto achieve a settlement.” Jenkins v. Trustmark Nat’l Bank , 300 F.R.D. 291, 304 \n(S.D. Miss. 2014) (quotations  omitted).  \n Here, the parties have obtained ample information to achieve an informed \nsettlement. To begin, Bronstein’s counsel engaged in an extensive pre- suit \ninvestigation to determine the strength of the claims against Intrusion. (Dkt.  #65-2 \n¶ 32). This pre-suit investigation involved reviewing public documents, including \nSEC filings and analyst reports, and retaining a private investigator. (Dkt.  #65 \nat 15); (Dkt.  #65-2 ¶ 32). Following the pre- suit investigation, the parties extensively \nnegotiated the proposed settlement and participated in a full -day mediation with an \nexperienced mediator, which enabled the parties to develop a “full understanding of \nthe legal and factual issues surrounding [the] case” before agreeing to the proposed \nsettlement. Manchaca  v. Chater, 927 F.Supp. 962, 967 (E.D. Tex. 1996).  \nvi. Probability of Success on the Merits  \n The proposed settlement’s fairness, reasonableness, and adequacy is further \ndemonstrated by the uncertainty of success should the case proceed to trial. When there has been no showing of fraud or collusion , the probability of success is the most \nimportant factor in evaluating a proposed settlement. Smith v. Crystian , 91 F.App’x. \n952, 955 n.3 (5th  Cir. 2004) (per curiam) (citing Parker v. Anderson , 667 F.2d 1204, \n1209 (5th  Cir. 1982)). This factor requires the court to “compare the terms of the \nsettlement wi th the rewards the class would have been likely to receive following a \nsuccessful trial.” DeHoyos  v. Allstate Corp. , 240 F.R.D. 269, 287 (W.D. Tex. 2007). But \nin comparing the settlement’s terms with the potential rewards at trial, the c ourt Case 4:21-cv-00307-SDJ     Document 74     Filed 12/16/22     Page 13 of 34 PageID #: \n<pageID>14 \n must avoid “tr y[ing] the case in the settlement hearings.” Reed , 703 F.2d at 172. That \nwould undermine the settlement’s “very purpose,” which is to “avoid the delay and \nexpense of such a trial.”  Id. (quotations omitted ).  \n Here, the claims against Intrusion are hotly co ntested and difficult to prove. \nAgainst Bronstein’s efforts to develop these claims through extensive investigation \nand expert analysis, Intrusion has retained sophisticated counsel to oppose these \nefforts and would likely continue opposing them through tr ial and appeal. Intrusion \nwould no doubt challenge the sufficiency of Bronstein’s proof on a notoriously difficult \nelement in a securities claim: scienter. See Stott, 277 F.R.D. at 343 (noting that \nsecurities claims are “difficult to prove”).  \n Even if Bronstein established Intrusion’s liability for the alleged securities \nviolations, he would face additional challenges certifying a class and establishing \ndamages on a class -wide basis. For example,  it is likely that  Intrusion  would \nvigorously dispute the connection between  its alleged wrongdoing and the drop in its \nstock price. If Bronstein could prove that connection, Intrusion could still dispute \nwhat portion of the drop was attributable to its  actions as opposed to other causes.  \n The result would be a protracted battle of the experts that is avoided through \nthe proposed settlement. See In re Cendant Corp. Litig. , 264 F.3d 201, 236, 286 \n(3d Cir. 2001) (approving class action settlement in securities litigation in which \ncompeting positions on damages issu es would have devolved into a “battle of the \nexperts”); In re OCA, Inc. Sec. & Derivative Litig. , No. CV- 05-2165, 2009 WL 512081, \nat *14 (E.D. La. Mar. 2, 2009) (“Because the jury would have been faced with Case 4:21-cv-00307-SDJ     Document 74     Filed 12/16/22     Page 14 of 34 PageID #: \n<pageID>15 \n competing expert opinions, the resulting damage a ward would have been highly \nunpredictable.”).  \nvii. Range and Certainty of Recovery \n The range and certainty of recovery factor also weighs in favor of approving \nthe proposed settlement. In evaluating this factor, the Court must begin by \nestablishing a “ran ge of possible damages that could be recovered at trial.” Maher v. \nZapata Corp. , 714 F.2d 436, 460 (5th Cir. 1983) ( quotations omitted ). After \nestablishing the range of possible damages that could be recovered at trial, the Court then determines whether the settlement is “pegged at a [fair] point in the range” in \nlight of the “likelihood of prevailing at trial and other factors.” Id.  (quota tions \nomitted).    \n As explained in the discussion of the above factors, see supra Part III(A)(i) –(vi), \nBronstein and the class faced considerable risks in proceeding to trial. Considering these risks, it is far from guaranteed that the class would have rec overed even a \nfraction of the total amount in controversy. Thus, while the high end of the class’s \npotential recovery was $42.7 million , (Dkt.  #65 at 19), the low end of the class’s \npotential recovery was $0.00 —with the balance of probabilities weighing in  favor of \nrecovery closer to the low end than to the high end.  \n The $3,250,000.00 settlement is therefore pegged at a fair point in the range \nof total recovery. It represents 7. 61% of the class’s total potential recovery, which is \na respectable percentage  given the uncertainties of proceeding to trial, the \ncomplexities of class action lawsuits, and the difficulties in proving securities \nviolations.  (Dkt.  #65 at  19); (Dkt.  #65-2 ¶ 21). Indeed, it is common in class action Case 4:21-cv-00307-SDJ     Document 74     Filed 12/16/22     Page 15 of 34 PageID #: \n<pageID>16 \n lawsuits for plaintiffs to recover only “three -to-six cents on the dollar.” City of Omaha \nPolice & Fire Ret. Sys. , 2015 WL 965696, at *7.  \nviii. Opinions of Participants and Absent Class Members \n The virtually unanimous support for the proposed settlement also \ndemonstrates its fairness, reasonableness, and adequacy. The named parties and \nclass counsel all believe that the proposed settlement is a favorable outcome for both the active participants i n the litigation and the absent class members. That the \nparties and class counsel unanimously support the proposed settlement is an important fact weighing in favor of its approval because, “absent fraud, collusion, or \nthe like,” the Court “should be hesit ant to substitute its own judgment for that of \ncounsel.” Cotton v. Hinton , 559 F.2d 1326, 1330 (5th Cir. 1977). And here, the parties \nand counsel, all of whom are sophisticated, have vigorously defended their respective \npositions, lending further support f or the settlement’s fairness.  \n In addition to the named parties and class counsel, the absent class members \nalso appear to support the proposed settlement. Out of nearly 29,000 potential class \nmembers who received notice of the settlement, and more than 1 ,000 potential class \nmembers who responded to the notice, no potential class members objected to the proposed settlement or validly requested to be excluded from it. (Dkt.  #72-1 ¶¶ 7 –8). \nThis lack of objection from the class members supports the “adequacy of the \nsettlement.” Erica P. John Fund, Inc. , 2018 WL 1942227, at *5 (quotations omitted).   Case 4:21-cv-00307-SDJ     Document 74     Filed 12/16/22     Page 16 of 34 PageID #: \n<pageID>17 \n B. The Class Members Received Adequate Notice of the Proposed \nSettlement .  \n The Court also finds that the class members received adequate notice of the \nproposed settl ement. The adequacy of a class settlement notice is not governed by \n“rigid rules.” Wal -Mart Stores, Inc.  v. Visa U.S.A., Inc., 396  F.3d 96, 114 (2d  Cir. \n2005) ; Erica P. John Fund, Inc. , 2018 WL 1942227, at * 3 n.1. Instead, the notice must \nsatisfy the “broad reasonableness standard []” imposed by due process and Rule 23(e).  \nIn re Katrina Canal Breaches Litig. , 628 F.3d 185, 197 (5th Cir. 2010) (quotations \nomitted).  To satisfy that standard,  the notice must provide cla ss members with \n“information reasonably necessary” to decide whether t o object to the settlement or \nnot. Id. The standard does not require, however, “actual notice to each party” to be \nbound by the settlement.  Erica P. John Fund, Inc. , 2018 WL 1942227, at * 3 n.1 (citing \nMullane v. Cent. Hanover Bank & Tr. Co. , 339 U.S. 306, 313 –14 (1950)) .  \n Here, the class notices were adequate both in  timing and content. In terms of \ntiming, class counsel published and distributed the class settlement notices f orty days \nbefore the deadline to object to the settlement. (Dkt.  #56 at 18– 19); (Dkt.  #72-1 ¶ 3). \nThese efforts resulted in delivery of notices  to nearly 29,000 potential class members \nby email or postcard before the objection deadline. (Dkt.  #72-1 ¶ 3). The Court finds, \ntherefore, that the notice procedures provided class members ample time to object to \nthe settlement if they  wished to do so. See DeJulius v. New England Health Care \nEmps. Pension Fund , 429  F.3d 935, 947 (10th  Cir. 2005) (holding that the class \nmembers received adequate notice of a class settlement when the notices were “sent \nout nearly two weeks prior to the settlement hearing”).  Case 4:21-cv-00307-SDJ     Document 74     Filed 12/16/22     Page 17 of 34 PageID #: \n<pageID>30 \n  Amount Involved and Results Obtained. The amount in controversy in this \ncase is significant: $42.7 million, according to Bronstein’s damages expert. (Dkt.  #65 \nat 19). Counsel obtained 7.61% of that amount through the pr oposed settlement.  \n(Dkt.  #65 at 19); (Dkt.  #65-2 ¶ 21).  Given that plaintiffs typically recover only “three -\nto-six cents on the dollar” in class actions, City of Omaha Police & Fire Ret. Sys. , 2015 \nWL 965696, at *7, that is a favorable result.  See also Parker v. Anderson , 667 F.2d \n1204, 1210 (5th  Cir. 1982) (observing that class settlements can be fair and adequate \neven when they “amount to a fraction of the potential recovery [at trial]” (quotations \nomitted)). This factor supports the requested fee award w ithout need for any \nadjustment.   \nTime Limitations; Nature and Length of Relationship with Client.  The \ntime limitations and client relationship factors also  do not require any adjustment to \nthe requested fee award. As for time limitations, the parties have not identified any \ntiming constraints  imposed by the clients or circumstances. Erica P. John Fund, 2018 \nWL 1942227, at *11 (“This factor does not apply in this case because there is no indication that Lead Plaintiff imposed any time limits in the prosecution of this \ncase.”); see also  In re Combustion, Inc. , 968 F.Supp. at 1135) (“Even though it is \napparent that the Johnson factors must be addressed to ensure  that the resulting fee \nis reasonable, not every factor need be necessarily considered.”).  \n And as for the nature and length of the client relationship, the Court finds that \nclass counsel ably represent ed the class beginning in 2021. Both class counsel and  \nBronstein actively participated in the litigation for its full duration. Considering Case 4:21-cv-00307-SDJ     Document 74     Filed 12/16/22     Page 30 of 34 PageID #: \n<pageID>31 \n counsel’s dedication to Bronstein and to the class stretching more than a year, the \nrequested fee award adequately compensates counsel. That conclusion is supported \nby Br onstein’s declaration, in which he states that  class counsel regularly discussed \nthe case with him, provided “periodic status reports,” and deserves the requested fees—all facts suggesting that the attorney -client relationship was strong. (Dkt.  #66-\n4 ¶¶ 5–6, 8–9); Erica P. John Fund, 2018 WL 1942227, at *12 (finding that this factor \nweighed in favor of a requested fee award when “the professional relationship with \nLead Plaintiff w as positive”).   \niii. Lodestar Cross- Check  \n A lodestar cross -check  confirms the reasonableness of the fees requested. The \nlodestar method focuses on the work performed as opposed to the recovery obtained. \nTo calculate the lodestar, the court multiplies the attorney’s hourly rate by the hours \nworked.  See Hobbs v. EVO Inc. , 7 F.4th 241, 259 (5th  Cir. 2021).  The burden is on the \nmoving party to establish the reasonableness of both the rate charged and the hours billed. McClain v. Lufkin Indus., Inc. , 649 F.3d 374, 381 (5th Cir. 2011); Swanston v. \nCity of Plano , No. 4:19 -CV-412, 2022 WL 3567059, at *2 (E.D. Tex. Aug. 18, 2022).   \n Here, counsel submitted affidavits and declarations supporting a lodestar \namount of $467,783.00. (Dkt.  #65-2 ¶ 33–34). The affidavits and declaration s do not \ninclude contemporaneous billing records , detailed time entries , or proof of the rate \ntypically charged in the community, as would typically be required to support a claim \nfor attorney’s fees. See Vaughan v. Lewisville In dep. Sch. Dist. , No. 4:19 -CV-109-SDJ, \n2021 WL 6125786, at *5 (E.D. Tex. Dec. 28, 2021); McClain , 649 F.3d at 381– 82. \nHowever, the submitted affidavits and declarations are sufficient under the Case 4:21-cv-00307-SDJ     Document 74     Filed 12/16/22     Page 31 of 34 PageID #: \n<pageID>32 \n circumstances . No party objected to the fee request. And the Court is employing the \nlodestar method only as a rough cross -check to confirm the reasonableness of the \npercentage award. Turner v. Murphy Oil  USA, Inc. , 472  F.Supp.2d 830, 867 (E.D.  La. \n2007)  (observing that , in performing a lodestar cross -check , the court need not \nscrutinize each time entry and  “representations by class counsel as to total hours \n[worked] may be sufficient” (quotations omitted)).  \n When a lodestar cross -check is applied to  a class -action fee aw ard in a common \nfund case , courts frequently use a multiplier ranging from one to four based on the \nJohnson factors. See, e.g. , Burford , 2012 WL 5471985, at *6 n.1 (approving a 1.78 \nmultiplier and remarking that court s frequently approve multipliers rangin g from \none to four); Di Giacomo v. Plains All Am. Pipeline , No. CV -99-4137, 2001 WL \n34633373, at *10– 11 (S.D.  Tex. Dec. 19, 2001)  (approving a 5.3 multiplier in a \nsecurities class action) .   \n Here, the Johnson factors, for the reasons explained above,  see supra Part \nIII(D)(ii),  support a $1,083,332.00 attorney’s fee  award —which is the lodestar amount \nmultiplied 2.32 times. That multiplier falls in the commonly accepted range. The \nCourt finds that the lodestar c ross-check confirms the reasonableness of the \nrequested fee award.  E. Bronstein and Class Counsel May Recover Reasonable Expenses .  \n \n Bronstein and class counsel may recover reasonable expenses  incurred during \nthe litigation . Bronstein requests $5,000.00 for the considerable time (approximately \nforty hours) he invested in the case communicating with counsel, reviewing Case 4:21-cv-00307-SDJ     Document 74     Filed 12/16/22     Page 32 of 34 PageID #: \n<pageID>33 \n documents, and participating in settlement negotiations. (Dkt.  #66-4 ¶¶ 3 –7, 11). \nBronstein’s request is author ized under the P SLRA,  which allows a lead plaintiff to \nrecover “reasonable costs and expenses (including lost wages)  directly relating to \nrepresentation of the class.” 15 U.S.C. § 78u -4(a)(4).  \n The Court agrees  that Bronstein invested considerable time and  effort to this \ncase and awards Bronstein  the requested recovery of $5,000 . The award is below what \ncourts have awarded in other class action  cases. See, e.g. , Burford , 2012 WL 5471985, \nat *6 (awarding named plaintiffs up to $15,000.00 in compensation for efforts \nexpend ed representing the class) ; In re Catfish Antitrust Litig. , 939 F.Supp. 493, 504 \n(N.D. Miss. 1996) (awarding $10,000.00).  \n Class Counsel request  reimbursement in the amount of $35,216.89 for \nexpenses incurred representing the  class. (Dkt. #66 at 27, 30 ). Counsel further \nrequests that these expenses be awarded out of the settlement fund in addition to the \n$1,083,332.00 in  attorney’s fees. Because no class member objected to the request , \ncounsel diligently represented the class, and  counsel incurred considerable expense \nwith no guarantee of recovery, the Court finds that the requested amount is \nreasonable under the circumstances and will be awarded.  \nIV. CONCLUSION  \n The parties and counsel have diligently litigated these consolidated  cases and \nachieved a favorable settlement not only for the named parties, but also for the absent class members. The reasonableness of the settlement is reflected by the lack of any \nobjection to it. The Court finds that the proposed settlement  should be approved, the \nclass certified, and the requested fees and expenses awarded.  Case 4:21-cv-00307-SDJ     Document 74     Filed 12/16/22     Page 33 of 34 PageID #: \n<pageID>34 \n  It is therefore ORDERED as follows:  \n1. The Court finally approves the proposed settlement agreement, (Dkt.  #55), as \nfair, reasonable, and adequate under the Federal Rule s of Civil Procedure. Its \nterms shall bind all class members.  \n \n2. The Court finally certifies a class of persons or entities that purchased or otherwise acquired Intrusion, Inc. common stock between October 1 4, 2020,  \nand August 26, 2021, both dates inclusive,  and were damaged thereby. The \ncertified class excludes: (a) Defendants; (b) Intrusion, Inc.’s officers, directors, \nand affiliates, at all relevant times; (c) Intrusion. Inc.’s employee retirement or \nbenefit plan(s) and their participants or beneficiaries to the extent they purchased or acquired Intrusion, Inc. stock through any such plan(s); (d) any entity in which Defendants have or had controlling interest; (e) immediate \nfamily members of any excluded person; (f) the legal representatives, heirs, \nsuccess ors, or assigns of any excluded person or entity; and (g) all those who \nsubmit timely and valid requests  for exclusion.  \n \n3. The Court dismisses with prejudice all claims in this action between the class \nand Defendants.  \n \n4. The Court approves the parties’ propo sed allocation plan as a fair and \nreasonable method of allocating the settlement fund among class members. The Court directs the parties to distribute  through the claims administer  the \nsettlement fund in accordance with the settlement agreement and stipula tion. \n(Dkt.  #55).  \n \n5.  The Court awards class counsel $1,083,332.00 in attorney’s fees and \n$35,216.89 in expenses. The Court awards lead Plaintiff Andrew Bronstein \n$5,000.00 for expenses.   \n \n  \n \n \n Case 4:21-cv-00307-SDJ     Document 74     Filed 12/16/22     Page 34 of 34 PageID #: \n<pageID>",

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: This case is a securities class action involving C3.AI, Inc., along with other defendants, where plaintiffs allege that C3 made misleading statements regarding their strategic partnership with Baker Hughes, purportedly affecting the company's stock value. The claimed misrepresentations involve assertions about the size of Baker Hughes' salesforce engaged in marketing C3's AI products, among other things. The court grants in part and denies in part the motions to dismiss various allegations, allowing plaintiffs the opportunity to amend their complaint regarding certain claims, without resolving whether AI technology itself is implicated directly in the legal claims.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: The primary legal issue is whether C3.AI, Inc. and associated defendants made material misrepresentations or omissions in violation of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, particularly concerning the company's AI software sales efforts and strategic partnerships.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court grants in part and denies in part the motions to dismiss filed by the C3 defendants and grants Baker Hughes' motion to dismiss entirely. The court decides that plaintiffs sufficiently pleaded some claims related to Section 11 of the Securities Act but fail to meet the pleading requirements for claims under Sections 10(b), 20(a), and 20A of the Exchange Act, suggesting a lack of adequate pleading of scienter (intent to deceive).\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine a company tried to sell a magic toy by partnering with a famous sales team, and they said all 12,000 members of this team were helping sell it. Later, it turns out just a small group was actually selling the toy, not the whole sales team, and the company's stock value went down because of this news. A group of people sues the company saying, \"Hey, you tricked us about the magic toy's sales team to make your company look better.\" The court tells them their case is only partly clear and gives them a chance to explain better why they think the company misled them.",

Nos. 105, 109  \n \n \nPending before the Court are motions to dismiss Plaintiffs’  putative securities class action \nfiled by the C3 Defendants and Defendant Baker Hughes .  Dkt. No s. 105, 109 .  Plaintiffs filed an \nomnibus opposition to Defendants’ separately filed motions.  See Dkt. No. 119.  The Court finds \nthe matter appropriate for disposition without oral argument and the matter is deemed submitted.  \nSee Civil L.R. 7 -1(b).  For the reasons be low, the Court GRANTS IN PART and DENIES IN \nPART the C3 Defendants’ motion to dismiss, Dkt. No. 105, and GRANTS Defendant Baker \nHughes’ motion to dismiss, Dkt. No. 109.  To the extent the motions to dismiss are granted , \ndismissal is  WITH LEAVE TO AMEND .  The Court further GRANTS the C3 Defendants’ \nrequest for judicial notice, Dkt.

BACKGROUND  \nOn March 4, 2022, the Reckstin Family Trust filed this lawsui t, asserting  various \nviolations of the Securit ies and Exchange Acts .  See Dkt. No. 1.  In December 2022, the Court \nappointed Mark Samarghandi – an investor who purchased shares of C3 stock and claims that he \nwas damaged by Defendants’ alleged securit ies law violations – as Lead Plaintiff , and Hagens Case 4:22-cv-01413-HSG     Document 154     Filed 02/22/24     Page 1 of 45 \n2 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP as lead counsel.  Dkt. No. 66.   \nOn February 2023, Plaintiffs  filed an  Amended Class Action Complaint (“ CAC”)  against \nnumerous defendants .1  See Dkt. No. 71 (“ CAC”) ¶¶ 29–35.  The Court will refer to one subset of \ndefendants as the “C3 Defendants,” which includes  (i) Defendant C3.ai, Inc. (“C3”), a company \nincorporated in Delaware and headquartered in Redwood City, California that makes and sells \nartificial intelligence  (“AI”) software for enterprise clients using  a subscription model, id. ¶¶ 4, \n29; and (ii) four individually named C3 officers: Thomas M. Siebel (“Siebel”), Edward Y. Abbo \n(“Abbo”), David Barter (“Barter”), and Lorenzo Simonelli (“Simonelli”) ( and collectively , the \n“Individual Defendants”). 2  Id. ¶¶ 31 –34.  In addition to the C3 Defendants, Plaintiffs also name d \nBaker Hughes (or “BH”) as a Defendant.3  Baker Hughes, incorporated in Delaware and \nheadquartered in Houston, Texas, is “one of the world’s largest oil field service companies.”  CAC  \n¶ 8.  As relevant here, BH purchased C3’s artificial intelligence software for its own use, and also \nagreed to be “the exclusive seller” for C3’s product s within the oil and gas industry.  Id.   \nPlaintiffs  allege that  the C3 Defendants made false or misleading statements concerning \nthe nature of C3’s joint venture with “gas monolith” BH during the class period, which they define \nas starting with C3’s IPO on December 9, 2020 and ending the following year on December 2, \n \n1 The parties in the amended complaint differ from those in the original complaint.  The amended \ncomplaint drop ped most of the previously named C3 Directors, such as Condoleezza  Rice and \nStephen Ward , while adding others .  And b esides the lead plaintiff, the CAC identifies as \n“Additional Plaintiffs” shareholders Sharen L. Zavalanski, David Linder, and Elizabeth Wensel, \nall of whom allege that they purchased C3 stock and were subsequently damaged by Defendants’ \npurported misconduc t.  CAC ¶¶ 26 –28. \n2 Defendant Siebel founded C3 in 2009 and currently serves (and during the relevant period \nserved) as C3’s Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and Chairman of the Board of Directors.  CAC ¶ \n31.  Defendant Abbo is C3’s President and Chief Tech nology Officer (“CTO”), the latter being a \nrole he has served in since 2011.  Id. ¶ 32.  Before the class period, Abbo  also served as C3’s CEO \n(from September 2009 -July 2011) and sat on its Board of Directors (from August 2009 -November \n2020).  Id.  Defendant Barter served as C3’s Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer \n(“CFO”) at the time of C3’s initial public offering (“IPO”), but subsequently left the CFO role on \nDecember 1, 2021.  Id. ¶ 33.  Defendant Simonelli – the Chairman, President, and CEO of Baker \nHughes – served as a Director on C3’s Board from August 2019 to December 17, 2021.  Id. ¶ 34.   \n3 The CAC  also name d ten Underwriter Defendants.  See CAC  ¶¶ 38 –47.  However, because the \nUnderwriter Defendants were voluntarily dismissed with prejudice from this action on June 30, \n2023, see Dkt. No. 118, which mooted their then -pending  motion to dismiss, Dkt. No . 113, the \nCourt will not detail those parties or the allegations made against them.  Case 4:22-cv-01413-HSG     Document 154     Filed 02/22/24     Page 2 of 45 \n3 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  2021 .  CAC ¶¶  1, 2.  Plaintiff s allege that although  the C3 Defendants  made statements (both in \nC3’s S EC filing s and in public statements ) during the class period suggesting that  BH’s 12,000-\nperson sales team was engaged in selling  C3’s AI software , C3 “did not have Baker Hughes’ \nentire [12,000-person] salesforce at its disposal.”  Id. ¶ 10  (emphasis added) .  Instead, Plaint iffs \naver that the sale  of C3 products was supposedly handled in a  separate unit “outside of [BH’s] \nnormal structure . . . staffed with salespeople who lacked the industry expertise and connections of \nBaker Hughes’ normal salesforce.”  Id.  Plaintiffs cont end that t he relegation of C3’s sales to this \ninexperienced subunit contributed  to lackluster sales performance.  Id.   \nIn addition to misleading investors about C3’s access to BH’s 12,000 -person salesforce , \nPlaintiffs allege that Defendants further concea led a “massive restructuring” of C3’s  own \nsalesforce  in July 2021  despite “the significant risks it posed to the company.”  CAC ¶ 11.  \nConcealing the internal restructuring while touting the strategic partnership between C3 and BH – \nparticularly  the vast sales resources available to C3 through that partnership  – allegedly \n“artificially inflated C3’s stock.”  Id. ¶ 12.  Plaintiffs further claim that the Individual Defendants, \nwho knew about  the sales issues, then engaged in insider trading by dumping hundreds of millions \nof dollars in C3 stock upon expiration of the post -IPO lockup period.  Id.  Only in December 2021 \ndid Defendant Siebel first publicly reveal that C3 had “secretly” reorganiz ed its direct salesforce \nand restructured its strategic partnership with Baker Hughes, in part because it “did not have \naccess to Baker Hughes’ enormous 12,000 -person salesforce nor its deep expertise.”  Id. ¶ 16.  \nAccording to Plaintiffs, t he revelations about C3’s true sales structure and resources were costl y: \nas of the date the initial complaint was filed (in March 2022), “the price of C3’s Class A common \nstock closed at $20.05, a 52% decline from the $42.00 per share Offering price.”  Id. ¶ 19.  \nBased on these allegations, Plaintiffs bring causes of action  against Defendants  on behalf \nof putative class es under Sections 11  and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933 (the “Securities Act ,” 15 \nU.S.C. § 77  et seq ); Items 303 and 505 of Regulation S -K (17 C.F.R. §§  229.303(a)(3)(ii) , \n229.105(a) ); Sections 10(b) , 20(a) , and 20A  of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the \n“Exchange Act ,” 15 U.S.C. § 78 a et seq ); and U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) \nRule 10b -5 (17 CFR 240.10b -5).  See CAC ¶¶ 96–116, 240 –269.  Defendants  have moved to Case 4:22-cv-01413-HSG     Document 154     Filed 02/22/24     Page 3 of 45 \n4 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  dismiss the CAC in its entirety.  See Dkt. No. 105  (“C3 MTD”) , 109  (“BH MTD”) .4  The issues \nare fully briefed.  See Dkt. No s. 119 (“Opp.”), 137 (“C3 Reply”), 139 (“BH Reply”).  \nII. LEGAL STANDARD  \nA. Federal Rule of Civil  Procedure 12(b)(6)  \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a) requires that a complaint contain “a short and plain \nstatement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2).  A \ndefendant may move to dismiss a complaint for  failing to state a claim upon which relief can be \ngranted under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6).  “Dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) is \nappropriate only where the complaint lacks a cognizable legal theory or sufficient facts to support \na cognizable l egal theory.”  Mendiondo v. Centinela Hosp. Med. Ctr. , 521 F.3d 1097, 1104 (9th \nCir. 2008).  To survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, a plaintiff must plead “enough facts to state a \nclaim to relief that is plausible on its face.”  Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly , 550  U.S. 544, 570 (2007). \nA claim is facially plausible when a plaintiff pleads “factual content that allows the court to draw \nthe reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.”  Ashcroft v. Iqbal , \n556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009).  \nIn reviewing the plausibility of a complaint, courts “accept factual allegations in the \ncomplaint as true and construe the pleadings in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.” \nManzarek v. St. Paul Fire & Marine Ins. Co. , 519 F.3d 1025, 1031 (9th Cir . 2008).  Nonetheless, \nCourts do not “accept as true allegations that are merely conclusory, unwarranted deductions of \nfact, or unreasonable inferences.” In re Gilead Scis. Secs. Litig. , 536 F.3d 1049, 1055 (9th Cir. \n2008).  \nB. Heightened Pleading Standard  \nSection 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 provides that it is unlawful “[t]o use \nor employ, in connection with the purchase or sale of any security registered on a national \nsecurities exchange or any security not so registered . . . any manipulativ e or deceptive device or \ncontrivance . . . .”  15 U.S.C. § 78j(b).  Under this section, the SEC promulgated Rule 10b -5, \n \n4 According to its motion, Baker Hughes joins the C3 Defendants’ motion to dismiss “in full.”  BH \nMTD at 7.  Case 4:22-cv-01413-HSG     Document 154     Filed 02/22/24     Page 4 of 45 \n5 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  which makes it unlawful, among other things, “[t]o make any untrue statement of a material fact or \nto omit to state a material fact nece ssary in order to make the statements made, in the light of the \ncircumstances under which they were made, not misleading.”  17 C.F.R. § 240.10b -5(b).  To \nprevail on a claim for violations of either Section 10(b) or Rule 10b -5, a plaintiff must prove six \nelements: “(1) a material misrepresentation or omission by the defendant; (2) scienter; (3) a \nconnection between the misrepresentation or omission and the purchase or sale of a security; (4) \nreliance upon the misrepresentation or omission; (5) economic loss;  and (6) loss causation.” \nStoneridge Inv. Partners, LLC v. Scientific -Atlanta, Inc. , 552 U.S. 148, 157 (2008).  \nAt the pleading stage, a complaint alleging claims under Section 10(b) and Rule 10b -5 \nmust not only meet the requirements of Federal Rule of Civi l Procedure 8, but also satisfy the \nheightened pleading requirements of both Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b) and the Private \nSecurities Litigation Reform Act (“PSLRA”).  In re Rigel Pharm., Inc. Sec. Litig. , 697 F.3d 869, \n876 (9th Cir. 2012).  Under R ule 9(b), claims alleging fraud are subject to a heightened pleading \nrequirement, which requires that a party “state with particularity the circumstances constituting \nfraud or mistake.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(b).  Additionally, all private securities fraud com plaints are \nsubject to the “more exacting pleading requirements” of the PSLRA, which require that the \ncomplaint plead with particularity both falsity and scienter.  Zucco Partners, LLC v. Digimarc \nCorp. , 552 F.3d 981, 990 (9th Cir. 2009) , as amended  (Feb. 10, 2009) . \nIII. REQUEST S FOR JUDICIAL NOTICE  \nDefendants have moved the Court to judicially recognize a number of documents they cite \nin their motion.  Dkt. No. 105 -2 (“C3 RJN”). 5  Plaintiff s have done the same.  Dkt. No. 119 -5 \n(“Pltf RJN”).   \nA. Legal Standard  \n“Generally, district courts may not consider material outside the pleadings when assessing \nthe sufficiency of a complaint under Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.”  In re \nEventbrite, Inc. Sec. Litig. , No. 18 -CV-02019 -EJD,  2020 WL 2042078, at *7 (N.D. Cal. Apr. 28, \n \n5 In its motion, BH does not independently request judicial n otice of any materials, but rather \nindicates that it joins the C3 Defendants’ requests.  BH MTD at 9 n. 3.  Case 4:22-cv-01413-HSG     Document 154     Filed 02/22/24     Page 5 of 45 \n6 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  2020) (citing Lee v. City of Los Angeles , 250 F.3d 668, 688 (9th Cir. 2001)); Khoja v. Orexigen \nTherapeutics, Inc. , 899 F.3d 988, 998 (9th Cir. 2018)); see also  Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(d).  “This rule \ndoes not apply t o the incorporation by reference doctrine or judicial notice under Federal Rule of \nEvidence 201.”  Eventbrite , 2020 WL 2042078, at *7 (citing Khoja , 899 F.3d at 998).  \nA court may take judicial  notice  of an “adjudicative fact” pursuant to the Federal Rules of \nEvidence, if that fact is one “that is not subject to reasonable dispute because it: (1) is generally \nknown within the trial court’s territorial jurisdiction; or (2) can be accurately and readily \ndetermined from sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned.”  Fed. R. Evid. 201(b). \nThus, under Rule 201, courts may “take judicial  notice  of matters of public record, but not of facts \nthat may be subject to reasonable dispute.”  United States v. Corinthian Colls. , 655 F.3d 984, 999 \n(9th Cir. 2011) ( internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  \nIn the Ninth Circuit, incorporation by reference is a doctrine that “treats certain documents \nas though they are part of the complaint itself.”  Khoja , 899 F.3d at 1002.  A document may be \nincorporated by reference into a complaint “if the plaintiff refers extensively to the document or \nthe document forms the basis of the plaintiff’s claim.”  United States v. Ritchie , 342 F.3d 903, 908 \n(9th Cir. 2003).  “Once a document is deemed incorporated by reference, the entire document is \nassumed to be true for purposes of a motion to dismiss, and both parties  – and the Court  – are free \nto refer to any of its contents.”  In re NVIDIA Corp. Sec. Litig. , 768 F.3d 10 46, 1058 n.10 (9th Cir. \n2014) ( internal quotation marks and citation omitted ). \nB. Analysis  \ni. The C3 Defendants’  Requests  \nThe C3 Defendants  request that the Court consider  numerous documents  outside the \npleadings, which can be sorted into two buckets: (1)  publi c documents filed with the SEC and (2) \nfinancial analyst reports.  See generally  C3 RJN .  The Court agrees that consideration of these \ndocuments is permissible, and accordingly GRANTS  Defendants’ request , Dkt. No. 105 -2.   \n First, the  C3 Defendants argue t hat C3’s IPO materials (Exhibits B, C), Forms 10 -K \n(Exhibits D, E, S, T), Forms 8 -K (Exhibits A, F, G, H), and proxy statements (Exhibits I, J), as \nwell as Baker Hughes’ Forms 4 (Exhibits K, L, M) and Forms 144 (Exhibits N, O), should be Case 4:22-cv-01413-HSG     Document 154     Filed 02/22/24     Page 6 of 45 \n7 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  judicially noticed  because they are publicly available documents filed with the SEC.  C3 RJN at \n4.6  They also argue that  the incorporation by reference doctrine provides an alternat ive basis on \nwhich the Court can properly consider Exhibits B -D, K -M and S , since those documents are either \nreferenced extensively in Plaintiffs’ complaint  or underlay certain of Plaintiffs’ claims .  Id. at 2 –3. \nPlaintiffs oppose judicial notice of Exhibits A-O because they contend Defendants’ request is an \nimproper attempt to rebut  Plaintiffs’ allegations on the merits.  Opp. at 65 –69, Dkt. No. 119-1.  \nThey also argue that the filings are susceptible to “varying interpretations ,” and are therefore \nimproper s ubjects of judicial notice.  Id.   \nThe Court finds that the “accuracy” of these publicly filed SEC documents “cannot \nreasonably be questioned .”  Wochos v. Tesla, Inc. , No. 17 -CV-05828 -CRB, 2018 WL 4076437, at \n*2 (N.D. Cal. Aug. 27, 2018); see also Dreiling  v. Am. Exp. Co. , 458 F.3d 942, 946 n.2 (9th Cir. \n2006) (noting that SEC filings are subject to judicial notice); Hampton v. Aqua Metals, Inc. , 2020 \nWL 6710096, at *4 (N.D. Cal. Nov. 16, 2020) (considering Forms 4 for the purpose of evaluating \nstock sales and scienter allegations even where Forms 4 are not explicitly cited in complaint); \nWaterford Twp. Police v. Mattel, Inc. , 321 F. Supp. 3d 1133, 1143 (C.D. Cal. 2018) (granting \njudicial notice as to transcripts of earnings calls and excerpts of SEC filings ); In re Yahoo! Inc. \nCustomer Data Sec. Breach Litig. , No. 16 -MD-02752 -LHK, 2017 WL 3727318, at *10 (N.D. Cal. \nAug. 30, 2017) (“[B]oth  SEC filings and documents on government websites are proper subjects \nof judicial notice.”) .  The Court also finds that the documents  are suitable subjects of judicial  \nnotice  as evidence  “that the market was aware of the information [they] contain [].”  Heliotrope \nGen., Inc. v. Ford Motor Co. , 189 F.3d 971, 981 n.18 (9th Cir. 1999) .  Accordingly, the Court \nGRANTS  Defendants’ request for judicial notice as to Exhibits A -O, S, and T.7  In doing so, the \nCourt does not assume the truth of any of the facts asser ted, or endorse either of the competing \ninferences that the parties maintain arise out of the financial filings .  See Pardi v. Tricida, Inc ., No. \n \n6 For ease of reference, the Court refers to the PDF page  number  of a document rather than the \ndocument’s internal pagination  throughout this order,  unless otherwise noted.  \n7 The Court additionally  agrees that the incorporation by reference doctrine is a separate basis that \npermits the Court to consider Exhibits B -D, K-M and S , though not to resolve any factual dispute \nbetween the parties as to the substantive truth or falsity of their contents .  Case 4:22-cv-01413-HSG     Document 154     Filed 02/22/24     Page 7 of 45 \n8 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  21-CV-00076 -HSG, 2022 WL 3018144, at *3 –4 (N.D. Cal. July 29, 2022)  (quoting Wochos , 2018 \nWL 4076437, at *2 ).   \n The C3 Defendants  additionally urge the Court to consider three analyst reports (Exhibits \nP-R) cited in the complaint , both because they are incorporated by reference in Plaintiffs’ \ncomplaint ( by virtue of  their loss causation  allegations ) and also  because they are judicially \nnoticeable.  C3 RJN at 3 –4.  Plaintiff s oppose the Court’s consideration of these documents  \nbecause Defendants  supposedly  rely on them “to rebut Plaintiffs ‘loss causation arguments and \nassert that there was a ‘far more plausi ble reason’ for the stock price decline than Defendants’ \nomissions and representations,” and because the documents are “subject to differing \ninterpretations.”   Opp. at 67.  But P laintiffs do not detail what these differing interpretations might \nbe, and moreover, do not dispute  “that analyst reports may be considered to show what \ninformation was available to the market, which is the central issue in a loss causation analysis. ”  \nDkt. No. 138 at 6 –7 (citing  In re Century Aluminum  Co. Sec. Litig. , 2011 WL 83017 4, at *9 \n(“[C]ourts routinely take judicial notice of analyst reports . . . to determine what may or may not \nhave been disclosed to the public.”); Yaron v. Intersect ENT, Inc. , 2020 WL 6750568, at *4 (N.D. \nCal. June 19, 2020) (similar )).  Accordingly, the Court GRANTS Defendants’ request for judicial \nnotice as to Exhibits P -R, and will consider these documents not for their truth , but to determine \nwhat  information may or may not have been publicly disclosed .8   \nii. Plaintiffs’ Requests  \nPlaintiffs also request  that the Court take judicial notice of five documents they rely on in \ntheir opposition to the motion s to dismiss.  See Pltf RJN .   \nExhibits 1, 2, and 5 are publicly available documents C3 filed with the SEC  that reflect  \nwhat the market was aware of at the time .9  For the same reasons discussed above, the Court \n \n8 The Court additionally agrees that the incorporation by reference doctrine is a separate basis that \npermits the Court to consider Exhibits P -R, with the same limitations described above .  \n9 Exhibit 1 is th e Joint Venture Agreement between C3 and Baker Hughes dated June 6, 2019; \nExhibit 2 is the Third Amendment to the Joint Venture Agreement between C3 and Baker Hughes, \neffective May 1, 2022, and Exhibit 3 is the Quarterly Report for the period ended October  31, \n2021, filed with the SEC on Form 10 -Q on December 2, 2021.    Case 4:22-cv-01413-HSG     Document 154     Filed 02/22/24     Page 8 of 45 \n9 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  GRANTS Plaintiffs’ request for judicial notice as to these documents.   In so doing, the Court \noverrules Defendants’ objection that Exhibit 1, the Joint Venture Agreement between C3 and BH \n(which was enclosed as an attachment to the Registration Statement C3 submitted to the SEC), \nshould not be considered under either the in corporation by reference doctrine or the judicial notice \ndoctrine.  Dkt. No. 140 at 2 –3.  Although  Plaintiffs do not explicitly reference the Joint Venture \nAgreement (“JVA”) by name  in their complaint , they do reference a  “joint venture” and “deal ” – \nthe execution of which underpins  their action .  See Dkt. No. 142 at 2.  The Court therefore finds \nthat the JVA, a document filed with the SEC,  “is not reasonably subject to dispute ” and can be \nconsidered .  However, in keeping with its previously articulated app roach , the Court does not \nassume the truth of any of the facts  asserted in the judicially noticed documents or use those \ndocuments to supplement the allegations in Plaintiffs’ complaint.  See Dkt. No. 140 at 3.  \nPlaintiffs also seek judicial notice of Exhibits 3 and 4 , which are, respectively, a CNBC \narticle titled “Billionaire Tom Siebel faces tumult at C3.ai as investor lawsuit, short sellers \nquestion metrics ,” and the video segment from the CNBC business show “Last Call” embedded \nwithin the article.  Pltf RJN at 3.  Both reports are dated June 2, 2023, which is years after the \nclass period ended  and a month after the C3 Defendants filed their motion to dismiss.  In these \nmedia reports – which discuss this very lawsuit  in detail  – the C3 Defendants  purportedly ma de \n“public statements [to reporters] reaffirming that their claims regarding the size of Baker Hughes’ \nsalesforce were true and accurate representations of fact.”  Id.  Plaintiffs argue that because the C3 \nDefendants advanced in their motion to dismiss  a position contrary to the one articulated in the \nnews article and video , judicial notice of the media report s is warranted  “not for the truth of \nDefendants’ statements, but for the fact that they were made and the context they provide.”  Id. at \n4 (citing United States v. Kiewit Pacific Co. , 2013 WL 5770514, at *5 (N.D. Cal. Oct. 24, 2013) ). \nBut the Court is unpersuaded that considering media reports published  years after the class \nperiod (in response to the very litigation at issue) is a proper  application  of the judicial notice \ndoctrine , and Plaintiffs do not point to any cases to change that.  While the Court recognizes that \njudicially noticing news articles  may be appropriate in some instances , see Heliotrope Gen., Inc. , \n189 F.3d at 981 n. 18 (using news article to take judicial notice of what the market knew at the Case 4:22-cv-01413-HSG     Document 154     Filed 02/22/24     Page 9 of 45 \n10 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  time), this is not  such an instance.  Since the reporting postdates  the class period, it cann ot provide \ninsight into what the market knew during that time.  Dkt. No. 140 at 4 –5 (citing In re Clearly \nCanadian Sec. Litig. , 875 F. Supp. 1410 (N.D. Cal. 1995) ).  The Court therefore DENIES judicial \nnotice as to Exhibits 3 and 4.  \nIV. DISCUSSION  \nA. Securities Act Claims  \nPlaintiffs contend in their CAC that the C3 Defendants made false and misleading \nstatements and material omissions in the Registration Statement that C3  filed in connection with \nits December 2020 IPO.  CAC ¶¶ 69 –108.  According to Plaintiffs, these statements and omissions \nviolate d Section 11 of the Securities Act , as well as Items 303 and 105 of Regulation S -K, which \nimposes additional requirements on SEC registrants .  The C3 Defendants  argue , for their part,  that \nPlaintiffs’ Section 11 claims sound in fraud and thus must meet the heightened pleading \nrequirements of Rule 9(b).  C3 MTD at 18 –19.  They contend that  Plaintiffs fail to state a \ncognizable claim  under that standard , and that, in any event, certain of th eir Section 11 claims are \ntime-barred .  Id. \ni. Relation Back  \nBefore turning to the substance of Plaintiffs’ Section 11 claims, the Court considers as a \nthreshold matter whether certain of those claims  are in fact untimely  under Rule 15 , as Defendants \nurge.  It concludes they are not.  \n“Rule 15(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure governs when an amended pleading \n‘relates back’ to the date of a timely filed original pleading and is thus itself timely even though it \nwas filed outside an applicable statute of limitations.”  Krupski v. Costa Crociere S. p. A. , 560 \nU.S. 538, 541 (2010).   “The relation back doctrine of Rule 15(c) is ‘liberally applied.’” ASARCO, \nLLC v. Union Pac. R. Co. , 765 F.3d 999, 1004 (9th Cir. 2014) (citation omitted).  As relevant \nhere, Rule 15(c) provides that an amended pleading adding claims against a previously  named \nparty relates back to the date of the original pleading when the amendment asserts a claim or \ndefense that “arose out of the conduct, transaction, or occurrence set out  – or attempted to be set \nout – in the original pleading. ”  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(c)(1)(B).   “Claims arise out of the same Case 4:22-cv-01413-HSG     Document 154     Filed 02/22/24     Page 10 of 45 \n11 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  conduct, transaction, or occurrence if they ‘share a common core of operative facts’ such that the \nplaintiff will rely on the same evi dence to prove each claim.”  Williams v. Boeing Co. , 517 F.3d \n1120, 1133 (9th Cir. 2008) (citations omitted); see also ASARCO , 765 F.3d at 1004 (“An amended \nclaim arises out of the same conduct, transaction, or occurrence if it ‘will likely be proved by the \nsame kind of evidence offered in support of the original pleading.’”) ( quoting  Percy v. S.F. Gen. \nHosp. , 841 F.2d 975, 978 (9th Cir.1988)).  “The Ninth Circuit has made clear that the emphasis is \nnot on the legal theory asserted by Plaintiff, but rathe r on the operative facts of the claim.”  \nStichting Pensioenfonds ABP v. Countrywide Fin. Corp. , 802 F. Supp. 2d 1125, 1133 (C.D. Cal. \n2011) (citing FDIC v. Jackson , 133 F.3d 694, 702 (9th Cir.1998)).  \nDefendants argue that because the original complaint did  not include  allegations based on  \nstatements about  either the size of Baker Hughes’ salesforce or on the amount of revenue \nrecognized from C3’s relationship with Baker Hughes in the fiscal year ending April 2020, the \nallegations in the amended complaint co ncerning those two statements cannot not relate back to \nthe original complaint.  C3 MTD at 26 –27.  Plaintiffs, on the other hand, contend that the theories \nthey advance in their amended complaint concerning these statements do relate back to the \noriginal c omplaint (and are therefore timely) because the amended complaint merely “refine[d]” \nthe theory of liability arising out of the same “transactions and occurrences” at issue in the original \ncomplaint.  See Opp. at 63 –64.  In other words, even though the ori ginal complaint did not allege \nthat Baker Hughes was not deploying 12,000 salespeople on C3’s behalf, or that no sales had been \nmade by April 30, 2020, the original complaint did make allegations about how the Registration \nStatement misrepresented the natu re of C3’s relationship with Baker Hughes – which is, at \nbottom, what Plaintiffs allege these statements concern.  \nTo assess these  arguments, the Court starts by examining  Plaintiffs’ original complaint.  As \nrelevant here, the complaint originally  asserted Section 11 claims premised upon misleading \nstatements and material omissions made in the Registration Statement about C3’s deteriorating \nrelationship with Baker Hughes, C3’s flawed accounting method s, C3’s product performance and \npersonnel retention issues , the “scale of [C3’s] alliances with its major business partners,” and \nother matters.  Dkt. No. 1 ¶ 6.  Based on these alleged deficiencies, Plaintiffs pled that C3’s Case 4:22-cv-01413-HSG     Document 154     Filed 02/22/24     Page 11 of 45 \n12 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  “public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times ,” and quot ed dozens \nof allegedly misleading  paragraphs from the Registration Statement.   Id.  ¶¶ 6, 38 –41.  In the \nCAC, filed almost a year after the amended complaint , Plaintiffs  again bring  Section 11 claims, \nbut focus more narrowly on just three statements in the  Registration Statement  concerning C3’s \nrelationship with Baker Hughes  (Statement #1),  the size of Baker Hughes’ workforce  (Statement \n#2), and the revenues recognized from the relationship  (Statement #3).10   \nComparing the original and amended complaints shows that the case theor ies advanced in \nthe latter  do not entirely  track those  raised in t he former , but the Court finds that the initial \ncomplaint provided sufficient notice of Plaintiffs’ claims regarding the now -challenged  statements  \nto warrant relati on back.  Namely, the original complaint clearly identified  Plaintiffs ’ concerns \nabout the reliability of representations made in C3’s Registration Statement concerning its \nrelationship with Baker Hughes, the st rength of its corporate relationships , and its financial \nperformance .  The CAC presents similar concerns about the Registration Statement, only with a \nnarrowed focus on certain aspects of the Baker Hughes’ partnership  – namely the lack of staffing \ncommitme nt and sales generation .11  Accordingly, and in view of the liberality with which the \nrelation back doctrine is applied, the Court finds that the claims  in the amended complaint  \ngenerally a rise out of the  “same transaction and occurrence”  contemplated in t he original \ncomplaint,  and that the amended claims would “likely be proved by the same kind of  similar \nevidence .”  See ASARCO , 765 F.3d at 1004 .  Relation back is therefore proper, and the Court will \nproceed to analyze these statements (identified as #2 and #3 infra ).  That conclusion \nnotwithstanding, Defendants are not foreclosed from raising statute of limitations arguments at \n \n10 For ease, the Court will follow the same numerical identification that Defendants assigned to \neach challenged statement for purposes of the C3 MTD.  See Dkt. No. 105 -1, Appendix A (chart \nidentifying the statement number, CAC paragraph, date, speaker, and source of each statement \nchallenged  in Plaintiffs’ CAC).  \n11 The Court notes that while Plaintiffs  did not make specific allegations about the size of the \nBaker Hughes workforce or about revenue recognition from the partnership as of April 3 0, 2020  in \ntheir original complaint , they did quote Statement #3 as part of a longer Registration Statement \nexcerpt, and also separately excerpted  quotes touting the contested 12,000 -salesforce figure.  \nTherefore, while Plaintiffs did not necessarily connect all the dots for Defendants in their original \nfiling, Defendants cannot claim to be unfamiliar with these statements .  Case 4:22-cv-01413-HSG     Document 154     Filed 02/22/24     Page 12 of 45 \n13 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  later stages of the proceeding if further fact development warrants  it.  \nii. Legal Standard  \n“Section 11 of the Securities Act contains a private right of action for purchasers of a \nsecurity if the issuer publishes a registration statement in connection with that security that \n‘contain[s] an untrue statement or omit[s] to state a material fact required  to be stated therein or \nnecessary to make the statements therein not misleading.’”  Rubke v. Capitol Bancorp Ltd. , 551 \nF.3d 1156, 1161 (9th Cir. 2009) (quoting  15 U.S.C.  § 77k(a)).  To allege a  Section  11 claim, a \nplaintiff must show “(1) that the registr ation statement contained an omission or \nmisrepresentation, and (2)  that the omission or misrepresentation was material, that is, it would \nhave misled a reasonable investor about the nature of his or her investment.”   Id. (quot ation \nomitted ).  Importantly,  “[n]o scienter is required for liability under § 11; defendants will be liable \nfor innocent or negligent material misstatements or omissions.”  In re Stac Elecs. Sec. Litig ., 89 \nF.3d 1399, 1404 (9th Cir. 1996) (citation omitted).  \nUnlike  Section  10(b) clai ms, the heightened pleading standards of the PSLRA do not apply \nto Section  11 claims.   See Rubke , 551 F.3d at 1161.  However, “[t]he particularity requirements of \nRule 9(b) apply to claims brought under [S]ection 11 when such claims are grounded in fraud.”   \nRigel , 697 F.3d at 876 .  The Ninth Circuit has held that “a plaintiff’s nominal efforts to disclaim \nallegations of fraud with respect to its [S]ection  11 claims are unconvincing where the gravamen \nof the complaint is fraud and no effort is made to show any other basis for the claims.”  Id.  “To \nascertain whether the complaint sounds in fraud, [the Court] must normally determine, after a \nclose examinatio n of the language and structure of the complaint, whether the complaint allege[s] \na unified course of fraudulent conduct and rel[ies] entirely on that course of conduct as the basis of \na claim.”  Id. (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).  \nWhile Plaintiffs disclaim “any allegation of fraud, recklessness, or intentional misconduct” \nin incorporating the allegations supporting their Section 11 claims, CAC ¶ 96, Defendants urge \nthat Plaintiffs’ fraud allegations can not be so cleanly excised.  C3 MTD a t 18–19.  The Court \ndisagrees : Plaintiffs clearly identify which allegations in their complaint underpin their Section 11 \nversus Section 10(b) theories, and those allegations are far from “the exact same .”  See Rigel , 697 Case 4:22-cv-01413-HSG     Document 154     Filed 02/22/24     Page 13 of 45 \n14 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  F.3d at 8 86; Rubke , 551 F.3d at 11 61 (concluding that a court can assume a Section 11 complaint \nsounds in fraud where  “a complaint employs the exact same factual allegations to allege violations \nof section 11 as it uses to allege fraudulent conduct under section 10(b) of the Exchange Act ”).  In \nfact, Plaintiff s’ claims do not overlap at all : while there are parallels between certain of the \nstatements challenged under each law (namely Statements #2 and #18, and Statements #1 and \n#14), Plaintiffs have not alleged that any given  statement viol ates both Section 11 and Section \n10(b).  This contrasts with the situation in Rigel , for instance, where the plaintiff did not adopt all \nthe allegations contained in the complaint, but also did not allege different misrepresentations for \nits Section 11 cla im.  Rigel , 697 F.3d at 8 86.  Accordingly , the Court  concludes  that Plaintiffs’ \nSection 11 claims stand sufficiently alone, such that application  of the heightened pleading \nstandard  is not warranted.  \niii. Section 11  \nPlaintiffs base their Section 11 claims against C3, Simonelli, Siebel, and Barter on three \nstatements in C3’s  Registration Statement. 12  \na. Statement #1  \nPlaintiffs allege that the following statement , which describes C3’s  “Go-To-Market \nStrategy ,” is misleading:  \n \nOur strat egic go -to-market alliances vastly extend our reach globally . Some of \nour most notable partners include Baker Hughes, FIS, IBM, and Microsoft. \nEach strategic partner is a leader in its industry, with a substantial installed \ncustomer base and extensive mark eting, sales, and services resources that we \ncan leverage to engage and serve customers anywhere in the world. Using our \nAI Suite as the development suite, we leverage our model -driven architecture \nto efficiently build new cross -industry and industry -speci fic applications \nbased on identifying requirements across our customer base of industry \nleaders and through our industry partners. Our strategy with strategic \npartners is to establish a significant use case and prove the value of our \nAI Suite with a flagsh ip customer in each industry in which we \nparticipate. We have done this with our strategic vertical industry \n \n12 Plaintiffs informed the Court in their Opposition that they are withdrawing their Section 11 \nclaim against Abbo.  Opp. at 61 n.16.  As such, the Section 11 analysis applies only to C3, \nSimonelli, Siebel, and Barter – who the Court will collectively refer to in Section s IV.A.iii and \nIV.A.iv of this order as “Defendants,” and elsewhere in this order as the “Section 11 Defendants.”  Case 4:22-cv-01413-HSG     Document 154     Filed 02/22/24     Page 14 of 45 \n15 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  partner in oil and gas, Baker Hughes , as well as with our iconic global \ncustomers, some of whom are deploying C3 technology to optimize thousands \nof critical assets globally across their upstream, midstream, and downstream \noperations.  \n \nCAC ¶ 74  (bolding in original ; underlining added ).  While  Plaintiffs do not make any specific \nallegations in the CAC about  this statement or how, exactly, it is misleading , their  opposition  \nadvances the theory  that the statement misled the market by creating an impression – based on the  \nclaim in the first sentence  that the alliances “vastly extend” C3’s global reach – that a “large ” \nsalesforce was involved with selling C3  products  at Baker Hughes when , in reality,  it was not .  \nOpp. at 35.  Defendants disagree.  They argue that Plaintiffs do not allege that Statement #1 \n“falsely represented their actual partnership plans and ex pectations,” and that, regardless, the \nstatement is best understood as “classic corporate puffery.”  C3 MTD  at 20.   \n Plaintiffs’ failure to allege in the complaint how this statement was misleading  is \nessentially dispositive.  And even had  they done so , the Court is not persuaded that the challenged \nlanguage could plausibly mislead a reasonable investor.  The first sentence of the challenged \nstatement  does not, as Plaintiffs suggest, claim that any individual  alliance – whether with Baker \nHughes , FIS, IMB,  Microsoft,  or another strategic partner – “vastly extends ” C3’s reach.  It claims \nthat the “alliances” do.   A plain reading of the challenged language is therefore that the cumulative \neffect of C3’s strategic alliances  across various  industries  is to “vastly extend ” its global reach.  \nSince the statement is silent on the impact of any single partnership  on C3’s reach , the Court finds \nPlaintiffs’ argument  that it made any representation  about the  size of Baker Hughes’ salesforce \nimplausible.   Further, for t he statement to be misleading about Baker Hughes specifically, it must \nbe true that Baker Hughes did not contribute to extending C3’s reach globally – which Plaintiffs \ndo not allege.  \n Moreover, the Court agrees that the claims at issue in this statement – that C3’s strategic \nalliances  “vastly extend” its global reach, and that  Baker Hughes is a “strategic vertical partner” \nwith whom C3 has realized its partnership strategy of “establish[ing] a significant use cas e and \nprov[ing] the value of our AI Suite”  – are puffery.  In the securities context, p uffery is not \nactionable because investors “know how to devalue” such subjective statements of corporate Case 4:22-cv-01413-HSG     Document 154     Filed 02/22/24     Page 15 of 45 \n16 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  optimism when assessing  a corporation .  In re Cutera Sec. Litig. , 610 F.3d 1103 , 1110  (9th Cir. \n2010) .  The statements at issue here are too vague for a reasonable investor to rely upon  in \nassessing C3 because they are not susceptible to “objective verification.”  Retail Wholesale & \nDep’t Store Union Local 338 Ret. Fun d v. Hewlett -Packard Co. , 845 F.3d 1268, 1275 (9th Cir. \n2017) .  For example,  C3’s claim that its partnerships have “vastly” expanded its global reach is \nunquantifiable given the inherent inexactitude of the descriptor “vastly,” and its statement that the \nBaker Hughes partnership is “proving” the value of its AI products is general in nature, given the \nsubjectivity of that proof in this context.   See Hampton , 2020 WL 6710096 at *13 (discussing and \ndismissing as puffery statements such as “ [w]e believe this [ IB partnership] serves as a strong \nvalidation of our technology ”).  \nAs such,  Statement #1 is nonactionable,  the Court GRANTS Defendants’ motion to \ndismiss Plaintiffs’ Section 11 claim as  to this statement.13   \nb. Statement #2  \nNext, Plaintiffs allege that the following statement  describing C3’s “Sales Alliances” is \nmisleading:  \n \nBaker Hughes: Oil, Gas, and Chemicals. In 2019, we a formed a strategic \nalliance with Baker Hughes, a $24 billion oil and gas services company. \nUnder the terms of this alliance, Bak er Hughes has standardized on C3 for all \ninternal use AI applications . In addition, we are jointly marketing and \nselling a range of Enterprise AI solutions to address the entire value of \nupstream, mid -stream, and downstream activity under the BHC3 brand \nto oil and gas companies globally with the active engagement of Baker \nHughes, which has a 12,000 -person sales organization.  \n \nCAC ¶ 75  (emphasis in original) .  They contend that the statement is misleading “for failing to \ndisclose the fact that C3 did not have engagement with the Baker Hughes 12,000 -person \nsalesforce, but instead set up a separate sales division that relied on a subset of sales people that \n \n13 In any amended complaint, Plaintiffs must fully allege the basis for every claim .  Supplementing \nallegations through briefing will not be permitted , and the Court  will, for example, ignore any \narguments only raised in the briefing (but not in the complaint) explaining why a challenged \nstatement is misleading.  Case 4:22-cv-01413-HSG     Document 154     Filed 02/22/24     Page 16 of 45 \n17 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  did not have the industry connections, expertise, support, or mandatory sales quotas of Baker \nHughes’ typical salesforce . . . .”  Id. ¶ 76.  As a result of this structure, they allege that “C3 could \nnot reap the full benefits of a partnership.”  Id.  Defendan ts, for their part, maintain that because \nthe challenged statement “did not state, suggest, or imply that all the people in Baker Hughes’ \nsalesforce were working for C3,” and because it contains “nothing misleading about C3’s \ndescription of Baker Hughes’ s alesforce,” Statement #2 is not actionable.  C3 MTD  at 21.   \nDefendant s further argue that they disclosed to investors that C3 “cannot be certain” that its \nstrategic partners would adequately resource and prioritize sales efforts of C3 products.   Id.   \n Because the Court does not agree that the challenged statement “actively created an \nimpression that the full 12,000 -person Baker Hughes was engaged with C3,” it finds the statement \nnonactionable.  Plaintiffs have not alleged that the Baker Hughes salesforc e was not actually \n12,000 strong, such that the statement does not “affirmatively create an impression of a state  of \naffairs that differs in a material way from the one that actually exists.” Brody v. Transitional \nHosps. Corp. , 280 F.3d 997 , 1006  (9th Cir.  2002) .  The Court also concludes that Plaintiffs have \nnot plausibly pled that the statement omitted information that rendered it misleading .  Since the \nomission of the information about the size of BH’s C3 -focused salesforce did not “make \n[Statement #2] m isleading,” id., Defendants were not obligated to disclose it.  And w hile investors \nmay have been interested to know what proportion of the 12,000 -strong BH  salesforce was \nengaged in selling C3 products, “Section 11 does not require the disclosure of all i nformation a \npotential investor might take into account when making his decision .”  Rubke , 551 F.3d at 1163 .   \nAccordingly, the Court GRANTS Defendants’ motion to dismiss Plaintiffs’ Section 11 \nclaim as to Statement #2.  \nc. Statement #3  \nFinally, Plaintiff all eges that the following statement, made in relation to a description of \nC3’s financial  performance, is misleading:  \n \nIn June 2019, we entered into a three -year arrangement with Baker Hughes \nas both a leading customer and as a partner in the oil and gas ind ustry. This \narrangement included a subscription to our AI Suite for their own operations \n(which we refer to below as direct subscription fees), the exclusive right for Case 4:22-cv-01413-HSG     Document 154     Filed 02/22/24     Page 17 of 45 \n41 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  when it repeatedly claimed all 12,000 Baker Hughes salespeople were actively selling C3 ’s \nproduct .  However, t he Court does not agree that so neat a line can be drawn  between the \nconcealed fact at issue and C3’s disappointing RPO, let alone its overall  allegedly  poor \nperformance .  While the Court  recognizes  that RPO  may gauge a salesforce’s success, it finds \nsignificant that the disappointing RPO metrics at issue were not identified as flowing from the oil \nand gas  segment  specifically , and , moreover,  that analysts identified factors unrelated to the Baker \nHughes partnership in explaining  those metrics.  See Opp. at 43.  As alleged, the two phenomena \nare too attenuated : without more, C3’s disappointing RPO  metrics  could have materialized from \nthe concealed facts concerning the Baker Hughes arrangement , but they also could have \nmaterialized from “some other fact .”  First Solar , 881 F.3d at 753.  Given this, the Court cannot \nconclud e that Plaintiffs have plausibly  alleged that  “the very facts about which defendant [s] lied” \n(i.e. the size of Baker Hughes’ C3 -focused salesforce) “ caused [Plaintiffs’]  injuries”  (i.e. the \ndisappointing RPO metrics and ensuing decline of C3’s stock price).   McCabe , 494 F.3d at 431. \nPlaintiffs’ theory does not fare any better as applied to the purported insider sales .  Though \nthey argue that the sales (which occurred eight times between March and November 2021) caused \nC3’s stock price to drop, the Court is unable to conclude that the sales were a materialization of \nthe risks concealed regarding C3’s lack of access to Baker Hughes’ 12,000 -person salesforce.  \nEven assuming the truth of Plaintiff’s allegation that “[l]arge and unusual insider trading is often \nseen as a signal that the ins iders know something the market does not,” the allegations are \ninsufficient to allow the Court to conclude that the “something” was C3’s lack of access to Baker \nHughes’ 12,000 -person salesforce.  \n2. Corrective Disclosure  \nNext , Plaintiffs plead that on a Decem ber 1, 2021 conference call, Siebel disclosed the \ntruth about how Baker Hughes’ C3 -focused salesforce had been operating, which caused C3’s \nstock value to “plummet”  11.20%  the next day  to $30.04 – the lowest price of the year .30  Opp. at \n \n30 The Court understands Plaintiffs allegations to suggest that Siebel’s comments took place after \nthe market closed on December 1, 2021.  If that is correct,  the Court agrees with Defendants that \nonly the losses on December 2, 2021 are at issue.  C3 MTD at 31 –32.   Case 4:22-cv-01413-HSG     Document 154     Filed 02/22/24     Page 41 of 45 \n42 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  53–54, see CAC ¶¶ 193–202.  Defendants argue that Plaintiffs “fail to link the December 2, 2021 \nprice decline to Mr. Siebel’s comments on the December 1, 2021 earnings call concerning the \nreorganization of C3’s internal sales structure or the structure of the Baker Hughes p artnership,” \nand that there are  “far more plausible reason[s]” for the price decline  than Siebel’s comments.   C3 \nMTD  at 41.  They further contend that since the risk associated with strategy and partnership \nchanges were disclosed , revelation of those changes could not be a corrective disclosure.  Id. at 42.  \nThe Court finds that Plaintiffs have done enough at this stage to plead loss causation under \nthis corrective disclosure theory.  “[T]o prove loss causation by relying on one or more correc tive \ndisclosures, a plaintiff must show that: (1) a corrective disclosure revealed, in whole or in part, the \ntruth concealed by the defendant’s misstatements; and (2) disclosure of the truth caused the \ncompany’s stock price to decline and the inflation att ributable to the misstatements to dissipate.”  \nIn re BofI Holding, Inc. Sec. Litig. , 977 F.3d 781 , 791  (9th Cir. 2020 ).  As to the first prong, the \nCourt agrees that Siebel’s remarks on the December 1, 2021 earnings call disclosed what \npreviously was not : that C3 had not had access to Baker Hughes’ full 12,000 -person salesforce, \nand instead had been  working through a “new business unit” that “sat outside of Baker Hughes” \nstaffed with out “the people with the relationships and . . . quotas and . . . the deep industry \nexpertise.”  CAC ¶ 192.  As to the second prong, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have plausibly pled \nthat Siebel’s corrective disclosure caused the stock price to decline.  While Defendants conte nd \nthat independent factors other than the correctiv e disclosure  were  equally  capable of causing the \nDecember 2, 2021 stock drop, that deflection is unpersuasive  here.  Unlike the price dips \nfollowing the financial reporting and insider stock sales discussed above, the December price drop \nwas directly prece ded – by less than a day – by comments from Siebel that explicitly contradicted  \nthe near dozen public statements he had made over the prior year , and suggested that the structure \nand staffing of the Baker Hughes’ salesforce contributed to poor sales perfor mance.  These \ncomments furnish the analytical missing link between the concealed fact and the allegedly absent \nRPO growth.  CAC ¶ 190.  The notion that this revelation  (and its connection with the poor RPO \nmetrics)  was “a substantial factor” in the price d rop is made even more  plausible by the analyst \nreports published on December 2 that explicitly discuss  the Baker Hughes relationship and the C3 Case 4:22-cv-01413-HSG     Document 154     Filed 02/22/24     Page 42 of 45 \n43 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  sales apparatus  in dissecting the company’s financial reports .  CAC ¶¶ 195 –198; see Yaron , 2020 \nWL 6750568, at *5.  Accordingly, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs have adequately pled that \nDefendants’ December 1, 2021 disclosure of the alleged fraud (and the allegedly middling RPO \nmetrics  resulting from that claimed fraud) caused investor s’ losses.  \n******  \n While Plaintiffs have adequately pled falsity and loss causation as to the statements \nconcerning the size of BH’s C3 -focused salesforce, the Court GRANT S the C3 Defendants’ \nmotion to dismiss Plaintiffs’ Section 10(b) and Rule 10b -5 claims for failure to plead scienter with \nthe requi red particularity.  \nii. Section 20(a)  \nPlaintiffs also bring control person liability claims against the Individual Defendants and \nBaker Hughes under Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act.  Plaintiffs contend that because  of the \nIndividual Defendants’ positions within C3 and Baker Hughes’ position as a minority shareholder , \nthey were control persons within the meaning of Section 20.   \nLike Section 15 in the context of the Securities Act, Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act \nmakes certain “controlling” individuals liable for violations of § 10(b).   Zucco , 552 F.3d at 990.  \nIn order to prove a prima facie case under Section 20(a), a plaintiff must allege : “(1) a primary \nviolation of federal securities laws and (2) that the defen dant exercised “actual power or control” \nover the primary violator.”  Howard , 228 F.3d at 1065 .  \nDefendants  assert that the absence of a well -pled predicate violation of the Exchange Act \nsinks this claim .  C3 MTD at 34 –35; BH MTD at 8.  The Court agrees.  Accordingly, the Court \nGRANTS Defendants’ motions to dismiss Plaintiffs’ Section 20(a) claims.   See Zucco , 552 F.3d \nat 990.  \niii. Section 20A   \nPlaintiffs  allege that the Individual Defendants and Baker Hughes als o engaged in \nunlawful insider trading in violation of Section 20A of the Exchange Act.  CAC ¶¶ 255–69.  \nInsider trading is defined as “purchasing or selling a security while in possession of \nmaterial, nonpublic information.” 15 U.S.C. § 78t –1(a).  “Section  20A of the Exchange Act Case 4:22-cv-01413-HSG     Document 154     Filed 02/22/24     Page 43 of 45 \n44 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  creates a private cause of action for ‘contemporaneous’ insider trading.  To satisfy § 20A, a \nplaintiff must plead [(1)] a predicate violation of the securities laws; and (2) facts showing that the \ntrading activity of plaintiffs an d defendants occur [red]  ‘contemporaneously.’”  Hefler v. Wells \nFargo & Co. , No. 16 -cv-05479 -JST, 2018 WL 1070116 (N.D. Cal. Feb. 27, 2018) (quoting In re \nCountrywide Financial Corp. Sec. Litig. , 588 F. Supp. 2d 1132, 1174 –75 (C.D. Cal. 2008) ); see \nalso Johnson v. Aljian , 490 F.3d 778, 779 n. 8 (9th Cir.  2007).   \nDefendants  argue  that because the CAC fails to plead a primary violation of securities \nlaws, the insider trading  claims must also fail.  C3 MTD at 44; BH MTD at 10.  The Court agrees.  \nAccordingly,  the Court GRANTS Defendants’ motions to dismiss Plaintiffs’ Section 20(A) \nclaims .31  See Zucco , 552 F.3d at 990.  \nV. CONCLUSION  \nThe Court GRANTS IN PART and DENIES IN PART the C3 Defendants’ Motion to \nDismiss, Dkt. No. 105 , and GRANTS Defendant Baker Hughes’ Motion to dismiss.  Dkt. No. \n109.  Specifically, the Court:  \n• GRANTS the C3 Defendants’ motion to dismiss Plaintiffs’ Section 11 claims premised \nupon Statements #1 and #2 , but DENIES the motion to dismiss Plaintiffs’ Section 11 \nclaim s to the extent they are  premised on Statement #3.    \n• GRANTS the C3 Defendants’ motion to dismiss Plaintiffs’ claims arising under Items 303 \nand 105.   \n• GRANTS the C3 Defendants’ motion to dismis s Plaintiffs’ Section 15 claim against Abbo, \nbut DENIES that motion  as relates to  Siebel, Barter , and Simonelli .  \n• GRANTS the C3 Defendants’ motion to dismiss Plaintiffs’ Section 10(b) and Rule 10b -5 \n \n31 That said, the  Court  make s a few  observations about Plaintiffs’ 20A claims.  First, it reminds \nPlaintiffs that they cannot raise any unpled claim s, so if they intend to assert a Section 20A on \nbehalf of Plaintiff Zavalanski, they must plead one.  See CAC ¶ 256 (bringing Section 20A claims \n“on behalf of Lead Plaintiff, Plaintiff Linder, and all other members of a subclass . . .”).  Second, \nto the ex tent Simonelli did not make any trades of personally owned C3 stock, t he Court  reiterates \nthat it does not  see a basis for imputing Baker Hughes’ trades of C3 stock to him.  And finally, the \nCourt notes that unless and until a primary violation of the secu rities laws is properly pled, it need \nnot decide the bounds of the “contemporaneous” requirement or determine whether trades \ninvolving a purchase  price lower than the sale price are actionable.

No. 105 -2, \nand GRANTS IN PART and DENIES  IN PART Plaintiffs’ Request for Judicial Notice, Dkt. \nNo. 119 -7.  \nSince the Court cannot conclude that amendment would be futile, Plaintiffs may file an \namended complaint within 2 1 days of the date of this order.   When preparing an amended \ncomplaint, Plai ntiffs are further ordered to prepare a statement -by-statement chart of the \ninformation required by 15 U.S.C. § 78u -4(b)(1) and (2) that specifically identifies: (A) each \nstatement or action alleged to have been false or misleading, (B) the reasons the sta tement or \naction was false, misleading, or deceptive when made, and (C) if an allegation regarding the \nstatement or omission is made on information and belief, all facts on which the belief is formed.  \nThe chart should clearly identify which statements or omissions are attributable to which \nDefendants, and include a detailed statement of the facts giving rise to a strong inference that each \ndefendant acted with the required state of mind.  Plaintiffs should also summarize their allegations \nregarding what ea ch Defendant knew with regard to the statement or omission, and when they \nknew it.  Such a chart should be included within any amended complaint or attached to any \namended complaint.  For guidance on the format for such a chart, the Court directs Plaintiff s to \nreview In re NVIDIA Corp. Sec. Litig. , 18-cv-07669 -HSG, Dkt.

    "summary": "1. **Summary:** In this case, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) brought action against Automators LLC and related entities and individuals, alleging deceptive practices in violation of the FTC Act and other regulations. These practices were connected to misleading income claims and the misuse of automation tools, including artificial intelligence (AI), to mislead consumers about potential earning opportunities. The court granted a preliminary injunction to enforce restrictions on the defendants' business activities, freeze their assets, and appoint a receiver to manage the assets, thus vacating the need for a hearing.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue:** The main legal issue in the case was whether Automators LLC and related parties engaged in deceptive business practices, including false earnings claims and misuse of AI, violating the Federal Trade Commission Act and related regulations.\n\n3. **Court's Holding:** The court granted a stipulated preliminary injunction against the defendants, thereby restraining them from making misleading earnings claims, freezing their assets, and appointing a receiver to manage their affairs. This decision supports the FTC's position that the defendants are likely in violation of the law and aims to prevent further consumer harm.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation:** The FTC sued a group of companies and their leaders because they made unrealistic promises to people about getting rich using AI. The court agreed with the FTC and put restrictions on the companies, making sure they can't continue their deceptive practices or access their money freely, until the case is resolved more permanently.",

(TRO App., ECF No. 5-1.)  The \nCourt issued an ex parte  Temporary Restraining Order against Defendants and Relief \nDefendant on August 11, 2023, which includes an asset freeze, appointment of a temporary \nreceiver over the Receivership Entities (as defined below), and other equitable relief \n(Docket No. 8). \n On September 8, 2023, the FTC moved jointly with Automators LLC, also d/b/a \nAutomators AI and Ecom Skool; Empire  Ecommerce LLC; Onyx Distribution LLC; \nStryder Holdings LLC; Pelenea Ventures LLC; Roman Cresto; John Cresto; and Andrew Chapman (referred to above, collectively, as  “Defendants”); and Peregrine Worldwide, \nLLC (referred to above as “Relief Defendant” ) for the entry of a preliminary injunction \n(“P.I.”) as to Defendants and Relief Defendant.  (ECF No. 47.)  \nLEGAL STANDARD  \n A preliminary injunction generally is cons idered “an extraordinary remedy that may \nonly be awarded upon a clear showing that the plaintiff is entitled to such relief.”  Winter \nv. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc. , 555 U.S. 7, 22 (2008).  To obtain a preliminary injunction, \nthe movant must show:  (1) a likelihood of success on the merits; (2) a likelihood of \nirreparable harm to the movant in the absence of preliminary relief; (3) that the balance of equities tips in favor of the moving party; and (4) that an injunction is in the public interest.  \nWinter , 555 U.S. 7 at 20.  When the government is a party, the final two factors merge into \na single inquiry.  Drakes Bay Oyster Co. v. Howell , 747 F.3d 1073, 1092 (9th Cir. 2014) \n(citing Nken v. Holder , 556 U.S. 418, 435 (2009)). \nBACKGROUND AND FINDINGS  \n The FTC filed a substantial volume of declarations and exhibits in support of its \nTRO Application, in addition to detailed allegations in its Complaint.  ( See ECF Nos. 5-2 \nto 5-24.)  The Court reviewed those materials in connection with the FTC’s TRO \nApplication, and granted the FTC’s request on that basis.  (ECF No. 8.)  The P.I. that the parties seek by their Joint Motion also is premised largely upon those materials.  ( See ECF Case 3:23-cv-01444-DMS-BGS   Document 48   Filed 09/08/23   PageID.<pageID>   Page 2 of 26 \n3 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 5 6 \n7 \n8 9 \n10 11 \n12 \n13 14 15 \n16 \n17 18 19 \n20 \n21 22 23 \n24 \n25 26 27 28 No. 47.)  Based on those materials, and the J oint Motion itself, the Court makes the ensuing \nfindings for the limited purpose of the instant P.I. only. \nA. This Court has jurisdiction over the subject matter of this case, and there is \ngood cause to believe that it will have jurisd iction over all parties hereto and that venue in \nthis district is proper.  \nB. Defendants and Relief Defendant cons ent to the entry of this Stipulated \nPreliminary Injunction, but reserve all rights to contest or challenge the authority of the \nFTC to seek and this Court to award any further relief sought by the FTC. \nC. The FTC alleges that there is good cause to believe that Defendants have \nengaged in and are likely to engage in acts or practices that violate Section 5(a) of the FTC \nAct, 15 U.S.C. § 45(a), the Business Opportunity Rule, and the CRFA and that the FTC is \ntherefore likely to prevail on the merits of this action. \nD. The FTC alleges that there is good cause to believe that immediate and \nirreparable harm will result from Defendants’ ongoing violations of the FTC Act, the \nBusiness Opportunity Rule, and the CRFA unless Defendants continue to be restrained and \nenjoined by order of this Court. \nE. The FTC alleges that there is good cause to believe that immediate and \nirreparable damage to the Court’s ability to grant effective final relief for consumers – \nincluding monetary restitution, rescission, or refunds – will occur from the sale, transfer, \ndestruction or other disposition or concealment by Defendants or Relief Defendants of their \nassets or records, unless Defendants and Relief  Defendants continue to be restrained and \nenjoined by order of this Court. \nF. The FTC alleges that good cause exists for the Court to order: (1) the \ncontinued appointment of a Receiver over the Receivership Entities; (2) an asset freeze \nover all the assets of the Defendants; and (3) the ancillary relief described below.   \nG. This Order is in the public interest.

Summary:**\nThe Federal Trade Commission (FTC) filed a lawsuit against Automators LLC, doing business as Automators AI and Ecom Skool, and several other entities, alleging violations of the FTC Act, the Business Opportunity Rule, and the Consumer Review Fairness Act. The defendants were accused of deceptive practices related to e-commerce business opportunities, including overstating earning potentials and misrepresenting the capabilities of AI-driven business tools. The court issued a stipulated order imposing a permanent injunction on the defendants against selling or advertising certain business opportunities and ordered them to pay a monetary judgment of nearly $22 million.\n\n**2. Key Legal Issue:**\nWhether the defendants engaged in deceptive business practices in violation of consumer protection laws, specifically the FTC Act, the Business Opportunity Rule, and the Consumer Review Fairness Act.\n\n**3. Court's Holding:**\nThe court issued a permanent injunction against the defendants, prohibiting them from advertising or selling business opportunities related to e-commerce using misleading earnings claims or false representations about AI capabilities. Additionally, the court ordered a monetary judgment against the defendants totaling $21,765,902.65, while suspending part of the judgment contingent on the defendants' financial disclosures' accuracy.\n\n**4. ELI5 Explanation:**\nThe court found that a group of companies and people were misleading customers about the profits they could make from online businesses and how smart their technology was. They can't sell these business programs anymore and must pay back almost $22 million. The court made these decisions to protect customers from being tricked and to make sure the companies follow the rules in the future.",

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: This case is a consolidated class action lawsuit against Intrusion Inc. for alleged securities violations related to their cybersecurity product \"Intrusion Shield,\" which was claimed to use artificial intelligence (AI) to boost its stock price artificially. The parties reached a settlement of $3.25 million after accusations that the product did not perform as promised and the company's claims were misleading. The court approved the settlement agreement, certifying the class and awarding attorney's fees and expenses.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether Intrusion Inc. made false representations about its product, Intrusion Shield, to artificially inflate its stock price, thereby violating securities laws under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, specifically Sections 10(b) and 20(a).\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court approved the settlement agreement as fair, reasonable, and adequate for class members, granted class certification, and awarded attorney's fees and expenses. The court found that the proposed settlement and allocation plan were proper and there was no evidence of fraud or collusion.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine a company says it has made a fantastic new product that uses a bit of magic and advanced technology to stop online bad guys better than ever before. This news makes the company's shares really expensive. But it turns out, the product doesn't work like they said, and the shares’ price crashes. Some people who bought these shares felt tricked and took the company to court. In the end, they all decided to settle, meaning the company would pay them some money instead of continuing with a long court battle. The judge agreed this was a fair way to resolve the issue.",

No objections to the \nproposed settlement or valid requests for exclusion have been submitted. After full \nconsideratio n, the Court concludes that the proposed settlement should be approved \nand that the L ead Plaintiff and class counsel  should be awarded attorney’s fees and \nexpenses.  \n Therefore, the Court GRANTS  Lead Plaintiff Andrew Bronstein’s Unopposed \nMotion for Final Approval of Class Action Settlement and Plan of Allocation. \n(Dkt . #65). In doing so, the C ourt certifies the proposed class and disposes of all claims \nin this consolidated class action between Bronstein and the class members, on the \none hand, and Defendants Intrusion, Inc., Jack B. Blount, Michael L. Paxton, B. Case 4:21-cv-00374-SDJ     Document 11     Filed 12/16/22     Page 1 of 34 PageID #: \n<pageID>2 \n Franklin Byrd, T. Joe Head,1 Gary Davis, and James Gero (collectively, “Intrusion”), \non the other.  \n The Court also GRANTS Lead Counsel’s Motion for Award of Attorneys’ Fees \nand Reimbursement of Expenses. (Dkt.  #66).  \nI. BACKGROUND  \n Bronstein and Intrusion have agreed to settle the  claims  in this consolidated \nclass action for $3,250,000.00. The proposed settlement arises from more than a year \nof litigation surrounding Intrusion’s alleged  efforts to artificially boost its share price \nthrough misrepresentations regarding a new cybersecurity product: “Intrusion \nShield.” After obtaining preliminary approval of the proposed class settlement on \nAugust 17, 2022,  Bronstein and class counsel now seek final approval and an award \nof attorney’s fees and expenses.  \nA. Intrusion’s Efforts to Artificially Boost Its S hare  Price  \n Intrusion is a publicly traded cybersecurity company.  In the summer of 2020, \nit developed a new product that would supposedly “ revolutionize the  [network \nsecurity ] industry. ” (Dkt.  #38 ¶ 58). Intrusion described this new product, Intrusion \nShield, as blocking cyberthreats more effectively  than existing technologies on the \nmarket because it combined state -of-of the -art artificial intelligence tools with a \nproprietary database of 2.7 billion malicious IP addresses. (Dkt.  #38 ¶¶ 46, 58).  \n \n 1 The Amended Class Action Complaint, (Dkt.  #38), names “P. Joe Head” as a \nDefendant as opposed to “T. Joe Head.” This Order references  the Defendant as T. Joe Head \nbecause that is the name used in the Unopposed Motion f or Final Approval of Class Action \nSettlement. (Dkt.  #65).   Case 4:21-cv-00374-SDJ     Document 11     Filed 12/16/22     Page 2 of 34 PageID #: \n<pageID>3 \n  Intrusion Shield was marketed  through promotional videos  published on the \ninternet , investor calls, government  filings, and press releases. See, e.g. , (Dkt.  #38 \n¶¶ 47–48, 58, 60, 67 ). In one press release, for example, Intrusion announced that \nduring beta testing with thirteen companies  Intrusion Shield had suc cessfully \nblocked  more than 75 million cyberthreats emanating from over 800,000 unique \nmalicious entities. (Dkt.  #38 ¶ 60). In another press release,  Intrusion allegedly  \nasserted  that the product  could prevent “zero -day” attacks: in other words, attacks \nthat exploit previously unknown cybersecurity weaknesses. (Dkt.  #38 ¶¶  42, 65). \n These representations allegedly boosted Intrusion’s stock price to over $28.00 \nper share  by April 2021.  (Dkt.  #38 ¶ 125). But within a few months, Intrusion’s stock \nprice dropped to under $4.00 per share. (Dkt.  #38 ¶ 11). Bronstein alleges that the \nstock price dropped because Intrusion Shield did not perform as investors expected. \nFar from revolutionizing the  industry, it merely repackaged existing products. \n(Dkt.  #38 ¶ 2). And instead of shutting down cyberthreats, it shut down customer \ncomputer networks. (Dkt.  #38 ¶  7). Bronstein also alleges that, based on employee \nreports and third- party research, Intrusion’s representatio ns about the product were \nnot just false but knowingly false and calculated to boost Intrusion’s stock price ahead \nof a potential sale. See, e.g. , (Dkt.  #38 ¶¶ 1, 3, 8, 41, 119– 24).  \nB. The Resulting Class Action Litigation  \n Intrusion’s alleged misrepresenta tions regarding Intrusion Shield gave rise to \ntwo federal securities class actions  in this Court:  one filed in April 2021 , and the other  \nfiled in May of the same year. (Dkt.  #1, #31). After consolidating  these cases , \n(Dkt.  #31),  appoint ing Bronstein  as Lead Plaintiff, (Dkt.  #32 at 6–7), and appoint ing Case 4:21-cv-00374-SDJ     Document 11     Filed 12/16/22     Page 3 of 34 PageID #: \n<pageID>4 \n The Rosen Law Firm, P.A.  as class counsel  (and Steckler Wayne Cochran Cherry, \nPLLC as liaison counsel),  (Dkt.  #32 at 6 –7), the Court ordered Bronstein to file an \namended complaint. (Dkt.  #37).  \n Bronstein filed the amended complaint  on February 7,  2022 , asserting t wo \ncauses of action under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 : (1) violation of Section \n10(b) against all Defendants; and (2) violation of Section 20(a) against the individual \nDefendants.  (Dkt.  #38).  The amended complaint asserted damages against Intrusion \nunder a “fraud- on-the-market” theory —seeking to hold the comp any responsible for \nartificially  boosting  its share price through alleged misstatements regarding \nIntrusion Shield . (Dkt.  #38 ¶¶  11, 125 –29); see also Halliburton Co.  v. Erica P. John \nFund, Inc. , 573  U.S. 258, 268, 134 S.Ct. 2398, 189  L. Ed. 2d 339 (2014) .   \n Class counsel diligently litigated the case, achieving a proposed class \nsettlement in June 2022.  (Dkt.  #51). Class counsel’s efforts to secure the proposed \nsettlement included an extensive pre- suit investigation, consultations with damages \nexper ts, negotiations with opposing counsel, and participation in a full- day \nmediation.  (Dkt.  #65-2 ¶ 32).   \nC. The Proposed Class Action Settlement  \n The proposed class settlement disposes of all claims in this consolidated class \naction  for $3,250,000.00. The propo sed class settlement value represents 7.61% of the \nmaximum possible damages that could have been recovered at trial , according to \nBronstein’s damages calculations . (Dkt.  #65 at 19); (Dkt.  #65-2 ¶ 21).   \n The proposed class settlement  disposes of all claims  in this consolidated class \naction  not only between Bronstein and Intrusion, but also between Intrusion and the Case 4:21-cv-00374-SDJ     Document 11     Filed 12/16/22     Page 4 of 34 PageID #: \n<pageID>5 \n proposed class members. The proposed class includes any  person or entity  who \npurchased (or otherwise acquired)  Intrusion stock between Oct ober 14, 2020,  and \nAugust 26, 2021. (Dkt. #38 ¶ 1). Under the proposed settlement, each class member \nwould receive  a pro rata share of the settlement fund based on the number of shares \npurchased during the relevant period, accounting for both the purchase price and the \nsale price.  (Dkt.  55-1 at 7–10); (Dkt.  #65 at  24).   \n Following  the Court’s  preliminary approval of the proposed class action \nsettlement on  August 17, 2022,  (Dkt.  #56),  Bronstein diligently notified the potential \nclass members of the proposed settlement. P otential class members were notified by \nseveral  methods —including postcard notice , email notice, and a published summary \nnotice2—resulting in delivery of notices to nearly 29,000 potential class members. \n(Dkt.  #72-1 ¶ 3). Over 1,000 potential class members responded to the notice. \nSignificantly, no class members objected to the proposed settlement.  (Dkt.  #72-1 ¶ 8).  \nAnd only two class members requested exclusion from th e proposed settlement. \n(Dkt.  #72-1 ¶ 7). Those two requests are invalid, however, because they did not \ncomply with basic requirements for submitting a request for exclusion. (Dkt.  #72-1 \n¶ 7).    \n Bronstein now moves for final approval of the proposed  class  settlement and \nfor attorney’s fees and expenses.  (Dkt.  #65, #66).  Intrusion does not oppose these \nmotions. The Court held a settlement fairness hearing on November 30 , 2022,  to \n \n 2 These notices were delivered through a third- party administrator. The administrator \nalso maintained a webpage and toll -free line to inform class members of the settlement and \ninstruct them on submitting claims. (Dkt.  #72-1 ¶¶ 5 –6).

(Dkt.  #73). No class members appeared at the hearing. The November 9, \n2022,  deadline for objecting to the proposed class settlement or requesting exclusion \nfrom  it has passed. (Dkt.  #56 ¶ 37).  \nII. LEGAL STANDARD  \n The Court’s responsibilities in evaluating a class action settlement run not only \nto the named parties, but also to the unnamed class members. The Court must ensure \nthat the class members receive adequate notice of the settlement and an opportunity \nto object or request exclusion from it . FED. R. CIV. P. 23(e)(1);  Pettway  v. Am. Cast \nIron Pipe Co. , 576 F.2d 1157, 1219 (5th  Cir. 1978) . The Court also must ensure that \nthat the settlement is “fair, reasonable, and adequate” to the class members under \nthe four factors  enumerated in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(e)(2) : (1) adequacy \nof the representation,  (2) fairness of the negotiations (i.e., whether  the negotiations \nwere at arm’s length), (3) adequacy of the relief , and (4) equitability of treatment to  \nclass members . The adequacy of relief factor turns on several considerations , \nincluding  the risks of proceeding to trial.3 FED. R. CIV. P. 23(e)(2)(C).  \n In addition to the nonexclusive Rule 23 factors, courts in this c ircuit  often  \nconsider the Reed  factors in evaluating the fairness, reasonableness, and adequacy of \na proposed class settlement: “ (1) the existence of fraud or collusion  behind t he \n \n 3 The Rule 23 factors were added by amendment in 2018.

Instead, they were added \nto “focus the court and the lawyers on the core concerns of procedure and substance that \nshould guide the decision whether to approve the proposal .” Id.

Motors Corp. , 703  F.2d 170, 172 (5th  Cir. 1983)  (citations omitted) ; ODonnell v. \nHarris Cty ., No. 16 -CV-1414, 2019 WL 6219933, at *9 (S.D. Tex. Nov. 21, 2019) \n(observing that “courts in this circuit often combine [the Rule 23 and Reed factors] in \nanalyzing class settlements.” ). \nIII. DISCUSSION  \n The Court finds that the motion for final approval of the proposed class \nsettlement should be granted. The propos ed settlement is fair, reasonable, and \nadequate to the class members. The class members each received adequate notice of \nthe settlement and the settlement will be effectively distributed through the plan of \nallocation. The Court therefore certifies the proposed class, approves the class \nsettlement, and awards Bronstein and class counsel  the requested attorney’s fees and \nexpenses.   \nA. The Proposed Class Settlement Is Fair, Reasonable, and Adequate.  \n The proposed class settlement is fair, reasonable, and adequate under both the \nRule 23 and Reed factors.  \ni. Adequacy of Class Representation  \n The record establishes that Bronstein and class  counsel adequately \nrepresented the settlement class in litigatin g this complex securities case and in \nnegotiating the proposed settlement agreement. Bronstein is an Intrusion securities Case 4:21-cv-00374-SDJ     Document 11     Filed 12/16/22     Page 7 of 34 PageID #: \n<pageID>8 \n investor who suffered the same alleged injuries as the other class members. His \nmotivations are therefore aligned with the other class  members, reducing the \nlikelihood of a conflict of interest. In re Polaroid ERISA Litig. , 240  F.R.D. 65, 77 \n(S.D.N.Y. 2006)  (“Where plaintiffs and class members share the common goal of \nmaximizing recovery, there is no conflict of interest between the clas s representatives \nand other class members.”). Bronstein also actively participated in the case by \ncommunicating with counsel and participating in settlement negotiations , further \ndemonstrating the adequacy of his representation.  (Dkt.  #65-5 ¶¶ 3– 7).  \n Class counsel diligently prosecuted the case on behalf of the class. In addition \nto drafting pleadings and negotiating the settlement agreement, counsel also \ninvestigated the claims, retained a private investigator, consulted with damages \nexperts, drafted deta iled mediation statements, and participated in a full -day \nmediation. (Dkt.  #65-2 ¶ 32). Counsel was competent and informed and ably \nrepresented not only Bronstein, but also the proposed class. See Hays v. Eaton Grp. \nAttorneys, LLC , No. CV 17-88-JWD -RLB, 2019 WL 427331, at *9 (M.D.  La. Feb. 4, \n2019) ( approving class settlement agreement negotiated by “a law firm with \nsubstantial experience in litigating complex class actions ”).  \nii. Arm’s Length Negotiations, Fraud, and Collusion  \n The propos ed settlement agreement is not the product of fraud or collusion; \ninstead, it arises from extensive arm’s length negotiations between sophisticated counsel. The parties entered the proposed settlement agreement after a full -day \nmediation —which  “suggests th e settlement was not the result of improper dealings.”  \nErica P. John Fund, Inc.  v. Halliburton Co. , No. 3:02 -CV-1152- M, 2018 WL 1942227, Case 4:21-cv-00374-SDJ     Document 11     Filed 12/16/22     Page 8 of 34 PageID #: \n<pageID>9 \n at *4 (N.D.  Tex. Apr. 25, 2018).  The mediator , Jed D. Melnick,  had substantial \nexperience mediating complex securities actions, lending further support to the \nagreement’s legitimacy. See Gordon  v. Vanda Pharm. Inc. , No. 19 -CV-1108, 2022 WL \n4296092, at *4 (E.D.N.Y.  Sept. 15, 2022) (holding that mediation conducted by Jed D. \nMelnick, “a highly qualified mediator [,] strongly supports a finding that the \nnegotiations were conducted at  arm’s length without  collusion ”); In re China Med. \nCorp. Sec. Litig. , No. 8:11 -1061- JLS, 2014 WL 12581781, at *5 (C.D.  Cal. Jan.  7, 2014) \n(“Mr. Melnick ’s involvement in the settlement supports the argument that it is non -\ncollusive.”). In any event, the Court may presume the absence of any fraud or \ncollusion when, as here, no evidence has been presented to the contrary.  See Welsh  v. \nNavy Fed. Credit Union , No. 16 -CV-1062, 2018 WL 7283639, at *12 (W.D.  Tex. Aug. \n20, 2018)  (“The Court may . . . presume that no fraud or collusion occurred between \nopposing counsel in the absence of any evidence to the contrary.”) . \niii. Adequacy of Relief ; Expected Complexity, Expense, and Duration \nof the Litigation  \n The proposed settlement agreement provides adequate relief to the class. True, \nthe proposed $3,250,000.00 settlement represents only 7. 61% of the total recovery \nthat class members could have obtained at trial based on Bronstein’s damages model.  \n(Dkt.  #65 at 19); (Dkt.  #65-2 ¶ 21).  But federal courts have long recognized that, when \nfaced with the expense and unpredictability of ongoing litigation, it often makes good \nsense to settle for ev en small fractions of the total amount in controversy. Ayers v. \nThompson , 358 F.3d 356, 369 (5th Cir. 2004) (observing that settling “avoids the risks \nand burdens of potentially protracted litigation”).  Case 4:21-cv-00374-SDJ     Document 11     Filed 12/16/22     Page 9 of 34 PageID #: \n<pageID>10 \n  That is especially true when the case involves compl ex issues like those \npresented in this consolidated securities class action. Securities claims are \nparticularly  “difficult to prove ” because of the high bar for  establishing falsity an d \nscienter. Stott v. Capital Fin. Servs., Inc. , 277 F.R.D. 316, 343 (N.D . Tex. 2011); \nFishoff v. Coty Inc. , No. 09 -CV-628, 2010 WL 305358, at *2 (S.D.N.Y.  Jan. 25, 2010) \n(“[T]he element of scienter is often the most difficult and controversial aspect of a \nsecurities fraud claim.”), aff’d , 634 F.3d 647 (2d Cir. 2011). A trial w ould therefore \nlikely be “lengthy, burdensome, and  would  consume tremendous time and resources.” \nHays, 2019 WL 427331, at * 10. After the trial concluded, the losing party would likely \nappeal the judgement, causing further delay and additional expense.  \n Because any future recovery would be burdensome and unpredictable, \nBronstein opted for a settlement that is immediate and guaranteed. That settlement \nwill adequately and fairly compensate the class. This settlement is  also in line with \nother class settlement  agreements that have been approved by federal courts.4 See, \ne.g., Erica P. John Fund, Inc.  v. Halliburton Co. , No. 3:02 -CV-1152- M, 2018 WL \n1942227, at *5 (N.D.  Tex. Apr. 25, 2018)  (observing that courts frequently approve \nclass action settlements even when the settlement amount is a small fraction of what  \nclass plaintiffs could recover at trial ); City of Omaha Police & Fire Ret. Sys. v. LHC \nGrp., No. CIV. 6:12 -1609, 2015 WL 965696, at *7 (W.D. La. Mar. 3, 2015) (“The typical \nrecovery in  most class actions generally is three -to-six cents on the dollar.”).  \n \n 4 As explained below, see infra Part III(D), the proposed settlement is also adequate \nconsidering “the terms of any proposed award of attorney’s fees.” F ED. R. CIV. P. \n23(e)(2)(C)(i ii).   Case 4:21-cv-00374-SDJ     Document 11     Filed 12/16/22     Page 10 of 34 PageID #: \n<pageID>11 \n  The proposed settlement is adequate not only in its amount  considering the \nrisks of proceeding to trial , but also in two additional ways contemplated in Rule 23’s \nadequacy factor:  \n First , the proposed settlement’s  allocation plan distributes the settlement fund \nthrough a reasonable process. Counsel has retained a third -party administrator to \nprocess the claims, assist claimants in curing deficiencies, and distribute funds on a \npro rata b asis. (Dkt.  #72-1). The Court finds that the proposed distribution process \nwill adequately deliver settlement funds to the class members.  \n Second , the proposed settlement is reasonable considering any agreements \nmade in connection with the proposed settle ment . Although Intrusion may terminate \nthe proposed settlement under a confidential agreement if enough class members \nrequest exclusion from it, (Dkt.  #50 at 14– 15), the Court finds that this agreement is \nfair under the circumstances and does not undermine  the adequacy of the proposed \nsettlement’s relief to the class. See Erica P. John F und, Inc. , 2018 WL 1942227, at * 1, \n5 (approving a class settlement with a similar confidentiality provision ). The parties \nhave also filed a stipulation that publicly discloses the proposed settlement’s terms. \n(Dkt.  #55).  \niv. Equitable Distribution  \n The proposed settlement’s allocation plan equitably distributes proceeds \nbetween the class members. When an allocat ion plan is “formulated by competent \nand experienced counsel,” it will generally be upheld if it is supported by a “reasonable, rational basis.” In re IMAX Sec. Litig. , 283 F.R.D. 178, 192 \n(S.D.N.Y. 2012) (quotations omitted).  Case 4:21-cv-00374-SDJ     Document 11     Filed 12/16/22     Page 11 of 34 PageID #: \n<pageID>12 \n  Here, the allocation plan is  supported by a reasonable basis. It was developed \nwith the assistance of a damages consultant and provides each class member a pro \nrata share of the settlement fund based on the number of shares purchased during \nthe relevant period. (Dkt.  #55-1 at 7–10); (Dkt.  #65 at  24). In calculating each class \nmember’s pro rata share of the settlement fund, the allocation plan accounts for the timing and price of each purchase, as well as the timing and price of any eventual \nsale, as is common in securities class actio ns. See, e.g. , City of Omaha Police & Fire \nRet. Sys. , 2015 WL 965693, at *15 (approving a class action allocation plan in which \neach class member would receive a pro rata share of a recognized loss); N.Y. State \nTeachers’ Ret. Sys.  v. Gen. Motors Co. , 315 F .R.D. 226, 241 (E.D.  Mich. 2016), aff’d \nsub nom. Marro  v. N.Y. State Teachers’ Ret. Sys. , No. 16 -1821, 2017 WL 6398014 \n(6th Cir. Nov. 27, 2017) (collecting cases approving similar allocation plans).  \nv. Stage of Proceedings and Discovery Efforts  \n The stage  of proceedings and discovery efforts factor also weighs in favor of \napproving the proposed settlement. In evaluating this factor, the key issue is whether the parties and court possess sufficient information to “evaluate the merits of the \ncompeting positi ons.” Ayers, 358 F.3d at 369. Even when the parties “have not \nconducted much formal discovery,” this factor can be satisfied when other information demonstrates that the settlement should be approved. Klein v. O’Neal, Inc. , \n705 F.Supp.2d 632, 65 3 (N.D. Tex. 2010); see also  Union Asset Mgmt. Holding A.G.  v. \nDell, Inc. , 669 F.3d 632, 639 (5th  Cir. 2012) (“ [F]ormal discovery is not a prerequisite \nto approving a [class] settlement as reasonable. ”). That conclusion flows naturally \nfrom the general prin ciple that early settlements should be encouraged, not hindered, Case 4:21-cv-00374-SDJ     Document 11     Filed 12/16/22     Page 12 of 34 PageID #: \n<pageID>13 \n so long as the parties have obtained the “desired quantum of information necessary \nto achieve a settlement.” Jenkins v. Trustmark Nat’l Bank , 300 F.R.D. 291, 304 \n(S.D. Miss. 2014) (quotations  omitted).  \n Here, the parties have obtained ample information to achieve an informed \nsettlement. To begin, Bronstein’s counsel engaged in an extensive pre- suit \ninvestigation to determine the strength of the claims against Intrusion. (Dkt.  #65-2 \n¶ 32). This pre-suit investigation involved reviewing public documents, including \nSEC filings and analyst reports, and retaining a private investigator. (Dkt.  #65 \nat 15); (Dkt.  #65-2 ¶ 32). Following the pre- suit investigation, the parties extensively \nnegotiated the proposed settlement and participated in a full -day mediation with an \nexperienced mediator, which enabled the parties to develop a “full understanding of \nthe legal and factual issues surrounding [the] case” before agreeing to the proposed \nsettlement. Manchaca  v. Chater, 927 F.Supp. 962, 967 (E.D. Tex. 1996).  \nvi. Probability of Success on the Merits  \n The proposed settlement’s fairness, reasonableness, and adequacy is further \ndemonstrated by the uncertainty of success should the case proceed to trial. When there has been no showing of fraud or collusion , the probability of success is the most \nimportant factor in evaluating a proposed settlement. Smith v. Crystian , 91 F.App’x. \n952, 955 n.3 (5th  Cir. 2004) (per curiam) (citing Parker v. Anderson , 667 F.2d 1204, \n1209 (5th  Cir. 1982)). This factor requires the court to “compare the terms of the \nsettlement wi th the rewards the class would have been likely to receive following a \nsuccessful trial.” DeHoyos  v. Allstate Corp. , 240 F.R.D. 269, 287 (W.D. Tex. 2007). But \nin comparing the settlement’s terms with the potential rewards at trial, the c ourt Case 4:21-cv-00374-SDJ     Document 11     Filed 12/16/22     Page 13 of 34 PageID #: \n<pageID>14 \n must avoid “tr y[ing] the case in the settlement hearings.” Reed , 703 F.2d at 172. That \nwould undermine the settlement’s “very purpose,” which is to “avoid the delay and \nexpense of such a trial.”  Id. (quotations omitted ).  \n Here, the claims against Intrusion are hotly co ntested and difficult to prove. \nAgainst Bronstein’s efforts to develop these claims through extensive investigation \nand expert analysis, Intrusion has retained sophisticated counsel to oppose these \nefforts and would likely continue opposing them through tr ial and appeal. Intrusion \nwould no doubt challenge the sufficiency of Bronstein’s proof on a notoriously difficult \nelement in a securities claim: scienter. See Stott, 277 F.R.D. at 343 (noting that \nsecurities claims are “difficult to prove”).  \n Even if Bronstein established Intrusion’s liability for the alleged securities \nviolations, he would face additional challenges certifying a class and establishing \ndamages on a class -wide basis. For example,  it is likely that  Intrusion  would \nvigorously dispute the connection between  its alleged wrongdoing and the drop in its \nstock price. If Bronstein could prove that connection, Intrusion could still dispute \nwhat portion of the drop was attributable to its  actions as opposed to other causes.  \n The result would be a protracted battle of the experts that is avoided through \nthe proposed settlement. See In re Cendant Corp. Litig. , 264 F.3d 201, 236, 286 \n(3d Cir. 2001) (approving class action settlement in securities litigation in which \ncompeting positions on damages issu es would have devolved into a “battle of the \nexperts”); In re OCA, Inc. Sec. & Derivative Litig. , No. CV- 05-2165, 2009 WL 512081, \nat *14 (E.D. La. Mar. 2, 2009) (“Because the jury would have been faced with Case 4:21-cv-00374-SDJ     Document 11     Filed 12/16/22     Page 14 of 34 PageID #: \n<pageID>15 \n competing expert opinions, the resulting damage a ward would have been highly \nunpredictable.”).  \nvii. Range and Certainty of Recovery \n The range and certainty of recovery factor also weighs in favor of approving \nthe proposed settlement. In evaluating this factor, the Court must begin by \nestablishing a “ran ge of possible damages that could be recovered at trial.” Maher v. \nZapata Corp. , 714 F.2d 436, 460 (5th Cir. 1983) ( quotations omitted ). After \nestablishing the range of possible damages that could be recovered at trial, the Court then determines whether the settlement is “pegged at a [fair] point in the range” in \nlight of the “likelihood of prevailing at trial and other factors.” Id.  (quota tions \nomitted).    \n As explained in the discussion of the above factors, see supra Part III(A)(i) –(vi), \nBronstein and the class faced considerable risks in proceeding to trial. Considering these risks, it is far from guaranteed that the class would have rec overed even a \nfraction of the total amount in controversy. Thus, while the high end of the class’s \npotential recovery was $42.7 million , (Dkt.  #65 at 19), the low end of the class’s \npotential recovery was $0.00 —with the balance of probabilities weighing in  favor of \nrecovery closer to the low end than to the high end.  \n The $3,250,000.00 settlement is therefore pegged at a fair point in the range \nof total recovery. It represents 7. 61% of the class’s total potential recovery, which is \na respectable percentage  given the uncertainties of proceeding to trial, the \ncomplexities of class action lawsuits, and the difficulties in proving securities \nviolations.  (Dkt.  #65 at  19); (Dkt.  #65-2 ¶ 21). Indeed, it is common in class action Case 4:21-cv-00374-SDJ     Document 11     Filed 12/16/22     Page 15 of 34 PageID #: \n<pageID>16 \n lawsuits for plaintiffs to recover only “three -to-six cents on the dollar.” City of Omaha \nPolice & Fire Ret.

Opinions of Participants and Absent Class Members \n The virtually unanimous support for the proposed settlement also \ndemonstrates its fairness, reasonableness, and adequacy. The named parties and \nclass counsel all believe that the proposed settlement is a favorable outcome for both the active participants i n the litigation and the absent class members. That the \nparties and class counsel unanimously support the proposed settlement is an important fact weighing in favor of its approval because, “absent fraud, collusion, or \nthe like,” the Court “should be hesit ant to substitute its own judgment for that of \ncounsel.” Cotton v. Hinton , 559 F.2d 1326, 1330 (5th Cir. 1977). And here, the parties \nand counsel, all of whom are sophisticated, have vigorously defended their respective \npositions, lending further support f or the settlement’s fairness.  \n In addition to the named parties and class counsel, the absent class members \nalso appear to support the proposed settlement. Out of nearly 29,000 potential class \nmembers who received notice of the settlement, and more than 1 ,000 potential class \nmembers who responded to the notice, no potential class members objected to the proposed settlement or validly requested to be excluded from it. (Dkt.  #72-1 ¶¶ 7 –8). \nThis lack of objection from the class members supports the “adequacy of the \nsettlement.” Erica P. John Fund, Inc. , 2018 WL 1942227, at *5 (quotations omitted).   Case 4:21-cv-00374-SDJ     Document 11     Filed 12/16/22     Page 16 of 34 PageID #: \n<pageID>17 \n B. The Class Members Received Adequate Notice of the Proposed \nSettlement .  \n The Court also finds that the class members received adequate notice of the \nproposed settl ement. The adequacy of a class settlement notice is not governed by \n“rigid rules.” Wal -Mart Stores, Inc.  v. Visa U.S.A., Inc., 396  F.3d 96, 114 (2d  Cir. \n2005) ; Erica P. John Fund, Inc. , 2018 WL 1942227, at * 3 n.1. Instead, the notice must \nsatisfy the “broad reasonableness standard []” imposed by due process and Rule 23(e).  \nIn re Katrina Canal Breaches Litig. , 628 F.3d 185, 197 (5th Cir. 2010) (quotations \nomitted).  To satisfy that standard,  the notice must provide cla ss members with \n“information reasonably necessary” to decide whether t o object to the settlement or \nnot. Id. The standard does not require, however, “actual notice to each party” to be \nbound by the settlement.  Erica P. John Fund, Inc. , 2018 WL 1942227, at * 3 n.1 (citing \nMullane v. Cent. Hanover Bank & Tr. Co. , 339 U.S. 306, 313 –14 (1950)) .  \n Here, the class notices were adequate both in  timing and content. In terms of \ntiming, class counsel published and distributed the class settlement notices f orty days \nbefore the deadline to object to the settlement. (Dkt.  #56 at 18– 19); (Dkt.  #72-1 ¶ 3). \nThese efforts resulted in delivery of notices  to nearly 29,000 potential class members \nby email or postcard before the objection deadline. (Dkt.  #72-1 ¶ 3). The Court finds, \ntherefore, that the notice procedures provided class members ample time to object to \nthe settlement if they  wished to do so. See DeJulius v. New England Health Care \nEmps. Pension Fund , 429  F.3d 935, 947 (10th  Cir. 2005) (holding that the class \nmembers received adequate notice of a class settlement when the notices were “sent \nout nearly two weeks prior to the settlement hearing”).  Case 4:21-cv-00374-SDJ     Document 11     Filed 12/16/22     Page 17 of 34 PageID #: \n<pageID>30 \n  Amount Involved and Results Obtained. The amount in controversy in this \ncase is significant: $42.7 million, according to Bronstein’s damages expert. (Dkt.  #65 \nat 19). Counsel obtained 7.61% of that amount through the pr oposed settlement.  \n(Dkt.  #65 at 19); (Dkt.  #65-2 ¶ 21).  Given that plaintiffs typically recover only “three -\nto-six cents on the dollar” in class actions, City of Omaha Police & Fire Ret. Sys. , 2015 \nWL 965696, at *7, that is a favorable result.  See also Parker v. Anderson , 667 F.2d \n1204, 1210 (5th  Cir. 1982) (observing that class settlements can be fair and adequate \neven when they “amount to a fraction of the potential recovery [at trial]” (quotations \nomitted)). This factor supports the requested fee award w ithout need for any \nadjustment.   \nTime Limitations; Nature and Length of Relationship with Client.  The \ntime limitations and client relationship factors also  do not require any adjustment to \nthe requested fee award. As for time limitations, the parties have not identified any \ntiming constraints  imposed by the clients or circumstances. Erica P. John Fund, 2018 \nWL 1942227, at *11 (“This factor does not apply in this case because there is no indication that Lead Plaintiff imposed any time limits in the prosecution of this \ncase.”); see also  In re Combustion, Inc. , 968 F.Supp. at 1135) (“Even though it is \napparent that the Johnson factors must be addressed to ensure  that the resulting fee \nis reasonable, not every factor need be necessarily considered.”).  \n And as for the nature and length of the client relationship, the Court finds that \nclass counsel ably represent ed the class beginning in 2021. Both class counsel and  \nBronstein actively participated in the litigation for its full duration. Considering Case 4:21-cv-00374-SDJ     Document 11     Filed 12/16/22     Page 30 of 34 PageID #: \n<pageID>31 \n counsel’s dedication to Bronstein and to the class stretching more than a year, the \nrequested fee award adequately compensates counsel. That conclusion is supported \nby Br onstein’s declaration, in which he states that  class counsel regularly discussed \nthe case with him, provided “periodic status reports,” and deserves the requested fees—all facts suggesting that the attorney -client relationship was strong. (Dkt.  #66-\n4 ¶¶ 5–6, 8–9); Erica P. John Fund, 2018 WL 1942227, at *12 (finding that this factor \nweighed in favor of a requested fee award when “the professional relationship with \nLead Plaintiff w as positive”).   \niii. Lodestar Cross- Check  \n A lodestar cross -check  confirms the reasonableness of the fees requested. The \nlodestar method focuses on the work performed as opposed to the recovery obtained. \nTo calculate the lodestar, the court multiplies the attorney’s hourly rate by the hours \nworked.  See Hobbs v. EVO Inc. , 7 F.4th 241, 259 (5th  Cir. 2021).  The burden is on the \nmoving party to establish the reasonableness of both the rate charged and the hours billed. McClain v. Lufkin Indus., Inc. , 649 F.3d 374, 381 (5th Cir. 2011); Swanston v. \nCity of Plano , No. 4:19 -CV-412, 2022 WL 3567059, at *2 (E.D. Tex. Aug. 18, 2022).   \n Here, counsel submitted affidavits and declarations supporting a lodestar \namount of $467,783.00. (Dkt.  #65-2 ¶ 33–34). The affidavits and declaration s do not \ninclude contemporaneous billing records , detailed time entries , or proof of the rate \ntypically charged in the community, as would typically be required to support a claim \nfor attorney’s fees. See Vaughan v. Lewisville In dep. Sch. Dist. , No. 4:19 -CV-109-SDJ, \n2021 WL 6125786, at *5 (E.D. Tex. Dec. 28, 2021); McClain , 649 F.3d at 381– 82. \nHowever, the submitted affidavits and declarations are sufficient under the Case 4:21-cv-00374-SDJ     Document 11     Filed 12/16/22     Page 31 of 34 PageID #: \n<pageID>32 \n circumstances . No party objected to the fee request. And the Court is employing the \nlodestar method only as a rough cross -check to confirm the reasonableness of the \npercentage award. Turner v. Murphy Oil  USA, Inc. , 472  F.Supp.2d 830, 867 (E.D.  La. \n2007)  (observing that , in performing a lodestar cross -check , the court need not \nscrutinize each time entry and  “representations by class counsel as to total hours \n[worked] may be sufficient” (quotations omitted)).  \n When a lodestar cross -check is applied to  a class -action fee aw ard in a common \nfund case , courts frequently use a multiplier ranging from one to four based on the \nJohnson factors. See, e.g. , Burford , 2012 WL 5471985, at *6 n.1 (approving a 1.78 \nmultiplier and remarking that court s frequently approve multipliers rangin g from \none to four); Di Giacomo v. Plains All Am. Pipeline , No. CV -99-4137, 2001 WL \n34633373, at *10– 11 (S.D.  Tex. Dec. 19, 2001)  (approving a 5.3 multiplier in a \nsecurities class action) .   \n Here, the Johnson factors, for the reasons explained above,  see supra Part \nIII(D)(ii),  support a $1,083,332.00 attorney’s fee  award —which is the lodestar amount \nmultiplied 2.32 times. That multiplier falls in the commonly accepted range. The \nCourt finds that the lodestar c ross-check confirms the reasonableness of the \nrequested fee award.  E. Bronstein and Class Counsel May Recover Reasonable Expenses .  \n \n Bronstein and class counsel may recover reasonable expenses  incurred during \nthe litigation . Bronstein requests $5,000.00 for the considerable time (approximately \nforty hours) he invested in the case communicating with counsel, reviewing Case 4:21-cv-00374-SDJ     Document 11     Filed 12/16/22     Page 32 of 34 PageID #: \n<pageID>33 \n documents, and participating in settlement negotiations. (Dkt.  #66-4 ¶¶ 3 –7, 11). \nBronstein’s request is author ized under the P SLRA,  which allows a lead plaintiff to \nrecover “reasonable costs and expenses (including lost wages)  directly relating to \nrepresentation of the class.” 15 U.S.C. § 78u -4(a)(4).  \n The Court agrees  that Bronstein invested considerable time and  effort to this \ncase and awards Bronstein  the requested recovery of $5,000 . The award is below what \ncourts have awarded in other class action  cases. See, e.g. , Burford , 2012 WL 5471985, \nat *6 (awarding named plaintiffs up to $15,000.00 in compensation for efforts \nexpend ed representing the class) ; In re Catfish Antitrust Litig. , 939 F.Supp. 493, 504 \n(N.D. Miss. 1996) (awarding $10,000.00).  \n Class Counsel request  reimbursement in the amount of $35,216.89 for \nexpenses incurred representing the  class. (Dkt. #66 at 27, 30 ). Counsel further \nrequests that these expenses be awarded out of the settlement fund in addition to the \n$1,083,332.00 in  attorney’s fees. Because no class member objected to the request , \ncounsel diligently represented the class, and  counsel incurred considerable expense \nwith no guarantee of recovery, the Court finds that the requested amount is \nreasonable under the circumstances and will be awarded.  \nIV. CONCLUSION  \n The parties and counsel have diligently litigated these consolidated  cases and \nachieved a favorable settlement not only for the named parties, but also for the absent class members. The reasonableness of the settlement is reflected by the lack of any \nobjection to it. The Court finds that the proposed settlement  should be approved, the \nclass certified, and the requested fees and expenses awarded.  Case 4:21-cv-00374-SDJ     Document 11     Filed 12/16/22     Page 33 of 34 PageID #: \n<pageID>34 \n  It is therefore ORDERED as follows:  \n1. The Court finally approves the proposed settlement agreement, (Dkt.  #55), as \nfair, reasonable, and adequate under the Federal Rule s of Civil Procedure. Its \nterms shall bind all class members.  \n \n2. The Court finally certifies a class of persons or entities that purchased or otherwise acquired Intrusion, Inc. common stock between October 1 4, 2020,  \nand August 26, 2021, both dates inclusive,  and were damaged thereby. The \ncertified class excludes: (a) Defendants; (b) Intrusion, Inc.’s officers, directors, \nand affiliates, at all relevant times; (c) Intrusion. Inc.’s employee retirement or \nbenefit plan(s) and their participants or beneficiaries to the extent they purchased or acquired Intrusion, Inc. stock through any such plan(s); (d) any entity in which Defendants have or had controlling interest; (e) immediate \nfamily members of any excluded person; (f) the legal representatives, heirs, \nsuccess ors, or assigns of any excluded person or entity; and (g) all those who \nsubmit timely and valid requests  for exclusion.  \n \n3. The Court dismisses with prejudice all claims in this action between the class \nand Defendants.  \n \n4. The Court approves the parties’ propo sed allocation plan as a fair and \nreasonable method of allocating the settlement fund among class members. The Court directs the parties to distribute  through the claims administer  the \nsettlement fund in accordance with the settlement agreement and stipula tion. \n(Dkt.  #55).  \n \n5.  The Court awards class counsel $1,083,332.00 in attorney’s fees and \n$35,216.89 in expenses. The Court awards lead Plaintiff Andrew Bronstein \n$5,000.00 for expenses.   \n \n  \n \n \n Case 4:21-cv-00374-SDJ     Document 11     Filed 12/16/22     Page 34 of 34 PageID #: \n<pageID>",

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: This case involves a securities class action lawsuit against Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (PANW) and its executives, who are accused of making misleading statements about the company's financial health. The plaintiffs argue that PANW's representations about its business strategies and financial outlook were false, leading to financial losses for investors. The court dismissed the case, finding that the plaintiffs did not sufficiently show that any statements were misleading when made or that the defendants acted with intent to deceive. The case does involve AI, as PANW's AI-enhanced security platforms were part of the allegedly misleading business strategies.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: The key legal issue is whether PANW and its executives made materially false or misleading statements in violation of the Securities Exchange Act, and whether they acted with the requisite scienter, i.e., knowledge or intent to deceive, manipulate, or defraud investors.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court granted the defendants' motion to dismiss the amended complaint without prejudice. The court found that the plaintiffs failed to adequately allege that the defendants' statements were materially false or misleading when made or that they were made with scienter. The court also found that related claims under Section 20(a) for control person liability and Section 20A for insider trading failed due to the insufficiency of the underlying Section 10(b) claim.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: This court case is about investors suing a cybersecurity company, claiming that the company lied to them about how well it was doing financially and about its new tech products, including AI stuff. The investors were upset because they lost money when the company's stock price dropped. The court, however, said that the investors didn't present enough evidence to show the company actually lied or meant to trick them, so it dismissed the case but allowed the investors to try again if they can come up with more convincing evidence.",

BACKGROUND  \nA. Parties  \nLead Plaintiffs Ron and Michele Nabhan are individual investors who purchased \nshares of PANW common stock between August 21, 2023 and February 20, 2024 .  Am . \nCompl . (AC) (dkt. 65) ¶ 25.  The purported class of plaintiffs also purchased PANW \ncommon stock or exercised put options of PANW in the same time period .  Id. ¶ 1. \nDefendant PANW  is a multinational cybersecurity company headquartered in Santa \nClara, California.  Id. ¶ 26.  The three individual defendants are Nikesh Arora, PANW’s Case 3:24-cv-01156-CRB     Document 75     Filed 04/11/25     Page 1 of 21 \n2 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  CEO; Dipak Golechha, PANW’s CFO; and Lee Klarich, PANW’s chief product officer.  \nId. ¶¶ 27–29. \nB. Factual Background   \nPANW sells network security products, AI -enhanced cloud security platforms, and \nsecurity operations products, among others.  Id. ¶¶ 39 –40.  In 2023 PANW began an \nongoing “platformization strategy” —a targeted sales tactic whereby PANW consolidated \nvarious standalone products into a unified “platform” product with the goal of bringing \n“various security functions under one roof” and “ capturing more business from its \ncompetitors.”  Id. ¶¶ 45, 52.  PANW also incorporated platformization in dealings with its \nfederal clients ; this made up a large portion of PANW’s billings revenue.  Id. ¶¶ 52, 61 –62. \nOn August 18, 2023, PANW announced its revenue and billings guidance for the \nupcoming FY2024.  Id. ¶ 78.  Then, on November 15, PANW announced its Q1 2024 \nresults and provided updated guidance.  Id. ¶¶ 95,  97.  PANW (1)  reported that it met its \nrevenue guidance but fell short of its billings guidance during Q1 2024, (2)  announced \nlower billings guidance for Q2 2024, and (3)  lowered the FY2024 billings guidance.  Id.; \nNov. 15 Earnings Call Slides (dkt. 66 -6) at 17.  Golechha publicly attributed the impacts \non billings to “more customers asking for deferred payment terms” and “some customers \n… looking for additional discounts for upfront payments.”  AC ¶  114. \nOn February 20, 2024, PANW reported that it met its Q2 2024 billings and revenue \nguidance, announced its Q3 2024 guidance, and again updated its FY2024 guidance.  Id. \n¶ 126; Feb. 20 Earnings Call Slides (dkt. 66 -7) at 20.  Once again, PANW lowered its \nguidance.  AC ¶  126.  On the same day, Arora explained in an earnings call that the change \nin projections was “a consequence of us driving a shift in our strategy in want ing to \naccelerate both our platformization and consolidation and activating our AI leaders hip.”  \nId. ¶ 128.  He also told investors that several deals with the federal government for “large \nprojects” did not close, resulting in “a significant shortfall in [] U.S. federal government \nbusiness” that he expected to last through the end of 2024.  Id. ¶ 134.  He said that this \nshortfall “started off towards the end of Q1” and “worsened in Q2.”  Id. Case 3:24-cv-01156-CRB     Document 75     Filed 04/11/25     Page 2 of 21 \n3 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  That same day, Arora also announced that PANW would begin offering customers \ntransitional periods of free platform products to “build customer confidence” and lower \nrisk for customers as they transitioned out of their contracts with other security vendors.   \nId. ¶¶ 130–131, 133.  Golechha explained that this free product strategy would put \nimmediate pressure on their billings revenue, but Arora estimated that PANW would \nreturn to its growth rate within twelve months.  Id. ¶¶ 131–132. \nThe next day, PANW’s common stock price declined by over 28% per share —from \n$366.09 per share on February 20 to $261.97 per share on February 21.  Id. ¶ 167. \nC. Procedural  History  \nPlaintiffs filed this securities class action on February 26, 2024.  Compl. (dkt. 1).  In \nPlaintiffs’ amended complaint, they allege that PANW, Arora, Golechha, and Klarich \nmade false or misleading statements and material omissions about PANW’s business, \noperations, and prospects during that period, and that these statements and omissions \nresulted in significant losses to class members.  AC ¶  20.  To support these allegations, \nPlaintiffs offer statements from six confidential witnesses.  Id. ¶¶ 33 –38.  Plai ntiffs also \nallege that Arora engaged in insider trading.  \nFailures to disclose.  Plaintiffs allege that Defendants failed in August 2023 to \ndisclose that they planned to lower their year -over-year revenue and billings guidance, \nwhich they did in February 2024.  Id. ¶ 82.  Plaintiffs also allege that Defendants failed to \ndisclose (1)  that platformization was “not driving increased market share”; (2)  that demand \nwas slowing due to increased competition, so PANW was planning to start offer ing free \ntrial periods of its platform products; (3)  that PANW’s new artificial intelligence products \nwere “not driving platformization”; and (4)  that one of PANW’s federal government \ncontracts (Thunderdome) would not generate short -term revenue.  Id. ¶ 5. \nMisstatements.   Plaintiffs challenge 24 statements contained in various press \nreleases, earnings call transcripts, SEC filings, and conference call transcripts.  The \nstatements fall into three general categories:  \n• Category I , statements about platformization, product demand, and billings;  Case 3:24-cv-01156-CRB     Document 75     Filed 04/11/25     Page 3 of 21 \n4 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  • Category II , PANW’s FY2024 revenue and billings guidance announced on \nAugust 18, 2023 and revised on November 15, 2023; and  \n• Category III , risk factor disclosures regarding sales to government entities.  \nInsider trading.   Plaintiffs allege that Arora “dumped $160 million worth of his \nown shares” in a four -week span from November to December 2023 —two months before \nPANW launched its free platform product strategy.  Id. ¶ 4.  According to Plaintiffs, these \nsales were inconsistent with his prior stock sales.  Id. ¶ 149. \nPlaintiffs bring three counts under the Exchange Act: a Section 10(b) fraud claim \nagainst all Defendants; a Section 20(a) control person liability claim against Arora, \nGolechha, and Klarich; and a Section 20A insider trading claim against Arora.  Id. ¶¶ 182–\n194.  Defendants now move to dismiss the amended complaint.  \nII. LEGAL STANDARD  \nTo survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter to \nstate a claim that is facially plausible.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6); Ashcroft v. Iqbal , 556 U.S. \n662, 678 (2009).  A claim is facially plausible when “the plaintiff pleads factual content \nthat allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the \nmisconduct alleged.”  Ashcroft , 556 U.S. at 678.  The Court “must take all of the factual \nallegations in the complaint as true,” but it is “not bo und to accept as true a legal \nconclusion couched as a factual allegation.”  Id.1 \nA complaint alleging fraud must also “state with particularity the circumstances \nconstituting fraud.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(b); Kearns v. Ford Motor Co. , 567 F.3d 1120, 1125 \n \n1 In addition to the allegations in the AC, the Court can consider documents subject to \njudicial notice or incorporation by reference.  United States v. Ritchie , 342 F.3d 903, 908 \n(9th Cir. 2003) .  Defendants request judicial notice of publicly available communications \nand financial documents, including an SEC filing.  Request for Consideration (dkt. 67) at \n4.  Judicial notice of these documents is proper.  Metzler Inv. GMBH v. Corinthian Colls ., \nInc., 540 F.3d 1049, 1064 n.7 (9th Cir. 2008)  (publicly available financial documents);  \nWochos v. Tesla, Inc. , No. 17 -cv-05828 -CRB, 2019 WL 1332395, at *2 (N.D. Cal. Mar. \n25, 2019) (earnings call transcripts) .  Defendants further request that various statements \nand forms filed by Defendants be incorporated by reference because Plaintiffs refer to \nthem throughout the amended complaint  and rely on them as the basis for their claims. \nRequest for Consideration at 2.  This too is proper.  Khoja v.

Rule 9(b) requires a plaintiff to set forth the “who, what, when, where, \nand how” of the alleged fraud.  Vess v. Ciba Geigy Corp. USA , 317 F.3d 1097, 1106 (9th \nCir. 2003).  One purpose of Rule 9(b)’s heightened pleading requirement is to provide \nnotice to defendants of the specific fraudulent conduct against which they must defend.  \nBly-Magee v. California , 236 F.3d 1014, 1018 (9th Cir. 2001).  \nSecurities fraud claims must further meet the heightened pleading requirements of \nthe Private Securities Litigation Reform Act (PSLRA): “[T]he complaint shall specify each \nstatement alleged to have been misleading, the reason or reasons why the statement i s \nmisleading, and, if an allegation regarding the statement or omission is made on \ninformation and belief, the complaint shall state with particularity all facts on which that \nbelief is formed.”  15 U.S.C. § 78u -4(b)(1)(B); Tellabs, Inc. v. Makor Issues & Rights, \nLtd., 551 U.S. 308, 321 (2007).  \nIII. DISCUSSION  \nThe Court concludes that Plaintiffs fail to state a claim under Section 10(b) ; thus, \ntheir claims as to control -person liability under Section 20(a) and Section 20A fail  as well . \nA. Section 10(b) and Rule 10b -5 \nTo state a claim for securities fraud under Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act, a \nplaintiff must adequately allege “(1) a material misrepresentation or omission by the \ndefendant; (2) scienter; (3) a connection between the misrepresentation or omission and t he \npurchase or sale of a security; (4) reliance upon the misrepresentation or omission; (5) \neconomic loss; and (6) loss causation.”  ESG Cap . Partners, LP v. Stratos , 828 F.3d 1023, \n1032 (9th Cir. 2016) (citations omitted).  “SEC Rule 10b -5 implements [ section] 10(b) by \ndeclaring it unlawful: ‘(a)  To employ any device, scheme, or artifice to defraud, (b)  To \nmake any untrue statement of a material fact or to omit to state a material fact necessary in \norder to make the statements … not misleading, or (c)  To engage in any act, practice, or \ncourse of business which operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon any person, \nin connection with the purchase or sale of any security.’”  Tellabs , 551 U.S. at 318 \n(quoting 17 C.F.R. §  240.10b -5). Case 3:24-cv-01156-CRB     Document 75     Filed 04/11/25     Page 5 of 21 \n6 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  Plaintiffs’ Section 10(b) claim rests on 24 allegedly false and misleading statements \nmade by Defendants.  See AC ¶¶  78–123.  Defendants challenge the sufficiency of \nPlaintiffs’ allegations with respect to two elements: (1)  the falsity of their statements and \n(2) whether they were made with scienter.  Ultimately, Plaintiffs fail to plead facts with \nsufficient particularity to allege that any statements were false or materially misleading \nwhen made.  Plaintiffs also fail to plead particularized facts allegin g scienter.  \n1. Materially  false or misleading statements  \nTo prevail on a Section 10(b) claim, Plaintiffs must show either that Defendants’ \nstatements contained material falsehoods, see Dura Pharmaceuticals., Inc. v. Broudo , 544 \nU.S. 336, 341 (2005), or that Defendants’ statements omitted material information in a \nmanner that made the statements misleading, see Basic Inc. v. Levinson , 485 U.S. 224, \n231–32 (1988).  Materiality depends on whether “there is a substantial likelihood that a \nreasonable shareholder would consider” the information to be “important.”  Id. at 231 \n(citation omitted).  Certain types of statements are non -actionable, including puffery and \n“vague statements of optimism,” because most investors “know how to devalue the \noptimism of corporate executives.”  Police Ret. Sys. of St. Louis v. Intuitive Surgical, Inc. , \n759 F.3d 1051, 1060 (9th Cir. 2014).  \nFor an omission to be misleading and therefore actionable, “there must be a \nsubstantial likelihood that the disclosure of the omitted fact would have been viewed by \nthe reasonable investor as having significantly altered the ‘total mix’ of information made  \navailable.”  Basic , 485 U.S. at 231 –32 (citation omitted).  But “[ section] 10(b) and Rule \n10b-5(b) do not create an affirmative duty to disclose any and all material information.”  \nMatrixx Initiatives, Inc. v. Siracusano , 563 U.S. 27, 44 (2011).  These ru les “prohibit only \nmisleading and untrue statements, not statements that are incomplete.”  In re Rigel \nPharms., Inc. Sec. Litig. , 697 F.3d 869, 880 n.8 (9th Cir. 2012).  Disclosure is therefore \nrequired only if necessary to make statements  not misleading  “in the light of the \ncircumstances under which they were made.”  Id. (citing 17 C.F.R. § 240.10b -5(b)).  \nMoreover, a plaintiff “cannot rely on hindsight; rather, it must explain ‘why the Case 3:24-cv-01156-CRB     Document 75     Filed 04/11/25     Page 6 of 21 \n7 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  statements were false or misleading at the time they were made.’”  In re Cloudera, Inc. , \n121 F.4th 1180, 1187 (quoting Rigel , 697 F.3d at 876); see also  City of Roseville Emps.’ \nRet. Sys. v. Sterling Fin. Corp. , 47 F. Supp. 3d 1205, 1221 –22 (E.D. Wash. 2014) (“[A] \nplaintiff may not plead ‘fraud by hindsight,’ i.e. a complaint may not simply contrast a \ndefendant’s past optimism with less favorable actual results.”); In re Vantive Corp. Sec. \nLitig. , 283 F.3d 1079, 1084 –85 (9th Cir. 2002)  (“The purpose of [the  PSLRA’s] \nheightened pleading requirement was generally to eliminate abusive securities litigation \nand particularly to put an end to the practice of pleading fraud by hindsight.”) , abrogated \non other grounds by  Tellabs , 551 U.S. 308.  \nPlaintiffs challenge 24 statements that fall into three general categories.  Category I \nincludes statements about platformization, product demand, and billings.  Category II \nincludes statements drawn from PANW’s revenue and billings guidance.  Category III  \nincludes PANW’s risk disclosures regarding sales to government entities.  \na. Category  I (platformization, demand, and billings \nstatements)  \nPlaintiffs challenge 20 statements Defendants made about platformization, product \ndemand, and billings on the grounds that they omitted material information.  These \nstatements range from general comments on the strength and popularity of particular \nproducts ( see, e.g. , AC ¶¶  79, 101, 118) to statements about past sales and anticipated \nfuture sales ( see, e.g. , id. ¶ 112) to statements about billings strategies ( see, e.g. , id. ¶¶ 107, \n109–10).  Plaintiffs fail to allege that any of these statements were materially misleading.  \nMany of the challenged statements are non -actionable puffery or statements of \ncorporate optimism that include optimistic, upbeat, and otherwise non -verifiable opinion -\nbased expressions.  For instance, Plaintiffs challenge PANW’s statement that “[w]e \ncontinue to see strong interest across our next -generation security portfolio, and w e’re \nmaking progress on our  platformization journey.”  Id. ¶ 99; see also  id. ¶¶ 79, 83, 89, 91, \n93, 95, 103, 105, 120, 122.  Courts regularly find that similar statements are non -\nactionable.  See, e.g. , In re Splash Tech. Holdings., Inc. Sec. Litig. , 160 F. Supp. 2d 1059, Case 3:24-cv-01156-CRB     Document 75     Filed 04/11/25     Page 7 of 21 \n8 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  1077 (N.D. Cal. 2001) (words like “strong,” “robust,” “well -positioned,” and “solid,” \nwhen used to describe results, demand, strategy, and products, were not actionable); \nIntuitive , 759 F.3d at 1060 (statement that “there is potential for growth in the [] market” \nwas not actionable); In re Pivotal Sec. Litig. , No.  19-cv-03589 -CRB, 2020 WL 4193384, \nat *7 (N.D. Cal. Jul. 21, 2020) (statements about the “viral adoption” of a “leading” \nproduct that addressed a “rapidly growing market” were not actionable).  \nPlaintiffs note that “even general statements of optimism, when considered in \ncontext, may form a basis for a securities fraud claim if they address specific aspects of a \ncompany’s operation that the speaker knows to be performing poorly.”  Opp. at 8 –9 (citing \nIn re Quality Sys., Inc. Sec. Litig. , 865 F.3d 1130, 1143 (9th Cir. 2017)).  But Plaintiffs \nhave not adequately alleged that relevant aspects of PANW’s business operations were \nperforming poorly, much less that any speaker knew that to be the case.  P laintiffs also \nargue that some of the challenged statements were material to investors and therefore are \nnot mere puffery.  Opp. at 9.  To the extent any statements discussed material information  \n(and few did) , Plaintiffs fail to adequately allege that they were materially misleading . \nFor instance , eleven of the challenged statements discuss PANW’s platformization \nstrategy.  AC ¶¶  79, 83, 91, 93, 95, 99, 101, 103, 118, 120, 122.  Plaintiffs contend that \nplatformization was not as well -received in the market as promised and that Defendants \nfailed to  disclose those failures.  Id. ¶ 80.  Plaintiffs allege that the challenged statements \nabout platformization were misleading because Defendants failed to disclose material \ninformation about platformization’s weak reception in the market.  Id. ¶¶ 45–51, 66, 80.  \nAdditionally, Plaintiffs appear to contend that federal contracts were integral to the success \nof platformization but that many of the platform products could not actually be sold to the \ngovernment because they lacked requisite federal ce rtifications.  Id. ¶¶ 56–58, 80.  \nAccordingly, Plaintiffs allege, the se challenged statements were misleading because the \ncompany could not generate any revenue from platform sales to the government.  Id. \nFor the challenged statements about platformization to have been misleading, \nplatformization would have had to be failing at the time those statements were made , with Case 3:24-cv-01156-CRB     Document 75     Filed 04/11/25     Page 8 of 21 \n9 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  Defendants withholding that information from their investors.  Rather than allege specific \nfacts that would  demonstrate this, Plaintiffs rely on vague statements from confidential \nwitnesses that “numbers weren’t very good,” customer requests “slowed the sales process \ndown,” and the idea of offering free product “came up” at the end of the quarter.  Id. \n¶¶ 48–49.  Plaintiffs also allege that platformization could not have been succeeding to the \nextent Defendants claimed because the platformization strategy w as nothing new.  See, \ne.g., id. ¶ 53 (PANW “had always offered customers a way to add additional products onto \ntheir platforms” and “[p]latformization was ‘just a buzzword’”).  Similarly, Plaintiffs rely \non confidential witness statements to allege that PANW’s new AI offering, XSIAM, wa s \nnot driving increased platformization.  See, e.g., id. ¶ 66 (XSIAM was “not ready for prime \ntime” and customers “couldn’t get full functionality”); id. ¶ 67 (“the process of selling \nXSIAM took longer than other products”); id. ¶ 68 (“I didn’t sell a single XSIAM \nproduct”); id. (“[Confidential Witness] 6 did not hear about anyone … having sold the \nXSIAM platform.”).  To show that PANW could not sell platform products to federal \ncustomers, Plaintiffs rely on confidential witness statements that “the [Department of \nDefense] couldn ’t touch certain [PANW] products” because those products did not have \nthe highest level of federal certifications.  Id. ¶¶ 56 –58. \nNone of these vague accounts sufficiently allege that the challenged statements \nwere misleading when made.2  See Zucco Partners, LLC v. Digimarc Corp. , 552 F.3d 981, \n996 (9th Cir. 2009)  (rejecting as insufficient confidential witness accounts that “allege \nconclusory assertions”) , as amended  (Feb. 10, 2009).  Some of these accounts, like one \nconfidential witness “not hear[ing]” about any XSIAM sales or another’s report that \n \n2 Plaintiffs argue that disagreements over the reliability of confidential witnesses are \nimproper at this stage, but that is not the reason the confidential witnesses’ statements are \ninsufficient.  Rather, their accounts are vague, speculative, and concluso ry.  See Cloudera , \n121 F.4th at 1189 (conclusory assertions about the reasons for a company’s poor sales \nperformance and a conclusory assertion that a company’s “ products could not provide \nperformance comparable to its competitors ’” were “unsupported by details” and thus could \nnot “satisfy the particularity requirement of Rule 9(b) ”); cf. City of Sunrise  Firefighters’ \nPension Fund v. Oracle Corp. , 527 F. Supp. 3d 1151, 1179 (N.D. Cal. 2021) (confidential \nwitness accounts sufficiently particularized when they reported concrete internal metrics \nwith specific data points).  \nCase 3:24-cv-01156-CRB     Document 75     Filed 04/11/25     Page 9 of 21 \n10 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  “customers couldn’t get full functionality,” are unreliable hearsay.  AC ¶¶  66, 68.  Other s \nare plainly conclusory, such as one statement that platformization’s “numbers weren’t very \ngood”  and another’s that “we all knew about platformization, and we knew it wouldn’t \nwork.”   Id. ¶¶ 48, 55.  When confidential witnesses report only unreliable hearsay or make \nconclusory assertions, their reports are insufficient to show that any statements by \ndefendants were misleading. See Zucco , 552 F.3d at 996.  Some of the  confidential witness \nassertions are even inconsistent with reality, which further indicates unreliability.  For \ninstance, Plaintiffs cite confidential witness as saying he “never heard of a single sale” of \nXSIAM, but PANW announced $200 million in XSIAM sales in FY2023.  AC ¶  68; Nov. \n15 Earnings Call Transcript (dkt. 66 -16) at 7.  \nPlaintiffs’ allegations also fail because Plaintiffs do not allege with particularity \nhow any statements omitted material information and thereby “significantly altered the \n‘total mix’ of information made available” to investors.  See Basic , 485 U.S. at 231 –32 \n(citations omitted).  Nowhere do Plaintiffs allege particularized facts that would show that \ngeneral demand was declining, that demand for platform products was declining, or that \ndemand for platform products was low relative to demand  for other produ cts.3  Nowhere \ndo Plaintiffs provide data about actual sales of the platform products, actual AI product \nsales, the size of PANW’s market share, or how market share changed.  Without th ese or \nsimilar allegations, Plaintiffs do not adequately allege falsity . \nSimilarly, nowhere do Plaintiffs allege any facts that would  show  that PANW had \nalready decided to implement the free product strategy when the challenged statements \nwere made.  Plaintiffs allege that increased competition from other companies slowed \ndemand, so PANW’s “decision to implement free giveaways was in respons e to industry \ncompetition.”  AC at  20.  This, Plaintiffs allege, indicates that Defendants knew all along \n \n3 Plaintiffs point to lowered February 2024 guidance as an indication that platformization \nhad been failing all along.  At best this is fraud by hindsight, which is not a valid theory of \nfraud.  See Cloudera , 121 F.4th at 1187.  That PANW lowered its guidance in February \n2024 does not suffice to allege that platformization was failing months earlier, nor that \nstatements made months earlier were misleading.  \nCase 3:24-cv-01156-CRB     Document 75     Filed 04/11/25     Page 10 of 21 \n11 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  they would start offering free products to stem the flow of customers over to lower -priced \ncompetitors.4  See, e.g., id. ¶ 80.  The Ninth Circuit rejected similar speculation in \nCloudera .  121 F.4th at 1189 (unsupported assertions about the cause of a company’s “poor \nperformance” did not “satisfy the particularity requirement of Rule 9(b)”).  \nPlaintiffs also rely on a statement Arora made on an earnings call on February 20, \n2024 —the day that PANW announced its free product strategy —that PANW had “been \nquietly working” for six months to “develop programs” to “accelerate [its] \n[platformization] strategy further.”  AC ¶¶  80, 86, 148.  According to Plaintiffs, thi s was \ntantamount to an admission that platformization had been failing all along and that \nDefendants had been lying about it for months.  But Plaintiffs take Arora’s statement out \nof contex t: Arora said nothing about platformization not driving increased market share, \nplatform product sales slowing, or the platformization strategy not succeeding.  In fact, on \nthe same earnings call, Arora noted that the percentage of customers who purchased \nplatform products had increased in the last two years, announced several large sales of \nplatform products, noted that PANW “continued to drive large deals” involving platform \nproducts, noted that PANW was seeing market “share shift happening in our favor b ecause \nwe see customers consolidating,” and remarked that “the demand story is no different from \nprevious quarters.”  Feb. 20 Earnings Call Transcript (dkt. 66 -17) at 4 –7.  Plaintiffs do not \nallege, let alone with factual support, that these statements wer e false.  So it is wrong to \nallege that Arora was concealing the failures of platformization; to the contrary, the full \ntranscript shows him explaining how platformization was succeeding.  \nNor did anything else Arora said in the February 20 earnings call indicate that any \nchallenged statements about billings (AC ¶¶  85, 89, 95, 99, 107, 109 –10, 114) were \nmisleading.  All he said was that PANW “was beginning  to notice customers [were] facing \n \n4 Plaintiff cites In re Apple Inc. Sec. Litig. , 2020 WL 6482014, at *6 –7 (N.D. Cal. Nov. 4, \n2020), in which a defendant “cut production lines” due to low demand after representing to \nits investors only four days prior that the company was not “experiencing [demand] \npressure” and the court found plausi ble the plaintiff’s allegation that the challenged \nstatement was misleading.  Id.  The six-month timeline in this case is significantly longer \nthan the four days in Apple .  See id. \nCase 3:24-cv-01156-CRB     Document 75     Filed 04/11/25     Page 11 of 21 \n12 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  spending fatigue” and “ beginning  to see rogue behavior” from competitors , and that the \nfree product strategy was one way to “accelerate platformization and consolidation.”  Feb. \n20 Earnings Call Transcript at 6 –7 (emphasis added).  But Plaintiffs offer no factual \nallegations to show that Defendants had decided to offer free pro ducts at the time that the \nstatements were made.5  And “later, sobering revelations do not by themselves make [an] \nearlier, cheerier statement a falsehood.”  Cloudera , 121 F.4th at 1189 (citation omitted).  \nUltimately, Arora’s statements do not provide a basis for Plaintiffs’ overarching \nallegations that PANW was keeping secrets from its investors or engaging in fraud to \nartificially inflate PANW’s billings and revenue  guidance.  \nEven if Defendants had been planning on launching their free product strategy for \nseveral months, Plaintiffs have not alleged that Defendants had a duty to disclose that \ninformation.  Despite Plaintiffs’ allegation that “Defendants were assuring investors that \n[PANW] could avoid offering discounts by allowing customers to pay substantially in full \non a deferred basis,” AC ¶  86, Plaintiffs never identify any statement that created the \nimpression that PANW was not discounting (or would not discount) its produ cts.  The \nclosest that Plaintiffs come is identifying statements that some customers wanted discounts \nthat PANW did not want to give, and that PANW offered those customers deferred \npayment plans instead of discounts.  Id. ¶¶ 85, 89, 109, 114.  Such statements do not \nimpose a duty on Defendants to disclose whether they were —or were not —planning to \noffer discounts.6 \nNot only do Plaintiffs fail to show that Defendants hid material information about \ndemand or competition from investors, they also fail to show that demand was declining or \n \n5 One confidential witness states that the topic of offering free products “came up” at the \nend of 2023.  AC ¶ 48.  But this does not demonstrate that PANW “was already planning \nto offer significant discounts to induce customers to adopt platformization” six months \nearlier, as Plaintiffs contend.  Id. ¶¶ 48, 86.  \n6 Plaintiffs also argue that “insiders in possession of material nonpublic information must \ndisclose that information to shareholders or refrain from trading with them ,” so Arora’s \nstock sales triggered a duty to disclose information  to shareholders .  Opp . at 8 (citing \nMcCormick v. Fund Am. Co s., 26 F.3d 869, 876 (9th Cir. 1994)).  The Court does not \nneed to reach the holdings of Plaintiffs’ cited cases because Plaintiffs do not allege with \nparticularity that Arora was in possession of any material nonpublic information.  \nCase 3:24-cv-01156-CRB     Document 75     Filed 04/11/25     Page 12 of 21 \n13 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  that PANW was struggling to compete.  Statements from confidential witnesses that they \n“got a clear understanding at those meetings that we weren’t selling [much],” id. ¶ 59, are \nnot specific enough.  And one of Plaintiffs confidential witnesses even admits the \nexistence of high demand.  Id. ¶ 69 (increased pace of XSIAM’s development and rollout \nwas because of “customer demand”).  Plaintiffs allege the existence of competitors, but \nthey offer no factual allegations to support their conclusory allegation that PANW “was \nstruggling to compete in  a competitive environment.”  Id. ¶¶ 70–77.  Plus, PANW’s \ninvestors had contemporaneous access to material details about platformization and \ncompetition that could have corroborated (or undermined) the challenged statements.  See, \ne.g., Aug. 18 Earnings Ca ll Slides (dkt. 66 -13) at 6 –8, 11, 100, 108 (disclosing the \nproportion of PANW’s largest deals that were “platformization” transactions, the growth \nof multi -module customers, and the ratio of total customers who had purchased products \n“across all 3 platfor ms”); Nov. 15 Earnings Call Slides at 6, 9, 12 (disclosing the growth of \nmulti -module customers and the value of XSIAM bookings in 2023); FY2023 Annual \nReport (dkt. 66 -14) at 14, 19 –20 (disclosing risks); Q1 2024 Quarterly Report (dkt. 66 -15) \nat 36, 41 –42 (same).  Plaintiffs have not alleged any omission that would have \nsignificantly altered the total mix of information available to investors . \nFinally, Plaintiffs fail to allege that Defendants’ representations about future federal \ncontracts made any of the challenged statements misleading.  Plaintiffs allege that platform \nproduct sales to government entities “made up the majority of [PANW’s] bil ling revenue,” \nbut that those sales were faltering, so Defendants’ statements about platformization \n“driving large deal momentum” were misleading.  Id. ¶¶ 52, 63.  But Plaintiffs do not \nprovide any factual allegations that would demonstrate that the lack o f certifications for \nthese “certain products” had a material effect on overall sales of those platform products.  \nNor do they identify which products required which certifications, which government \nentities could still buy products without specific certifi cations, or how any lack of \ncertifications affected platformization as a whole.  Standing alone, the confidential witness \nstatements that the Department of Defense could not purchase “certain [PANW] products” Case 3:24-cv-01156-CRB     Document 75     Filed 04/11/25     Page 13 of 21 \n14 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  are not enough to allege the misleading nature of the challenged statements.  Id. ¶ 56.  \nPlaintiffs do not even allege any representation from PANW that the products did have \nsuch certifications.  Because Plaintiffs did not allege  facts sufficient to show that a lack of \ncertifications materially affected PANW’s sales to government entities, they fail to \nadequately allege that Defendants’ statements about platformization driving government \nsales were misleading.  \nb. Category II (guidance  statements ) \nPlaintiffs challenge two revenue and billings guidance statements: the August 18, \n2023 guidance statement, AC ¶  81, and the November 15, 2023 guidance statement, id. \n¶ 97.  These guidance statements are protected by the PSLRA’s safe harbor rule.  \nThe PSLRA carves out a safe harbor from liability for statements that are identified \nas “forward -looking” and are “accompanied by meaningful cautionary statements.”  15 \nU.S.C. §  78u-5(c)(1)(A)(i).  A forward -looking statement is “any statement regarding \n(1) financial projections, (2)  plans and objectives of management for future operations, \n(3) future economic performance, or (4)  the assumptions ‘underlying or related to’ any of \nthese issues.”  No. 84 Employer -Teamster Joint Council Pension Trust Fund v. Am . W. \nHolding Corp. , 320 F.3d 920, 936 (9th Cir. 2003).  “[I]f a forward -looking statement is \nidentified as such and accompanied by meaningful cautionary statements … the statement \nis not actionable.”  In re Cutera Sec. Litig. , 610 F.3d 1103, 1112 (9th Cir. 2010).  A \nforward -looking statement is also non -actionable when the plaintiff fails to allege that it \nwas made with “actual knowledge that the statement was false or misleading.”  Id. at 1111 \n(citing 15 U.S.C. §  78u–5(c)(1)(B)).  Guidance statements, like  earnings projections, are \nforward -looking statements “by definition.”  See id. \nPlaintiffs erroneously claim that Defendants’ guidance statements were not \nidentified as forward -looking.  AC ¶  171.  But see  Aug. 18 Form 8 -K (dkt. 66 -5) at 6 \n(“This press release contains forward -looking statements ”); Nov. 15 Form 8 -K (dkt. 66 -10) \nat 5 (same).  They  contend that the “boilerplate” cautionary statements accompanying the \nguidance statements were not “meaningful,” so the safe harbor rule does not apply.  Opp. Case 3:24-cv-01156-CRB     Document 75     Filed 04/11/25     Page 14 of 21 \n15 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  at 10 –11.  But PANW’s guidance statements specifically incorporated risk factor \ndisclosures that referenced the exact kinds of risks that PANW faced.  See, e.g. , May 24 \nForm 10 -Q (dkt. 66 -3) at 43, 50; FY2023 Annual Report at 18, 20; Q1 2024 Quarterly \nReport at 40, 42.  Plaintiffs also argue that the risk factor disclosures failed to reference \nknown developments that made the identified risks more likely to come to fruition —that \nplatformization was already failing, and that a key federal contract called Thu nderdome \nwas already not materializing.  Opp. at 11; AC ¶¶ 61, 63.  But this argument fails because \nPlaintiffs fail to allege facts that would establish that platformization was already failing or \nthat Thunderdome was not materializing when the statements were made, let alone that \nDefendants knew of those developments.  \nc. Category III (risk disclosure statements)  \nFinally, Plaintiffs challenge two of PANW’s risk disclosure statements as \nmisleading: the September 1, 2023 risk disclosure statement, AC ¶  87, and the November \n17, 2023 risk disclosure statement, id. ¶ 116.  Plaintiffs fail to plead with sufficient \nparticularity that these statements were misleading.  \nAs Plaintiffs correctly note, allegations are “sufficient to survive a motion to \ndismiss when the complaint plausibly allege[s] that a company’s SEC filings warn[] that \nrisks ‘could’ occur when, in fact, those risks had already materialized.”  In re Facebook, \nInc. Sec. Litig. , 87 F.4th 934, 948 –49 (9th Cir. 2023).  The challenged statements warn of \nthe risks inherent to sales to government entities: such sales can be “highly competitive,” \ncertification requirements may “restrict[] our ability to sell into t he federal government \nsector,” and funding restrictions may “adversely affect[] public sector demand.”  AC \n¶¶ 87, 116.  Plaintiffs allege that these risks had already come to fruition at the time the \nchallenged statements were made because many products la cked federal certifications, the \nThunderdome deal was not generating revenue, and there were federal budgetary \nlimitations that prevented deals from going through.  Id. ¶¶ 88, 117.  \nBut Plaintiffs fail to substantiate their allegations with specific factual allegations.  \nFor instance, they make only vague, unsupported allegations that “many” products lacked Case 3:24-cv-01156-CRB     Document 75     Filed 04/11/25     Page 15 of 21 \n16 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  necessary federal certifications and that the Department of Defense would not buy \n“certain” products.  Id. ¶ 56.  As discussed earlier, plaintiffs do not specify which products \nhad or needed which certifications, whether the lack of such certifications had a material \neffect on sales to government entities, or how the Department of Defense’s inability to buy \n“certain” products affected overall sales.  \nPlaintiffs’ focus on the Thunderdome deal fares no better.  They allege that the \nchallenged risk disclosure statements —which warned of the risk that the company may \nexpend “significant upfront time and expense” trying to secure government sales “without \nany assurance that these efforts will generate a sale” —were misleading because \nThunderdome was already “failing to generate revenue.”  AC ¶¶ 87, 116.  But Plaintiffs do \nnot offer any factual allegations about when the issues with the Thunderdome deal \nmateria lized or when Defendants knew of those issues.  They only offer a statement from \nArora that “softness in the U.S. federal government market … started off towards the end \nof Q1 [of 2024]” and “worsened in Q2 [of 2024] ,” id. ¶ 134 , and one from Golechha that \n“a large program” (which Plaintiffs assume to be Thunderdome) “didn’t materialize at the \npace and at the spending levels we had expected.  We saw an early glimpse in Q1 towards \nthe end.”  Id. ¶ 135.  Other than those vague references, Plaintiffs do not al lege any facts \nabout the timing of the Thunderdome deal.  \nThe challenged risk disclosure statements were published on September 1 and \nNovember 17, 2023.  Id. ¶¶ 87, 116.  Plaintiffs do not adequately alleg e that Thunderdome \nwas already failing, or that Defendants were aware of Thunderdome’s failures, on those \ndates.  At best, they make the conclusory allegation that Thunderdome “was already failing \nto generate revenue” because Defendants announced on February 20, 2024 that the \nThunderdome deal did not close and accordingly lowered their guidance.  Id. ¶¶ 117, 135 ; \nsee also  id. ¶¶ 136, 139, 140 (analysts’ statements after PANW lowered its guidance) .  \nThis is, again, a barred “fraud by hindsight” theory.  See Cloudera , 121 F.4th at 1187.  \nFinally, Plaintiffs do not adequately allege that federal budgetary constraints \naffected sales to government entities at the time the challenged statements were made.  Case 3:24-cv-01156-CRB     Document 75     Filed 04/11/25     Page 16 of 21 \n17 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  Plaintiffs offer only a single statement from a confidential witness that “the U.S. \ngovernment didn’t have the budget for cybersecurity products” until “summer of 2024.”  \nId. ¶ 60.  Plaintiffs do not identify when the U.S. government supposedly informed the \nconfidential witness of this budgetary issue, who at PANW knew about this budgetary \nissue, or whether this budgetary issue actually affected PANW’s sales to government \nentities.  Thus, this bare assertion is insufficient to make the challenged statements  from \nSeptember 1 and November 17, 2023 misleading.  \n2. Scienter  \nDefendants also challenge Plaintiffs’ Section 10(b) claim on the grounds that \nPlaintiffs failed to plead particularized facts giving rise to a “strong inference” of scienter.  \nTellabs , 551 U.S. at 323.  A Section 10(b) claim must “state with particularity facts giving \nrise to a strong inference that the defendant acted” with “a mental state embracing intent to \ndeceive, manipulate, or defraud.”  Id. at 319, 321.  To do so, a complaint must allege that \nthe defendants made “false or misleading statements eithe r intentionally or with deliberate \nrecklessness.”  Zucco , 552 F.3d at 991 (citation omitted).  Deliberate recklessness is not \n“mere recklessness,” but is instead “an extreme departure from the standards of ordinary \ncare” that “presents a danger of misleading buyers or sellers that is either known to the \ndefenda nt or is so obvious that the actor must have been aware of it.”  Schueneman v. \nArena Pharms., Inc. , 840 F.3d 698, 705 (9th Cir. 2016) (citations omitted).  \nThe Court must “engage in a comparative evaluation [and] … consider, not only \ninferences urged by the plaintiff … but also competing inferences rationally drawn from \nthe facts alleged.”  Tellabs , 551 U.S. at 314.  Courts in the Ninth Circuit sometimes \nconduct a dual inquiry, which considers both “whether any of the plaintiff’s allegations, \nstanding alone, are sufficient to create a strong inference of scienter” and, if not, whether \nthe individual ly inadequate allegations “combine” to allege scienter when co nsidered as a \nwhole.  In re VeriFone Holdings, Inc. Sec. Litig. , 704 F.3d 694, 702 –03 (9th Cir. 2012).  \nPlaintiffs’ theory of scienter relies on four allegations: (1)  that Defendants \n“artificially inflated” PANW’s guidance; (2)  that Arora engaged in suspiciously timed bulk Case 3:24-cv-01156-CRB     Document 75     Filed 04/11/25     Page 17 of 21 \n18 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  sales of shares; (3)  that Arora’s statements on the February 20 earnings call indicated that \nhis previous statements were false or misleading; and (4)  that Arora and Golechha \noccupied such integral positions at PANW that they “were reckless in not knowing” that \nplatformization was “underperforming.”  Opp. at 1, 5, 12; AC ¶¶  78, 81, 148 –160.  But \nPlaintiffs have not sufficiently plead ed scienter, even considering their allegations both \nindividually and collectively.  \nFirst, Plaintiffs offer no support for their allegation that Defendants “artificially \ninflated” PANW’s guidance to maintain its then -current valuation.  Opp. at 1, 5, 12.  \nPlaintiffs have not alleged any facts, let alone with particularity, from which the Court  \ncould infer that Defendants acted intentionally or with deliberate recklessness when setting \nPANW’s guidance.  See Tellabs , 551 U.S. at 323.  Rather, the Court can rationally infer \nthat PANW’s valuation was simply accurate.  \nSecond , Plaintiffs fail to allege with particularity that Arora’s stock sales were \n“dramatically out of line with prior trading practices” and thus indicative of deliberate \nrecklessness.  See Zucco , 552 F.3d at 1005 (citations omitted).  Though “trading at \nsuspicious times or in suspicious amounts by corporate insiders has long been recognized \nas probative of scienter,” trading must also “be unusual, well beyond the normal patterns \nof trading by tho se defendants.”  In re Daou Sys., Inc. , 411 F.3d 1006, 1022 –23 (9th Cir. \n2005) (citation omitted).  To be sure, Arora’s net profit from his sales in November and \nDecember 2023 was over $120 million, his sales were made on five days over a four -week \nspan, his largest sale corresponded to PANW’s then -highest -ever stock price, and his sales \nrapidly increased in the summer of 2023 and have rapidly tapered since February 2024 .  \nAC ¶¶  149–51.  But the Court must consider competing inferences, and facts drawn from \nincorporated documents counteract any apparent suspiciousn ess of Plaintiffs’ allegations .7  \n \n7 Though “it is improper to assume the truth of an incorporated document if such \nassumptions only serve to dispute facts stated in a well -pleaded complaint ,” Khoja , 899 \nF.3d at 1003, the facts drawn from these incorporated documents do not dispute any of \nPlaintiffs’ factual allegations.  Rather, they relate to Plaintiffs’ conclusory  allegation that \nArora’s stock sales were unusual .  See In re Eventbrite , Inc. Sec. Litig. , No. 18-cv-2019 -\nEJD, 2020 WL 2042078, at *7 (N.D. Cal. Apr. 28, 2020) ( “Khoja  does not prevent a \nCase 3:24-cv-01156-CRB     Document 75     Filed 04/11/25     Page 18 of 21 \n19 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  Arora sold more shares in the three months before August 21, 2023 than he did between \nthat date and February 20, 2024 .  May 26 Form 4 (dkt. 66 -19), June 8 Form 4 (dkt. 66 -20); \nsee also  In re Apple Comput. Sec. Litig. , 886 F.2d 1109, 1117 (9th Cir. 1989) (“Large \nsales of stock before the class period are inconsistent with plaintiffs’ theory that defendants \nattempted to drive up the price of Apple stock during the class period.”).  Plaintiffs do not \nallege that the othe r individual Defendants similarly traded .  See Metzler , 540 F.3d at 1067 \n(“We typically require larger sales amounts [than 37%] —and corroborative sales by other \ndefendants —to allow insider trading to support scienter.”).  And Arora’s sales were made \npursuant to a 10b5 -1 plan he created two months before Defen dants allegedly came up \nwith the free product strategy.  AC ¶  153.8 \nThird , as discussed above, Plaintiffs fail to adequately allege that Arora’s February \n20 statement directly contradicted or was inconsistent with earlier statements such that \nArora must have had contemporaneous knowledge of the falsity of those earlier  \nstatement s.  See In re Read -Rite Corp. Sec. Litig. , 335 F.3d 843, 846 (9th Cir. 2003).  \nPlaintiffs’ assertion to the contrary does not allege a strong inference of scienter.  \nFourth , Plaintiffs fail to allege with particularity that Arora and Golechha were \ndeliberately reckless in not knowing about the strength or weakness of the platformization \nstrategy.  Plaintiffs rely on confidential witnesses to argue that Arora and Golechha, by  \nvirtue of their roles and responsibilities to the company, should have known about any \nalleged failures with platformization.  That argument fails.  For one, Plaintiffs do not \nallege facts from which the Court could conclude that any risks of platfo rmization were so \nobvious that Arora and Golechha must have been aware of them.  See Intuitive , 759 F.3d \n \ndefendant from using the doctrines of judicial notice or incorporation by reference to \ncreate factual disputes with a plaintiff's conclusory  allegations. ” (emphasis in original)).  \n8 Plaintiffs cite Lamartina v. VMWare, Inc., No. 5:20 -cv-02182 -EJD, 2021 WL 4133851, \nat *12 (N.D. Cal. Sept. 10, 2021), as support for their position that Arora’s 10b5 -1 plan \ndoes not automatically negate scienter.  Opp. at 14.  But in Lamartina , it was unclear when \nthe defendants adopted their 10b5 -1 plans, so “ the Court [could not]  say that those plans \npreceded [the defendants’]  awareness of the alleged plan to manipulate .”  2021 WL \n4133851, at *12.  Here, Plaintiffs allege that the 10b5 -1 plans preceded the “alleged plan” \nto manipulate stock prices by two months.  AC ¶  153. \nCase 3:24-cv-01156-CRB     Document 75     Filed 04/11/25     Page 19 of 21 \n20 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  at 1062 (allegations of scienter based on defendant’s role in the company may be sufficient \n“in rare circumstances where the nature of the relevant fact is of such prominence that it \nwould be absurd to suggest that management was without knowledge of the m atter”) \n(citation omitted).  For another, Plaintiffs do not explain how these confidential witnesses \nknow what Arora and Golechha would have known about specific operations at PANW .  \nSee Mulligan v. Impax Labs ., Inc. , 36 F. Supp. 3d 942, 962 (N.D. Cal. 201 4) (confidential \nwitnesses must be described “with sufficient particularity to support the probability that a \nperson in the position occupied by the source would possess the information alleged”  \n(citations omitted) ); Intuitive , 759 F.3d at 1062 (plaintiff’s allegations insufficient where \nthe complaint lacked “allegations of specific admissions by the individual defendants \nregarding their involvement with [the company’s] operations” and instead relied on \n“impressions of witnesse s who lacked direct access to the executives but claim[ed] that the \nexecutives were involved with [the company’s] day -to-day operations”).  \nEven taking Plaintiffs’ individual allegations holistically, they still fail to allege \nsufficient facts to demonstrate  scienter.  The Ninth Circuit has found scienter on a holistic \nreview , as one example,  where a company’s founders repeatedly sold their shares without \ninforming an investor in violation of the investor’s right to notice because the investor was \nhighly regarded and would cause the company to go under if it jumped ship, all while the \nfounders  were engaged in a scheme to profit from the company ’s business while it lost \nenormous amounts of money.  WPP Luxembourg Gamma Three Sarl v. Spot Runner, Inc. , \n655 F.3d 1039, 1052 –53 (9th Cir. 2011), abrogated on other grounds by  Lorenzo v. SEC , \n587 U.S. 71 (2019).  Plaintiffs have not alleged anything near ly as compelling .  Their \nallegations do not tell a cohesive story like those in WPP Luxembourg , they do not become \nmore “cogent” together than they are individually , and they do not combine to become “at \nleast as compelling as any opposing inference of non fraudulent intent .”  See Tellabs , 551 \nU.S. at 314.   Accordingly, Plaintiffs have not sufficiently alleged  scienter.  \nB.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: In the case of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) v. Click Profit, LLC, et al., the FTC seeks a preliminary injunction against the defendants for allegedly violating the Federal Trade Commission Act through deceptive marketing practices. The case involves artificial intelligence (AI), as defendants purportedly made false claims about the use of AI to select profitable e-commerce products, misrepresenting potential earnings and affiliations with major brands, leading to financial harm to consumers. The court found good cause to believe that these practices violated consumer protection laws and ordered asset freezes and other injunctive measures.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the defendants engaged in deceptive marketing practices, including making false or unsubstantiated earnings claims, misrepresenting affiliations, and using AI claims to induce consumers to purchase their business opportunities, in violation of the FTC Act and other consumer protection laws.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court issued a preliminary injunction finding good cause to believe the defendants violated the FTC Act and other regulations. The injunction restrains the defendants from continuing deceptive practices, freezes their assets, and requires detailed financial disclosures to preserve potential remedies for affected consumers.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: This case is about a company that was telling people they could make a lot of money by buying into their business opportunities, which they falsely claimed involved using smart technology (AI) to pick good products. The government agency in charge of protecting consumers said that's not true and took the company to court. The judge agreed it's likely true they were lying, told the company to stop these practices, and froze their funds so they could potentially pay back the victims.",

This Court has jurisdiction over the subject matter of this case and over the parties.  \nB. Venue in this district is proper, and Stipulating Defendants  have been properly served \nwith process under  Rule 4 of the  Federal Rule s of Civil Procedure.  \nC. On March  5, 2025, the Court found good cause to believe that,  in numerous instances, \nDefendants, in the marketing and selling of business opportunities, have violated the FTC Act as well as other laws enforced by the Commission.  Specifically, the Court found that  there is good cause to \nbelieve that Defendants have (1) made false or unsubstantiated claims about earnings, their affiliation \nwith well -known brands, and their use of artificial intelligence; (2) violated multiple trade regulation \nrule provisions in the selling of Defendants’  products or services, and (3) used threats and non-\ndisparagement clauses to discourage purchasers from publishing truthful reviews about Defendants and their products or services.   [ECF No.  15 at 3].  \nD. The Court  also found good cause to believe that Defendants have engaged in and are \nlikely to engage in acts or practices that violate Section 5(a) of the FTC Act, 15 U.S.C. §  45(a) ; the \nBusiness Opportunity Rule, 16 C.F.R. pt. 437, as amended; the Consumer Review Fairness Act , 15 \nU.S.C. §  45b; and the Impersonation Rule, 16 C.F.R. pt. 461, and that Plaintiff is therefore likely to \nprevail on the merits of this action.   [ECF No.  15 at 4].  \nE. The Court also found good cause to believe Defendants have caused financial harm \nto consumers as a result of their unlawful practices.  [ECF No.  15 at 4].  Case 1:25-cv-20973-DSL   Document 85   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/21/2025   Page 2 of 613 \n F. The Court also found good cause to believe that immediate and irreparable harm \nwould result from Defendants’ ongoing violations of the FTC Act, the Business Opportunity Rule, \nthe CRFA, and the Impersonation Rule , and that there would be immediate and irreparable damage \nto the Court’s ability grant effective final relief for consumers —including monetary restitution, \nrecission, or refunds —unless Defendants were restrained and enjoined by order of this Court.  [ECF \nNo. 15 at 4–5 ].  \nG. The FTC asserts that, unless Defendants continue to be preliminarily restrained and \nenjoined by this Court, immediate and irreparable harm would result from Defendant s’ violations of \nthe FTC Act , the Business Opportunity Rule, the CRFA , and the Impersonation Rule , and that there \nwould be immediate and irreparable damage to the Court’s ability to grant effective final relief for \nconsumers —including monetary restitution, rescission, or refunds . \nH. The FTC asserts that  good cause exists for the Court to order: (1) the continued freeze \nof all Defendants’ assets; and (2) the ancillary relief described below.  \nI. The Stipulating Defendants  agree to the entry of this Order without any admission of \nwrongdoing as to the allegations in the Complaint, except as specifically stated in this Order.   Only \nfor purposes of this action, Stipulating Defendants admit the facts necessary to establish jurisdiction.  \nJ. The Stipulating Defendants waive all rights to seek judicial review or otherwise \nchallenge or contest the validity of this Order.  \nK. The entry of this Order is in the public interest . \nL. This Court has authority to issue this Order pursuant to Section s 13(b)  and 19 of the \nFTC Act, 15 U.S.C. § § 53(b) , 57b ; Rule 65 of the Fed eral Rules of Civil Procedure ; and the All Writs  \nAct, 28 U.S.C. §  1651.  \nM.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: In Daimler v. Moehle et al., Plaintiff Eric Daimler alleged that Defendants misrepresented material facts, fraudulently inducing him to enter a business partnership and later ousting him, leading to a loss of his vested stock units. Despite Daimler's claims of intentional misrepresentation regarding investment leads and stock vesting schedules, the court partially dismissed and partially sustained the claims, allowing Daimler to amend certain allegations.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether Defendants committed fraud in the inducement and breach of contract by misrepresenting terms of the business agreements and whether Daimler’s forfeited stock units were wrongfully denied.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court granted the motion to dismiss most of Daimler's claims but allowed him to re-plead the fraud allegations specifically concerning General Electric's potential investment. The breach of contract claim related to not receiving units for his capital contributions was upheld, providing a basis for potential relief.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine you and a friend start a business together because your friend promises a third party will invest a lot of money, which turns out to be untrue. Later, your friend manages to push you out of the company and you lose any shares you worked for. You sue to get your shares back, but the judge says your case is weak except for when you say your friend also didn't give you shares for extra money you invested. The judge lets you change your lawsuit to explain how the investor promise tricked you, but other complaints are dismissed.",

He further alleges that the Defend ants then \nforced Daimler out of  these companies by preventing him from satisfying conditions precedent to \na common unit vesting schedule,  resulting in the forfeiture of all of his c ommon units in th e \nCompanies.  (Id. at ¶ 2 ).  In short, Daimler claims that Defendants  wrongly forced Daimler out of \ncompan ies that he helped to create and build.   Defendants now move  to dismiss Daimler’s \ncomplaint on the grounds that it fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted.  \nThe Court has reviewed the Brief in Support of Defendants’  Motion to Dismiss Under \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) (Docket No. 17), the Memorandum of Law in Opposition \nto Defendants’  Motion to Dismiss the First Amended Complaint (Docket No. 19), and the Reply \nBrief in Support of Defendants’  Motion to Dismiss Under FRCP 12(b)(6) (Docket No. 20) .  For Case 2:18-cv-00165-MJH   Document 22   Filed 07/30/18   Page 1 of 22 \n2 \n the reasons set forth below, Defendants ’ motion to dismiss (Docket No. [16]) is GRANTED  IN \nPART AND DENIED IN PART . \nI. STATEMENT OF FACTS  \nSometime in 2015, Daimler and Moehle, each  of whom  operat ed his own robotics and /or \nventure finance compan y, formed a partnership in order to invest in high-growth -potenti al, early -\nstage robotics companies. (Docket No. 4  at ¶¶ 10-11).  The two agreed to create an equal \npartnership by combining Moehle’s company, Skilled Science, with Daimler’s company, Coal \nHill; they also created two new entities, Robotic s Hub and Robotics Hub Fund 1 LP ( the “Fund” ).  \n(Id. at ¶¶  at 11 -12).  Daimler and Moe hle amended and re stated  Coal Hill’s operating agreement \nto reflect Daimler’s and Moehle’s equal partnership, began working together on marketing \nstrategies, and merged “expenses accrued through the funding of Skilled Science into the \nfundraising expenses of Robotics Hub. ”  (Id. at ¶ 14). \n Before beginning the partnership, Moehle told Daimer that General Electric (“GE”) would \ninvest $20 million in the F und and that he had  strong relationships with the National Robotics \nEngineering Center (“NREC”) and the Robotics Institute  (“RI”) , both of which would create \ninvestment o pportunities for the ir venture .  (Docket No. 4 at ¶¶  15-16).  By early 2016, however, \nDaimler learned tha t Moehle had misrepresented his relationships with NREC and RI.  (Id. at ¶ \n18).  Nevertheless, throughout 2016, Moehle continued to represent that GE would be investing \n$20 million.  ( Id. at ¶ 19).  \n In January 2016, the Obama White House appointed Daimler as a Presidential Innovation \nfellow.  (Docket No. 4 at ¶ 29).  Daimler , with Moehle’s encouragement, accepted the year -long \nfellowship.  ( Id. at ¶¶ 30 -31).  During the fellowship, Daimler advised the White House on robotics \nand artificial intelligence, and  the fellowship generated positive press coverage for Daimler and Case 2:18-cv-00165-MJH   Document 22   Filed 07/30/18   Page 2 of 22 \n3 \n Robotics Hub.  ( Id. at ¶¶ 32 -33).  During the course of the fellowship, Daim ler provid ed \nunspecified services to the C ompanies but did not receive any compensation.  ( Id. at ¶ 34).  Daimler \nand Moehle agreed that Daimler would be paid at a later date.  (Id.) \n During public relations and fundraising efforts, as well as joint presentations to potential \ninvestors, the Companies and the Fund promoted Daimler and Moehle as equal partners.  (Docket  \nNo. 4 at ¶¶ 25 -26).  Both were also designated as “key persons” in the Fund’s Limited Partnership \nAgreement.1  (Id. at ¶ 24).   \n In the spring of 2016, Daimler and Moehle retained Reed Smith LLP to prepare the \nformation and governing documents, including the Companies’  Amended and Restated Operating \nAgreements and Common Unit Award Agreements.  (Docket No. 4 at ¶ 36 ).  Moehle was the main \npoint of contact for the law firm.  ( Id. at ¶ 37).  The Companies’ Amended and Restated Operating \nAgreements and Coal H ill’s and Robotics Hub’s Common Unit Award Agreements with both \nMoehle and Daimler are attached to the complaint as exhibits,  (Docket Nos. 4 -1 through 4 -6), and \nthe Court has considered and relied upon each in deciding this motion.2  See, e.g ., Lum v. Bank  of \nAmerica , 361 F.3d 217, 222 (3d Cir. 2004)  (in resolving Rule 12(b)(6) motions, “ courts generally \nconsider only the allegations in the complaint, exhibits attached to the complaint, matters of public \nrecord, and documents that form the basis of a claim ”) (citing In re Burlington Coat Factory Sec. \nLitig. , 114 F.3d 1410, 1426 (3d Cir.  1997) ).  \nInsofar as relevant here, the Amended and Restated Operating Agreements, both dated \nMarch 23, 2016,3 noted that Daimler and Moehle were members  of the Companies,  and they \n                                                           \n1  That limited partnership agreement was not attached to the complaint.  \n \n2  The Court has not relied upon the IRS form submitted by Defendants and therefore does not address \nDefendants’ argument that the document is one that may be considered in this motion to dismiss.   (Docket No. 17 at \n12, n.6).  \n3  As noted above, t he Amended and Restated Operating Agreements are attached as exhibits to the Complaint, \nand citations to each in this opinion are made to the assigned docket  numbers, Docket No. 4-5 for the Robotics Hub Case 2:18-cv-00165-MJH   Document 22   Filed 07/30/18   Page 3 of 22 \n4 \n appointed the two as managers and  board members.  (Docket Nos. 4 -5 and 4 -6 at ¶¶ 5.2 ).  The \nboards of each company were authorized to manage, control and operate each company and had : \nthe full and complete power, authority, and discretion for, on  behalf \nof and in the name of the Company, to take such action as it may in \nits sole discretion deem necessary or advisable to carry out any and \nall of the objectives and purposes of the Company, subject only to \n[the Operating Agreement and applicable law. ]   \n \n(Docket Nos. 4 -5 and 4 -6 at ¶ 5.1).  Each Manager on the board had one vote on matters submitted \nto the board, and, in the event of a tie vote, the board would refer the matter to a Deadlock \nArbitrator whose decision would be “final and binding on the  Company, the board and the \nMembers.”  (Docket Nos. 4 -5 and 4 -6 at ¶ 5.5(c)).  Managers were not entitled to receive \ncompensation for their duties as a manager, nor did the Operating Agreements “confer upon any \nManager any rights with respect to continued employment by the Company.”  (Docket Nos. 4 -5 \nand 4 -6 at ¶ 5.7).  The Agreements specifically provided, “[N]othing herein should be construed \nto have created any employment agreement with any Manager.”  ( Id.)  Officers, however, were \nentitled to compensati on as determined by the board.  ( Id. at ¶ 6.10).   The Agreements noted that \nneither Moehle nor Daimler had made any  capital contributi ons, and the Agreements  provided that \nneither would be required to make additional capital contributions.  ( Id. at ¶ 7.2 ).   If additional \ncapital  contributions were made, those contributions  could be made only “with the consent of the \nBoard and in connection with an issuance of Units.”  ( Id. at ¶ 7.2).  Loans by any member were \nnot to be considered capital contributions un der the Agreements.  ( Id. at ¶ 7.6).  The holders of a \nmajority of common units were authorized to determine the size of the boards and the identity of \n                                                           \nAgreement and Docket No.  4-6 for the Coal Hill  Agreement .  The Amended and Restated Operating Agreements are \ncollectively referred to herein as the “Agreements.”  Robotics Hub was created as a Delaware Limited Liability \nCompany, (Docket No. 4 -5 at 7), and Coal Hill was formed as a Pennsylvania limited liability company (Docket No. \n4-6 at 7). Robotics Hub was formed on February  17, 2016, and its original Operating Agreement was dated March 11, \n2016.  (Docket No. 4-5 at 7).  Coal Hill was formed under Pennsylvania law o n April 27, 2015, and its original \nOperating Agreement was dated the same day.  (Docket No. 4 -6 at 7).  Neither of the original Operating Agreements \nare attached to the complaint or otherwise referen ced in it.  Case 2:18-cv-00165-MJH   Document 22   Filed 07/30/18   Page 4 of 22 \n5 \n the members serving the boards.  (Docket Nos. 4 -5 and 4 -6 at ¶¶ 5.2, 5.3).  Exhibit A to the \nOperating A greements noted that both Daimler and Moehle  each had 42 common units  in each of \nthe Companies , “which may be subject to vesting, pursuant to a restricted unit award agreement. ”  \n(Docket No. 4 -5 at 39; Docket No. 4 -6 at 40).   \n The same day that the Operating Agreements were signed, each Company granted each of \nDaimler and Moehle the 42 common units  referenced above .4  (Docket Nos. 4 -1, 4-2. 4-3, and 4 -\n4).  The units vested over time.  Moehle’s units vested as follows:  \n▪20% vests  on the first anniversary of the Date of the Award;  \n \n▪1.6666% vests ratably on the last day of each month thereafter until the fifth \nanniversary of the Date of the Award.   \n \n(Docket No. 4 at ¶ 38; Docket No s. 4-1 and 4 -2 at 2).  In addition, Moehle’s unit s vested only if \nMoehle was providing Full Time Services to a combination of the Companies, the Fund and the \ninvestment manager of the Fund on the Vesting Date.5  (Docket Nos. 4-1 at 3, ¶ 2(a); 4 -2 at 3, ¶ \n2(a)).  If Moehle stopped working full time, he would forfeit any unvested units.  (Docket No s. 4-\n1 and 4 -2 at 4, ¶ 2(b )).   \n  Daimler’s units, however, vested pursuant to a different schedule.  According to the \nSummaries con tained on the first page of the Daim ler Awards , 20% of Daimler’ s units would vest \non the date that he had provided twelve consecutive and uninterrupted months of Full Time \n                                                           \n4  The Common Unit Award Agreement awarding Moehle units in Robotics Hub is found at , and is referenced \nherein as , Docket No. 4 -1.  The Common Unit Award Agreement awarding Moe hle units in Coal Hill is referenced as \nDocket No. 4 -2.  The Court re fers to those together as the “Moehle Awards.” The Common Unit Award Agreement \nawarding Daimler units in Robotics Hub is at Docket No. 4 -3, and the Common Unit Award Agreement awarding \nDaimler units in Coal Hill is at Docket No. 4 -4.  Docket Nos. 4 -3 and 4 -4 are collectively referred to herein as the \n“Daimler Awards.” The Court refers to both the Daimler Awards and the Moehle Awards together  as the “Awards.”  \n \n5  The Awards define “Full Time Service” to mean that the grantee “was employed by or otherwise pro viding \ngreater than 95% of his professional activities, as determined in the the sole discretion of the Board . . . to a combination \nof the Compan[ies], the Fund and the investment manager of the Fund . . . on the applicable Vesting Date.”  (Docket \nNos. 4-1, 4-2, 4-3, and 4 -4 at ¶ 2(a)).  Case 2:18-cv-00165-MJH   Document 22   Filed 07/30/18   Page 5 of 22 \n6 \n Services, provided that those service s began within one year of the A ward.  (Docket No s. 4-3 and \n4-4 at 2).  If Daimler met those conditions, the remaining 80% of the units would vest on a pro-\nrata basis on the last day of each month thereafter until the fifth anniversary of the award.  ( Id.)  \nLike the Moehle A ward s, the Daimler A ward s stated that, if he stopped providing F ull Time \nServices, he would forfeit any unvested units.  (Docket No. 4 -3 at ¶ 2(b) Docket No. 4 -4 at ¶ 2(b)).    \nEach of the four award agreements otherwise appear to contain identical language , which \ninclude s a paragraph addressing employment rights .  Of note, paragraph 10 of each award, entitled \n“No Employment Rights ,” provide s: \nThe grant of this Award shall not confer upon the Grantee any right \nto be retained by or in the employ or service of the Company and \nshall not interfere in any way with the right of the Company to \nterminate the Grantee’s employment or service at any time.  The \nright of the Company, as applicable, to terminate at will the \nGrantee’s employment or service at any time for any reason is \nspecifically reserved .   \n   \n(Docket Nos. 4-1, 4-2, 4-3, and 4 -4 at ¶ 10)  (underline and bold in original) . \nOver the course of the partnership, Daimler provided the Companies with financial support.  \nFor example, he l oaned $125,000 to the Companies pursuant to a promissory note, which has since \nbeen repaid  with interest.  (Docket No. 4 at ¶¶ 27 -28).  He a dvanced personal funds to cover \nunspecified corporate expenses  – including $30,000 between May and August 2016 – and has been \nreimbursed $35,000 .  (Id. at ¶ 27 , 28, 65, and 68 ).  He also provided  $100,000 capital contribution s \nto Robotics Hub and Coal Hill but did not receive units in return , even though he and Moehle (the \nonly two members of the board) had agreed that he would .6  (Id. at ¶¶ 67, 135, 174).  Moehle, on \n                                                           \n6  The Court does not consider the allegations made in Plaintiff’s opposition brief that, “[u]pon further review,” \nhe determined that he had advanced in excess of $160,000 for expenses.  (Docket No. 19 at 4, n.1).   Commo nwealth \nof Pennsylvania ex rel. Zimmerman v.  PepsiCo, Inc ., 836 F.2d 173, 181 (3d Cir. 1988) (“It is axiomatic that the \ncomplaint may not be amended by the briefs in opposition to a motion to dismiss’) (citations and in ternal quotation \nmarks omitted).  Thi s ‘amendment’ is, in any event, far from clear and does not specify whether the additional \nadvances were intended as loans or capital contributions and included in the breach of contract claims relating to ¶ 7.2 \nof the Agreements and discussed infra.  Case 2:18-cv-00165-MJH   Document 22   Filed 07/30/18   Page 6 of 22 \n7 \n the other hand, contributed o nly $1,000 in capital.  ( Id. at ¶ 27).  The complaint does not state \nwhether Moehle received units in return for his capital contribution.  \nIn early to mid -2016, Daimler’s and Moehle’s relationship began to deteriorate.  (Docket \nNo. 4 at ¶ 59).  Moehle beca me critical of Daimler  and refused to share information or consult \nwith him .  (Id. at ¶¶  59-69).  By mid to late -2016, Moehle began taking steps “to gain sole control \nof the Companies.”  ( Id. at ¶ 70).  Moehle “thwarted” Daimler’s efforts to arrange meetings, \nrefused Daimler’s help with the Fund’s first closing, and “actively obstructed Daimler’s efforts to \ncommunicate with the Fund’s investors and portfolio managers.”  ( Id. at ¶¶ 71 -75).  Moehle also \nassigned work to Daimler, which Daimler performed, and then claimed that the work was not \nnecessary and accused Daimler of having failed to complete the work.  ( Id. at ¶ 73).  All the while, \nat least until November 2016, Moehle told investors that he and Daim ler were equal partners.  ( Id. \nat ¶ 77).  \nIn January 2017, Daimler and Moehle met to discuss Daimler’s full -time role with the \nCompanies.  (Docket No. 4 at ¶ 78).  However, on or about January 5, 201 7, as Daimler’s \nfellowship was ending, Moehle recommended to the Companies’ boards that Daimler not be \npermitted to work full -time with the Companies, purportedly because the Companies could not \nafford to pay Daimler.  ( Id. at ¶¶ 79, 80).  Because Daimler and Moehle were the only two board \nmembers, the board was deadlocked on the issue and, pursuant to the Operating Agreements, the \nmatter was referred to the Deadlock Arbitrator .  (Id. at ¶¶ 81, 82).  On March 22, 2017, the \nDeadlock Arbitrator  voted against Daimler.  ( Id. at ¶ 84).  As such, Daimler did not provide full \ntime services to the Companies befor e the first anniversary of his A wards, and he forfeited the 42 \nunvested units he h ad been issued pursuant to the Daimler A wards.  ( Id. at ¶¶ 85-87).  Moehle then Case 2:18-cv-00165-MJH   Document 22   Filed 07/30/18   Page 7 of 22 \n8 \n became the majority member of the Companies and removed Daimler from the boards.  ( Id. at ¶¶ \n88). \nII. DISCUSSION  \nA. The Legal Standard  \nWhen reviewing a motion to dismiss pursuant to Federal Ru le of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) , \nthe C ourt must “ ‘accept all factual allegations as true, construe the complaint in the light most \nfavorable to the plaintiff, and determine whether, under any reasonable reading of the complaint, \nthe plaintiff may be entitl ed to relief.’ ” Eid v. Thompson , 740 F.3d 118, 122 (3d Cir. 2014)  (quoting \nPhillips v. County of Allegheny , 515 F.3d 224, 233 (3d Cir. 2008) ). To survive a Rule 12(b)(6)  \nchallenge, a plaintif f's “‘[f]actual allegations must be enough to raise a right to relie f above the \nspeculative level.’ ” Id. (quoting  Bell Atlantic v . Twombly , 550 U.S.  544, 555 (2007).  “Thus, ‘only \na complaint that states a plausible claim for relief  survives a motion to dismiss.’ ” Id. (quoting \nAshcroft v.  Iqbal , 556 U.S . 662,  679 (2009)).  \nAlthough the Court must accept the allegati ons in the complaint as true, “ ‘[it i s] not \ncompelled to accept unsupported conclusions and unwarranted inferences, or a legal conclusion \ncouched as a factual allegation.’ ”  Morrow v. Balaski , 719 F.3d 160, 165 (3d Cir. 2013)  (quoting \nBaraka v. McGreevey , 481 F.3d 187, 195 (3d Cir. 2007) ). “Threadbare recitals of the elements of \na cause of action, supported by mere conclusory statements, do not suffice.” Iqbal , 556 U.S. at 678  \n(citing Twombly , 550 U.S. at 555 ).  Instead, the plaintiff must plead facts which permit the court \nto make a reasonable inference that the defendant is liable.  Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678 ; Twombly , 550 \nU.S. at 556 –57. \nConsistent with these principles, the Third Circuit Court of A ppeals has prescribed a three -\nstep analysis for purposes of determining whether a claim is plausible. First, the court should Case 2:18-cv-00165-MJH   Document 22   Filed 07/30/18   Page 8 of 22 \n9 \n “outline the elements a plaintiff must plead to a state a claim for relief.” Bistrian v. Levi , 696 F.3d \n352, 365 (3d Cir. 2012) .  Second, the court should “peel away” legal conclusions that are not \nentitled to the assumption of truth.   Id.; see also Iqbal , 556 U.S. at 679 (“While legal conclusions \ncan provide the framework of a complaint, they  must be supported by factual allegations.”).  Third, \nthe court should assume the veracity of all well -pled factual allegations and then “ ‘determine \nwhether they plausibly give ris e to an entitlement to relief.’ ” Bistrian , 696 F .3d at 365  (quoting  \nIqbal , 556 U.S. at 679).  This third step of the analysis is “ a context -specific task that requires the \nreviewing court to draw on its judicial experience and common sense. ”  Id. (quoting  Iqbal , 556 \nU.S. at 679) .   \nB. Fraud in the Inducement  \n(Counts 1, 9, and 1 4) \n \n Plaintiff asserts three “fraud in the inducement claims,” one against each of Moehle, \nRobotics Hub, and Coal Hill .  He  has also identified t hree representations that he alleges misled \nhim and induced him to enter into a business relationship with Moehle:  (1) the representations \nabout Moehle’s relationships with NREC and RI ; (2) the representation s about GE’s $20 million \ninvestment; and (3) the re presentations about the Moehle Awards being identical to the Daimler \nAwards.  Specifically, Daimler asserts  that Moehle’s misrepresentations, upon which he justifiably \nrelied, induced him to sign both the Daimler Awards and the Agreements.   (Docket No . 4 at ¶¶ 95, \n146, 181 ).  None of these theories survive Defendants’ motion to dismiss , but th is Court will grant \nleave to re -plead the claim arising from the alleged misrepresentations about GE’s investment.  \nUnder Pennsylvania law, which governs the Coal Hill Agreements, the elements of fraud \nin the inducement are:  (1) a representation; (2) which is material to the transaction; (3) made \nfalsely,  with knowledge of its falsity or recklessness as to whether it is true or false; (4) with the \nintent of mislead ing anot her into relying on it; (5) justifiable reliance on the misrepresentation; Case 2:18-cv-00165-MJH   Document 22   Filed 07/30/18   Page 9 of 22 \n10 \n and (6) injury proximately caused by the reliance.  McWreath v. Range Resources – Appalachia , \nLLC, 81 F. Supp. 3d 448, 470 (W.D. Pa. 2015) (Fischer, J.) , aff’d  645 F ed. App’x 190 (3d Cir. \n2016) .  See also  Batoff v. Charbonneau , 130 F. Supp. 3d 957, 969 (E.D. Pa. 2015) (“Fraud in the \ninducement is found where ‘an opposing party made false representations that induced the \ncomplaining party to agree to the contract.”).  Id.  Similarly, under Delaware law, which governs \nthe Robotic Hub Agreements, a plaintiff alleging fraud in the inducement must plead:  “(1) a false \nrepresentation, usually one of fact, made by the defendant; (2) the Defendants’  knowledge or belief \nthat the representation was false, or was made with reckless indifference to the truth; (3) an intent \nto induce  the plaintiff to act or to refrain from acting; (4) the plaintiff's action or inaction taken in \njustifiable reliance upon t he representation; and (5) damage to the plaintiff as a result of such \nreliance.”7 In re Med. Wind Down Holdings III, Inc ., 332 B.R. 98, 102 (Bankr. D. Del. 2005) \n(citing Stephenson v. Capano Dev., Inc.,  462 A.2d 1069, 1074 ( Del.1983)). Under both Delaware  \nand Pennsylvania law, f raud in the inducement renders a contract voidable, and a  victim of this \nfraud  may either rescind  the contract or affirm it and sue for damages .  Connors v. Fawn Mining \nCorp ., 30 F.3d 483, 490 (3d Cir. 1994); McWreath , 81 F. Supp. 3d at 470; Lincoln Nat. Life Ins. \nCo. v. Joseph Schlanger 2006 Ins. Trust , 28 A.3d 436, 441 (Del. 2011).   See also  Langley  v. Fed. \nDeposit Ins. Corp ., 484 U.S. 86, 87 (1987)  (noting that fraud in the inducement rendered a disputed \nnote “voidable but not void ”); Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 164 (1981) .  Here, Plaintiff \nhas not sought rescission of the contracts at issue.      \nThe first set of alleged mis representations , those regarding Moehle’s relations hips with the \nNREC and RI , cannot serve as the basis of a fraudulent inducement claim  because Plaintiff  admits \n                                                           \n7  Although the parties agree that the Coal Hill Agreements are governed by Delaware law and that the Robotics \nHub Agreements are governed by Pennsylvania law (Docket No. 17 at 4, n.3; Docket No. 19 at 9, n.3), Daimler asserts \nthat Pennsylvania law should gover n his fraud claims (Docket No. 19 at 21, n.8).  The Court need not address this \ndispute because it does not affect  the outcome  of the motion to dismiss .   Case 2:18-cv-00165-MJH   Document 22   Filed 07/30/18   Page 10 of 22 \n11 \n that, “during 2015 and early 2016, Daimler came to learn that Moehle misrepresented and \noverst ated the strength  of his relati onships ” with those entities .  (Docket No. 4 at ¶ 18 ).  Daimler \ntherefore cannot argue that he  justifiably  relied to his detriment on th ose statements  which he knew \nwere false  (or suspected them to be ) when agreeing to form the companies and executing the \nagreements at issue .8  See, e.g ., Dunkin' Donuts Franchised Rest s., LLC v. Claudia I, LLC , 998 F. \nSupp. 2d 383, 389 (E.D. Pa. 2014)  (“A person who believes that a representation is false cannot \nseriously say they reasonably relied on the representation ”) (citing  In re Thorne's Estate,  344 Pa. \n503, 25 A.2d 811, 816 (1942) (“A person . . . who acquiesces in a proposal which he believes to \nbe wrongful and disadvantageous deprives himself of the plea of fraud  when later he finds that he \nhas been hurt.”) ).  \n The second set of alleged misrepresentations, the statements about GE’s future investment , \nlikewise  cannot form the basis of a fraudulent inducement claim  because Plaintiff has failed to \nplead that claim  with the  particularit y required under Rule 9(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil \nProcedure .   Rule 9(b) requires plaintiffs bringing  a fraud claim to “plead  the who , what, when, \nwhere, why, and how: the first paragraph of any newspaper story.”  Institutional  Inv’rs Grp. v. \nAvaya, Inc ., 564 F. 3d 242, 253 (3d Cir. 2009).  “[P]laintiffs must plead with particularity  the \ncircumstances of the alleged fraud in order to place the defendants on notice of the precise \nmisconduct with which they are charged, and to safeguard defendants against spurious charges of \nimmoral and fraudulent behavior.” Lum v. Bank of America , 361 F.3d 217, 223 -24 (3d Cir. 2004) \n(citations and internal quotation marks omitted).  “Plaintiffs may satisfy this  [particularity]  \n                                                           \n8  In addition, statements regarding the strength of a relationship , more akin to opinion than to fac t, are not the \ntype of  misrepresentations upon which a plaintiff may premise a fraud claim .  Lookout Wi ndpo wer, 714 F . Supp. 2d \nat 556  (“Predictions about the future and expressions of opinion cannot support a common law fraud claim.”) ( citing \nGreat Lakes Chem. Corp. v. Pharmacia Corp ., 788 A.3d 544, 554 (Del. Ch. 2001) ; Metro Communication Corp. BVI  \nv. Advanced Mobilecomm. Techs Inc ., 854 A. 2d 121, 148 (Del. Ch. 2004)  (“The law is rightly reluctant to find that \nmere expressions of opinion about the futur e can buttress a claim of fraud.” ).  \n Case 2:18-cv-00165-MJH   Document 22   Filed 07/30/18   Page 11 of 22 \n12 \n requirement by pleading the date, place or time of the fraud, or through alternative means of \ninjecting precision and some measu re of substantiation into their allegations of fraud.”  Id.  \n Here, Plaintiff allege s that Moehle made the represent ations about GE both “before their \npartnership began” and “throughout 2015 and 2016.”  (Docket No. 4 at ¶¶ 15, 16).   He does not , \nhowever,  provide any more detail .  He does not specify dates , location(s), or the manner/medium  \n(in person, by telephone, in writing, etc.) the representations were made .  Nor does he  provide a ny \ncontext to the allegation:  D id Moehle have conversations with repre sentatives of GE?   Had GE \nresponded to any outreach? Had GE ever expressed interest in the Companies or the Fund?   Or \nhad Moehle simply lied about it all?  Plaintiff must  “allege facts that give rise to an inference that \n[Moehle ] knew or was reckless in not knowing that . . . the statements  were misleading ,” and “[i]t \nis not enough for [Daimler ] to allege generally that defendants “knew or recklessly disregarded \neach of the false and misleading statements for which they were sued .”  In re Burlington Coat \nFactory Sec. Litig.,  114 F.3d 1410, 1422 (3d Cir. 1997) .  Rather,  Daimler “ must allege facts that \ncould give rise to a “strong” inference of scienter. ” Id. (citations and internal quotation marks \nomitted).   Daimler’s  failure to plead any such facts forecloses  his claim of fraud in the inducement  \narising from these alleged misrepresentations .  Although the Court will dismiss the claims of \nfraudulent inducement based upon this theory, these claims are dismissed with leav e to amend.  In \nre Burlington Coat Factory , 114 F.3d at 1435 (“Ordinarily where a complaint is dismissed on Rule \n9(b) failure to plead with particularity grounds alone, leave to amend is granted.” ). 9 \n                                                           \n9  Defendants also urge the Court to find that this claim fails because Plaintiff has not alleged a \nmisrepresentation of a past fact.  (Docket No. 17 at 14.)  Plaintiff’s failure to plead fraud with the requisite parti cularity \nmake s it difficult for the Court to evaluate this argument , and given that the Court has found that Plaintiff’s claim fails \nto meet the requirements of Rule 9(b), the Court need not  -- and does not -- resolve this issue .  That said, as Defendants  \nargue , in order to successfully plead this claim, “Plaintiff[] must allege a misrepresentation relating to a past or exis ting \nfact.”  Lookout Windpower , 714 F. Supp. 2d at 556 .  See also supra  n. 8.  “A statement as to future plans or intentions \nwill not satisfy the falsity element of fraud  unless the speaker knowingly misstates his true state of mind. ”  Dunkin \nDonuts , 998 F. Supp. at 389 (citing Nat'l Data Payment Sys., Inc. v. Meridian Bank,  212 F.3d 849, 858 (3d Cir.2000)).  \nHere, Daimler’s claims as currently styled are hardly clear.  He alleges that GE “would be investing ,” which may refer Case 2:18-cv-00165-MJH   Document 22   Filed 07/30/18   Page 12 of 22 \n13 \n Finally, the claims relating to the assertion that Daimler’s and Moehle’s awards were \nidentical must fail because Plaintiff cannot allege that he suffered any injury as a result of that \nmisrepresentation.  Specifically, Daimler does not allege that he was promised terms different from \nwhat the awards actually contained .  Instead, he complains that he and Moehle should have had \nthe same terms.  (Docket No. 4 at ¶¶ 49, 93, 102, 133, 172, 179, 188).  But, regardless whether the \nterms of Moehle’s award mirrored  that of Daimler’s, or whether Daimler’s mirrored those of \nMoehle’s, Plaintiff could not have satisfied the vesting requirements because he had not provided \nFull Time Services to the Companies  by March 23, 2017.   (Compare  the Moehle Awards (Docket \nNos. 4 -1 and 4 -2 at 2 , 3 ¶ 2(a) ) with the Daimler Awards ( Docket Nos. 4-3 and 4 -4 at 2) ).  \n C. Fraud in the Execution  \n (Counts 2, 10, and 15)  \n \n Plaintiff also alleges that the misstatements about the terms of the Awards constitute fraud \nin the execution.   “Fraud in the execution arises when a party executes an agreement with neither \nknowledge nor reasonable opportunity to obtain knowledge of its character or its essential terms.”  \nRed Online Mktg. Grp ., LP v. Reviser, Ltd ., No. 14 -1353, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11686,  at *14  \n(E.D. Pa . Feb. 2, 2015 ).  Fraud in the execution voids the contract.   Connors  v. Fawn Mining \nCorp. , 30 F. 3d 483, 490 (3d Cir. 1994) (fraud in the execution renders a contract “void ab initio ”).  \nSee also  Lincoln Nat. Life Ins. Co. v. Joseph Schla nger 2006 Ins. Tr ., 28 A.3d 436, 441 (Del. \n2011) . \nIn addition to the fact that , as set forth above,  Plaintiff cannot plausibly allege damages \nstemming from this alleged misrepresentation, his claim  also fails because he has not pled facts \n                                                           \nto a future, anticipated, event.  ( Docket No. 4 at ¶¶ 15, 90 ).  However, Daimler also claims that Moehle “vigorously” \nrepresented GE’s “alleged commitment  to invest,” a statement that may or may not reflect  existing fact .  (Docket No. \n4 at ¶ 19 ).    Case 2:18-cv-00165-MJH   Document 22   Filed 07/30/18   Page 13 of 22 \n14 \n demonstrating excusable neglect.  A party claiming fraud in the execution must demonstrate \n“excusable ignorance of the contents of the writing signed.”  Fawn Mining , 30 F.3d at 491.  \nDaimler , however,  does not allege that the contracts’ pages were surrepti tiously substituted, that \nthere was  a significant time pressure that prevented him from reviewing the contract s, or that he \nwas provided only with signature pages.  See Red Online Mktg. , 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11686 at \n*19.  Nor does Daimler allege what he thought the terms of the contract s should have been, other \nthan to complain that he thought his award s were  identical to Moehle’s.  In other words, Daimler  \ndoes not allege that the contract s contained terms different from what was actually there.  Rather, \nand as set forth above, he complains that he thought Moehle had the same deal.   \nWhile Daimler argues that he was repeatedly told that the awards were identical, and while \nhe may have thought that the contracts would reflect those discussions, th ese sentim ents simply \n“did not relieve [Daimler] of the responsibility to read the [agreements] and determine [their] \nprecise contents for [himself] prior to signing [them].”  Red Online Mktg. , 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS \n11686, at *16.  Cf. McWreath , 81 F.

In that case, the aggrieved party had been presented with \nredlined documents reflecting that the language  he had insisted upon was in the contracts, but the \nexecution copy – which omitted the critical lan guage – had been clandestinely substituted.  In other \nwords, that aggrieved party had read the agreement before signing it, but alleged that the \ncounterparty  deleted a material term without informing him and re -presented the document without \nmentioning this edit.

Thus, the court held that Case 2:18-cv-00165-MJH   Document 22   Filed 07/30/18   Page 14 of 22 \n15 \n aggrieved party  was under no obligation to read the document again and had a dequately pled facts \ndemonstrating excusable neglect.  Id. at 824.  That, however, is not the case here .  Daimler never \nalleges that he ever read the Awards or the Agreements.   In sum, Plaintiff has failed to plead any \nfacts that would excuse his failure to read the relevant document s or that otherwise support an \nallegation of excusable neglect.  \nD. Breach of Contract and Covenant of Good Faith  \n(Counts 6 , 7, 8, 12, and 13)  \n \nPlaintiff also brings several breach of contract claims.  Counts Six and Twelve, against \nRobotics Hub and Coal Hill respectively, allege that Robotics Hub and Coal Hill breached the \nterms of the Awards by preventing Daimler from providing full time s ervice s.  (Docket No . 4 at \n¶¶ 125 -129, 164 -168).  Counts Seven and Thirteen allege that Robotics Hub and Coal Hill breached \nthe terms of the Agreements by: (1) misrepresenting the terms of the Awards and wrongly \npreventing Daimler from working full -time, thereby  resulting in the forfeiture of Daimler’s \nunvested units and the loss of his board position s; and (2) failing to issue units in connection with \nDaimler’s capital contributions.  ( Id. at ¶¶ 130 -136, 169 -175).  Count Eight is a claim against \nRobotics Hub for  breach of the Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing and arises from \nthe company having wrongfully prevent ed Daimler from working full time and thereby satisfying \nthe vesting requirements of his award.  ( Id. at ¶¶ 137 -140).   \n Under both Delaware  and Pennsylvania law, a breach of contract claim has three elements: \n(1) the existence of a contract; (2) a breach of a duty imposed by the contract; and (3) damages  \nresulting from that breach .  Greenstar LLC v. Heller , 814 F. Supp. 2d 444, 450 (D. Del. 2 011); \nRendon v. Ragans , No. 08 -1665, 2009 WL 1514471, at *2 ( W.D. Pa. May 29, 2009) (Fischer, J.) \n(citing Novinger Group Inc. v. Hartford Insurance, Inc . 514 F. Supp. 2d 662, 670 (M.D. Pa. 2007) ).  \nDaimler has failed to allege a breach of contract related to the Companies’ failure to hire him, but Case 2:18-cv-00165-MJH   Document 22   Filed 07/30/18   Page 15 of 22 \n16 \n he has pled facts suffic ient to establish a breach of ¶  7.2 of the Operating Agreements for failure \nto issue him units in connection with his capital contr ibutions.   \n  1. The Failure to Employ  \n With respect to his claims that he was wrongfully pr evented from working full -time, \nPlaintiff has failed to allege facts reflecting a breach of a duty imposed by the contract.  Although  \nPlaintiff asserts  that the parties contemplated his working full -time for the Companies, the  \ncontract s state otherwise .  Specifically, b oth Agreements plainly state  that they d o not “confer \nupon any Manager any rights with respect to continued employment by the Company.”  (Dock et \nNos. 4 -5 and 4 -6 at ¶ 5.7).  Similarly, the Awards provide that Daimler had no “right to be retained \nby or in the employ or service of the Company” and that the grant of the units could not “interfere \nin any way with the right of the Company to terminat e [Daimler’s] employment or service at any \ntime.”   (Docket Nos. 4 -3, and 4 -4 at ¶ 10).  They further provide that the “right of the Company, \nas applicable, to terminate at will [Daimler’s] employment or service at any time for any reason is \nspecifically r eserved.”  (Id.)  Moreover, given Moehle’s and Daimler’s disagreement, in \naccordance with ¶ 5.5(c)  of the Agreements, the parties called upon the Deadlock Arbitrator  to \nresolve t he dispute.  (Docket No. 4 at ¶¶  82, 84 ).  The arbitrator – about whom Daimler has made \nno allegations  of wrongful conduct  – sided with Moehle.  ( Id. at ¶ 84).  While Plaintiff may have \nhoped that he would work for the Companies and that his units would therefore vest, he signed an \nagreement that clearly and unambiguously pro vided that he had no such right .  This Court cannot \nenforce the contract Plaintiff wishes he signed.  Case 2:18-cv-00165-MJH   Document 22   Filed 07/30/18   Page 16 of 22 \n17 \n  The fact that the contracts at issue expressly authorize the complained -of conduct also \ndefeats  any claims that Defendants breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.10  \nIn order to pursue a claim of bre ach of the implied co venant, a plaintiff must allege a specific \nimplied contractual obligation, a breach of that obligation, and damages.  Anderson v. Wachovia \nMortg. Corp ., 497 F. Supp. 2d  572, 581 –82 (D. Del. 2007) ; Kelly v.  Blum , No. 4516 -VCP, 2010 \nWL 629 850 ( Del. Ch.  Feb. 24, 2010).  Daimler argues that the contracts implied an obligation to \nhire him and that the failure to do so constitutes a breach of the covenant of good faith.  Howev er, \nunder Delaware law, the implied coven ant cannot modify or override express con tractual terms.  \nNemec v. Shrader , 991 A.2d 1120, 1126 (Del. 2010) ; Kuroda v. SPJS Holdings, LLC , 971 A.2d \n872, 888  (Del. Ch. 2009).   Because the Awards and the Agreements  clearly contemplated that \nDaimler might not work for the Companies, and because they expressly provided that he had no \nright to employment, Daimler cannot claim a breach of the covenant of good faith based upon the \nCompanies’ refusal to employ him.  Moreover, the Agreements provided for deadlock arbitration, \nand the parties availed themselves of this provision.  The Deadlock Arbitrator’s decision is final \nand binding.  Plaintiff cannot convert his disagreement with the arbitrator’s decision into a bre ach \nof contract claim against Defendants.  Although Daimler undoubtedly regrets entering into these \ncontracts, t his Court may not “rewrite the contract  to appease a party who later wishes to rewrite \na contract  he now believes to have been a bad deal. Parties have a right to enter into good and bad \ncontracts , the law enforces both. ”  Nemec , 991 A.2d at 1126.    \n  \n                                                           \n10  According to Daimler, breach of the implied covenant “is asserted only against Robotics Hub under Delaware \nlaw (Count Eight), because Pennsylvania law does not rec ognize this as an independent claim.”  (Docket No. 19 at 15 \nn. 6).   \n Case 2:18-cv-00165-MJH   Document 22   Filed 07/30/18   Page 17 of 22 \n18 \n   2. The Failure to Issue Units i n Connection with Capital Contributions  \nIn addition to the forfeited 42 units under the awards, Daimler claims that he is entitled to \nan unspecified number of additional units in one or both of the Companies.  Specifically, he states \nthat he made capital contributions to the Companies of an addi tional $100,000 for which he did \nnot receive units.  (Docket No. 4 at ¶¶ 135, 174 ).  Daimler does not state when this contribution or \ncontributions were made, nor does he specify when and where he and Moehle agreed to the terms.  \nIn addition, the claim tha t Daimler is entitled to an unspecified number of additional units seems \nto contradict his earlier claims that he and Moehle were equal partners, and he does not explain \nwhy Moehle would agree to treat these advances as capital contributions (thereby makin g Daimler \nthe majority owner) as opposed to  treating them as  loans.  See, e.g.  (Docket No. 4 -5 at ¶ 14 ) \n(defining membership interest by the number of issued and outstanding units).  However, Daimler  \ndoes allege that he and Moehle (the only two members of the Companies’ boards) agreed that \nDaimler would provide funding to the Companies and that he would receive units in return.  \nDefendants  counter  that this does not constitute b oard approval is an ove rly technical reading of \nthe Agreements .  (Docket No. 20 at 8 ).  Moehle and Daimler were the only board members, and \nDaimler has alleged that the two had agreed that his contributions would constitute capital \ncontributions.   Thus, D aimler had the “consent of the b oard” for the issuance of units in exchange \nfor his $100,000.  Albeit thinly pled, these facts suffice to defeat Defendants’  motion to dismiss  \nPlaintiff’s breach of contract claim relating to the failure to issue units in connection with his \ncapita l contributions .   \n  Case 2:18-cv-00165-MJH   Document 22   Filed 07/30/18   Page 18 of 22 \n19 \n D. Tortious Interference  \n(Counts 3 and 4)  \n \nPlaintiff alleges that Moehle torti ously interfered with Daimler’s contracts with the \nCompanies.  These claims must be dismissed  because, as set forth above, Moehle’s actions were \nauthorized by the contracts at issue .  Under Delaware law, a plaintiff claiming tortious interference \nwith contract must plead and prove:  (1) the existence of a contract; (2) about which the defendant \nknew; (3) an intentional act that was a significant factor in causing a breach of the contract; (4) \nthat was without justification; and (5) which caused injury.  Kuhn Const. Co. v. Ocean and Coastal \nConsultants, Inc ., 844 F Supp. 2d 519 (D. Del. 2012).  Similarly, in Pennsylvania, a plaintiff \nclaiming tortious interference must prove: (1) the existence of a contract; (2) purposeful action by \nthe defendant intended t o harm the contractual relationship ; (3) the absence of privilege or \njustification; and (4)  damages.  Zurchin v. Ambridge Area School District , 300 F. Supp. 3d 681, \n694 (W.D. Pa. 2018) (Fischer, J.) ( citing Crivelli v. Gen. Motors Corp ., 215, F.3d 386, 394 (3d \nCir. 2000).  The Court has set forth above, and will not repeat here, that Moehle was under no \nobligation to agree to Daimler’s full time s ervice , and that the Companies ’ refusal to employ \nDaimler was expressly permitted under the terms of the Agreements .  Moreover, in referring the \ndispute to the Deadlock Arbitrator for resolution, Moehle and the Companies complied with the \nterms of the Agreements.  The claim for tortious interference therefore cannot lie.11   \n                                                           \n11  Defendants also argue that Moehle could not have torti ously interfered with the Robotics Hub and Coal Hill \nagreements because, as a manager and board member of the Companies, he was an agent of both entities. (Docket No. \n17 at 20) .  “[A] party to a contract cannot tortiously interfere with that very same cont ract,” and “[b]y extension, agents \nof a contracting party are also unable to tortiously interfere.” Kuhn , 844 F. Supp. 2d at 531.  See also Zurchin , 300 F. \nSupp. 3d at 694.   Plaintiff argues in response that Moehle acted in his personal capacity and not a s an agent of the \nCompanies , but  the paragraphs cited by Plaintiff do not plead that Moehle was acting in his personal capacity or  \notherwise  set forth facts that might suggest that Moehle was acting ultra vires .  (See Docket No. 19 at 18 citing  Docket \nNo. 4 at ¶¶ 29 -34, 78 -80, and 85 -88).  However, because questions of agency often hinge o n factual determinations, \nthe Court does not resolve  Daimler’s  tortious interference claims on the se grounds.  See, e.g., Kuhn , 844 F. Supp. 2d \nat 531 citing  Jurimex Kommerz Transit G.M.B.h. v. Case Corp ., 65 Fed.  App’x 803, 808 (3d Cir. 2003).  But see \nLubold v. Univ. Veterinary Specialists, LLC , CV-17-507, U.S. Dist. LEXIS 102281, at * 7 -8 (W.D. Pa., June 30, 2017) \n(in a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, dismissing tort ious interference claim against officers of corporate defendant, noting that Case 2:18-cv-00165-MJH   Document 22   Filed 07/30/18   Page 19 of 22 \n20 \n F. Unjust Enrichment  \n(Counts, 5, 11, and 16)  \n \nUnjust enrichment, or quantum meruit , is a “quasi -contract claim that allows a party to  \nrecover the reasonable value of his or her services if: (i) the party performed the services with the \nexpectation that the recipient would pay for them; and (ii) the recipient should have known that \nthe party expected to be paid. ”  Lookout Windpower Holdi ng, Co. v. Edison Mission Energy , 714 \nF. Supp. 2d 547, 553 (W.D. Pa. 2010)  (citations omitted ).  “Courts generally dismiss claims for \nquantum meruit on the pleadings when it is clear from the face of the complaint that there exists \nan express contract that  controls. ”  Id.  (citations and internal quotation marks omitted ).  Indeed, \n“the doctrine of unjust enrichment is inapplicable when the relati onship between the parties is \nfounded upon a written agreement or exp ress contract, regardless of how harsh the provisions of \nsuch contracts may seem in the light of subsequent happenings.”  Batoff , 130 F. Supp. 3d at 972 .  \nHowever, a plaintiff may “pursue alternative theories of recovery based on both breach of contract \nand unjust enrichment” to the extent there “i s any question as to the validity of the contract in \nquestion.”  Id.  In this case, Daimler admits that he has pled the unjust enrichment claims against \nthe Companies in the alternative , should the Court reject his breach of contract claims .  (Docket \nNo. 1 9 at 20).  Because  the Court finds the ex istence of valid contracts,  and because Plaintiff  does \nnot seek rescission of the  contracts  and instead claims damages pursuant to those contracts (which \nthe parties agree address the at -issue conduct ), these  claim s must be dismissed.   \n  \n                                                           \nplaintiff had failed to plead  that the individual defendants acted in their individual capacities as opposed to on behalf \nof the corporation).   \n Case 2:18-cv-00165-MJH   Document 22   Filed 07/30/18   Page 20 of 22 \n21 \n G. Accounting  \n(Counts 17 and 18)  \n \n In Pennsylvania, a legal accounting is “merely an incident” to a breach of contract claim.  \nMcWreath , 81 F. Supp. 3d at 468.  And, “[u] nder well -accepted Delaware  law, an accounting  is \nan equitable  remedy that consists of the adjustment of accounts  between parties and a rendering of \na judgment for the amount ascertained to be due to either as a result. In other words, an accounting  \nreflects a request for a particular type of remedy, rather than an equitable  claim in and of itself.” \nGarza v. Citigroup Inc. , 192 F. Supp. 3d 508, 511 (D. Del. 2016)  (citations and internal quotation \nmarks omitted) , reconsideration denied sub nom. Lopez Garza v. Citigroup Inc. , No. CV 15 -537-\nSLR, 2016 WL 7197364 (D. Del.

Because Daimler’s accounting claims  are not stand -alone claims and relate, instead, to the \nremedy sought, Counts Seventeen and Eighteen are dismissed.  Plaintiff, however, may demand  \nan accounting as part of  the relief sought  in the re -pled complaint.   See, e.g . McWreath , 81 F. Supp. \n3d at 468 (dismissing  accounting claim, noting that legal accounting was a remedy , not a stand -\nalone claim, and that equitable accounting could not lie when parties had contractual relationship); \nGarza , 192 F. Supp. 3d at 514 (dismissing accounting claim because it was not a stand -alone claim \nand, in any event,  plaintiff could not allege requisite elements).  \nIII. CONCLUSION  \n For the foregoing reasons, Defendants’ M otion  to Dismiss  (Docket No. [ 16]) is \nGRANTED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART.  The motion is GRANTED as to  Counts Two,  \nThree, Four, Five, Six, Eight, Ten, Eleven, Twelve, Fifteen, Sixteen , Seventeen, and Eighteen  of \nPlaintiff’s First Amended Complaint.  Counts Seven and Thirteen are dismissed insofar as they \nrelate to allegations regarding Moehle’s relationships with NREC and RI and the statements  that Case 2:18-cv-00165-MJH   Document 22   Filed 07/30/18   Page 21 of 22 \n22 \n the Daimler and Moehle Awards were identical.  Counts One, Nine, and Fourteen are dismissed \nwith leave t o re-plead the allegations regarding GE’s potential  investment.   Defendants’  motion \n(Docket No. [16]) is DENIED as to  Counts Seven and Thirteen, insofar as those counts  relate to \nPlaintiff s alleged capital contributions.  \n An appropriate order follows.  \n \n                                       s/ Nora Barry Fischer      \n                                             Nora Barry Fischer  \n                                              United States District Judge  \nDate:  July 27, 2018  \n \ncc/ecf: All counsel of record  \n Case 2:18-cv-00165-MJH   Document 22   Filed 07/30/18   Page 22 of 22",

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: Plaintiffs, Carcharadon, LLC and David Sweig, alleged that Defendants Ascend Robotics, LLC and David Askey lured them into working on a joint venture under false pretenses, taking undue advantage by side-lining them, and profiting from the venture. Although the court allowed promissory estoppel and quantum meruit claims to proceed, it dismissed with prejudice the claims of fraud, promissory fraud, negligent misrepresentation, and more against Ascend and denied fiduciary duty against Askey. Despite involving robotics, the case does not focus on AI, ML, or automated systems in its claims or holding.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether Defendants' promises and representations about an intellectual property license and joint venture obligations constituted actionable claims of fraud, promissory fraud, negligent misrepresentation, and breach of fiduciary duty.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court allowed the promissory estoppel and quantum meruit claims to proceed but dismissed the fraud, promissory fraud, negligent misrepresentation, equitable estoppel claims against both defendants, and breach of fiduciary duty claim against Ascend with prejudice, citing insufficient remedy elements, unreasonable reliance, and barred circumstances under existing statutes.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine you join a team to make cool robot gadgets based on promises people make. Halfway, the people who've been promising things don’t follow through or play fair, and you think you've been tricked. The judge listens, says you can still chase some promises they made, but isn’t convinced about the talk of fraud and lies because maybe you ignored some signals or had existing deals, so those parts of the case are closed now.",

Because Plaintiffs have not sufficient ly addressed the deficiencies identified by the \nCourt in its August 29, 2022 Opinion as to their fraud, promissory  fraud, negligent \nmisrepresentation, and equitable estoppel claims agai nst both Defendants and the breach of \nfiduciary duty claim against Asce nd, the Court dismisses those cla ims with prejudice.  But the \nCourt allows Plaintiffs’ breach of fiduciary du ty claim against Askey to proceed given their \nallegations that Askey controlled Aryze, which gi ves rise to a fiduciary duty toward his fellow \nlimited liability company (“LLC”)  members.

The Court does not \naddress the status of Ascend Build as a party or any re quest to impose a constructive trust against Ascend \nBuild in this Opinion.    \n3 The Court takes the facts in the background section from the SAC and exhibits attached thereto and \npresumes them to be true for the purpose of resolving Defendants’ motion to dismiss.  See Phillips v. \nPrudential Ins. Co. of Am ., 714 F.3d 1017, 1019–20 (7th Cir. 2013).   Case: 1:21-cv-06841 Document #: 24 Filed: 05/09/23 Page 2 of 25 PageID #:<pageID>3 \n Delaware limited liability company with its  principal place of business in Cambridge, \nMassachusetts, is a robotics busin ess.  Askey, a Massachusetts resident, formed Ascend in 2017. \n Sweig learned of Askey, Robert Cohanim (a nother businessman associated with Ascend), \nand Ascend in 2017.  Askey and Cohanim repres ented to Sweig that Ascend was developing \nrobotics technology for commercial painting, with the technology pr ojected to cut labor costs by \nsubstituting highly efficient r obots for human labor.  Aske y indicated that Ascend could \ncomplete the robotics developm ent but that it needed Sweig’s business, finance, and \nmanagement expertise to build a business based on the technology.  Askey did not want to take \ninvestors into Ascend, intending instead to create a new entity for the business.  Askey told \nSweig that Ascend was well-capita lized, well-known, and respected  in the early-stage venture \ncapital financing community, and had access to  capital sponsors to fund its commercial \ndevelopment.  Askey indicated Ascend would contri bute its existing and fu ture technology to the \nnew entity for exclusive “field of use” purpos es in commercial construction and adjacent \nmarketplaces.  Doc. 43 ¶ 19.  Sweig advised Askey that Ascend would have to make its \nintellectual property (“IP”) a nd technology freely available to the new entity through an arms-\nlength, perpetual royalty-free license agreement in order to attract investors to the new entity.  \nAskey agreed that Ascend would provide such a license.  Askey also i ndicated that the new \nentity’s robot prototype would be  ready for testing by August 2018.   \n Cohanim, Askey, and Ascend invited Sweig, wo rking through Carchara don, to join them \nin developing the new entity—which Askey form ed and named Aryze, LLC—as a consultant.  \nThey anticipated that Sweig would develop a bus iness plan for Aryze, bring investment into \nAryze, and help attract an executive team.  Sweig executed two written agreements in December \n2017 and June 2018 to memorialize the consulting arrangement.  Carcharadon, Askey, Cohanim, Case: 1:21-cv-06841 Document #: 24 Filed: 05/09/23 Page 3 of 25 PageID #:<pageID>4 \n and Phoenix Construction, LLC (“Phoenix”) si gned the December 2017 Agreement.  Phoenix, \nAryze’s predecessor-in-interest, wa s never formed.  Instead, shortly  after the parties executed the \nDecember 2017 Agreement, Askey formed Aryze, which assumed all of Phoenix’s obligations \nand rights under the Agreement.   Under the December 2017 Agreemen t, Plaintiffs received a 5% \nminority equity interest in Ary ze, along with voting rights.  Asce nd, as consideration for granting \nan exclusive, perpetual royalty-free IP license ag reement, also became an equity voting member \nin Aryze, as did Askey.  This di vision of equity gave Defendant s voting control of Aryze.  The \nparties amended the December 2017 Agreemen t in December 2018 to make clear that \nCarcharadon’s ownership interests had “been fully earned and under no circumstances . . . \nsubject to any vesting or  claw-back provisions.”  Id. ¶ 80. \n In early 2018, Ascend, through Askey, agreed to  spin out its existi ng and future IP and \ntechnology, including applicable tr ademarks (the “Ascend IP”), to  Aryze through an exclusive, \nperpetual, royalty-free IP licen se for use in the commercial pain ting industry and adjacent \nmarkets (the “IP License Agreement”).  Be ginning in early 2018, Defendants repeatedly \nconfirmed the terms of the IP License Agreement with Plaintiffs, repres enting that Ascend would \nexecute a formal IP License Ag reement memorializing this arra ngement.  Between July 2018 and \nJuly 2019, Ascend’s lawyers produced  three drafts of the IP License Agreement.     \n In reliance on Ascend’s representation s to him, including about the IP License \nAgreement, in May 2018, Sweig terminated two other Carchara don consulting agreements with \nLego Systems and Alcentra Capi tal Corporation, which togeth er paid him between $65,000 and \n$75,000 per month.  Sweig also stopped soliciting  new assignments through Carcharadon based \non Askey’s indication that Sweig would have a se nior leadership position at Aryze as well as Case: 1:21-cv-06841 Document #: 24 Filed: 05/09/23 Page 4 of 25 PageID #:<pageID>5 \n serve on its board of directors.  Sweig also decided not to pursue partnership opportunities \npresented to him by A.T. Kearne y and Alvarez & Marshal.   \nIn 2018 and 2019, Ascend, through Askey, approved  various Aryze materials, including \nconfidential investor memoranda (“CIMs”) that Sw eig prepared for potential Aryze investors.  \nSweig drafted these materials based on represen tations that Askey had made to him about the \nfact that the IP License Agr eement “had been negotiated.”  Id. ¶ 57.  The CIMs and other \ninvestor materials touted the IP License Agreem ent.  For example, the fall 2018 CIM (prepared \nby Sweig) stated that “[r]esear ch, [d]evelopment, and IP prot ection will be done by our partner \nAscend in order to reduce complexity and avoid duplication of effort.  Aryze has negotiated an \nexclusive, perpetual and royalty free agreemen t for the use of the technology in both core and \nadjacent markets.”  Id. ¶ 60.  Askey told Sweig that the fall 2018 CIM “look[ed] great.”  Id. ¶ 62.  \nAn updated summer 2019 CIM repeated  the same information.  Swei g also prepared an eighteen-\npage management presentation for Aryze, which st ated that “Aryze has an exclusive, perpetual \nand royalty free agreement to utilize the portfo lio of Ascend’s technolog ies in connection with \nall Aryze solutions.”  Id. ¶ 64.  Askey again approved of this presentation. \n By early 2018, Sweig had assembled various  resources for Aryze’ s benefit, including \nexperts such as Tom Danilek, a thirty-year vetera n commercial real estate  developer, and David \nAscher, the president of one of the largest commercial painting companies in the United States.  \nSweig also assembled an advisory board for Aryze, which included Steven Tomlinson, head of real estate private equity at a major law firm; Gr eg Kranias, who worked at a private equity firm; \nSamuel Guren, a venture capital expert; John Ki spert, who worked in the technology and chip \nmanufacturing space and in private equity; and Jo seph Massey, a former diplomat.  Danilek met \nwith Sweig and Askey in fall 2018, discussing the structure of Aryze and the IP License Case: 1:21-cv-06841 Document #: 24 Filed: 05/09/23 Page 5 of 25 PageID #:<pageID>6 \n Agreement.  Danilek also reviewed the CIMs an d other documents that Sweig had prepared for \nAryze.  Although Sweig identified himself as Ar yze’s CEO, he made Da nilek aware that Askey \ncontrolled Aryze.  Ultimately, Danilek became an advisor to Aryze in exchange for a promise of \ncompensation and a vested equity interest in  Aryze from Askey.  Danilek never received any \npayment for his work on be half of Aryze, however. \nAlso, during 2018 and 2019, Sweig contacted potential investor s and customers, \nincluding venture capital and c onstruction companies.  In April 2019, Sweig initiated serious \ndiscussions with Saint-Gobain, a global bui lding products and materials company, about \ninvesting in Aryze.  On April 25, 2019, Sweig and Askey met with high level executives from \nSaint-Gobain, a global building products and materials company.  During the meeting, Askey \nrepresented to Saint-Gobain’s representatives  that Ascend had granted Aryze the exclusive \nlicense to use its IP as  set forth in the IP License Agreem ent.  In early May 2019, Saint-Gobain \nreported an interest in making an  investment in Aryze as its lead, strategic investor, inquiring \nlater that month about Aryze’s IP  portfolio.  Sweig told Saint-G obain that Ascend owned the IP \nbut that it “would be subject to th e perpetual license agreement.”  Id. ¶ 87.  During a June 2019 \nmeeting with Saint-Gobain representatives, Aske y explicitly confirmed that Ascend had granted \nAryze the discussed IP license a nd that it was finalizing the IP License Agreement.  By August \n2019, Saint-Gobain had agreed on a written term  sheet with Sweig on Aryze’s behalf, pending \nthe fully executed IP License Agreement.   \nSweig also developed relations hips with representatives of  WeWork Companies, Inc., \none of the largest commer cial landlords.  In late April 2019, Sweig reported to WeWork that the \nfirst preliminary field trial for the Aryze robot delivered succe ssful results.  By August 2019, \nAryze had successfully completed the first of a two-phase pilot.  Based on those results, Case: 1:21-cv-06841 Document #: 24 Filed: 05/09/23 Page 6 of 25 PageID #:<pageID>7 \n WeWork was seriously considering creating a bi nding, strategic relationship as an Aryze \ncustomer based in large part on representations about the IP License Agreement.  Danilek and \nSweig also engaged in negotiations with Hines, the commercial real esta te developer for whom \nDanilek had worked, about investing in Aryze.   \nMoreover, Sweig undertook work outside the scope of the consulting agreements for \nAscend’s benefit, using his profe ssional network to help Ascend develop applications for other \nproducts, such as cold storage/material handli ng, and leveraging Ascend’s artificial intelligence \nengine in other platforms.  Ascend never compensated Sweig for this additional work.  On August 26, 2019, Askey confirmed in writ ing that Plaintiffs had a 17.5% equity \ninterest in Aryze, with Ascend having a 21.2% interest and Askey individually having a 22.8% \ninterest.  Although the Agreement reserved 30% of the membership  units for a future employee \npool, only Askey, Ascend, and Sweig had voting right s.  This meant that Defendants had over \n50% of Aryze’s voting interests and thus controlled Aryze, w ith Sweig’s equity interest \nincreased to 25%.  Askey further indicated that  Ascend’s goal was to support Aryze’s growth \nand see Ascend obtain an investment return of at l east $120 million.   \n On August 27, 2019, Askey sent Sweig a furthe r draft of the IP License Agreement, \nwhich excluded the previously discussed perp etual, irrevocable, r oyalty-free IP license.  \nDefendants initially represented that the omissi on would be corrected, but over the following \nthree weeks, Sweig learned that  Defendants did not intend to honor  their prior representations \nabout the IP license, instead intending to ma ke Aryze dependent on Ascend for access to the \nAscend IP.  Thus, in early September 2019, Sweig told Askey that, as Aryze’s CEO and as a \nfiduciary, he would not sign the la test IP License Agreement or pr esent it to financing partners \nbecause it was not commercially reasonable or an arms-length transaction. On September 10, Case: 1:21-cv-06841 Document #: 24 Filed: 05/09/23 Page 7 of 25 PageID #:<pageID>8 \n 2019, Sweig sent an email to Ascend’s attorneys and others, representing that the current draft \n“seem[s] to be incongruous if not  completely inconsistent with the business plan that has been \ncirculated to investors for well over a year . . . a business plan signed off on by [Askey] and \nAscend in the first half of 2018.”  Id. ¶ 119.   \nOn September 15, 2019, Askey provided Sweig and Aryze’s counsel with a further \nrevised draft of the IP License Agreement pr epared by Ascend’s attorneys, which similarly \nreflected that the grant of an IP license to Ary ze was not perpetual, irrevocable, unconditional, or \nroyalty-free and did not give Aryze any rights to future IP  developed by Ascend.  During a \nSeptember 17, 2019 conference cal l with Askey, Ascend representatives, and Sweig, Askey \nincorrectly represented that the September 15 dr aft aligned with the bus iness plan Sweig had \nprepared.  During this call, Askey made clear As cend’s intention to seize for its own benefit the \nwork Sweig had done on Aryze’s behalf, ultimate ly through a different company, Ascend Build.  \nOn a separate call that same day, Askey terminated  Plaintiffs’ services.  In a follow-up email on \nSeptember 19, Askey attached a letter, which he  signed as an Aryze manager, confirming the \ntermination of Sweig’s agreements  with Aryze.  Askey stated: \nWhile I will not go into all the de tails and reasons here, the manner \nin which you have provided services  to Aryze over the course of \ntime, and especially over the pa st month, has led me to this \ndecision.  Most recently, in our call on the evening of September 17 with co-founders Ricky and Amy in which we discussed the upcoming fundraising proposal to Sa int-Gobain, you indicated that \nif Saint-Gobain asked you in our upcoming meeting whether you \nagreed with the proposed license agreement that Aryze planned to \npresent, you would state that you did not.  This reinforced to \nRicky, Amy, and me that your overa ll vision for the future of \nAryze is not aligned [with] the co llective vision of the founders.  \nWhile you have provided important services over the years as an \nindependent contractor and consul tant, in my opinion you simply \nhave not demonstrated the temperam ent that I want and that I feel \nAryze needs in a CEO or in an executive-level role in the Company. Case: 1:21-cv-06841 Document #: 24 Filed: 05/09/23 Page 8 of 25 PageID #:<pageID>9 \n Doc. No. 43-19 at 2.  In the same letter, Askey also denied that Pl aintiffs had any equity interest \nin Aryze.  This denial ignored Askey’s August 26, 2019 email to Sweig and the December 2018 Amendment to the December 2017 Agreement, whic h both confirmed Plaintif fs’ equity interest \nin Aryze.    Shortly after Askey terminated Sweig, Ar yze ceased operations.  In October 2019, Askey \nformed Ascend Build, affiliated with Ascend.  In November 2019, Askey approached Saint-Gobain about making an investment in his “n ew” venture, but Saint-Gobain declined.   \n Plaintiffs are currently  engaged in arbitration proceedings  against Askey, in his individual \ncapacity, and Aryze for breach of contract, frau d, and other business torts pursuant to the \narbitration provisions in the cons ulting agreements.  Although Plaint iffs had also asserted claims \nagainst Ascend in the arbitration proceeding, a federal district cour t in Massachusetts ruled that, \nas a non-signatory to the agreements, Ascend was not bound to arbitrat e Plaintiffs’ claims \nagainst it.   \nLEGAL STANDARD   \n A motion to dismiss under Rule  12(b)(6) challenges the sufficiency of the complaint, not \nits merits.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6); Gibson v. City of Chicago , 910 F.2d 1510, 1520 (7th Cir. \n1990).  In considering a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, the C ourt accepts as true all well-pleaded facts in \nthe plaintiff’s complaint and draws all reasonable inferences from those fa cts in the plaintiff’s \nfavor.  Kubiak v. City of Chicago , 810 F.3d 476, 480–81 (7th Cir. 2016).  To survive a Rule \n12(b)(6) motion, the co mplaint must assert a fa cially plausible claim an d provide fair notice to \nthe defendant of the claim’s basis.  Ashcroft v. Iqbal , 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009); Bell Atl. Corp. v. \nTwombly , 550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007); Adams v. City of Indianapolis , 742 F.3d 720, 728–29 (7th \nCir. 2014).  A claim is facially pl ausible “when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the Case: 1:21-cv-06841 Document #: 24 Filed: 05/09/23 Page 9 of 25 PageID #:<pageID>10 \n court to draw the reasonable infe rence that the defendant is liab le for the misconduct alleged.”  \nIqbal , 556 U.S. at 678. \n Rule 9(b) requires a party alleging fraud to “state with particularity the circumstances \nconstituting fraud.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(b).  “Thi s ordinarily requires describing the ‘who, what, \nwhen, where, and how’ of the fraud, although the exact  level of particularity that is required will \nnecessarily differ based on th e facts of the case.”  AnchorBank, FSB v. Hofer , 649 F.3d 610, 615 \n(7th Cir. 2011) (citation omitted).  Rule 9(b) do es not govern only claims of fraud; it applies to \nall allegations and averments of fraud.  Pirelli Armstrong Tire Corp. Retiree Med. Benefits Tr. v. \nWalgreen Co. , 631 F.3d 436, 446–47 (7th Cir. 2011); Borsellino v. Goldman Sachs Grp., Inc. , \n477 F.3d 502, 507 (7th Cir. 2007).  “A claim that ‘s ounds in fraud’—in other words, one that is \npremised upon a course of fra udulent conduct—can imp licate Rule 9(b)’s heightened pleading \nrequirements.”  Borsellino , 477 F.3d at 507.   \nANALYSIS \nI. Fraud (Count I) \n To state a fraud claim, Plaintiffs must allege that: (1) Defendants made a false statement or omission of material fact, (2 ) Defendants knew of or believed  in its falsity, (3) Defendants \nintended to induce Plaintiffs to act, (4) Plainti ffs acted in reliance on the truth of Defendants’ \nstatement, and (5) damages resu lted from Plaintiffs’ reliance.  Weidner v. Karlin , 402 Ill. App. \n3d 1084, 1087 (2010).  Plaintiffs set forth the following alleged mis representations of “past and \nexisting material facts” th at Askey made to Sweig: \na. Beginning in Spring 2018, Ar yze was to be independent \nfrom Ascend Robotics.  To achieve Aryze’s independence, Ascend’s IP and related technology in  Aryze’s field of use, related \nfields of use and adjacent markets would be “spun out” to Aryze through the IP License Agreemen t, the basic term of which Case: 1:21-cv-06841 Document #: 24 Filed: 05/09/23 Page 10 of 25 PageID #:<pageID>11 \n provided Aryze with a perpetual, royalty free license of Ascend’s \nIP and technology; and \nb. Beginning in approximately Spring of 2018, Askey, on \nnumerous occasions confirmed in writing and represented orally to Sweig, members of the Aryze Advisory Board, prospective \ninvestors and customers that the es sential terms of the IP License \nAgreement – that Aryze “had” or “has” negotiated, i.e., an exclusive, perpetual, and royalty free IP license from Ascend Robotics for all of current and fu ture Ascend IP and technology in \nthe field of use, related fields of use and adjacent markets.  Prior to \nthe materials distribution, Askey’s representations were repeatedly \nconfirmed in CIMs, Teasers and re lated investor materials that \nSweig prepared at Askey’s dir ection and with Askey’s direct \ninvolvement and with his explic it approval, individually and on \nbehalf of Ascend Robotics. \nDoc. 43 ¶ 144.  The first set of statements, that  Aryze “was to be i ndependent” and that the \nAscend IP and related technology “would be ‘spun out,’” id., amounts to promises about the \nfuture.  See Ault v. C.C. Servs., Inc. , 232 Ill. App. 3d 269, 271 (1992) (“[A]lleged \nmisrepresentations must be statem ents of present or preexisting facts, and not statements of \nfuture intent or conduct.”).  The Court addresses this in connection with Plaintiffs’ promissory \nfraud claim and here focuses on the second set, As key’s statements about the terms of the IP \nLicense Agreement.   \nThe Court initially reiterates that, to the extent that Plaintiffs  contend that Askey \napproved of statements made in the CIMs and other materials that Sweig authored or that Askey \nmade certain statements on beha lf of Aryze, they cannot reco ver for such representations.  See \nDoc. 37 at 20; Abazari v. Rosalind Franklin Univ. of Med. & Sci. , 2015 IL App (2d) 140952, \n¶ 14 (specifying that the defendant must have made the false statem ent at issue).  But Plaintiffs \nalso allege that “in early 2018 Askey and Ascend Robotics agreed with and repres ented to Sweig \nthat Ascend Robotics provided Aryz e with an exclusive, perpetua l, royalty free license enabling \nAryze to use all current and future Ascend IP in th e field of use, related fields of use,” Doc. 43 Case: 1:21-cv-06841 Document #: 24 Filed: 05/09/23 Page 11 of 25 PageID #:<pageID>12 \n ¶ 37, and that “Askey repeatedly represented to  Sweig, members of the Aryze Advisory Board, \npotential investors and customers that Ascend ‘had’ or ‘has’ agreed  to the essential terms of the \nIP License Agreement,” id. ¶ 42; see also id.  ¶ 47 (“From early 2018 until late August of 2019, \nAskey repeatedly represented to Sweig, member s of the Aryze Adviso ry Board, prospective \ninvestors and customers that, as previously represented, the term s of the IP License Agreement \nhad been agreed upon[.]”).  Plaintiffs buttress these allegations by poin ting to two specific \ninstances where Askey made such representati ons: (1) a November 15, 2018 meeting of Sweig, \nAskey, and Danilek, where Askey represented the terms of the IP License Agreement and the \nfact that Ascend’s attorneys we re memorializing the terms, id. ¶ 48; and (2) a June 12, 2019 \nmeeting of Askey and Sweig with Saint-Goba in, where Askey confirmed that Ascend had \ngranted Aryze the IP License Agreement, id. ¶¶ 90–91.   \nAmong other things, Defendants contend that Plaintiffs have not adequately alleged \nreliance.  This element of a fraud claim requir es that Plaintiffs’ reliance be reasonable or \njustified.  Dvorkin v. Soderquist , 2022 IL App (1st) 201368, ¶ 87.  “In determining whether \nreliance was reasonable, all of the facts which plaintiff had actual knowledge of, as well as all of \nthose it might have learned if it had used ordinary prudence, mu st be taken into account.”  \nLoggerhead Tools, LLC v. Sears Holdings Corp ., No. 12-CV-9033, 2016 WL 5111573, at *4 \n(N.D. Ill. Sept. 20, 2016) (quoting Teamsters Local 282 Pension Tr. Fund v. Angelos , 839 F.2d \n366, 370 (7th Cir. 1988)), aff’d , 784 F. App’x 785 (Fed. Cir. 2019).  Here, as in their initial \ncomplaints, Plaintiffs allege that they reasona bly relied on Askey’s re presentations about the \nstatus of the IP License Agr eement by continuing to work fo r Aryze and performing under the \nAgreements instead of terminati ng them.  Defendants, however, argue that Sw eig, a sophisticated \nbusinessman who was represented by counsel, could not reasonably re ly on an unexecuted Case: 1:21-cv-06841 Document #: 24 Filed: 05/09/23 Page 12 of 25 PageID #:<pageID>13 \n license agreement or an arrangement that he  knew the parties con tinued to negotiate.  See \nRunnemede Owners, Inc.  v. Crest Mortg. Corp. , 861 F.2d 1053, 1059 (7th Cir. 1988) (“Taking \ninto consideration that Ghura is an experienced  businessman, he certainly should have proceeded \nwith caution when confronted with oral representa tions inconsistent with the written terms of the \ncontract, such as Rayman’s ‘we have a deal’ a ssurances.” (footnote omitted)).  Nothing in the \nSAC undercuts the Court’s prior conclusion that Sweig’s reliance on the dr aft terms of the IP \nLicense Agreement was unreasonable.  Doc. 37 at 20–21.  The same reasoning applies to any \noral or written statements As key more generally made about the status of the IP License \nAgreement.  As the SAC makes clear, the par ties to the license (As cend and Aryze) never \nexecuted a final version, a fact that Sweig kne w and that Askey acknowledged when discussing \nthe IP License Agreement with ad visors and potential investors.  See, e.g. , Doc. 43 ¶ 48 (Askey \nrepresented to Danilek in Sweig’s presen ce that “Ascend Robotics’ attorneys were \nmemorializing those terms”); id. ¶ 92 (Askey represented to Sain t-Gobain that “the written IP \nLicense Agreement was being finalized”).  B ecause Sweig knew of facts that contradicted \nAskey’s representations that Ascend had already granted Aryz e the license and that Askey \nhimself acknowledged this, the Court canno t find Sweig’s alleged reliance on the \nmisrepresentations that the license ha d already been granted reasonable.  See AMPAT/Midwest, \nInc. v. Ill. Tool Works, Inc. , 896 F.2d 1035, 1042 (7th Cir. 1990) (“ If the victim acted recklessly \nin the face of the alleged fraud, it is difficult to  believe that he was act ually deceived; he may \nsimply regret having assumed a risk  that has turned out badly.”);  D.S.A. Fin. Corp. v. Cnty. of \nCook , 345 Ill. App. 3d 554, 561 (2003) (“If the party’ s reliance is unreasonabl e in light of the \ninformation open to him, the loss is c onsidered his own responsibility.”); Adler v. William Blair \n& Co. , 271 Ill. App. 3d 117, 125–26 (1995) (“A person may not enter into a tr ansaction with his Case: 1:21-cv-06841 Document #: 24 Filed: 05/09/23 Page 13 of 25 PageID #:<pageID>14 \n eyes closed to available information and then charge that he has been deceived by another.” \n(citation omitted)).  As a result, Plaintiffs cannot recover for Askey’ s allegedly fraudulent \nstatements concerning whether Ascend had grante d Aryze the license contemplated by the IP \nLicense Agreement.4   \nII. Promissory Fraud (Count II) \nTo state a claim for promissory fraud, in a ddition to the elements of fraud discussed \nabove, Plaintiffs must allege that  Defendants made the misrepresentat ions “as part of a scheme to \ndefraud.”  Trade Fin. Partners, LLC v. AAR Corp. , 573 F.3d 401, 413 (7th Cir. 2009); see also \nDesnick v. Am. Broad. Cos. , 44 F.3d 1345, 1354 (7th Cir. 1995) (“[P]romissory fraud is \nactionable only if it either is particularly egregi ous or . . . is embedded in a larger pattern of \ndeceptions or enticements that reasonably induc es reliance and against which the law ought to \nprovide a remedy.”).  The Court pr eviously dismissed this claim, finding that Plaintiffs had not \nadequately alleged a scheme to defraud.  Doc.  37 at 18–19.  Specifically, the Court found that \nAskey’s repeated assertions that Ascend woul d contribute its technol ogy and would implement \nthe IP License Agreement did not amount to a scheme to defraud.  See Sols. Team, Inc. v. Oak St. \nHealth, MSO, LLC , No. 17-cv-1879, 2019 WL 462481, at *6 (N .D. Ill. Feb. 6, 2019) (“Plaintiffs \ncannot establish a scheme to defraud merely  by alleging that defendants made the same \nrepresentations multiple times.”); Nat’l Painting, Inc. v. PPG Architectural Finishes, Inc. , No. 14 \nC 8054, 2015 WL 1593008, at *4 (N.D. Ill. Apr.  1, 2015) (repetition of fraudulent \nmisrepresentations, without more, does not adequate ly allege a scheme to defraud).  The Court \nalso found that Plaintiffs had not  alleged that Defendants “engage d in other acts of trickery \ncompounding the initial misrepresenta tions” or “that they perpetrate [d] this type of fraud as a \n \n4 Because the Court finds that Plaintiffs cannot a llege reasonable reliance, the Court need not address \nDefendants’ remaining arguments for dismissal of the fraud claim.   Case: 1:21-cv-06841 Document #: 24 Filed: 05/09/23 Page 14 of 25 PageID #:<pageID>15 \n regular practice, or on any grand scale” that would allow the Court to infer a scheme to defraud.  \nLeDonne v. Axa Equitable Life Ins. Co. , 411 F. Supp. 2d 957, 960–62 (N.D. Ill. 2006), \nsuperseded on other grounds by statute , 735 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/ 2-2201.  Finally, the Court \nconcluded that Ascend’s ultimate failure to enter into the IP License Agreement did not on its \nown demonstrate that it and/ or Askey never intended to keep the promise to do so.  See BPI \nEnergy Holdings, Inc. v. IEC (Montgomery), LLC , 664 F.3d 131, 137 (7th Cir. 2011) (“[T]he fact \nthat a party breaks a contract doesn’t show that  its promise to perform it had been fraudulent \nwhen made—that is, that the pa rty had never intended to perform  it.”).  Nothing in the SAC \novercomes these problems that th e Court previously identified; the Court again dismisses the \npromissory fraud claim.   III. Negligent Misrepresentation (Count III) \nTo state a claim for negligen t misrepresentation, Plaintiffs must allege: “(1) a false \nstatement of material fact; (2) carelessness or negligence in ascertaining the truth of the \nstatement by the party making it; (3) an intention to induce the other party to act; (4) action by \nthe other party in reliance on the truth of the st atement; (5) damage to the other party resulting \nfrom such reliance; and (6) a duty on the party making the statement to  communicate accurate \ninformation.”  Tricontinental Indus., Ltd. v. Pricewaterhouse Coopers, LLP , 475 F.3d 824, 833–\n34 (7th Cir. 2007) (quoting First Midwest Bank, N.A. v. Stewart Title Guar. Co. , 218 Ill. 2d 326, \n334–35 (2006)).  The Court previously explained that, because Plaintif fs seek only economic \ndamages, i.e., damages not involving personal injury or  property damage, “t he duty to avoid \nnegligently conveying false information is  imposed only if the party accused of \nmisrepresentation ‘is in the busine ss of supplying information for th e guidance of ot hers in their \nbusiness transactions.’”  Dino Publ’g LLC v. Maritimo Mktg. Ams., Inc ., No. 19 C 1921, 2019 Case: 1:21-cv-06841 Document #: 24 Filed: 05/09/23 Page 15 of 25 PageID #:<pageID>16 \n WL 3857875, at *2 (N.D. Ill. Aug. 16, 2019) (quoting First Midwest , 218 Ill. 2d at 335); Prime \nLeasing, Inc. v. Kendig , 332 Ill. App. 3d 300, 311 ( 2002).  Otherwise, the Moorman or economic \nloss doctrine bars a plaintiff’s  attempt to recover purely ec onomic losses through tort.  First \nMidwest , 218 Ill. 2d at 337–42 (explaining Moorman doctrine and its two other inapplicable \nexceptions).  In addressing the initial complaints, the Court co ncluded that Defendants did not \nengage in the kind of business that provided informa tion for others to re ly on in their own \nbusiness transactions, and so the economic loss doctrine barred Plaintiffs’ negligent \nmisrepresentation claim.  Doc. 37 at 22–23.   \nPlaintiffs disagree with the Court’s analysis of the economic loss doctr ine, insisting that it \nonly applies where the duty arises from a breach of contract and that they have alleged an \nextracontractual duty that allo ws their claim to proceed.  See Congregation of the Passion, Holy \nCross Province v. Touche Ross & Co. , 159 Ill. 2d 137, 162 (1994) (“Where a duty arises outside \nof the contract, the economic lo ss doctrine does not prohibit recovery in tort for the negligent \nbreach of that duty.”);  Kanter v. Deitelbaum , 271 Ill. App. 3d 750, 754–55 (1995) (economic \nloss doctrine did not bar neglig ence claim where the defendant’s duty to the plaintiff was \nextracontractual) .  The Court need not re solve this question, however, because even assuming \nthat the economic loss doctrine does not apply here because Defendants owed Plaintiffs a \nfiduciary duty, Plaintiffs’ negl igent misrepresentation claim fails.  As discussed in connection \nwith their fraud claim, Plaintiffs cannot allege  that they reasonably  relied on the alleged \nmisrepresentations, one of the required elements of a neglig ent misrepresentation claim.  See \nNeptuno Treuhand-Und Verwaltungs gesellschaft Mbh v. Arbor , 295 Ill. App. 3d 567, 575 (1998) \n(“[N]o recovery for fraudul ent misrepresentation, fraudulen t concealment or negligent \nmisrepresentation is possible unless pl aintiffs can prove justifiable re liance, i.e., that any reliance Case: 1:21-cv-06841 Document #: 24 Filed: 05/09/23 Page 16 of 25 PageID #:<pageID>17 \n was reasonable. . . .  If ample opportunity existed to discover the truth, then reliance is not \njustified.”).  Therefore, the Court again di smisses the negligent misrepresentation claim. \nIV. Breach of Fiduciary Duty (Count IV) \n“To state a claim for breach of fiduciary duty under Delaware law, a plaintiff must allege \nthat a fiduciary duty existed and that  the defendant breached that duty.”5  Cornielsen v. Infinium \nCap. Mgmt., LLC , 916 F.3d 589, 604 (7th Cir. 2019).  The Cour t previously dismissed this claim, \nconcluding that Defendants did not have any fiduciary duties to Plaintiffs as minority \nshareholders in Aryze because none of the parties had more than an  expectancy interest in Aryze \nstock.  Doc. 37 at 27–30.  Plaint iffs have repleaded this clai m, which Defendants argue fails \nbecause the Court correctly  concluded that Defendants never had an equity interest in Aryze that \nwould create a duty to Sweig.  Plai ntiffs maintain that the Court er red in its analysis, particularly \nas it relied on general cor poration law as opposed to that specific to LLCs.   \nIn previously analyzing this issue, the parties and the Cour t glossed over this significant \ndetail: Askey formed Aryze as an LLC.  Delawa re law treats “any agreement (whether referred \nto as a limited liability company agreement, ope rating agreement or otherwise), written, oral or \nimplied, of the member or members as to the affairs of a limited liability company and the \nconduct of its business” as an LLC agreement.  Del. Code Ann. tit. 6, § 18-101(9).  In other \nwords, Delaware’s LLC Act “creates myriad opp ortunities for LLC agreem ents that range from \nthe minimalistic to the ill-formed  to the simply incomplete.”  Feeley v. NHAOCG, LLC , 62 A.3d \n649, 663 (Del. Ch. 2012); see also XRI Inv. Holdings LLC v. Holifield , 283 A.3d 581, 660 n.87 \n(Del. Ch. 2022) (“LLC agreements present themselv es with varying levels of formality.  Under \nthe LLC Act an LLC agreement can be ‘written, oral  or implied.’  An LLC agreement is also not \n \n5 The parties agree, and the Court accepts for the purpo ses of this motion, that Delaware law applies to \nthis claim.  Case: 1:21-cv-06841 Document #: 24 Filed: 05/09/23 Page 17 of 25 PageID #:<pageID>21 \n With the filing of the SAC, Defendants properly raise the statute of frauds as a reason for \ndismissal of this claim.7  “[P]romissory estoppel does not ba r the application of the statute of \nfrauds.”  McInerney v. Charter Golf, Inc. , 176 Ill. 2d 482, 492 (1997).  Il linois’ statute of frauds \nrenders promises and agreements  that cannot be performed with in one year unenforceable.  740 \nIll. Comp. Stat. 80/1.  “The test for determining whether the statute of frauds  applies to a contract \nis whether the contract is capab le of being performed within one  year of its formation, not \nwhether such occurrence is likely.”  Robinson v. BDO Seidman, LLP , 367 Ill. App. 3d 366, 370 \n(2006).  Here, Plaintiffs’ promis sory estoppel claim focuses on Askey’s alleged promise to \nexecute the IP License Agreement.  Although Ascend never executed th at agreement, nothing \nsuggests that it could not have done so within a y ear, and so the statute of  frauds does not bar the \nclaim.8  Id.   \nDefendants next argue that the promissory esto ppel claim fails because Plaintiffs have not \nidentified an unambiguous promise.  They ma intain that Askey’s pr omise that Ascend would \nexecute the IP License Agreement facially cont radicts other representa tions that Defendants \n \n7 Defendants could have and should have raised the arguments they now make for dismissal of the \npromissory estoppel claim in their initial motion to dism iss Plaintiffs’ complaints, particularly given that \nthe SAC does not materially change the allegations related to this claim.  See Burton v. Ghosh , 961 F.3d \n960, 968 (7th Cir. 2020) (“[T]he invitation to answ er an amended complaint should be understood as \npermission to plead in response to the amendments, as contemplated by Rule 15(a)(3), unless leave is \nexpressly given to raise new defenses unrelated to th e amendments.  In the usual course, this means \nresponding to the new substance of the amended complaint.”); Wright & Miller, 5C Federal Practice & \nProcedure § 1388 (“The filing of an amended compla int will not revive the right to present by motion \ndefenses that were available but were not asserted in  timely fashion prior to the amendment of the \npleading.”).  Nonetheless, the Court finds it appropriate  to address Defendants’ arguments on their merits \ngiven that the parties have fully briefed the issues. \n \n8 Defendants argue that the Court should consider  not whether Ascend could execute the IP License \nAgreement within a year but rath er the “consideration” Plaintiffs gave for the promise—Sweig’s \nperformance of services to Aryze—which they maintain  he could not because he  worked for Aryze for \nalmost two years.  But this again confuses the i ssues, as Plaintiffs’ promissory estoppel claim does not \nfocus on Sweig’s agreement to provide services to  Aryze under the consulting agreements nor do \nPlaintiffs have to allege considerati on to pursue a promissory estoppel claim.  See Matthews , 2016 IL \n117638, ¶ 93 (“Under Illinois law, a promissory estoppel claim will succeed where the other elements of a \ncontract exist (offer, acceptance, and mutual assent), but consideration is lacking.”).   Case: 1:21-cv-06841 Document #: 24 Filed: 05/09/23 Page 21 of 25 PageID #:<pageID>22 \n allegedly made about the fact th at the license had been finalized  and so creates an ambiguity.  \nBut the Court finds no such ambiguity, given Plai ntiffs’ acknowledgment that Askey represented \nthat the agreement had been negotiated but that th e ministerial details remained to be finalized.  \nPlaintiffs have set fort h the IP License Agreement’s specific terms.  These details differentiate \nthis case from those where courts have found pro mises to enter into agr eements too indefinite.  \nCf. Sembos v. Philips Components , 376 F.3d 696, 704 (7th Cir. 2004) (promise of employment \nwithout specification of a position, salary, or other terms of empl oyment was too indefinite to \nconstitute an unambiguous promise).   \nDefendants also argue that Plaintiffs ca nnot plead reliance because the consulting \nagreements already obligated them to provide services to Aryze.  Indeed, “once consideration is \nfound to exist, a party to the contract can no l onger maintain an action for promissory estoppel \nwhere the performance which is said to satisfy the requirement of detrimental reliance is the \nsame performance which supplies the c onsideration for the contract.”  Prentice v. UDC Advisory \nServs., Inc. , 271 Ill. App. 3d 505, 512 (1995).  But Plaint iffs focus not on their obligations to \nAryze but rather on the fact that  Defendants’ promises about the IP License Agreement allegedly \ncaused Sweig to forgo other employment.  Altho ugh a factual question may exist as to whether \nSweig could have provided the services under th e consulting agreements and undertaken other \nconsulting opportunities at the same time, at this stage, Plaintiffs’ allegations sufficiently suggest \nreliance independent of their obligat ions under the consulting agreements.9  Cf. id.  at 514 \n(“Promissory estoppel cannot be based upon a pro mise which only induces pl aintiffs to do that \n \n9 The SAC does include an allegation that Sweig had to  terminate other consulting agreements “to enable \nhim to meet his increasing responsibilities to Aryze.”  Doc. 43 ¶ 73.  Defendants point to this allegation to argue that Sweig acknowledges that he forwent bus iness opportunities “to meet his existing duties under \nthe consulting agreements.”  Doc. 56 at 8.  Because th e Court reads the SAC in the light most favorable to \nPlaintiffs at this stage, it does not find that this allegation forecloses Plaintiffs ’ contention that he could \nhave undertaken these outside opportuniti es regardless of his obligations under the consulting agreements.   Case: 1:21-cv-06841 Document #: 24 Filed: 05/09/23 Page 22 of 25 PageID #:<pageID>23 \n which they were already legall y bound to do.”).  And unlike the misrepresentation claims, where \nthe Court has found that Plaintiffs  cannot plead that any reliance was reasonable, here the Court \naccepts that Plaintiffs detrimen tally relied on Askey’s promises because those alleged promises \ninvolved the existence of and the intention to finalize the IP License Agreement, not just the \nrepresentation that such an agreement already existed.   \nFinally, Defendants argue that th e parol evidence rule bars th e promissory estoppel claim.  \n“[A] dispute as to the terms of  a contract rather th an its existence cannot be grounds for invoking \nthe doctrine of promissory estoppel where to do so would violate the pa rol evidence rule.”  Id.  \nBut as the Court previously recognized, the c onsulting agreements do no t address the subject \nmatter at issue in the promissory estoppel cl aim.  Doc. 37 at 24–25.  Indeed, the integration \nclauses specify that the consulti ng agreements only concern “Car charadon’s engagement,” with \nno discussion of the Ascend IP.  See Doc. 43-1 at 4; Doc. 43-2 at 4.  Thus, the integration clauses \nin the consulting agreements and the parol evidence rule do not bar Plaintiffs’ clai m about the IP \nLicense Agreement, allowing Plaintiffs’ promissory estoppel claim to proceed. \nVII. Quantum Meruit (Count VII) \nIn its August 29, 2022 Opinion, th e Court allowed Plaintiffs  to pursue their quantum \nmeruit claim alleging that Sweig performed work for Ascend’s benefit outside the scope of the \nconsulting agreements absent compensation agai nst Ascend.  Ascend now argues that the statute \nof frauds bars this claim.10  But Ascend cites to no authority in dicating that the statute of frauds \napplies to quantum meruit claims, and courts have instead recognized that such recovery \n \n10 In reply, Ascend also argues that quantum meruit’s purpose is incompatible with Plaintiffs’ claims \nbecause they already received compen sation for their work.  Ascend only raised this argument in reply, \nwaiving it.  See Multi-Ad Servs., Inc. v. NLRB , 255 F.3d 363, 370 (7th Cir. 2 001) (“It is well-settled that \nparties may not raise new arguments or present new facts for the first time in reply.”).  But the Court also \ndoes not find this argument persuasive because Plainti ffs claim they performed work unrelated to their \nresponsibilities under the consulting agreements, for which they received no compensation. Case: 1:21-cv-06841 Document #: 24 Filed: 05/09/23 Page 23 of 25 PageID #:<pageID>24 \n becomes available where oral agreements are re ndered unenforceable becau se of the statute of \nfrauds.  See, e.g. , Fischer v. First Chicago Cap. Mkts., Inc. , 195 F.3d 279, 284 (7th Cir. 1999) \n(noting the possibility of rec overing under quantum meruit despite  the fact that promissory \nestoppel claim failed under the statute of frauds); In re Rowell , 606 B.R. 329, 344 (Bankr. N.D. \nIll. 2019) (“Illinois courts have recognized the ex istence of a claim in restitution for performance \non an unenforceable contract, including on the basis of the statute of frauds, to avoid unjust \nenrichment.” (foot note omitted)); Cove Mgmt. v. AFLAC, Inc. , 2013 IL App (1st) 120884, ¶ 34 \n(“Plaintiffs often plead quantum meruit  as an alternative claim in breach of contract actions so \nthat the plaintiff may recover ev en if the contract is  unenforceable.”).  Thus, Plaintiffs may \nproceed against Ascend on thei r quantum meruit claim.   \nVIII. Dismissal with Prejudice  Because Plaintiffs have had several opport unities to state a valid  claim and further \namendment would be futile, the Court dismisses the fraud, promissory fraud, negligent \nmisrepresentation, and equitable estoppel claims agai nst both Defendants and the breach of \nfiduciary duty claim agains t Ascend with prejudice.  See Camasta v. Jos. A. Bank Clothiers, Inc. , \n761 F.3d 732, 734–35 (7th Cir. 2014) (affirming dism issal with prejudice of first amended \ncomplaint after initial complaint was dismisse d without prejudice); Pirelli Armstrong Tire Corp., \nRetiree Med. Benefits Tr. v. Walgreen Co. , No. 09 C 2046, 2010 WL 624709, at *1 (N.D. Ill. \nFeb. 18, 2010) (dismissing amended co mplaint with prejudi ce after previous dismissal of ICFA \nand unjust enrichment cla ims without prejudice), aff’d , 631 F.3d 436 (7th Cir. 2011). Case: 1:21-cv-06841 Document #: 24 Filed: 05/09/23 Page 24 of 25 PageID #:<pageID>25 \n \nCONCLUSION \n For the foregoing reasons, the Court grants in part and deni es in part Defendants’ motion \nto dismiss [Case No. 21 C 2890, Doc. 44; Case No. 21 C 6841, Doc. 18].  The Court dismisses \nthe fraud, promissory fraud, ne gligent misrepresentation, and e quitable estoppel claims (Counts \nI, II, III, and V) against both Defendants and th e breach of fiduciary duty claim (Count IV) only \nagainst Ascend with prejudice.    \n  Dated: May 9, 2023 ______________________  SARA L.

    "summary": "1. Summary: Carcharadon, LLC and David Sweig filed suits against Ascend Robotics, LLC and David Askey, alleging that the defendants misled them about a joint venture's licensing agreement for robotics technology, which Ascend intended to contribute for exclusive use in new commercial construction markets. The plaintiffs allege that the defendants cut them out of the business, misrepresented the terms of a technology license agreement crucial for attracting investments, thereby causing damages. Key claims such as fraud and breach of fiduciary duty against Ascend were dismissed, but certain claims, including breach of fiduciary duty against Askey, promissory estoppel, and quantum meruit against Ascend, proceed.\n\n2. Key Legal Issue: Whether the defendants engaged in fraud and other wrongful actions to exclude the plaintiffs from benefiting from a joint venture's business opportunities reliant on robotics technology.\n\n3. Court's Holding: The court dismissed the plaintiffs' claims of fraud, promissory fraud, negligent misrepresentations, and the breach of fiduciary duty against Ascend, but allowed promissory estoppel and quantum meruit claims against Ascend, and a breach of fiduciary duty claim against David Askey to proceed. The Court reasoned that the plaintiffs failed to show reasonable reliance on purported misrepresentations and other dismissed claims, but they sufficiently alleged facts for certain claims regarding unfulfilled promises.\n\n4. ELI5 Explanation: Imagine you and your friend agree to start a business together. You work hard, believing your friend will give you a crucial technology vital for the business. Later, your friend backs out and takes all the work you did to form a new company. You sue your friend for breaking promises and lying. The judge says some of your complaints can't go to court because you didn't show you were tricked enough, but will let a few complaints continue since you showed you reasonably believed in your friend's promises enough to lose other job opportunities.",

Because Plaintiffs have not sufficient ly addressed the deficiencies identified by the \nCourt in its August 29, 2022 Opinion as to their fraud, promissory  fraud, negligent \nmisrepresentation, and equitable estoppel claims agai nst both Defendants and the breach of \nfiduciary duty claim against Asce nd, the Court dismisses those cla ims with prejudice.  But the \nCourt allows Plaintiffs’ breach of fiduciary du ty claim against Askey to proceed given their \nallegations that Askey controlled Aryze, which gi ves rise to a fiduciary duty toward his fellow \nlimited liability company (“LLC”)  members.  The Court also again allows the promissory \nestoppel and quantum meruit  claims to proceed.   \nBACKGROUND3 \n Sweig, who lives in Deerfield, Illinois, ha s worked for nearly thirty years as a \nmanagement consultant, investme nt banker, and entrepreneur.  Sweig advises businesses in \nimproving their operations, reducing costs, and increasing revenue and pr ofitability.  He has \nadvised companies on mergers and acquisitions, fi nancial restructuring, a nd capital management \nstrategies.  He has also worked  with start-up ventures, includi ng serving as CEO and COO.  In \n2013, Sweig formed Carcharadon, through which he  performs his consulting work.  Ascend, a \n \n2 Plaintiffs asked the Court for leave to file th e SAC in order to add Ascend Build LLC as a party, \nindicating they do not intend to pursue any claim ag ainst Ascend Build but want to impose a constructive \ntrust against Ascend Build covering the Aryze opportunity .  Plaintiffs did not add Ascend Build as a party \nin the caption, however, nor does it appear that A scend Build has been served.  The Court does not \naddress the status of Ascend Build as a party or any re quest to impose a constructive trust against Ascend \nBuild in this Opinion.    \n3 The Court takes the facts in the background section from the SAC and exhibits attached thereto and \npresumes them to be true for the purpose of resolving Defendants’ motion to dismiss.  See Phillips v. \nPrudential Ins. Co. of Am ., 714 F.3d 1017, 1019–20 (7th Cir. 2013).   Case: 1:21-cv-02890 Document #: 67 Filed: 05/09/23 Page 2 of 25 PageID #:<pageID>3 \n Delaware limited liability company with its  principal place of business in Cambridge, \nMassachusetts, is a robotics busin ess.  Askey, a Massachusetts resident, formed Ascend in 2017. \n Sweig learned of Askey, Robert Cohanim (a nother businessman associated with Ascend), \nand Ascend in 2017.  Askey and Cohanim repres ented to Sweig that Ascend was developing \nrobotics technology for commercial painting, with the technology pr ojected to cut labor costs by \nsubstituting highly efficient r obots for human labor.  Aske y indicated that Ascend could \ncomplete the robotics developm ent but that it needed Sweig’s business, finance, and \nmanagement expertise to build a business based on the technology.  Askey did not want to take \ninvestors into Ascend, intending instead to create a new entity for the business.  Askey told \nSweig that Ascend was well-capita lized, well-known, and respected  in the early-stage venture \ncapital financing community, and had access to  capital sponsors to fund its commercial \ndevelopment.  Askey indicated Ascend would contri bute its existing and fu ture technology to the \nnew entity for exclusive “field of use” purpos es in commercial construction and adjacent \nmarketplaces.  Doc. 43 ¶ 19.  Sweig advised Askey that Ascend would have to make its \nintellectual property (“IP”) a nd technology freely available to the new entity through an arms-\nlength, perpetual royalty-free license agreement in order to attract investors to the new entity.  \nAskey agreed that Ascend would provide such a license.  Askey also i ndicated that the new \nentity’s robot prototype would be  ready for testing by August 2018.   \n Cohanim, Askey, and Ascend invited Sweig, wo rking through Carchara don, to join them \nin developing the new entity—which Askey form ed and named Aryze, LLC—as a consultant.  \nThey anticipated that Sweig would develop a bus iness plan for Aryze, bring investment into \nAryze, and help attract an executive team.  Sweig executed two written agreements in December \n2017 and June 2018 to memorialize the consulting arrangement.  Carcharadon, Askey, Cohanim, Case: 1:21-cv-02890 Document #: 67 Filed: 05/09/23 Page 3 of 25 PageID #:<pageID>4 \n and Phoenix Construction, LLC (“Phoenix”) si gned the December 2017 Agreement.  Phoenix, \nAryze’s predecessor-in-interest, wa s never formed.  Instead, shortly  after the parties executed the \nDecember 2017 Agreement, Askey formed Aryze, which assumed all of Phoenix’s obligations \nand rights under the Agreement.   Under the December 2017 Agreemen t, Plaintiffs received a 5% \nminority equity interest in Ary ze, along with voting rights.  Asce nd, as consideration for granting \nan exclusive, perpetual royalty-free IP license ag reement, also became an equity voting member \nin Aryze, as did Askey.  This di vision of equity gave Defendant s voting control of Aryze.  The \nparties amended the December 2017 Agreemen t in December 2018 to make clear that \nCarcharadon’s ownership interests had “been fully earned and under no circumstances . . . \nsubject to any vesting or  claw-back provisions.”  Id. ¶ 80. \n In early 2018, Ascend, through Askey, agreed to  spin out its existi ng and future IP and \ntechnology, including applicable tr ademarks (the “Ascend IP”), to  Aryze through an exclusive, \nperpetual, royalty-free IP licen se for use in the commercial pain ting industry and adjacent \nmarkets (the “IP License Agreement”).  Be ginning in early 2018, Defendants repeatedly \nconfirmed the terms of the IP License Agreement with Plaintiffs, repres enting that Ascend would \nexecute a formal IP License Ag reement memorializing this arra ngement.  Between July 2018 and \nJuly 2019, Ascend’s lawyers produced  three drafts of the IP License Agreement.     \n In reliance on Ascend’s representation s to him, including about the IP License \nAgreement, in May 2018, Sweig terminated two other Carchara don consulting agreements with \nLego Systems and Alcentra Capi tal Corporation, which togeth er paid him between $65,000 and \n$75,000 per month.  Sweig also stopped soliciting  new assignments through Carcharadon based \non Askey’s indication that Sweig would have a se nior leadership position at Aryze as well as Case: 1:21-cv-02890 Document #: 67 Filed: 05/09/23 Page 4 of 25 PageID #:<pageID>5 \n serve on its board of directors.  Sweig also decided not to pursue partnership opportunities \npresented to him by A.T. Kearne y and Alvarez & Marshal.   \nIn 2018 and 2019, Ascend, through Askey, approved  various Aryze materials, including \nconfidential investor memoranda (“CIMs”) that Sw eig prepared for potential Aryze investors.  \nSweig drafted these materials based on represen tations that Askey had made to him about the \nfact that the IP License Agr eement “had been negotiated.”  Id. ¶ 57.  The CIMs and other \ninvestor materials touted the IP License Agreem ent.  For example, the fall 2018 CIM (prepared \nby Sweig) stated that “[r]esear ch, [d]evelopment, and IP prot ection will be done by our partner \nAscend in order to reduce complexity and avoid duplication of effort.  Aryze has negotiated an \nexclusive, perpetual and royalty free agreemen t for the use of the technology in both core and \nadjacent markets.”  Id. ¶ 60.  Askey told Sweig that the fall 2018 CIM “look[ed] great.”  Id. ¶ 62.  \nAn updated summer 2019 CIM repeated  the same information.  Swei g also prepared an eighteen-\npage management presentation for Aryze, which st ated that “Aryze has an exclusive, perpetual \nand royalty free agreement to utilize the portfo lio of Ascend’s technolog ies in connection with \nall Aryze solutions.”  Id. ¶ 64.  Askey again approved of this presentation. \n By early 2018, Sweig had assembled various  resources for Aryze’ s benefit, including \nexperts such as Tom Danilek, a thirty-year vetera n commercial real estate  developer, and David \nAscher, the president of one of the largest commercial painting companies in the United States.  \nSweig also assembled an advisory board for Aryze, which included Steven Tomlinson, head of real estate private equity at a major law firm; Gr eg Kranias, who worked at a private equity firm; \nSamuel Guren, a venture capital expert; John Ki spert, who worked in the technology and chip \nmanufacturing space and in private equity; and Jo seph Massey, a former diplomat.  Danilek met \nwith Sweig and Askey in fall 2018, discussing the structure of Aryze and the IP License Case: 1:21-cv-02890 Document #: 67 Filed: 05/09/23 Page 5 of 25 PageID #:<pageID>6 \n Agreement.  Danilek also reviewed the CIMs an d other documents that Sweig had prepared for \nAryze.  Although Sweig identified himself as Ar yze’s CEO, he made Da nilek aware that Askey \ncontrolled Aryze.  Ultimately, Danilek became an advisor to Aryze in exchange for a promise of \ncompensation and a vested equity interest in  Aryze from Askey.  Danilek never received any \npayment for his work on be half of Aryze, however. \nAlso, during 2018 and 2019, Sweig contacted potential investor s and customers, \nincluding venture capital and c onstruction companies.  In April 2019, Sweig initiated serious \ndiscussions with Saint-Gobain, a global bui lding products and materials company, about \ninvesting in Aryze.  On April 25, 2019, Sweig and Askey met with high level executives from \nSaint-Gobain, a global building products and materials company.  During the meeting, Askey \nrepresented to Saint-Gobain’s representatives  that Ascend had granted Aryze the exclusive \nlicense to use its IP as  set forth in the IP License Agreem ent.  In early May 2019, Saint-Gobain \nreported an interest in making an  investment in Aryze as its lead, strategic investor, inquiring \nlater that month about Aryze’s IP  portfolio.  Sweig told Saint-G obain that Ascend owned the IP \nbut that it “would be subject to th e perpetual license agreement.”  Id. ¶ 87.  During a June 2019 \nmeeting with Saint-Gobain representatives, Aske y explicitly confirmed that Ascend had granted \nAryze the discussed IP license a nd that it was finalizing the IP License Agreement.  By August \n2019, Saint-Gobain had agreed on a written term  sheet with Sweig on Aryze’s behalf, pending \nthe fully executed IP License Agreement.   \nSweig also developed relations hips with representatives of  WeWork Companies, Inc., \none of the largest commer cial landlords.  In late April 2019, Sweig reported to WeWork that the \nfirst preliminary field trial for the Aryze robot delivered succe ssful results.  By August 2019, \nAryze had successfully completed the first of a two-phase pilot.  Based on those results, Case: 1:21-cv-02890 Document #: 67 Filed: 05/09/23 Page 6 of 25 PageID #:<pageID>7 \n WeWork was seriously considering creating a bi nding, strategic relationship as an Aryze \ncustomer based in large part on representations about the IP License Agreement.  Danilek and \nSweig also engaged in negotiations with Hines, the commercial real esta te developer for whom \nDanilek had worked, about investing in Aryze.   \nMoreover, Sweig undertook work outside the scope of the consulting agreements for \nAscend’s benefit, using his profe ssional network to help Ascend develop applications for other \nproducts, such as cold storage/material handli ng, and leveraging Ascend’s artificial intelligence \nengine in other platforms.  Ascend never compensated Sweig for this additional work.  On August 26, 2019, Askey confirmed in writ ing that Plaintiffs had a 17.5% equity \ninterest in Aryze, with Ascend having a 21.2% interest and Askey individually having a 22.8% \ninterest.  Although the Agreement reserved 30% of the membership  units for a future employee \npool, only Askey, Ascend, and Sweig had voting right s.  This meant that Defendants had over \n50% of Aryze’s voting interests and thus controlled Aryze, w ith Sweig’s equity interest \nincreased to 25%.  Askey further indicated that  Ascend’s goal was to support Aryze’s growth \nand see Ascend obtain an investment return of at l east $120 million.   \n On August 27, 2019, Askey sent Sweig a furthe r draft of the IP License Agreement, \nwhich excluded the previously discussed perp etual, irrevocable, r oyalty-free IP license.  \nDefendants initially represented that the omissi on would be corrected, but over the following \nthree weeks, Sweig learned that  Defendants did not intend to honor  their prior representations \nabout the IP license, instead intending to ma ke Aryze dependent on Ascend for access to the \nAscend IP.  Thus, in early September 2019, Sweig told Askey that, as Aryze’s CEO and as a \nfiduciary, he would not sign the la test IP License Agreement or pr esent it to financing partners \nbecause it was not commercially reasonable or an arms-length transaction. On September 10, Case: 1:21-cv-02890 Document #: 67 Filed: 05/09/23 Page 7 of 25 PageID #:<pageID>8 \n 2019, Sweig sent an email to Ascend’s attorneys and others, representing that the current draft \n“seem[s] to be incongruous if not  completely inconsistent with the business plan that has been \ncirculated to investors for well over a year . . . a business plan signed off on by [Askey] and \nAscend in the first half of 2018.”  Id. ¶ 119.   \nOn September 15, 2019, Askey provided Sweig and Aryze’s counsel with a further \nrevised draft of the IP License Agreement pr epared by Ascend’s attorneys, which similarly \nreflected that the grant of an IP license to Ary ze was not perpetual, irrevocable, unconditional, or \nroyalty-free and did not give Aryze any rights to future IP  developed by Ascend.  During a \nSeptember 17, 2019 conference cal l with Askey, Ascend representatives, and Sweig, Askey \nincorrectly represented that the September 15 dr aft aligned with the bus iness plan Sweig had \nprepared.  During this call, Askey made clear As cend’s intention to seize for its own benefit the \nwork Sweig had done on Aryze’s behalf, ultimate ly through a different company, Ascend Build.  \nOn a separate call that same day, Askey terminated  Plaintiffs’ services.  In a follow-up email on \nSeptember 19, Askey attached a letter, which he  signed as an Aryze manager, confirming the \ntermination of Sweig’s agreements  with Aryze.  Askey stated: \nWhile I will not go into all the de tails and reasons here, the manner \nin which you have provided services  to Aryze over the course of \ntime, and especially over the pa st month, has led me to this \ndecision.  Most recently, in our call on the evening of September 17 with co-founders Ricky and Amy in which we discussed the upcoming fundraising proposal to Sa int-Gobain, you indicated that \nif Saint-Gobain asked you in our upcoming meeting whether you \nagreed with the proposed license agreement that Aryze planned to \npresent, you would state that you did not.  This reinforced to \nRicky, Amy, and me that your overa ll vision for the future of \nAryze is not aligned [with] the co llective vision of the founders.  \nWhile you have provided important services over the years as an \nindependent contractor and consul tant, in my opinion you simply \nhave not demonstrated the temperam ent that I want and that I feel \nAryze needs in a CEO or in an executive-level role in the Company. Case: 1:21-cv-02890 Document #: 67 Filed: 05/09/23 Page 8 of 25 PageID #:<pageID>9 \n Doc. No. 43-19 at 2.  In the same letter, Askey also denied that Pl aintiffs had any equity interest \nin Aryze.  This denial ignored Askey’s August 26, 2019 email to Sweig and the December 2018 Amendment to the December 2017 Agreement, whic h both confirmed Plaintif fs’ equity interest \nin Aryze.    Shortly after Askey terminated Sweig, Ar yze ceased operations.  In October 2019, Askey \nformed Ascend Build, affiliated with Ascend.  In November 2019, Askey approached Saint-Gobain about making an investment in his “n ew” venture, but Saint-Gobain declined.   \n Plaintiffs are currently  engaged in arbitration proceedings  against Askey, in his individual \ncapacity, and Aryze for breach of contract, frau d, and other business torts pursuant to the \narbitration provisions in the cons ulting agreements.  Although Plaint iffs had also asserted claims \nagainst Ascend in the arbitration proceeding, a federal district cour t in Massachusetts ruled that, \nas a non-signatory to the agreements, Ascend was not bound to arbitrat e Plaintiffs’ claims \nagainst it.   \nLEGAL STANDARD   \n A motion to dismiss under Rule  12(b)(6) challenges the sufficiency of the complaint, not \nits merits.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6); Gibson v. City of Chicago , 910 F.2d 1510, 1520 (7th Cir. \n1990).  In considering a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, the C ourt accepts as true all well-pleaded facts in \nthe plaintiff’s complaint and draws all reasonable inferences from those fa cts in the plaintiff’s \nfavor.  Kubiak v. City of Chicago , 810 F.3d 476, 480–81 (7th Cir. 2016).  To survive a Rule \n12(b)(6) motion, the co mplaint must assert a fa cially plausible claim an d provide fair notice to \nthe defendant of the claim’s basis.  Ashcroft v. Iqbal , 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009); Bell Atl. Corp. v. \nTwombly , 550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007); Adams v. City of Indianapolis , 742 F.3d 720, 728–29 (7th \nCir. 2014).  A claim is facially pl ausible “when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the Case: 1:21-cv-02890 Document #: 67 Filed: 05/09/23 Page 9 of 25 PageID #:<pageID>10 \n court to draw the reasonable infe rence that the defendant is liab le for the misconduct alleged.”  \nIqbal , 556 U.S. at 678. \n Rule 9(b) requires a party alleging fraud to “state with particularity the circumstances \nconstituting fraud.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(b).  “Thi s ordinarily requires describing the ‘who, what, \nwhen, where, and how’ of the fraud, although the exact  level of particularity that is required will \nnecessarily differ based on th e facts of the case.”  AnchorBank, FSB v. Hofer , 649 F.3d 610, 615 \n(7th Cir. 2011) (citation omitted).  Rule 9(b) do es not govern only claims of fraud; it applies to \nall allegations and averments of fraud.  Pirelli Armstrong Tire Corp. Retiree Med. Benefits Tr. v. \nWalgreen Co. , 631 F.3d 436, 446–47 (7th Cir. 2011); Borsellino v. Goldman Sachs Grp., Inc. , \n477 F.3d 502, 507 (7th Cir. 2007).  “A claim that ‘s ounds in fraud’—in other words, one that is \npremised upon a course of fra udulent conduct—can imp licate Rule 9(b)’s heightened pleading \nrequirements.”  Borsellino , 477 F.3d at 507.   \nANALYSIS \nI. Fraud (Count I) \n To state a fraud claim, Plaintiffs must allege that: (1) Defendants made a false statement or omission of material fact, (2 ) Defendants knew of or believed  in its falsity, (3) Defendants \nintended to induce Plaintiffs to act, (4) Plainti ffs acted in reliance on the truth of Defendants’ \nstatement, and (5) damages resu lted from Plaintiffs’ reliance.  Weidner v. Karlin , 402 Ill. App. \n3d 1084, 1087 (2010).  Plaintiffs set forth the following alleged mis representations of “past and \nexisting material facts” th at Askey made to Sweig: \na. Beginning in Spring 2018, Ar yze was to be independent \nfrom Ascend Robotics.  To achieve Aryze’s independence, Ascend’s IP and related technology in  Aryze’s field of use, related \nfields of use and adjacent markets would be “spun out” to Aryze through the IP License Agreemen t, the basic term of which Case: 1:21-cv-02890 Document #: 67 Filed: 05/09/23 Page 10 of 25 PageID #:<pageID>11 \n provided Aryze with a perpetual, royalty free license of Ascend’s \nIP and technology; and \nb. Beginning in approximately Spring of 2018, Askey, on \nnumerous occasions confirmed in writing and represented orally to Sweig, members of the Aryze Advisory Board, prospective \ninvestors and customers that the es sential terms of the IP License \nAgreement – that Aryze “had” or “has” negotiated, i.e., an exclusive, perpetual, and royalty free IP license from Ascend Robotics for all of current and fu ture Ascend IP and technology in \nthe field of use, related fields of use and adjacent markets.  Prior to \nthe materials distribution, Askey’s representations were repeatedly \nconfirmed in CIMs, Teasers and re lated investor materials that \nSweig prepared at Askey’s dir ection and with Askey’s direct \ninvolvement and with his explic it approval, individually and on \nbehalf of Ascend Robotics. \nDoc. 43 ¶ 144.  The first set of statements, that  Aryze “was to be i ndependent” and that the \nAscend IP and related technology “would be ‘spun out,’” id., amounts to promises about the \nfuture.  See Ault v. C.C. Servs., Inc. , 232 Ill. App. 3d 269, 271 (1992) (“[A]lleged \nmisrepresentations must be statem ents of present or preexisting facts, and not statements of \nfuture intent or conduct.”).  The Court addresses this in connection with Plaintiffs’ promissory \nfraud claim and here focuses on the second set, As key’s statements about the terms of the IP \nLicense Agreement.   \nThe Court initially reiterates that, to the extent that Plaintiffs  contend that Askey \napproved of statements made in the CIMs and other materials that Sweig authored or that Askey \nmade certain statements on beha lf of Aryze, they cannot reco ver for such representations.  See \nDoc. 37 at 20; Abazari v. Rosalind Franklin Univ. of Med. & Sci. , 2015 IL App (2d) 140952, \n¶ 14 (specifying that the defendant must have made the false statem ent at issue).  But Plaintiffs \nalso allege that “in early 2018 Askey and Ascend Robotics agreed with and repres ented to Sweig \nthat Ascend Robotics provided Aryz e with an exclusive, perpetua l, royalty free license enabling \nAryze to use all current and future Ascend IP in th e field of use, related fields of use,” Doc. 43 Case: 1:21-cv-02890 Document #: 67 Filed: 05/09/23 Page 11 of 25 PageID #:<pageID>12 \n ¶ 37, and that “Askey repeatedly represented to  Sweig, members of the Aryze Advisory Board, \npotential investors and customers that Ascend ‘had’ or ‘has’ agreed  to the essential terms of the \nIP License Agreement,” id. ¶ 42; see also id.  ¶ 47 (“From early 2018 until late August of 2019, \nAskey repeatedly represented to Sweig, member s of the Aryze Adviso ry Board, prospective \ninvestors and customers that, as previously represented, the term s of the IP License Agreement \nhad been agreed upon[.]”).  Plaintiffs buttress these allegations by poin ting to two specific \ninstances where Askey made such representati ons: (1) a November 15, 2018 meeting of Sweig, \nAskey, and Danilek, where Askey represented the terms of the IP License Agreement and the \nfact that Ascend’s attorneys we re memorializing the terms, id. ¶ 48; and (2) a June 12, 2019 \nmeeting of Askey and Sweig with Saint-Goba in, where Askey confirmed that Ascend had \ngranted Aryze the IP License Agreement, id. ¶¶ 90–91.   \nAmong other things, Defendants contend that Plaintiffs have not adequately alleged \nreliance.  This element of a fraud claim requir es that Plaintiffs’ reliance be reasonable or \njustified.  Dvorkin v. Soderquist , 2022 IL App (1st) 201368, ¶ 87.  “In determining whether \nreliance was reasonable, all of the facts which plaintiff had actual knowledge of, as well as all of \nthose it might have learned if it had used ordinary prudence, mu st be taken into account.”  \nLoggerhead Tools, LLC v. Sears Holdings Corp ., No. 12-CV-9033, 2016 WL 5111573, at *4 \n(N.D. Ill. Sept. 20, 2016) (quoting Teamsters Local 282 Pension Tr. Fund v. Angelos , 839 F.2d \n366, 370 (7th Cir. 1988)), aff’d , 784 F. App’x 785 (Fed. Cir. 2019).  Here, as in their initial \ncomplaints, Plaintiffs allege that they reasona bly relied on Askey’s re presentations about the \nstatus of the IP License Agr eement by continuing to work fo r Aryze and performing under the \nAgreements instead of terminati ng them.  Defendants, however, argue that Sw eig, a sophisticated \nbusinessman who was represented by counsel, could not reasonably re ly on an unexecuted Case: 1:21-cv-02890 Document #: 67 Filed: 05/09/23 Page 12 of 25 PageID #:<pageID>13 \n license agreement or an arrangement that he  knew the parties con tinued to negotiate.  See \nRunnemede Owners, Inc.  v. Crest Mortg. Corp. , 861 F.2d 1053, 1059 (7th Cir. 1988) (“Taking \ninto consideration that Ghura is an experienced  businessman, he certainly should have proceeded \nwith caution when confronted with oral representa tions inconsistent with the written terms of the \ncontract, such as Rayman’s ‘we have a deal’ a ssurances.” (footnote omitted)).  Nothing in the \nSAC undercuts the Court’s prior conclusion that Sweig’s reliance on the dr aft terms of the IP \nLicense Agreement was unreasonable.  Doc. 37 at 20–21.  The same reasoning applies to any \noral or written statements As key more generally made about the status of the IP License \nAgreement.  As the SAC makes clear, the par ties to the license (As cend and Aryze) never \nexecuted a final version, a fact that Sweig kne w and that Askey acknowledged when discussing \nthe IP License Agreement with ad visors and potential investors.  See, e.g. , Doc. 43 ¶ 48 (Askey \nrepresented to Danilek in Sweig’s presen ce that “Ascend Robotics’ attorneys were \nmemorializing those terms”); id. ¶ 92 (Askey represented to Sain t-Gobain that “the written IP \nLicense Agreement was being finalized”).  B ecause Sweig knew of facts that contradicted \nAskey’s representations that Ascend had already granted Aryz e the license and that Askey \nhimself acknowledged this, the Court canno t find Sweig’s alleged reliance on the \nmisrepresentations that the license ha d already been granted reasonable.  See AMPAT/Midwest, \nInc. v. Ill. Tool Works, Inc. , 896 F.2d 1035, 1042 (7th Cir. 1990) (“ If the victim acted recklessly \nin the face of the alleged fraud, it is difficult to  believe that he was act ually deceived; he may \nsimply regret having assumed a risk  that has turned out badly.”);  D.S.A. Fin. Corp. v. Cnty. of \nCook , 345 Ill. App. 3d 554, 561 (2003) (“If the party’ s reliance is unreasonabl e in light of the \ninformation open to him, the loss is c onsidered his own responsibility.”); Adler v. William Blair \n& Co. , 271 Ill. App. 3d 117, 125–26 (1995) (“A person may not enter into a tr ansaction with his Case: 1:21-cv-02890 Document #: 67 Filed: 05/09/23 Page 13 of 25 PageID #:<pageID>14 \n eyes closed to available information and then charge that he has been deceived by another.” \n(citation omitted)).  As a result, Plaintiffs cannot recover for Askey’ s allegedly fraudulent \nstatements concerning whether Ascend had grante d Aryze the license contemplated by the IP \nLicense Agreement.4   \nII. Promissory Fraud (Count II) \nTo state a claim for promissory fraud, in a ddition to the elements of fraud discussed \nabove, Plaintiffs must allege that  Defendants made the misrepresentat ions “as part of a scheme to \ndefraud.”  Trade Fin. Partners, LLC v. AAR Corp. , 573 F.3d 401, 413 (7th Cir. 2009); see also \nDesnick v. Am. Broad. Cos. , 44 F.3d 1345, 1354 (7th Cir. 1995) (“[P]romissory fraud is \nactionable only if it either is particularly egregi ous or . . . is embedded in a larger pattern of \ndeceptions or enticements that reasonably induc es reliance and against which the law ought to \nprovide a remedy.”).  The Court pr eviously dismissed this claim, finding that Plaintiffs had not \nadequately alleged a scheme to defraud.  Doc.  37 at 18–19.  Specifically, the Court found that \nAskey’s repeated assertions that Ascend woul d contribute its technol ogy and would implement \nthe IP License Agreement did not amount to a scheme to defraud.  See Sols. Team, Inc. v. Oak St. \nHealth, MSO, LLC , No. 17-cv-1879, 2019 WL 462481, at *6 (N .D. Ill. Feb. 6, 2019) (“Plaintiffs \ncannot establish a scheme to defraud merely  by alleging that defendants made the same \nrepresentations multiple times.”); Nat’l Painting, Inc. v. PPG Architectural Finishes, Inc. , No. 14 \nC 8054, 2015 WL 1593008, at *4 (N.D. Ill. Apr.  1, 2015) (repetition of fraudulent \nmisrepresentations, without more, does not adequate ly allege a scheme to defraud).  The Court \nalso found that Plaintiffs had not  alleged that Defendants “engage d in other acts of trickery \ncompounding the initial misrepresenta tions” or “that they perpetrate [d] this type of fraud as a \n \n4 Because the Court finds that Plaintiffs cannot a llege reasonable reliance, the Court need not address \nDefendants’ remaining arguments for dismissal of the fraud claim.   Case: 1:21-cv-02890 Document #: 67 Filed: 05/09/23 Page 14 of 25 PageID #:<pageID>15 \n regular practice, or on any grand scale” that would allow the Court to infer a scheme to defraud.  \nLeDonne v. Axa Equitable Life Ins. Co. , 411 F. Supp. 2d 957, 960–62 (N.D. Ill. 2006), \nsuperseded on other grounds by statute , 735 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/ 2-2201.  Finally, the Court \nconcluded that Ascend’s ultimate failure to enter into the IP License Agreement did not on its \nown demonstrate that it and/ or Askey never intended to keep the promise to do so.  See BPI \nEnergy Holdings, Inc. v. IEC (Montgomery), LLC , 664 F.3d 131, 137 (7th Cir. 2011) (“[T]he fact \nthat a party breaks a contract doesn’t show that  its promise to perform it had been fraudulent \nwhen made—that is, that the pa rty had never intended to perform  it.”).  Nothing in the SAC \novercomes these problems that th e Court previously identified; the Court again dismisses the \npromissory fraud claim.   III. Negligent Misrepresentation (Count III) \nTo state a claim for negligen t misrepresentation, Plaintiffs must allege: “(1) a false \nstatement of material fact; (2) carelessness or negligence in ascertaining the truth of the \nstatement by the party making it; (3) an intention to induce the other party to act; (4) action by \nthe other party in reliance on the truth of the st atement; (5) damage to the other party resulting \nfrom such reliance; and (6) a duty on the party making the statement to  communicate accurate \ninformation.”  Tricontinental Indus., Ltd. v. Pricewaterhouse Coopers, LLP , 475 F.3d 824, 833–\n34 (7th Cir. 2007) (quoting First Midwest Bank, N.A. v. Stewart Title Guar. Co. , 218 Ill. 2d 326, \n334–35 (2006)).  The Court previously explained that, because Plaintif fs seek only economic \ndamages, i.e., damages not involving personal injury or  property damage, “t he duty to avoid \nnegligently conveying false information is  imposed only if the party accused of \nmisrepresentation ‘is in the busine ss of supplying information for th e guidance of ot hers in their \nbusiness transactions.’”  Dino Publ’g LLC v. Maritimo Mktg. Ams., Inc ., No. 19 C 1921, 2019 Case: 1:21-cv-02890 Document #: 67 Filed: 05/09/23 Page 15 of 25 PageID #:<pageID>16 \n WL 3857875, at *2 (N.D. Ill. Aug. 16, 2019) (quoting First Midwest , 218 Ill. 2d at 335); Prime \nLeasing, Inc. v. Kendig , 332 Ill. App. 3d 300, 311 ( 2002).  Otherwise, the Moorman or economic \nloss doctrine bars a plaintiff’s  attempt to recover purely ec onomic losses through tort.  First \nMidwest , 218 Ill. 2d at 337–42 (explaining Moorman doctrine and its two other inapplicable \nexceptions).  In addressing the initial complaints, the Court co ncluded that Defendants did not \nengage in the kind of business that provided informa tion for others to re ly on in their own \nbusiness transactions, and so the economic loss doctrine barred Plaintiffs’ negligent \nmisrepresentation claim.  Doc. 37 at 22–23.   \nPlaintiffs disagree with the Court’s analysis of the economic loss doctr ine, insisting that it \nonly applies where the duty arises from a breach of contract and that they have alleged an \nextracontractual duty that allo ws their claim to proceed.  See Congregation of the Passion, Holy \nCross Province v. Touche Ross & Co. , 159 Ill. 2d 137, 162 (1994) (“Where a duty arises outside \nof the contract, the economic lo ss doctrine does not prohibit recovery in tort for the negligent \nbreach of that duty.”);  Kanter v. Deitelbaum , 271 Ill. App. 3d 750, 754–55 (1995) (economic \nloss doctrine did not bar neglig ence claim where the defendant’s duty to the plaintiff was \nextracontractual) .  The Court need not re solve this question, however, because even assuming \nthat the economic loss doctrine does not apply here because Defendants owed Plaintiffs a \nfiduciary duty, Plaintiffs’ negl igent misrepresentation claim fails.  As discussed in connection \nwith their fraud claim, Plaintiffs cannot allege  that they reasonably  relied on the alleged \nmisrepresentations, one of the required elements of a neglig ent misrepresentation claim.  See \nNeptuno Treuhand-Und Verwaltungs gesellschaft Mbh v. Arbor , 295 Ill. App. 3d 567, 575 (1998) \n(“[N]o recovery for fraudul ent misrepresentation, fraudulen t concealment or negligent \nmisrepresentation is possible unless pl aintiffs can prove justifiable re liance, i.e., that any reliance Case: 1:21-cv-02890 Document #: 67 Filed: 05/09/23 Page 16 of 25 PageID #:<pageID>17 \n was reasonable. . . .  If ample opportunity existed to discover the truth, then reliance is not \njustified.”).  Therefore, the Court again di smisses the negligent misrepresentation claim. \nIV. Breach of Fiduciary Duty (Count IV) \n“To state a claim for breach of fiduciary duty under Delaware law, a plaintiff must allege \nthat a fiduciary duty existed and that  the defendant breached that duty.”5  Cornielsen v. Infinium \nCap. Mgmt., LLC , 916 F.3d 589, 604 (7th Cir. 2019).  The Cour t previously dismissed this claim, \nconcluding that Defendants did not have any fiduciary duties to Plaintiffs as minority \nshareholders in Aryze because none of the parties had more than an  expectancy interest in Aryze \nstock.  Doc. 37 at 27–30.  Plaint iffs have repleaded this clai m, which Defendants argue fails \nbecause the Court correctly  concluded that Defendants never had an equity interest in Aryze that \nwould create a duty to Sweig.  Plai ntiffs maintain that the Court er red in its analysis, particularly \nas it relied on general cor poration law as opposed to that specific to LLCs.   \nIn previously analyzing this issue, the parties and the Cour t glossed over this significant \ndetail: Askey formed Aryze as an LLC.  Delawa re law treats “any agreement (whether referred \nto as a limited liability company agreement, ope rating agreement or otherwise), written, oral or \nimplied, of the member or members as to the affairs of a limited liability company and the \nconduct of its business” as an LLC agreement.  Del. Code Ann. tit. 6, § 18-101(9).  In other \nwords, Delaware’s LLC Act “creates myriad opp ortunities for LLC agreem ents that range from \nthe minimalistic to the ill-formed  to the simply incomplete.”  Feeley v. NHAOCG, LLC , 62 A.3d \n649, 663 (Del. Ch. 2012); see also XRI Inv. Holdings LLC v. Holifield , 283 A.3d 581, 660 n.87 \n(Del. Ch. 2022) (“LLC agreements present themselv es with varying levels of formality.  Under \nthe LLC Act an LLC agreement can be ‘written, oral  or implied.’  An LLC agreement is also not \n \n5 The parties agree, and the Court accepts for the purpo ses of this motion, that Delaware law applies to \nthis claim.  Case: 1:21-cv-02890 Document #: 67 Filed: 05/09/23 Page 17 of 25 PageID #:<pageID>21 \n With the filing of the SAC, Defendants properly raise the statute of frauds as a reason for \ndismissal of this claim.7  “[P]romissory estoppel does not ba r the application of the statute of \nfrauds.”  McInerney v. Charter Golf, Inc. , 176 Ill. 2d 482, 492 (1997).  Il linois’ statute of frauds \nrenders promises and agreements  that cannot be performed with in one year unenforceable.  740 \nIll. Comp. Stat. 80/1.  “The test for determining whether the statute of frauds  applies to a contract \nis whether the contract is capab le of being performed within one  year of its formation, not \nwhether such occurrence is likely.”  Robinson v. BDO Seidman, LLP , 367 Ill. App. 3d 366, 370 \n(2006).  Here, Plaintiffs’ promis sory estoppel claim focuses on Askey’s alleged promise to \nexecute the IP License Agreement.  Although Ascend never executed th at agreement, nothing \nsuggests that it could not have done so within a y ear, and so the statute of  frauds does not bar the \nclaim.8  Id.   \nDefendants next argue that the promissory esto ppel claim fails because Plaintiffs have not \nidentified an unambiguous promise.  They ma intain that Askey’s pr omise that Ascend would \nexecute the IP License Agreement facially cont radicts other representa tions that Defendants \n \n7 Defendants could have and should have raised the arguments they now make for dismissal of the \npromissory estoppel claim in their initial motion to dism iss Plaintiffs’ complaints, particularly given that \nthe SAC does not materially change the allegations related to this claim.  See Burton v. Ghosh , 961 F.3d \n960, 968 (7th Cir. 2020) (“[T]he invitation to answ er an amended complaint should be understood as \npermission to plead in response to the amendments, as contemplated by Rule 15(a)(3), unless leave is \nexpressly given to raise new defenses unrelated to th e amendments.  In the usual course, this means \nresponding to the new substance of the amended complaint.”); Wright & Miller, 5C Federal Practice & \nProcedure § 1388 (“The filing of an amended compla int will not revive the right to present by motion \ndefenses that were available but were not asserted in  timely fashion prior to the amendment of the \npleading.”).  Nonetheless, the Court finds it appropriate  to address Defendants’ arguments on their merits \ngiven that the parties have fully briefed the issues. \n \n8 Defendants argue that the Court should consider  not whether Ascend could execute the IP License \nAgreement within a year but rath er the “consideration” Plaintiffs gave for the promise—Sweig’s \nperformance of services to Aryze—which they maintain  he could not because he  worked for Aryze for \nalmost two years.  But this again confuses the i ssues, as Plaintiffs’ promissory estoppel claim does not \nfocus on Sweig’s agreement to provide services to  Aryze under the consulting agreements nor do \nPlaintiffs have to allege considerati on to pursue a promissory estoppel claim.  See Matthews , 2016 IL \n117638, ¶ 93 (“Under Illinois law, a promissory estoppel claim will succeed where the other elements of a \ncontract exist (offer, acceptance, and mutual assent), but consideration is lacking.”).   Case: 1:21-cv-02890 Document #: 67 Filed: 05/09/23 Page 21 of 25 PageID #:<pageID>22 \n allegedly made about the fact th at the license had been finalized  and so creates an ambiguity.  \nBut the Court finds no such ambiguity, given Plai ntiffs’ acknowledgment that Askey represented \nthat the agreement had been negotiated but that th e ministerial details remained to be finalized.  \nPlaintiffs have set fort h the IP License Agreement’s specific terms.  These details differentiate \nthis case from those where courts have found pro mises to enter into agr eements too indefinite.  \nCf. Sembos v. Philips Components , 376 F.3d 696, 704 (7th Cir. 2004) (promise of employment \nwithout specification of a position, salary, or other terms of empl oyment was too indefinite to \nconstitute an unambiguous promise).   \nDefendants also argue that Plaintiffs ca nnot plead reliance because the consulting \nagreements already obligated them to provide services to Aryze.  Indeed, “once consideration is \nfound to exist, a party to the contract can no l onger maintain an action for promissory estoppel \nwhere the performance which is said to satisfy the requirement of detrimental reliance is the \nsame performance which supplies the c onsideration for the contract.”  Prentice v. UDC Advisory \nServs., Inc. , 271 Ill. App. 3d 505, 512 (1995).  But Plaint iffs focus not on their obligations to \nAryze but rather on the fact that  Defendants’ promises about the IP License Agreement allegedly \ncaused Sweig to forgo other employment.  Altho ugh a factual question may exist as to whether \nSweig could have provided the services under th e consulting agreements and undertaken other \nconsulting opportunities at the same time, at this stage, Plaintiffs’ allegations sufficiently suggest \nreliance independent of their obligat ions under the consulting agreements.9  Cf. id.  at 514 \n(“Promissory estoppel cannot be based upon a pro mise which only induces pl aintiffs to do that \n \n9 The SAC does include an allegation that Sweig had to  terminate other consulting agreements “to enable \nhim to meet his increasing responsibilities to Aryze.”  Doc. 43 ¶ 73.  Defendants point to this allegation to argue that Sweig acknowledges that he forwent bus iness opportunities “to meet his existing duties under \nthe consulting agreements.”  Doc. 56 at 8.  Because th e Court reads the SAC in the light most favorable to \nPlaintiffs at this stage, it does not find that this allegation forecloses Plaintiffs ’ contention that he could \nhave undertaken these outside opportuniti es regardless of his obligations under the consulting agreements.   Case: 1:21-cv-02890 Document #: 67 Filed: 05/09/23 Page 22 of 25 PageID #:<pageID>23 \n which they were already legall y bound to do.”).  And unlike the misrepresentation claims, where \nthe Court has found that Plaintiffs  cannot plead that any reliance was reasonable, here the Court \naccepts that Plaintiffs detrimen tally relied on Askey’s promises because those alleged promises \ninvolved the existence of and the intention to finalize the IP License Agreement, not just the \nrepresentation that such an agreement already existed.   \nFinally, Defendants argue that th e parol evidence rule bars th e promissory estoppel claim.  \n“[A] dispute as to the terms of  a contract rather th an its existence cannot be grounds for invoking \nthe doctrine of promissory estoppel where to do so would violate the pa rol evidence rule.”  Id.  \nBut as the Court previously recognized, the c onsulting agreements do no t address the subject \nmatter at issue in the promissory estoppel cl aim.  Doc. 37 at 24–25.  Indeed, the integration \nclauses specify that the consulti ng agreements only concern “Car charadon’s engagement,” with \nno discussion of the Ascend IP.  See Doc. 43-1 at 4; Doc. 43-2 at 4.  Thus, the integration clauses \nin the consulting agreements and the parol evidence rule do not bar Plaintiffs’ clai m about the IP \nLicense Agreement, allowing Plaintiffs’ promissory estoppel claim to proceed. \nVII. Quantum Meruit (Count VII) \nIn its August 29, 2022 Opinion, th e Court allowed Plaintiffs  to pursue their quantum \nmeruit claim alleging that Sweig performed work for Ascend’s benefit outside the scope of the \nconsulting agreements absent compensation agai nst Ascend.  Ascend now argues that the statute \nof frauds bars this claim.10  But Ascend cites to no authority in dicating that the statute of frauds \napplies to quantum meruit claims, and courts have instead recognized that such recovery \n \n10 In reply, Ascend also argues that quantum meruit’s purpose is incompatible with Plaintiffs’ claims \nbecause they already received compen sation for their work.  Ascend only raised this argument in reply, \nwaiving it.  See Multi-Ad Servs., Inc. v. NLRB , 255 F.3d 363, 370 (7th Cir. 2 001) (“It is well-settled that \nparties may not raise new arguments or present new facts for the first time in reply.”).  But the Court also \ndoes not find this argument persuasive because Plainti ffs claim they performed work unrelated to their \nresponsibilities under the consulting agreements, for which they received no compensation. Case: 1:21-cv-02890 Document #: 67 Filed: 05/09/23 Page 23 of 25 PageID #:<pageID>24 \n becomes available where oral agreements are re ndered unenforceable becau se of the statute of \nfrauds.  See, e.g. , Fischer v. First Chicago Cap. Mkts., Inc. , 195 F.3d 279, 284 (7th Cir. 1999) \n(noting the possibility of rec overing under quantum meruit despite  the fact that promissory \nestoppel claim failed under the statute of frauds); In re Rowell , 606 B.R. 329, 344 (Bankr. N.D. \nIll. 2019) (“Illinois courts have recognized the ex istence of a claim in restitution for performance \non an unenforceable contract, including on the basis of the statute of frauds, to avoid unjust \nenrichment.” (foot note omitted)); Cove Mgmt. v. AFLAC, Inc. , 2013 IL App (1st) 120884, ¶ 34 \n(“Plaintiffs often plead quantum meruit  as an alternative claim in breach of contract actions so \nthat the plaintiff may recover ev en if the contract is  unenforceable.”).  Thus, Plaintiffs may \nproceed against Ascend on thei r quantum meruit claim.   \nVIII. Dismissal with Prejudice  Because Plaintiffs have had several opport unities to state a valid  claim and further \namendment would be futile, the Court dismisses the fraud, promissory fraud, negligent \nmisrepresentation, and equitable estoppel claims agai nst both Defendants and the breach of \nfiduciary duty claim agains t Ascend with prejudice.  See Camasta v. Jos. A. Bank Clothiers, Inc. , \n761 F.3d 732, 734–35 (7th Cir. 2014) (affirming dism issal with prejudice of first amended \ncomplaint after initial complaint was dismisse d without prejudice); Pirelli Armstrong Tire Corp., \nRetiree Med. Benefits Tr. v. Walgreen Co. , No. 09 C 2046, 2010 WL 624709, at *1 (N.D. Ill. \nFeb. 18, 2010) (dismissing amended co mplaint with prejudi ce after previous dismissal of ICFA \nand unjust enrichment cla ims without prejudice), aff’d , 631 F.3d 436 (7th Cir. 2011). Case: 1:21-cv-02890 Document #: 67 Filed: 05/09/23 Page 24 of 25 PageID #:<pageID>25 \n \nCONCLUSION \n For the foregoing reasons, the Court grants in part and deni es in part Defendants’ motion \nto dismiss [Case No. 21 C 2890, Doc. 44; Case No. 21 C 6841, Doc. 18].  The Court dismisses \nthe fraud, promissory fraud, ne gligent misrepresentation, and e quitable estoppel claims (Counts \nI, II, III, and V) against both Defendants and th e breach of fiduciary duty claim (Count IV) only \nagainst Ascend with prejudice.    \n  Dated: May 9, 2023 ______________________  SARA L.

    "summary": "1. **Summary:** This case involves Desiree Schmitt filing a lawsuit against SN Servicing Corporation (SNSC) for a data breach that occurred in late 2020, affecting over 170,000 customers whose personal and financial information was compromised. Schmitt claims that SNSC failed to adequately protect this data and delayed notifying affected customers for three months. The court partially granted and partially denied SNSC's motion to dismiss, allowing Schmitt's claims under negligence and the “unfair” prong of California's Unfair Competition Law (UCL) to proceed but dismissing her invasion of privacy claim with prejudice.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue:** Whether Schmitt has sufficiently pleaded claims for invasion of privacy and under the “unlawful” and “unfair” prongs of California’s UCL, and negligence, based on SNSC’s alleged failure to protect customers' personal data and delay in notification about the breach.\n\n3. **Court's Holding:** The court granted SNSC's motion to dismiss with prejudice regarding the invasion of privacy claim, as it did not meet the egregiousness standard required under California law. The “unlawful” UCL claim was dismissed but with an opportunity to amend, as Schmitt did not specify which FTC guidelines were violated. However, the claims under the “unfair” prong of the UCL and negligence claims were adequately pleaded and allowed to proceed.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation:** Imagine you're a customer of a company that was supposed to keep your sensitive information safe, but they got hacked and your data was stolen. You found out months after it happened, which made you upset and worried. So, you sue the company saying they didn’t do a good job protecting your information and didn't tell you fast enough. The court looked at your complaints and decided that while some of your claims need more details, you do have a valid point that the company might not have been fair and careful enough, and your case can continue in parts.",

No. 35  \n \n \nPlaintiff Desiree Schmitt brings this lawsuit against defendant SN Servicing Corporation \n(“SNSC”) on behalf of a nationwide class of impacted borrowers for claims arising out of a data \nbreach incident that occurred on SNSC’s system in late 2020 , of which SNSC did not notify its \ncustomers for three months.   SNSC has filed a motion to dismiss Schmitt’s First Amended \nComplaint  (“FAC”) , which is GRANTED in part and DENIED in part, with leave to amend.  The \nmotion is GRANTED with prejudice on Schmitt’s invasion of privacy claim  because  she has not \nadequately alleged egregious conduct by SNSC.  The motion is also GRANTED on the claim \nbrought under the “unlawful” prong of the UCL, with leave to amend.  Although the Ninth Circuit \npermits the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) Act and Guides to serve as predicates for \nunlawful  UCL claims, Schmitt has not pleaded these violations with enough specificity.  The \nmotion is DENIED on Schmitt’s claim brought under the “unfair” prong of the UCL as well as her \nnegligen ce claim, as she has sufficiently pleaded e lements of both.   \nBACKGROUND  \nSchmitt was a customer of SNSC, a financial services corporation that specializes in \nservicing residential, small balance commercial, consumer, and unsecured loans.  FAC [Dkt. No. \n34] ¶ 10.  On or about October 15, 2020, a ransomware -threat group known as “Mount Locker” Case 3:21-cv-03355-WHO   Document 40   Filed 11/12/21   Page 1 of 17 \n2 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  (the “Unauthorized Party”) deployed ransomware into SNSC’s system and successfully acquired a \nnumber of digital files maintained by SNSC ( known hereinafter as the “d ata breach”).  Id. at ¶ 15.  \nShe states that the personal and financial information of at least 170,426 people  were stolen and \nheld for ransom.  Id. at ¶ 18.  She also alleges that despite learning of the data breach and alerting  \nthe Federal Bureau of Inve stigation “almost immediately,” SNSC did not notify Schmitt or class \nmembers  of the breach  until January 14, 2021.  Id. at ¶ 19.  \n SNSC’s  Notice of Data Breach  (“Notice”)  informed recipients that personal information \nwas acquired through a “ransomware” atta ck that “may include, but is potentially not limited to: \nyour name, address, loan numbers, balance information and billing information such as charges \nassessed, owed and/or paid.”  Id. at ¶ 20 (citing Ex. B).  The letter also stated that SNSC was “still \nin the process of conducting a comprehensive investigation of this incident” and that recipients \n“will be notified in the event we discover that any additional nonpublic personal information \n(‘NPI’) or personally identifiable information (‘PII’) pertaining t o you was exposed.”  Id. at ¶ 21 \n(citing Ex. B).  The Notice  encouraged recipients, “[o]ut of an abundance of caution,” to “remain \nvigilant . . . review your account statements and immediately report any suspicious activity.”  See \nid. at ¶ 67; Ex. B.  It a lso recommended that recipients “obtain credit reports from each nationwide \ncredit reporting agency.”  Id.   \n Schmitt claims that she did just that, purchasing credit monitoring at an annual cost of \nmore than $200, along with a password manager (costing $3  per month) and password protection \n(costing more than $90).  FAC at ¶ 68.  She also contends that she has spent and will continue to \nspend “ time and energy protecting and monitoring her  identity and  credit,” including at least four \nhours reviewing bank ac counts and statements and at least 10 hours changing “hundreds of \npasswords related to her business and personal accounts. ”  Id. at ¶ 69.   \n This vigilance was warranted, Schmitt contends.  She alleges that o n or around July 16, \n2021, SNSC provided a suppl emental disclosure to some class members stating that names, \ncontact information, birthdates, Social Security numbers, and “loan/borrower information” had \nalso been stolen in the data breach.  Id. at ¶ 30 (citing Ex. C).  Schmitt concedes that she did not \nreceive the July 16 letter, but notes that she had already filed this lawsuit when it was distributed .  Case 3:21-cv-03355-WHO   Document 40   Filed 11/12/21   Page 2 of 17 \n3 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  Id. at ¶ 66.  Schmitt further argues that she had “no reason to doubt, and every reason to assume,” \nthat her Social Security number, birthdate, and “loa n/borrower information” was “ also stolen and \nin the hands of criminals.”  Id.  Schmitt asserts that she and other class members “provided their \nlenders, servicers, and SNSC with significant personal, income, and financial information that \nSNSC was able to acquire and to supplement by obtaining credit reports and banking information \nfrom third parties.”  Id. at ¶ 63.  This information, she contends, includes: full name s, mailing \naddress es, phone numbers, email addresses, loan identification numbers, tax info rmation, and \nSocial Security numbers.  See id .  \n Schmitt contends  that personal and financial information is “such a valuable commodity to \nidentity thieves that once information has been compromised, criminals often trade the \ninformation on the ‘cyber blac k-market’ for years.”  Id. at ¶ 53.  As such, she argues, “there is a \nstrong probability that entire batches of stolen information have been dumped on the black market, \nor are yet to be dumped on the black market,” placing her and other class members “at an \nincreased risk of fraud and identity theft for many years into the future.”  Id. at ¶ 54.  She also \nalleges  that after the data breach, she has experienced an “increase in spam, phishing attempts, and \nsocial engineering,” including repeated robotexts to her cell phone.  Id. at ¶ 70.  \n Schmitt blames SNSC for the data breach, arguing that its “failure to adhere to reasonable \nand necessary industry standards . . . resulted in the Data Breach and exacerbated its scope and \nimpact.”  Id. at ¶ 32.  She claims that SNSC undertook  “basic steps  recognized in the industry” to \nprotect her and other class members’ personal and financial information only after the breach.  Id. \nat ¶ 35.  According to Schmitt,  these steps included “replacing email filtering tools, malware \nsoftware, and Internet monito ring tools with more robust solutions that utilize artificial \nintelligence (AI) to detect and block known and newly introduced malware,” and blocking all \nInternet traffic with foreign countries.  See id . (citing Ex. B).  Schmitt also alleges that SNSC \nfailed to comply with FTC cybersecurity standards.  See id . at ¶¶ 37 -43.  Schmitt argues that had \nSNSC properly maintained its systems and protected Schmitt and other class members’ \ninformation, it could have prevented the breach.  See id . at ¶ 44.  She also c ontends that SNSC \n“should have notified all of its customers much sooner.”  Id. at ¶ 45.

Dkt. Nos. 1, 14.  Although I \nfound that Schmitt could assert California law claims as an Ohio resident, she failed to plausibly \nplead elements of those claims.  See Mot. to Dismiss Order (“First MTD Order”) [Dkt. No. 27] 1.  \nAs such, I  denied the motion in part and granted in part with leave to amend.  Id.  Schmitt filed her \nFAC on August 30, 2021, which prompted a second motion to dismiss by SNSC.  Dkt. Nos. 34, \n35.  I now consider that motion.  \nLEGAL STANDARD  \nUnder Federal Rule of Civi l Procedure 12(b)(6), a district court must dismiss a complaint \nif it fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.  To survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to \ndismiss, the plaintiff must allege “enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausib le on its \nface.”  See Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly , 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007).  A claim is facially plausible \nwhen the plaintiff pleads facts that allow the court to “draw the reasonable inference that the \ndefendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.”  See Ashcroft v. Iqbal , 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009)  \n(citation omitted).  There must be “more than a sheer possibility that a defendant has acted \nunlawfully.”  Id.  While courts do not require “heightened fact pleading of specifics,” a plaintiff \nmust allege facts sufficient to “raise a right to relief above the speculative level.”  See Twombly , \n550 U.S. at 555, 570.    \n In deciding whether the plaintiff has stated a claim upon which relief can be granted, the \ncourt accepts the plaintiff’s allegations as true and dra ws all reasonable inferences in their favor.  \nSee Usher v. City of Los Angeles , 828 F.2d 556, 561 (9th Cir. 1987).  However, the court is not \nrequired to accept  as true  “allegations that are merely conclusory, unwarranted deductions of fact, \n \n1 A second plaintiff, James Furth, was named in the original complaint.  See Dkt. No. 1.  However, \nFurth was not named in the Amended Complaint, nor any of the filings related to this Motion to \nDismiss.  Case 3:21-cv-03355-WHO   Document 40   Filed 11/12/21   Page 4 of 17 \n5 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  or unreasonable inferences.”  See In re Gilead Scis. Sec. Litig. , 536 F.3d 1049, 1055 (9th Cir. \n2008).  \nIf the court dismisses the complaint, it “should grant leave to amend even if no request to \namend the pleading was made, unless it determines that the pl eading could not possibly be cured \nby the allegation of other facts.” See Lopez v. Smith , 203 F.3d 1122, 1127 (9th Cir. 2000).  In \nmaking this determination, the court should consider factors such as “the presence or absence of \nundue delay, bad faith, dila tory motive, repeated failure to cure deficiencies by previous \namendments, undue prejudice to the opposing party and futility of the proposed amendment.”  See \nMoore v. Kayport Package Express , 885 F.2d 531, 538 (9th Cir. 1989).  \nDISCUSSION  \nI. INVASION OF PRIVA CY \nUnder California law, a plaintiff must show three elements to adequately state a claim for \ninvasion of privacy: (1) a legally protected privacy interest ; (2) a reasonable expectation of privacy \nunder the circumstances; and (3) a serious invasion of the privacy interest.  In re iPhone \nApplication Litig ., 844 F. Supp. 2d 1040, 1063 (N.D. Cal. 2012) (internal citation omitted).  SNSC \nagain challenges the third element of Schmitt’s claim.  \nThere is a “high bar” for pleading an invasion of privacy claim.  Low v. LinkedIn Corp ., \n900 F. Supp. 2d 1010, 1025 (N.D. Cal. 2012).  “Actionable invasions of privacy must be \nsufficiently serious in their nature, scope, and actual or potential impact to constitute an egregious  \nbreach of the social norms underlying the priva cy right.”  Hill v. Nat’l Collegiate Athletic Assn. , 7 \nCal. 4th 1, 37 (1994) (emphasis added).  “Even negligent conduct that leads to theft of highly \npersonal information, including Social Security numbers, does not approach the standard of \nactionable cond uct under the California Constitution and thus does not constitute a violation of \nplaintiffs’ right to privacy.”  iPhone Application Litig. , 844 F. Supp. 2d at 1063 (internal citation \nand quotation marks omitted).   \n SNSC argues that Schmitt again fails to  allege any egregious or intentional conduct.  Mot. \nto Dismiss (“MTD”) [Dkt. No. 35] 6:11 -12.  Rather, SNSC contends, Schmitt makes “barebones \nallegations” that she has the right to be “highly offended” by the disclosure of her personal Case 3:21-cv-03355-WHO   Document 40   Filed 11/12/21   Page 5 of 17 \n6 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  information, and th at the breach alone warrants  proceeding with this claim.  Id. at 6:11 -15.  SNSC \nargues that this does not amount to a serious invasion of privacy.  Id. at 6:15.   In support, SNSC \ncites two cases with similar allegations as those raised by Schmitt.  In one,  the court held that \n“[l]osing personal data through insufficient security doesn’t rise to the level of an egregious breach \nof social norms underlying the protection of sensitive data like Social Security numbers.”  Razuki \nv. Caliber Home Loans, Inc. , No. 17-CV-1718, 2018 WL 2761818, at *2 (S.D. Cal. June 8, 2018).  \nIn the other, the court dismissed an invasion of privacy claim because the plaintiff did not “allege \nany facts that would suggest that the data breach was an intentional violation of plaintiff’s  and \nother class members’ privacy, as opposed to merely a negligent one.”  Dugas v. Starwood Hotels \n& Resorts Worldwide, Inc. , No. 3:16 -CV-00014, 2016 WL 6523428, at *12 (S.D. Cal. Nov. 3, \n2016).  \n These cases are more on point  than the one cited by Schmitt , who argues that the  instant \ncircumstances are akin to the invasion of privacy that occurred in In re Facebook, Inc., Consumer \nPrivacy User Profile Litig. , 402 F. Supp. 3d 767 (N.D. Cal 2019).   See Oppo. to Mot. to Dismiss \n(“Oppo.”) [Dkt. No. 36] 16:19 -20.  In re Facebook  arose from the Cambridge Analytica scandal, \nalleging  that Facebook acted unlawfully by “making user information widely available to third \nparties” and “failing to do anything meaningful to prevent third parties from misusing the \ninformation they obtained.”  Id. at 777 -78.  According to Schmitt, “essentially the same conduct is \nalleged” here.  Oppo. at  16:24.   \n It is difficult to see how Schmitt draws this conclusion.  In re Facebook  involved \nFacebook’s alleged practice of intentionally sharing information about its users with a “non -\nexclusive list of business partners.”  In re Facebook , 402 F . Supp. 3d at 781.  In turn, those \ncompanies allegedly shared data with Facebook.  Id.  In addition, Facebook was accused of doing \nnothing to stop those  “business partners”  from misusing the user information that Facebook \nprovided.  Id.  In one instanc e—the Cambridge Analytica scandal that gave rise to the litigation —\na researcher gave the information that he obtained from Facebook to a British consulting firm, \nwhich then used personal information from millions of Facebook accounts to send targeted \npolitical  messages during the 2016 presidential campaign.  See id . at 777.  Case 3:21-cv-03355-WHO   Document 40   Filed 11/12/21   Page 6 of 17 \n7 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California   That is a far cry from the allegations at hand.  First, there is no indication of any intentional \nsharing of information by SNSC similar to that by Facebook.  Schmitt does not contend that SNSC \nwas in business with, purposefully shared consumers’ personal information with, or received data \nfrom the Unauthorized Party.  Schmitt claims that SNSC allowed access to consumers’ personal \ninformation by storing it in “a place where hackers would tar get and easily succeed in acquiring it \nas a result of SNSC’s unreasonable data security.”  Oppo. at 16:25 -27 (citing FAC at ¶ 25, 111).  \nBut procuring information via security breach is inherently different than obtaining it through a n \nagreed -upon exchange  between business partners , as alleged in In re Facebook .  See In re \nFacebook , 402 F. Supp. 3d at 781.   Schmitt repeatedly refers to the incident involving SNSC  as a \n“breach” and “attack,” underscoring this crucial difference.  See, e.g., FAC at ¶ 1, 14, 2 3, 107.   \nSchmitt also cites In re Facebook  in arguing that the “intimate details” regarding her and \nclass members was sufficiently sensitive to render the data breach an invasion of privacy .  Oppo. \nat 17:3 -10.  This argument also fails, as the compromise of any information resulted from alleged \nconduct that was (at most) negligent and not intentional.  See iPhone Application Litig. , 844 F. \nSupp. 2d at 106 3.  (“Even negligent conduct that leads to theft of highly personal information, \nincluding Social Security numbers, does not . . . constitute a violation of plaintiffs’ right to \nprivacy.”).   \n Because Schmitt  has not met the high bar for pleading invasion of privacy, I GRANT \nSNSC’s motion to dismiss the invasion of privacy claim  with prejudice.  \nII. UCL  \nThe UCL prohibits “any unlawful, unfair or fraudulent business act or practice.”  Cal. Civ. \nCode § 17200.  Each prong provides a “separate and distinct theory of liability.”  Lozano v. AT&T \nWireless Servs., Inc. , 504 F.3d 718, 731 (9th Cir. 2007).  Schmitt  claims violations of two of the \nthree prongs, alleging unlawful and unfair actions by SNSC.  See FAC at ¶¶ 115 -122.   \nA. UNLAWFUL  \nThe unlawful prong of the UCL prohibits “anything that can properly be called a business \npractice and that at the same time is forbidden by law.”  In re Yahoo! Inc. Customer Data Sec. \nBreach Litig. , No. 16 -MD-02752 -LHK, 2017 WL 3727318, at *23  (N.D. Cal. A ug. 30, 2017)  Case 3:21-cv-03355-WHO   Document 40   Filed 11/12/21   Page 7 of 17 \n8 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  (citation omitted).  “By proscribing ‘any unlawful’ business practice, the UCL permits injured \nconsumers to ‘borrow’ violations of other laws and treat them as unlawful competition that is \nindependently actionable.”  Id.  However, the claim “must identify the particular section of the \nstatute that was violated , and must describe with reasonable particularity the facts supporting the \nviolation.”  Bros. v. Hewlett -Packard Co. , No. C -06-02254 -RMW, 2006 WL 3093685, at *7 (N.D. \nCal. Oct. 31, 2006) (internal citation omitted).  If a plaintiff cannot state a claim under the \n“borrowed” law, he or she  cannot state a UCL claim.  Golden v. Sound Inpatient Physicians Med. \nGrp., Inc., 93 F. Supp. 3d 1171, 1179 (E.D. Cal. 2015).  \nSchmitt alleges violations of  the FTC Act and of FTC “regulations, guidance, and \ndecisions” as grounds for her claim under the  UCL’s  unlawful prong.  FAC at ¶ 117  (citing in part \n15 U.S.C. § 45, et. seq .).  At oral argument, her counsel referenced a footnote in her brief that  \ncited a n electronic brochure published by the FTC, which was included in Schmitt’s Opposition \nbut not in her FAC.  See Oppo. at 18 n.3.   \nI previously held that because the FTC Act did not confer a private right of action, it could \nnot serve as a predicate for a UCL claim under the latter’s unlawful prong.  See First MTD Order \nat 16 -17 (“For purposes of alleging an unlawful business practice, plaintiffs cannot predicate their \nUCL claim on the FTC Act.”).  I thought that  O’Donnell v. Bank of Am., Nat. Ass’n , 504 Fe d. \nAppx. 566 (2013)  was more persuasive than the district court’s ruling in In re Anthem, Inc. Data \nBreach Litig. , 162 F. Supp. 3d 953 (N.D. Cal. 2016) , particularly because it came from the Ninth \nCircuit .  See First MTD Order at 16 -17.   \nNow, Schmitt cite s new cases supporting her argument that the FTC Act and guidelines \ncan provide the basis for a n unlawful UCL claim, the most compelling of which come from the \nNinth Circuit and the California Supreme Court.  See Oppo. at 20.  In Rubenstein v. Neiman \nMarcu s Grp. LLC , 687 Fed. Appx. 564, 567 (9th Cir. 2017), the court  held that “although the FTC \nGuides do not provide a private civil right of action, virtually any state, federal or local law can \nserve as the predicate for an action under the UCL.” (internal q uotation marks and citation \nomitted).  Although this contradicts O’Donnell , it too directly addresses the lack of the private \nright of action as it pertains to FTC guidelines and the UCL  and is later in time (though neither Case 3:21-cv-03355-WHO   Document 40   Filed 11/12/21   Page 8 of 17 \n9 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  case is precedential) .  It also aligns with the California Supreme Court’s decision in Rose v. Bank \nof America, N.A. , 57 Cal. 4th 390, 397 -98 (2013), which allowed UCL claims based on violations \nof the Truth in Savings Act, even though the statute’s private right of action for damages ha d been \nrepealed.  For those reasons, I agree with the reasoning in Rubenstein and Schmitt may predicate \nher UCL unlawful claim on the FTC Act and FTC guidelines.  \nThe problem , however, is that Schmitt again fails to plead violations of either the FTC Act \nor guidelines with the requisite particularity.   When alleging unlawful conduct, the FAC  predicate s \nher UCL claim on violations of the FTC Act or FTC regulations, guidance, and decisions.  See \nFAC at ¶ 117.  But Schmitt does not name which specific provisi on of the FTC Act was allegedly \nviolated, let alone how.  See id .  The same goes for the FTC guidelines.   Unlike in Rubenstein , \nwhere the plaintiffs alleged violations of specific FTC Guides (the Guides Against Deceptive \nPricing, 16 C ode of Federal Regulat ions Sections  233.1 and 233.2(c)), Schmitt only mentions \ngeneral FTC “guides” and “standards.”  See Rubenstein , 687 Fed. Appx. at 566; FAC at ¶¶ 37 -38, \n117.   \nThe footnote counsel mentioned does not save the claim.  It cites a n electronic  “guide for \nbusine ss” published by the FTC.  See Oppo. at 18 n.3  (linking to “Protecting Personal \nInformation: A Guide for Business”).   But the authority of this document is unclear.  It does not \nappear to cite to any federal regulations, as in Rubenstein .  See id.  It enco urages readers to “take \nstock of the law” and references three statutes that “may require you to provide reasonable \nsecurity for sensitive information,” but does not elaborate beyond providing a link to the FTC \nwebsite.  See id . at 6.  Moreover, the introd uction to the document describes it as a “brochure.”  Id. \nat 2.  There is no indication that this document constitutes a law or federal regulation , nor carries \nthe weight of such .  Without any argument from Schmitt showing this, this document cannot serve \nas a predicate for her unlawful UCL claim.  \nSchmitt also points to a Third Circuit case as well as SNSC’s Privacy Policy in arguing \nthat her allegations have the requisite particularity.  See Oppo. at 18 -19.  But neither resolve the \nongoing flaw in the plea dings: Schmitt has failed to (1) identify a particular section of the statute \n(in this case, the specific provision of the FTC Act or an FTC Guide); and (2) describe with any Case 3:21-cv-03355-WHO   Document 40   Filed 11/12/21   Page 9 of 17 \n10 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  particularity the facts supporting the purported violations of th at section.    \nAccordingly , I find that Schmitt has not adequately pleaded a violation of a statute giving \nrise to a claim under the unlawful prong of the UCL.   \nB. UNFAIR  \nThe unfair prong of the UCL creates a cause of action for a business practice that is unfair \neven if not proscribed by another law.  In re Yahoo! , 2017 WL 3727318, at *23 (citation omitted).  \nThe UCL does not define “unfair ,” and the “proper definition of ‘unfair’ conduct against \nconsumers ‘is currently in flux’ among California courts.”  Id.  Some courts apply what is referred \nto as the “tethering test,” where unfairness must “be tethered to some legislatively declared policy \nor proof of some actual or thr eatened impact on competition.”  Lozano , 504 F.3d at 735  (citation \nomitted) .  Others use the “balancing test,” which requires courts to “weigh the utility of the \ndefendant’s conduct against the gravity of the harm to the alleged victim.”  Davis v. HSBC Ban k \nNevada, N.A. , 691 F.3d 1152, 1169 (9th Cir. 2012) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Plaintiffs \n“may proceed with a UCL claim under the balancing test by either alleging immoral, unethical, \noppressive, unscrupulous or substantially injurious conduct by  defendants or by demonstrating \nthat defendants’ conduct violated an established public policy.”  In re Anthem , 162 F. Supp. 3d at \n990.  \nSNSC contends that Schmitt fails both tests .  First, SNSC asserts that because Schmitt has \nfailed to allege “any legiti mate violation of statutory law, there is no legislative policy” to which \nshe can tether her claim.  See MTD at 11:10 -18.  SNSC extends this argument to the first aspect of \nthe balancing test, again asserting  that Schmitt cannot show that SNSC violated an “clear, \nestablished public policy.”  Id. at 12:22 -13:12.  Regarding the second aspect  of the balancing test , \nSNSC asserts  that Schmitt has not alleged how the ransomware attack amounts to “immoral, \nunethical, oppressive, unscrupulous or substantially injur ious” acts, beyond “reciting the words” in \nthe FAC .  See id . at 12:14 -17.   \nTurning first to the tethering test, I agree  that Schmitt has not sufficiently pleaded a Case 3:21-cv-03355-WHO   Document 40   Filed 11/12/21   Page 10 of 17 \n11 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  violation of public policy.2  The FAC  contends that it is the “established public policy o f this state \nthat confidential information entrusted to financial institutions . . . be adequately protected from \noutside institutions.”  FAC at ¶ 116.  Schmitt also alleges that “SNSC’s practices were contrary to \nlegislatively declared and public policies  that seek to protect consumer data and ensure that \nentities who solicit or are entrusted with personal and financial data utilize appropriate security \nmeasures.”  Id.  \nSchmitt argues that these public policies are reflected  in the FTC Act, Section 1798.81.5 of \nthe California Civil Code, and Article I, Section 1 of the California Constitution .  See id.  But the \nFTC Act and cited section of the California Constitution make  no mention of personal  information \nor consumer data, nor the legislative intent behind either.  Cf. In re Adobe Sys., Inc. Privacy Litig ., \n66 F. Supp. 3d 1197, 1227 (N.D. Cal. 2014) (noting that “California legislative intent is clear” as \nto the cited sta tutes, allowing plaintiffs to adequately allege a claim under the UCL’s unfair \nprong); Diva Limousine, Ltd. v. Uber Techs., Inc. , 392 F. Supp. 3d. 1074, 1091 (N.D. Cal. 2019) \n(finding that plaintiffs adequately alleged a n unfair  UCL  claim because the Calif ornia Labor Code \n“expressly declares that ‘it is the policy of this state to vigorously enforce minimum labor \nstandards ’” relevant to the claim).  These provisions might in fact reflect the public policy that \nSchmitt alleges.  But she needs to draw a more direct line between the two in order to adequately \nallege that SNSC’s actions violated any public policy.  \nSection 1798.81.5 (a)(1) of the California Civil Code  expressly  declares  the Legislature’s \nintent to protect personal information .  As I have previousl y stated, however, case law indicates \nthat this section  only appl ies to California residents, suggesting that any associated public policy \nmay be similarly limited.  See First MTD Order at 17  (citing In re Sony Gaming Networks & \nCustomer Data Sec. Breach L itig., 903 F. Supp. 2d 942, 973 (S.D. Cal. 2012) ; see also  Cal. Civ. \nCode  § 1798.81.5(a)(1) (“It is the intent of the Legislature to ensure that personal information \nabout California residents is protected.”)  (emphasis added).  Schmitt does not argue otherwise.  \nThat said , I find that Schmitt  has plausibly  alleged “immoral, unethical, oppressive, \n \n2 Schmitt did not allege any actual or threatened impact on competition by SNSC.  See FAC at ¶¶ \n116-122. Case 3:21-cv-03355-WHO   Document 40   Filed 11/12/21   Page 11 of 17 \n12 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  unscrupulous or substantially injurious ” conduct by defendants , satisfying the balancing test at this \nstage of the litigation .  In re Anthem , 162 F. Supp. 3d at 990.  The FAC offers sufficient facts to \nallege this type of conduct, in part by claiming that SNSC represented in its Privacy Policy that “to \nprotect . . . personal information from unauthorized access and use” it used security measures \nincluding “computer safeguards, secured files and buildings ,” but knowingly failed to employ \nadequate safeguards.  See FAC at ¶ 119 ; Ex. A .  While I agree with SNSC that its own Privacy \nPolicy does not carry the same weight as a legislatively declared publi c policy, the key is that \nSNSC represented to customers that it would protect their personal information despite knowing, \naccording to Schmitt, that it had inadequate safeguards in place.   See Reply  [Dkt. No. 37]  5:25-27.  \nMoreover, Schmitt alleges that SN SC’s conduct was “immoral, unethical, oppressive, \nunscrupulous, unconscionable, and/or substantially injurious” when it failed to disclose the data \nbreach in a timely manner, now pleading that SNSC had a duty to so.  See, e.g. , FAC at ¶ 118.  \nTherefore , based on the balancing test, I find that Schmitt has sufficiently stated a claim under the \nunfair prong of the UCL.  \nFor these reasons, SNSC’s motion to dismiss is DENIED with respect to the claim brought \nunder the unfair prong of the UCL.  It is GRANTED on t he claim brought under the unlawful \nprong, with leave to amend.  \nIII. NEGLIGENCE  \nTo state a claim for negligence in California, a plaintiff must show duty, breach, causation, \nand damages.  Conroy v. Regents of Univ. of Cal. , 45 Cal. 4th 1244, 1 250 (2009).   \nA. PERSONAL IDENTIFYING INFORMATION  \nAs an initial matter, in my prior Order, I held that Schmitt failed to adequately assert that \npersonal identifying information (“PII”) was among the information compromised during the data \nbreach —and thus, could not show that SNSC had a duty to protect that information.  First MTD \nOrder at 8:16 -19.  I stated that Schmitt could show this by “pleading what kind of information \n[she], and customers like [her], provided to SNSC.”  Id. at 8:19 -20.  “With allegations that certain \nless sensitive information was released during the data breach . . . and that SNS C at least had in its \npossession other more sensitive information (which rise to the level of PII), a reasonable inference Case 3:21-cv-03355-WHO   Document 40   Filed 11/12/21   Page 12 of 17 \n13 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  could be drawn that PII was also among the information compromised.”  Id. at 8:20 -24. \nSNSC asserts that Schmitt has again failed to d o this.  See MTD at 14.  SNSC relies \nheavily on the language of the Notice sent to customers , which it argues makes “abundantly clear \nthat plaintiff has no case because none of her PII was accessed and compromised.”  Id. at 14:11 -\n16.  SNSC cites excerpts, including:  \n \n• SNSC is “not aware of the misuse of any of your information. . . .”  \n• “[N]one of the information that was compromised included credit card information, or \nbanking account information. . . .”  \n• “The information compromised was largely limited to Mar ch 2018 Billing Statements \nand fee notices. . . .”  \n• “[Y]ou will be notified in the event we discover that any . . . personally identifiable \ninformation (‘PII’) pertaining to you was exposed.”  \n \nId. at 14 (citing FAC, Ex. B).   \nSchmitt responds by arguing  that she adequately amended her Complaint to include  the \ntypes of information about Schmitt and class members that SNSC possessed  at the time of the \nbreach .  See Oppo. at 7 :11-18.  She first cites SNSC’s Privacy Policy, which states that SNSC \ncollects and sha res information that can include Social Security numbers and account balances, \ntransaction and credit histories, credit scores , and mortgage rates and payments.  See Oppo. at \n7:12-15 (citing  FAC at ¶ 12).  Schmitt adds to this list later in the FAC, allegi ng that she and class \nmembers “provided their lenders, servicers, and SNSC with significant personal, income, and \nfinancial information that SNSC was able to acquire and to supplement by obtaining credit reports \nand banking information from third parties.”   Id. at ¶ 63.  That  information,  Schmitt asserts, \nincludes Social Security numbers, full names , property and insurance details, loan history \ninformation, and tax and credit information.  See id . \nIn deciding whether a plaintiff has stated a claim upon whic h relief can be granted, I must \naccept her allegations as true and draw all reasonable inferences in her favor.  See Usher , 828 F.2d \nat 561.  California law recognizes the disclosure of a person’s name and Social Security number as \nthe disclosure of PII.  See Cal. Civ. Code § 1798.81.5(d)(1)(A)(i).  Schmitt proffers enough factual \nallegations —including SNSC’s own Privacy Policy —to reasonably infer that SNSC had Social Case 3:21-cv-03355-WHO   Document 40   Filed 11/12/21   Page 13 of 17 \n14 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  Security numbers in its possession when the breach occurred.  See FAC at ¶¶ 12, 63.  This \nallegation is also supported by the supplemental disclosure sent to class members, stating that the \nUnauthorized Party “may have had access” to names, contact information, birthdates, Social \nSecurity numbers, and “loan/borrower information” during the data  breach.  Id. at ¶ 30 (citing Ex. \nC).  Although Schmitt did not receive the letter,  she notes that this lawsuit was pending at the time \nit was distributed.  Id. at ¶ 66.  Drawing all reasonable inferences in her favor, I find that Schmitt \nhas sufficiently pleaded that the information compromised in the data breach included PII.  \nB. DUTY OF CARE  \nCalifornia courts consider several factors when determining the existence of a legal duty.  \nThe “ Rowland  factors” include: (1) the foreseeability of harm to the plaintiff; (2) the degree of \ncertainty that the plaintiff suffered injury; (3) the closeness of the connection between the \ndefendant’s conduct and the injury suffered; (4) the moral blame attached to  the defendant’s \nconduct; (5) the policy of preventing future harm; (6) the extent of the burden to the defendant and \nconsequences to the community of imposing a duty; and (7) the availability, cost, and prevalence \nof insurance for the risk involved.  Rege nts of Univ. of Cal. v. Superior Court , 4 Cal. 5th 607, 628 \n(2018).  The Regents  court noted that these factors fall into two categories: one involving \n“foreseeability and the related concepts of certainty and the connection between plaintiff and \ndefendant ,” and the other examining “public policy concerns of moral blame, preventing future \nharm, burden, and insurance availability.”  Id. at 629.  The court also noted that the factors “must \nbe evaluated at a relatively broad level of factual generality.”  Id. at 628 . \ni. Foreseeability Factors  \nSNSC argues that the first Rowland  factor is not met because Schmitt’s alleged harm —\n“expenses and/or time spent on credit monitoring” —was not foreseeable.  MTD at 15:14 -16 \n(citing FAC at ¶ 109).  SNSC describes the Schmitt’s actions as “entirely unnecessary” and \n“voluntary,” arguing that because her PII was not accessed or misused, there was no need for her \nto spend time or money monitoring her credit .  See id . at 15:16 -24.  SNSC cites the Notice  as \naffirming that Schmitt’s PI I was not access ed or misused, along with the supplemental disclosure \nin arguing that SNSC offered “complimentary credit monitoring and identity theft services” to Case 3:21-cv-03355-WHO   Document 40   Filed 11/12/21   Page 14 of 17 \n15 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  affected individuals.  Id. at 1 5:18-26 (citing FAC, Exs. B, C).  The latter, SNSC argues, fu rther \nshows there was “no reason to incur this ‘harm.’”  Id. at 1 5:19. \nAs Schmitt argues, this ignores the language of the Notice  itself.  See Oppo. at 10:26 -11:9.  \nIn the letter, SNSC encouraged recipients to “remain vigilant over [the] next twelve (12) t o \ntwenty -four (24) months, review your account statements and immediately report any suspicious \nactivity.”  See FAC , Ex. B.  It also recommended that recipients “regularly obtain credit reports \nfrom each nationwide credit reporting agency.”  Id.  SNSC’s ar gument that its own \nrecommendations were not foreseeable is not persuasive.  \nSNSC summarily challenges the second and third Rowland  factors —the degree of certainty \nthat Schmitt suffered injury and closeness of the connection  between SNSC’s conduct and the \nalleged injury —on the same grounds .  See MTD at 16:1 -7.  However, as explained  below , the \nmoney and time Schmitt spent monitoring her credit constitutes a sufficient injury for her claims \nto proceed.  She also adequately all eges that her injury is closely connected to SNSC’s purported \nfailure to protect the personal information of Schmitt and other class members, along with its \nrecommendation that customer s monitor their credit.  See Oppo. at 11:18 -24.  \nii. Policy Factors  \nTurning  to the policy -related factors, SNSC first argues that there is “no moral blame to \nattach to SNSC,” particularly when the ransomware attack and purported harm to Schmitt was not \nforeseeable.  See MTD at 16:9 -11.  In support, SNSC cites Castillo v. Seagate Tech., LLC , No. 16 -\nCV-01958 -RS, 2016 WL 9280242, at *6 (N.D. Cal. Sept. 14, 2016), which analyzed moral \nblameworthiness under the economic loss doctrine.  In Castillo , the court held that the plaintiffs \nfailed to adequately plead that the defendant’s actio ns were immoral because they had not \n“provided enough information to permit an inference that [the defendant] should have been on the \nlookout for fraudulent requests for W -2 information.”  See id .  Without “reckless or purposeful \nbehavior,” SNSC argues, “n o moral blame can attach.”  See MTD at 16:17 -18 (citing Castillo , \n2016 WL 9280242, at *6 ). \nBut Castillo  is distinguishable.  The Castillo plaintiffs alleged that the defendant owed \nthem a duty to “protect their personal identifying information and to infor m them reasonably Case 3:21-cv-03355-WHO   Document 40   Filed 11/12/21   Page 15 of 17 \n16 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  promptly about the phishing attack.”  See Castillo , 2016 WL 9280242, at *2.   Schmitt takes issue \nwith SNSC’s  purported mis representations in its Privacy  Policy, along with the delayed \nnotification to customers  after the data breach was di scovered.  Oppo. at 11-12; see also  FAC at ¶ \n105-106 (alleging “reckless disregard” by SNSC).  And while  the Castillo  plaintiff were informed \nof the breach either “a few days” or “about a week” after it occurred, Schmitt alleges she was not \nnotified for th ree months.  See Castillo , 2016 WL 9280242, at *1; FAC at ¶ 19.   \nI also find that the policy of preventing future harm favors  imposing  a duty of care, as it \nwould strengthen information security for customers like Schmitt, who entrust companies like \nSNSC  with their PII  and, in the event that something goes awry, expect prompt notification.  See \nOppo. at 12 -13.  Again, SNSC cites a  distin guishable  case when  arguing otherwise.  See MTD at \n16:26 -17:6.  It is true that the  court in Sakai v. Massco Invs. , LLC , 20 Cal. App. 5th 1178, 1189 -90 \n(2018), decline d to find liability for harm caused by a third party “as a matter of policy ,” citing in \npart the “onerous” burden of implementing preventative measures.   But that case involved \nmarkedly different circumstances , arising after a taco truck customer was struck  by a vehicle in a \ngas station parking lot.  See id . at 1181 -82.  Any burden imposed on SNSC to strengthen its \nsecurity measures or speed up  its notification processes would be incurred by a large company, not \nthe owner of a gas station .  See MTD at 17:7 -15.  The benefits would also reach a wider audience.  \nSchmitt has adequately alleged that any burden would be outweighed by the “significant” benefits \nof reducing “ identity fraud, phishing, and social engineering schemes ,” as well as lessening the \nrisks of c ustomers’ identity theft and fraud.  See Oppo . at 13:7 -15.  Although the parties disagree \nas to the expense and availability of insurance, the final Rowland  factor, it is not dispositive, as the \nremaining factors all weigh in favor of imposing a duty of ca se. \n For these reasons, I find that Schmitt has adequately alleged that SNSC had a duty of care \nto protect her PII.3 \n \n \n3 Schmitt also contends in her Opposition that SNSC had a duty of case based on a special \nrelationship, because it created the peril , and under the doctrine of negligence per se.  See Oppo. at \n8-9.  Because I find that Schmitt has adequately pleaded a duty of care under the Rowland  factors, \nI need not evaluate the duty in these other contexts.  Case 3:21-cv-03355-WHO   Document 40   Filed 11/12/21   Page 16 of 17 \n17 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  C. BREACH  \nSNSC does not challenge breach in its Motion to Dismiss.  I previously noted that if \nSchmitt were to adequately allege a plausible  legal duty, the burden to plead a corresponding \nbreach based on SNSC’s inadequate security measures was “not high .”  See First MTD Order at \n8:26-28.  Because Schmitt has adequately alleged a duty, I see no issue with breach .   \nD. CAUSATION AND DAMAGES  \nSNSC challenges causation and damages with familiar arguments.  It argues that Schmitt \n“does not make the requisite connection between the alleged breach and [her]  damages” because \nshe does not assert that: “(1) her PII was actually stolen and misused, (2)  she was a victim of \nidentity theft or fraud, and (3) she did not suffer identify theft or fraud prior to this incident.”  See \nMTD at 18:15 -18. \nThese arguments have been settled.  As stated in my prior Order, recent case law makes \nclear that “time and mone y” a plaintiff spends on credit monitoring in response to a data breach “is \ncognizable harm to support [a] negligence claim.”  See First MTD Order at 10 (citing Huynh v. \nQuora, Inc. , 508 F. Supp. 3d 633, 649 -50 (N.D. Cal 2020) and other cases).  Schmitt ha s clearly \nasserted plausible damages under existing law.  \nIn my prior Order, I also noted that if Schmitt were to plausibly plead that her PII was \ncompromised, “a reasonable inference would follow  that [her] decision to purchase monitoring \nservices was ‘rea sonable’ and ‘necessary.’”  See First MTD Order at 12:1 -2.  As explained above, \nSchmitt has done this.  Again, I see no reason to depart from my earlier thinking.  \nGiven these considerations, I find that Schmitt has sufficiently pleaded a claim for \nnegligen ce.  Accordingly , SNSC’s motion is DENIED on this claim.  \nCONCLUSION  \nFor the foregoing reasons, SNSC’s Motion to Dismiss is GRANTED in part and DENIED \nin part, with leave to amend  in twenty days . \nIT IS SO ORDERED.  \nDated:  November 12, 2021  \nWilliam H.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: The court denied the plaintiffs' motion for class certification in a case where Wells Fargo was accused of discriminating against minority home loan applicants through the use of their CORE/ECS automated underwriting system. The plaintiffs failed to establish the commonality required under Rule 23(a) because they did not adequately demonstrate a causal connection, or \"robust causality,\" between Wells Fargo's policies and the statistical disparities in loan approval rates.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the plaintiffs demonstrated sufficient commonality among class members to certify a class action under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23, particularly regarding their claims of race-based disparate impact and treatment in Wells Fargo's mortgage lending practices through automated systems.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court held that the plaintiffs failed to prove commonality as required under Rule 23(a), primarily because they did not show that the Wells Fargo CORE/ECS automated system causally connected to alleged racial disparities in mortgage approvals. As a result, the motion for class certification was denied.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: The plaintiffs wanted to form a large group (class) of people to sue Wells Fargo, claiming the bank discriminated against them in home loans using an automated system that was unfair to minorities. To be a class, they needed to show that everyone in the group faced the same issue because of the same cause. They showed there were differences in how loans were approved for minorities compared to non-minorities, but they didn't convincingly prove that the bank's system caused these differences. Without this proof, the court said they couldn't form a class, so they'll have to handle their cases individually.",

They ask  for class certification under Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 23.  Dkt. No.  204.  The record before the Court does not establish the element of \ncommonality required by Rule 23(a), and so certification is denied.    \nBACKGROUND  \nAlthough t he parties’ familiarity with the facts is assumed, a summary of plaintiffs’ claims \nis useful  for context.  The operative complaint is the Amended and Consolidated Class Action \nComplaint.  Dkt. No.  114.  Plaintiffs are Aaron Braxton, Paul Martin, Gia Gray, Bryan Brown, \nElretha Perkins, Christopher Williams, Ifeoma Ebo, and Terah Kuykendall -Montoya , all of whom \nare Black or Latino/Hispanic American.  Id. ¶¶ 27, 32, 35, 39, 45, 48, 52, 66.  The  named plaintiffs \nallege claims “individually and as repr esentatives of a nationwide class of similarly situated \napplicants for original purchase mortgage, refinance and other home mortgage loans.”  Id. at 2.  \nThe only remaining defendant in the case is Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (Wells Fargo).  See Dkt. \nNo. 119. \nThe amended complaint says that Wells Fargo intentionally and disproportionately denied \napplications from minority applicants; imposed unjustified delays in processing their applications; \nand extended less favorable terms to them than were extended to similarly qualified White Case 3:22-cv-00990-JD     Document 328     Filed 08/05/25     Page 1 of 16 \n2 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  applicants .  See id . ¶ 5.  In plaintiffs ’ view, Wells Fargo was “ systematically engaging in a new \nform of redlining that harmed Plaintiffs and the Class based on their race and ethnicity.”  Id.  \nPlaintiffs  emphasize the bank’s “decision to employ centralized, universal, race-infected lending \nalgorithms to differentially assess, delay and ultimately reject residential lending applications.”  \nId. ¶ 15.  This “digital redlining,” id., was implemented , they say,  via a “centralized ‘pioneering \nautomated underwriting’ system -- sometimes referred to as CORE -- without sufficient, or \nsometimes any, human supervision or involvement.”  Id. ¶ 17. \nPlaintiffs’ lega l claims are : (1) a violation of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, 15 U.S.C. \n§ 16901 et seq., which “makes it unlawful for a creditor to discriminate against any applicant with \nrespect to any aspect of a credit transaction on the basis of race ”; (2) race discrimination in \nviolation of the Fair Housing Act of 1968, 42 U.S.C. §  3601 et seq., which prohibits \ndiscrimination “against designated classes of individuals in residential real estate transactions, \nincluding residential lending ”; (3) race discrimination in violation of 42 U.S.C. §  1981, which \n“guarantee [s] the same right to make and enforce contracts, regardless of race ”; (4) a violation of \nthe Unruh Civil Rights Act, Cal. Civil Code §  51, which “provides that all persons within the State \nof California are free and equal no matter their race and are entitled to full and equal treatment in \nall business establishments ”; and (5)  violations of the Unfair Competition Law, Cal. Bus. & Prof. \nCode §  17200, under its unlawful, fraudulent, and unfair prongs.  Id. ¶¶ 175-210. \nThis order resolves the class certification  proceedings , which included a concurrent expert  \nevidentiary hearing with respect to the expert opinions submitted in conjunction with the parties’ \nRule 23  arguments .  See Dkt. Nos.  305, 323, 324.  Plaintiffs have narrowed the scope of their case \nin some important ways for purposes of class certification.  In the amended complaint , they \nproposed various classes of “all Minority Applicants in the United States who, from January 1, \n2018, through the present (the ‘Cla ss Period’), submitted an application for an original purchase or \nother home mortgage loan or to refinance or modify a home mortgage loan through Defendants \nthat was (i)  denied; (ii)  approved at higher interest rates or subject to less favorable terms as \ncompared to similarly situated non -Minority Applicants; or (iii)  processed at a rate slower than the \naverage processing time of applications submitted by similarly situated non -Minority Applicants.”  Case 3:22-cv-00990-JD     Document 328     Filed 08/05/25     Page 2 of 16 \n3 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  Dkt. No.  204 at 10 -11 (quoting Am. Compl. ¶  155).  “These classes were referred to as the ‘denial \nclass,’ ‘higher rate class,’ ‘less favorable terms class,’ and ‘delayed class .’”  Id. at 11  (quoting Am. \nCompl. ¶¶  161-62).  Plaintiffs now “seek to focus their damages classes on those Minority \nApplicants who objectively demonstrated their creditworthiness by an agency (Fannie Mae or \nFreddie Mac) or government AUS [automated underwriting system ] or Wells Fargo’s own ECS \n[Enhanced Credit Score] model.”  Id.  To that end, they ask for certification of the following \n“damages subclasses pursuant to Rule 23(b)(3)”1: \n• Minority Applicants who applied for a refinance and were approved by an external \nAUS or Wells Fargo’s ECS, but who were ultimately denied during the Class \nPeriod.  \n• Minority Applicants who applied for a home purchase and were approved by an \nexternal AUS or Wells Fargo’s ECS, but who were ultimately denied during the \nClass Period.  \n• Minority Applicants who applied for a HELOC , were approved by Wells Fargo’s \nAUS for home equity products, but  ultimately denied during the Class Period.  \nId. \nPlaintiffs also ask to certify this injunction/restitution class under Rule 23(b)(2):  \n• Minority Applicants who paid fees to process their mortgage loan applications with \nWells Fargo during the Class Period, who had their applications denied.  \nId. at 11 -12. \nPlaintiffs propose  two additional “subclasses on the issue of liability under Rule 23(c)(4)”:  \n• Whether Wells Fargo is liable to Minority Applicants who were discriminated \nagainst based on Wells Fargo’s use of its CORE/ECS policy to process their home \nmortgage loans.  \n• Whether Wells Fargo is liable to minority borrowers who received mortgage loans \nfrom Wells Fargo, during the Class Period, who were discriminated against by \nreceiving higher interest rates compared to similarly situated White borrowers.  \n Id. at 12.   \nPlaintiffs say that the “crux” of their claims is that “Wells Fargo discriminated against the \nMinority Applicants by subjecting them to its discriminatory loan policies; primarily the uniform \n \n1 It is not clear what class these proposed classes are “subclasses” of, but the Court will use \nplaintiffs’ nomenclature  for present purposes .

LEGAL STANDARDS  \nThe standards governing class certification are well established.  The overall goal is “to \nselect the method best suited to adjudication of the controversy fairly and efficiently.”  Amgen Inc. \nv. Conn. Ret. Plans & Trust Funds , 568 U.S. 455, 460 (2013) (cleaned up).  “The class action is \n‘an exception to the usual rule that litigation is conducted by and on behalf of the individual \nnamed parties only.’”  Comcast Corp. v. Behrend , 569 U.S. 27, 33 (2013) (citation omitted).  To \nobtain certification, plaintiff s must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that their proposed \nclasses satisfy all four requirements of Rule 23(a) and at least one of the subsections of Rule \n23(b).  Id.; Zinser v. Accufix Research Inst., Inc. , 253 F.3d 1180, 1186 (9th Cir. 2001), amended \nby 273 F.3d 1266 (9th Cir. 2001); Olean Wholesale Grocery Coop., Inc. v. Bumble Bee Foods \nLLC, 31 F.4th 651, 664 -65 (9th Cir. 2022) (en banc), cert. denied , 143 S. Ct. 424 (2022).  \nThe Court’s class certification analysis “must be rigorous and may entail some overlap \nwith the merits of the plaintiff’s underlying claim,” but the merits questions may be considered to \nthe extent, and only to the extent, that they are “relevant to determ ining whether the Rule 23 \nprerequisites for class certification are satisfied.”  Amgen , 568 U.S. at 465 -66 (internal quotations \nand citations omitted).  The class certification procedure is decidedly not an alternative form of \nsummary judgment or an occasi on to hold a mini -trial on the merits.  Alcantar v. Hobart Service , \n800 F.3d 1047, 1053 (9th Cir. 2015).  The decision of whether to certify a class is entrusted to the \nsound discretion of the district court.  Zinser , 253 F.3d at 1186.  \nII. UNDISPUTED FACTS  \nThe salient facts for the question of class certification are not in dispute.  Plaintiffs say that \nthe “CORE/ECS underwriting system is the primary policy that [they] challenge,” Dkt. No.  204 at \n17 (emphasis omitted), so the Court starts there.  The Court draws primarily from the declarations \nsubmitted by Wells Fargo explaining its underwriting sy stem and component tools and Case 3:22-cv-00990-JD     Document 328     Filed 08/05/25     Page 4 of 16 \n5 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  applications.  See Dkt. No.  232-53 (Declaration of John R. Keller); Dkt. No.  232-54 (Declaration \nof Sally Relova).  Plaintiffs did not take issue  with these underlying facts.  See Dkt. No.  252. \nA. The “CORE / ECS Underwriting System”  \n“CORE,” which is short for “Common Opportunities Results Experiences,” is a “front -end \nworkflow tool that guides the loan origination process.”  Dkt. No.  232 at viii (Glossary); Dkt. \nNo. 232-53 (Keller Decl.)  ¶ 3.  CORE is “not an automated underwriting sy stem and it does not \nmake lending decisions or calculate or assign Credit Risk Classes.”  Keller Decl. ¶  3.  It “guides \nthe ‘flow’ of the loan origination process,” and also “retrieves, stores, and displays information \nand data (including data from the loa n application, certain outputs from the Risk Engine, and final \nlending decisions).”  Id. ¶ 9. \n“Credit Risk Classes are assigned  by business rules residing within a separate technology \napplication referred to as the Risk Engine.”  Id. ¶ 4.  The Risk Engine is a “technology \napplication” that “uses data from the applicant’s loan application and credit report to help analyze \n(based on underwriting policies and guidelines) the applicant’s creditworthiness.”  Id. ¶ 6.  The \nRisk Engine “uses data stored in CORE, including data from the loan application and credit \nreport.”  Id. ¶ 8.  It “performs tasks using three general components: (a)  business rules; \n(b) business services; and (c)  data attributes.”  Id. ¶ 10.  “The Risk Engine’s ‘business rules’ are \ndiscrete pieces of logic that can answer business questions.”  Id. ¶ 11.  For example, “Wells \nFargo’s minimum credit score for retail, non -conforming, fixed -rate, purchase loans up to \n$3,000,000 is 700,” and so “there is a business rule that implements that requirement.”  Id.  “The \nRisk Engine currently executes tens of thousands of separate ly identifiable business rules.”  Id. \nThe business rules are “grouped into 16 different ‘business services,’ including the Get \nRisk Decision business service.”  Id. ¶ 12.  An exhibit submitted and highlighted by plaintiffs \nexplains that “GRD [Get Risk Decision] is the largest business service within the Wells Fargo \nRisk Engine,” and GRD “ contains 14,000 rules” and  “1,300+ data attributes.”  Dkt. No.  252 at 7; \nDkt. No.  204-16 at ECF p.  276.  During the relevant time period, the “Get Risk Decision business \nservice” determined, “based on the polic ies, strategies, and guidelines within it, the applicable \nCredit Risk Class for the proposed transaction.”  Keller Decl. ¶  15.  Case 3:22-cv-00990-JD     Document 328     Filed 08/05/25     Page 5 of 16 \n6 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  The Risk Engine and CORE are “distinct applications ” that “communicate with each \nother.”  Id. ¶ 8.  “[S]ome of the outputs provided by the Risk Engine are displayed in CORE for \nuse by the underwriting during the decisioning process.”  Id.  Wells Fargo’s Senior Vice President \nand Business Execution Director for its Home Lending division declares that “underwriters are \ninstructed that the Risk Engine never supersedes the judgment of the underwriter,” and \n“[u]nderwriting is done by human und erwriters.”  Id. ¶¶ 1, 7.  Plaintiffs do not dispute that human \nunderwr iters make the ultimate decision .  See Dkt. No.  252 at 5 (“Wells Fargo makes much ado of \nits claim that its underwriting ‘is done by human underwriters’” but case law supports “that \ndisparate impact may be found even where there is some discretion in the process.”).    \n“ECS” or “Enhanced Credit Score ” refers to “two separate models Wells Fargo developed \nand uses in home lending: Model 11419 (used for government loans) and Model 11960 (used for \nconventional loans).”  Dkt. No.  232-54 (Relova Decl. ) ¶ 3.  “Each of the ECS models is a simple \nscorecard whose logic can be fully stated on 2 -3 sheets of paper,” and “[n]either utilizes artificial \nintelligence.”  Id. ¶ 4.  The models are “simple enough that an applicant’s score could be \ncalculated by hand.”  Id.  The ECS models consider inputs such as certain cr edit bureau report \nattributes , and results in a numerical score which is then translated into a credit risk class, \nrepresenting differentiated levels of default risk.  Id. ¶¶ 5-6.  The “ECS models are also used to \ngenerate risk insight messages that are displayed to underwriters.”  Id. ¶ 8. \nPlaintiffs contend  that “[t]he Risk Engine, ECS and CORE” are “inseparable,” and that \n“Wells Fargo’s CORE/ECS policy arranges Minority Applicants into ‘unfavorable’ risk \nclassifications” which “lead[s] to lower approval rates for minorities.”  Dkt. No.  252 at 8.  \nAlthough Wells Fargo says that  “there is no such thing as ‘CORE/ECS’” and there is no such \n“policy ,” Dkt. No.  232 at 3 (emphasis omitted) , it offered detailed explanations about the Risk \nEngine, ECS, and CORE , and how they are applied to loan appl ications.  \nB. Dr. Kurzendoerfer’s Opinions  \nPlaintiffs’ class certification motion relies heavily on the work and opinions of their expert, \nDr. Amanda Kurzendoerfer.  Dr.  Kurzendoerfer opined that “Wells Fargo’s home lending \napproval rate disparities between White and minority applican ts are not explained by differences Case 3:22-cv-00990-JD     Document 328     Filed 08/05/25     Page 6 of 16 \n7 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  in key underwriting factors.”  Dkt. No. 205 -12 (Kurzendoerfer Decl.) ¶  4.  By “[u]sing a \nregression model to control for . . . key underwriting factors, ” she determined that “statistically \nsignificant disparities remain for both the overall applicant population and the proposed classes or \nsubclasses.”  Id. ¶ 5.2  Dr. Kurzendoerfer concluded that there was a “statistically significant \ndifference in approval rates that favors White applicants,” and “on average, there is a disparity that \ncannot be explained by legitimate underwriting factors” that were not related to race.  Dkt. \nNo. 323 at 44:18 -45:13.   \nDuring the concurrent expert evidentiary proceeding, Wells Fargo’s expert, Dr.  Marsha J. \nCourchane, did not substantially  disagree with the logistic analysis Dr.  Kurzendoerfer  performed , \nor with her findings of a statistical disparity along racial lines.  See, e.g., id. at 9:19 -10:11.  Rather, \nDr. Courchane ’s main critique  was that Dr. Kurzendoerfer’s regression analyses could not \ndemonstrate that the racially imbalanced denials were caused by  race-related  factors .  \nDr. Courchane opined that the “class -wide evidence” of Dr.  Kurzendoerfer’s analyses could not be \nused “to actually ensure why those borrowers were denied without looking further at at least a \nsample of files to see those you thought should have been approved were actually denied for \nreasonable reasons.”  Id. at 34:7 -12.   \nWhile Dr.  Courchane agreed that “you will almost always find an underwriting disparity, \non average, for minorities,” id. at 46:10 -11, she  stated  that individual file reviews were essential to \n“understand how borrowers are truly similarly situated” and to understand “whether Wells Fargo \nactually made a proper denial of [a] loan or whether they wrongfully denied that loan” for reasons \nof race discrimination.  Id. at 46:15 -17, 48:21 -49:1.  In Dr. Courchane’s opinion,  because \nDr. Kurzendoerfer did not take that additional step, her logistic analysis cannot be used to \ndemonstrate that minority applicants were “improperly or wrongfully denied” and were overall \n“approved at lower rates than similarly situated non -Hispanic whites.”  Dkt. No.  317 at 2.  \n \n2 For purposes of this order, the Court denies Wells Fargo’s motions to exclude the testimony of \nplaintiffs’ experts, Dkt. Nos.  243, 244, and sustains plaintiffs’ objections to Wells Fargo’s \nevidence in opposition to class certification, Dkt. No.  252 at 15.   These determinations may be \nrevisited as developments in the case warrant.   Case 3:22-cv-00990-JD     Document 328     Filed 08/05/25     Page 7 of 16 \n8 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  III. CLASS CERTIFICATION  \nFor each of the proposed classes and subclasses under Rules 23(b)(3), 23(b)(2), and \n23(c)(4) , plaintiffs must establish that all of the elements of Rule 23(a)  are present .  See Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 23(a) (1)-(4).   \nA. Numerosity  \nThe first requirement under Rule 23(a) is numerosity.  The class must be “so numerous \nthat joinder of all members is impracticable.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(1).  Plaintiffs say that they \n“anticipate the defined classes will include at least 119,100 members.”  Dkt. No.  204 at 14.  Wells \nFargo did not dispute numerosity and that requirement is satisfied.  \nB. Commonality  \nFor a class to be certified, Rule 23(a)(2) requires  proof of  “questions of law or fact \ncommon to the class.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(2).  As the Supreme Court has cautioned , this \nlanguage is “easy to misread, since any competently crafted class complaint literally raises \ncommon questions.”  Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes , 564 U.S. 338, 349 (2011) (cleaned up).  \nSimply positing  common questions is not enough .  Commonality “requires the plaintiff to \ndemonstrate that the class members ‘have suffered the same in jury.’”  Id. at 350.  “This does not \nmean merely that they have all suffered a violation of the same provision of law.”  Id.  Rather, \n“[t]heir claims must depend upon a common contention -- for example, the assertion of \ndiscriminatory bias on the part of the same supervisor.”  Id.  The “common contention, moreover, \nmust be of such a nature that it is capable of classwide resolution -- which means that \ndetermination of its truth or falsity will resolve an issue that is central to the validity of each one of \nthe claims in one stroke.”  Id.   \nWhat counts is the “capacity of a class -wide proceeding to generate common answers  apt \nto drive the resolution of the litigation .”  Id. (quotations omitted, emphasis in original).  This does \nnot require total uniformity across a class.  “The existence of shared legal issues with divergent \nfactual predicates is sufficient, as is a common core of salient facts coupled with disparate legal \nremedies within the class.”  Hanlon v. Chrysler Corp. , 150 F.3d 1011, 1019 (9th Cir. 1998), Case 3:22-cv-00990-JD     Document 328     Filed 08/05/25     Page 8 of 16 \n9 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  overruled on other grounds by Dukes , 564 U.S. 338.  The commonality standard imposed by Rule \n23(a)(2) is “rigorous.”  Leyva v. Medline Indus. Inc. , 716 F.3d 510, 512 (9th Cir. 2013).  \n1. Disparate Impact  \nTo establish commonality, plaintiffs rely entirely on disparate impact , which they say is a \nviable way  to prove their claims under the FHA and ECOA.  See Dkt. No.  204 at 15 -24; id. at 18 \n(“Violations of the FHA and ECOA may be proven both by a showing of intentional \ndiscrimination and under a disparate impact theory.”).  Wells Fargo does not dispute that a \ndisparate impact theory is available for the FHA and ECOA claims.  See Dkt. No.  232; see also \nTex. Dep’t of Housing and Cmty. Affairs v. Inclusive Cmtys.  Project, Inc. , 576 U.S. 519, 545 \n(2015) (“disparate -impact claims are cognizable under the Fair Housing Act”); Miller v. American \nExpress Co. , 688 F.2d 1235, 1239 -40 (9 th Cir. 1982) (disparate treatment and adverse impact \ntests, which are the “two traditional Title VII tests for employment discrimination,” may both be \nused for ECOA claims).  \nThe parties also agree on the three -step burden -shifting framework that applies to disparate \nimpact theories in this context.  Plaintiff s have the initial burden of demonstrating  a prima facie \ncase of disparate impact discrimination under the FHA (and in this case, the ECOA).  Sw. Fair \nHousing Council, Inc. v. Maricopa Domestic Water Improvement Dist. , 17 F.4th 950, 960 -61 (9th \nCir. 2021).  The burden shifts to the defendant to “either rebut the facts underpinning the prima \nfacie case or to demonstrate a le gally sufficient, nondiscriminatory reason for the practices causing \nthe disparate impact.”  Id. (quotations omitted).  “Third and finally, the burden shifts back to the \nplaintiff to show the availability of an alternative practice that has less discriminatory impact yet is \nstill equally effective in serving the defendant’s legitimate goals.”  Id. (citations omitted).  \nFor plaintiffs to establish a prima face disparate impact claim  under the FHA, the y must \ndemonstrate: “(1)  the existence of a policy, not a one -time decision, that is outwardly neutral; (2)  a \nsignificant, adverse, and disproportionate effect on a protected class; and (3)  robust causality that \nshows, beyond mere evidence of a statistical disparity, that the challenged policy, and not some \nother factor or policy, caused the disproportionate effect.”  Id. at 962.  The Supreme Court has \nemphasized that “a disparate -impact claim that relies on a statistical disparity must fail if the Case 3:22-cv-00990-JD     Document 328     Filed 08/05/25     Page 9 of 16 \n10 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  plaintiff cannot point to a defendant’s policy or policies causing that disparity. ”  Inclusive \nCmmtys. , 576 U.S. at 542.  “ A robust causality requirement ensures that racial imbalance does not, \nwithout more, establish a prima facie case of disparate impact and thus protects defendants from \nbeing held liable for racial disparities they did not create.”  Id. (cleaned up).    \nThis is where plaintiffs’ argument for class certification comes to naught.  Plaintiffs did not \npresent any classwide evidence whatsoever of “robust causality .”  Instead, they focus ed like a \nlaser  on the statistical disparity  in application denial rates , without anything in the way of \nexplanatory factors .  For purposes of establishing commonality, plaintiffs  say only that  “every \napplicant is processed through Wells Fargo’s CORE/ECS system ,” Dkt. No.  204 at 16 , and that \nthere were “statistically significant disparities in approval rates between Minority Applicants and \nWhite Applicants that cannot be explained by key underwriting factors.”  Id. at 21 -22.  Crucially, \nplaintiffs did not demonstrate any connection between the “CORE/ECS system” and the \nstatistically significant disparities in approval rates .  They have no evidence  of how the \nCORE/ECS system might have caused racial disparities in approval rates  on the basis of suspect \nfactors .   \nThis shortfall  is evident in a number of ways.  Plaintiffs say, for example, that Wells Fargo \n“could not itself identify what was driving the disparity,” and that  the bank  “found that there were \nthree potential proxies for race in its ECS Model -- major derogatories, average months in file, and \nrecent inquiries -- which could be causing the disparity.”  Dkt. No.  252 at 8.  This is a major \nmisapprehension on plaintiffs’ part of who bears the burden of offering classwide evidence of \ncausation here.  That burd en is plaintiffs’ to bear , not Wells Fargo ’s.   \nThe absence of classwide evidence of causation is also made evident in plaintiffs’ \ncontention that “Wells Fargo’s own documents depict how CORE/ECS components combine to \nproduce underwriting decision outputs.”  Dkt. No.  252 at 7.  The document they cite is a Wells \nFargo slide with the heading, “GRD Is The Largest Business Service Within The Wells Fargo \nRisk Engine.”  Dkt. No.  204-16 at ECF p.  276.  The slide states that “GRD is 1 of 16 business \nservices”; “GRD contains 14,000 rules”; and “GRD contains 1,3 00+ data attributes.”  Id.  The \nproblem for plaintiffs is that nothing in these data points, whi ch are taken as true for present Case 3:22-cv-00990-JD     Document 328     Filed 08/05/25     Page 10 of 16 \n11 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  purposes, provides evidence that GRD might have caused the racially disparate results.   This falls \nfar short of the “robust causality” plaintiffs must show.  Inclusive Cmmtys. , 576 U.S. at 542.   In \naddition, the fact that Wells Fargo potentially analyzed 1,300+ data attributes pursuant to 14,000 \nrules indicates that commonality with respect to denial of a mortgage is not at all obvious here.   \nIn Inclusive Communities , the Supreme Court expressly cautioned against this results -\nfocused  approach pressed by plaintiffs .  As the Court stated:  \nCourts must therefore examine with care whether a plaintiff has \nmade out a prima facie case of disparate impact . . . .  A plaintiff \nwho fails to allege facts at the pleading stage or produce statistical \nevidence demonstrating a causal connection cannot ma ke out a \nprima facie case of disparate impact.  For instance, a plaintiff \nchallenging the decision of a private developer to construct a new \nbuilding in one location rather than another will not easily be able to \nshow this is a policy causing a disparate i mpact because such a one -\ntime decision may not be a policy at all.  It may also be difficult to \nestablish causation because of the multiple factors that go into \ninvestment decisions about where to construct or renovate housing \nunits .    \nInclusive Cmtys. , 576 U.S. at 543  (emphasis added) .   \nSo too here.  As the record amply demonstrates, each underwriting decision was complex \nand involve d many, many different factors.  It is certainly true that complexity alone is not an \ninherent barrier to certification, but when the undisputed facts indicate the application of up to \n14,000  rules  in deciding whether to make a loan , plaintiffs needed a good explanation of \ncommonality with respect to the cause or source of race discrimination .  They did not present one.  \nRacial imbalance, without more, cannot establish a prima facie case of disparate impact.  See id . at \n543.  To find otherwise would unfairly hold defendants liable “for racial disparities they did not \ncreate.”  Id.   \nPlaintiffs’ case citations do not lead to a different conclusion.  Plaintiffs repeatedly urge \nthe Court to follow the decision s reached by district judges in Heath v. Google LLC , 345 F. Supp. \n3d 1152 (N.D. Cal. 2018), and Ramirez v. Greenpoint Mortg. Funding, Inc. , 268 F.R.D. 627 (N.D. \nCal. 2010).  See Dkt. No.  204 at 3 (“This Court should follow the other district courts in the Ninth \nCircuit to confront similar claims and certify the proposed classes.”) (citing Heath , 345 F. Supp. \n3d at 1174, and Ramirez , 268 F.R.D. at 643); id. at 20 (“As in Ramirez  and Heath , a showing of Case 3:22-cv-00990-JD     Document 328     Filed 08/05/25     Page 11 of 16 \n12 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  disparate impact is what is needed for certification, not satisfaction of the remedial phase showing \nprecisely which Minority Applicants were discriminated against.”); id. at 24 (“just like the Courts \nin Ramirez  and Heath , this Court should also find that common questions predominate because \nboth parties will rely on statistical data and Wells Fargo’s policies and conduct are at the center of \nthe dispute; namely, its inseparable uniform reliance on CORE and its embedded EC S model.”); \nDkt. No.  252 at 6 (“ Ramirez supports Plaintiffs not Wells Fargo.”).    \nBut these cases are readily distinguishable  and of little moment here.  Heath  was a \ncollective action under the federal Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA).  The \nprocedures for collective actions are entirely different from class actions under Rule 23.  For \nADEA collective actions, the courts first “apply a lenient standard to determine whether the \nADEA proposed collective action should be conditionally certified and given notice .”  Heath , 345 \nF. Supp. 3d  at 1164.  In a second step, “the party opposing the certification may move to decertify \nthe class once discovery is complete.”  Id. at 1165 (quotations omitted).  “Plaintiffs need show \nonly that their positions are similar, not identical, to the positions held by the putative collective \naction members,” and even at the second stage, “the standard applied remains distinct from and \neasier to satisfy than the requirements for a class action certified under Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 23(b)(3).”  Id. (clea ned up).  Consequently, t he denial of decertification of the collective \naction in Heath  is of little help in deciding the question of Rule 23 certification here.  \nPlaintiffs’ heavy reliance on Ramirez  is equally misplaced .  The district court certified a \nclass of “African -American and Hispanic borrowers who obtained wholesale mortgage loans \nthrough GreenPoint from 2004 through 2007.”  Ramirez , 268 F.R.D. at 629.  The pricing of \nGreenPoint’s mortgage loans consisted of an objective and a subjective component, and plaintiffs \nthere challenged GreenPoint’s “discretionary pricing policy, which governed brokers’ \ncompensation for their services.”  Id. at 630  (emphasis omitted) .  Plaintiffs contended that “the \ndiscretionary policy resulted in minority borrowers” -- defined to include “African Americans and \nHispanics”  -- receiving “less favorable loan pricing than similarly situated whites .”  Id. at 631 .  \nPlaintiffs  brought  claims under both the ECOA and the FHA.  Id.  In certifying the class, the \ndistrict court found that “ [p]laintiffs’ reliance on statistical evidence to fulfill the commonality Case 3:22-cv-00990-JD     Document 328     Filed 08/05/25     Page 12 of 16 \n13 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  requirement is well founded in Ninth Circuit precedent,” relying on the circuit’s “recent en banc \nruling in Dukes v. Wal -Mart Stores, Inc. , 603 F.3d 571 (9th Cir. 2010).”  Id. at 634.  \nRamirez was decided in 2010, which bears mention because events have overtaken  its \nholding .  In 2011, the United States Supreme Court issued Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes , 564 \nU.S. 338 (2011), which revers ed the circuit court’s en banc decision  on which Ramirez  depended .  \nSince then, courts have declined to certify classes like the one certified in Ramirez , including in \ncircumstance s akin to those here .  For example, In re Wells Fargo Residential Mortgage Lending \nDiscrimination Litigation , No.  08-MD-01930 -MMC, 2011 WL 3903117 (N.D. Cal. Sept. 6, \n2011), permission to  appeal denied , No.  11-80252 (9th Cir. Nov. 15, 2011),  involved an allegation \nthat Wells Fargo had “discriminated” against the “‘Hispanic’ or ‘black’” plaintiffs, all of whom \n“obtained a mortgage loan from Wells Fargo,” by “giving them mortgage loans with less favorable \nconditions than were given to similarly  situated non -minority borrowers.”  Id. at *1.  Plaintiffs \nalleged that “such discrimination was the result of Wells Fargo’ s ‘discretionary loan pricing \nprocedures’” which plaintiffs referred to as the “Discretionary Pricing Policy.”  Id.  Plaintiffs’  \nclaims were stated, as here,  under the FHA and ECOA.  Id. at *2.    \nIn declining to certify  the proposed  classes for plaintiffs’ disparate  impact discrimination \nclaims, the district court cited the Supreme Court’s ruling in Dukes  that “‘merely proving that the \ndiscretionary system has produced a racial or sexual disparity is not enough .’”  Id. at *3 (quoting \nDukes , 564 U.S. at 357  (emphasis in original)).  The district court concluded that commonality \nwas not satisfied because, “[a]s the Supreme Court held in Dukes , . . . , even if the statistical \nevidence offered therein had shown a pattern of disparity ‘in all of Wal -Mart’s 3,400 stores,’ such \nstatistical proof would fail, because ‘[m]erely showing that [a defendant’s] policy of discretion has \nproduced an overall [race] -based disparity does not suffice’ to demonstrate commonality for \npurposes of Rule 23(a).”  Id. at *4 (citing Dukes, 564 U.S. at 356 -58 (emphasis in original)).    \nOther district courts are in agreement.  See In re Countrywide Fin . Mortg . Lending \nPractices Litig ., No.  08-MD-1974, 2011 WL 4862174 , at *4  (W.D. Ky. Oct. 13, 2011) (denying \ncertification where plaintiffs alleg ed disparate impact discrimination based on policy of \ndiscretionary mortgage loan pricing; noting that “[a]lthough certification of this type of class was Case 3:22-cv-00990-JD     Document 328     Filed 08/05/25     Page 13 of 16 \n14 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  more debatable pre -Wal-Mart , the Supreme Court has explained that Rule 23(a) commonality \nrequires more than” the mere statistical analysis offered by plaintiffs); Barrett v. Option One \nMortg . Corp. , No.  08-10157 -RWZ, 2012 WL 4076465 , at *3  (D. Mass. Sept. 18, 2012) (de -\ncertifying class of “all African -American borrowers who obtained a mortgage loan from one of the \ndefendants” following Supreme Court’s decision in Dukes ; noting that “[a]s in Wal-Mart , \nplaintiffs here submit a statistical analysis to demonstrate that Option One’s policy had a disparate \nimpact” but “that is no longer sufficient to establish commonality”).    \nPlaintiffs may say that this case does not involve a discretionary pricing policy, but they \nthemselves were the vigorous proponents of Ramirez  as a case presenting “similar claims.”  Dkt. \nNo. 204 at 3.  And the  record leaves no doubt that the underwriting decisions at issue in this case \ninvolve d the exercise of discretion.  As plaintiffs acknowledge, a human underwriter ultimately  \nexercises discretion  to approve or deny an application , after taking into consideration the outputs \nfrom the CORE/Risk Engine/ECS models .  See Dkt. No.  252 at 5 (“there is some discretion in the \nprocess”).   \nPlaintiffs’ suggestion  that they seek to “follow” the approach in International Brotherhood \nof Teamsters v. United States , 431 U.S. 324 (1977), also does not help them .  See Dkt. No.  204 at \n19.  Among other differences, t hat case was an employment discrimination case brought under \nTitle VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 by the United States.  It did not involve any class \ncertified under Rule 23.  Also, i n Dukes  too, the plaintiffs contended that Wal -Mart had engaged \nin a pattern or practice of discrimination as in Teamsters , but the Court still held that plaintiffs’ \nstatistical evidence showing that “the discretionary system has produced a racial or sexual \ndisparity is not enough .”  Dukes , 564 U.S. at 352, 356 -57 (emphasis in original).  \nOverall, plaintiffs’ arguments with respect to commonality are stuck in a time before the \nSupreme Court decided Dukes .  Plaintiffs’ failure to account for Dukes and the current state of the \nlaw foreclose s class certification.  In Dukes , “respondents wish[ed] to sue about literally millions \nof employment decisions at once.”  Dukes , 564 U.S. at 352.  The Court observed that “[w]ithout \nsome glue holding the alleged reasons  for all those decisions together, it will be impossible to say Case 3:22-cv-00990-JD     Document 328     Filed 08/05/25     Page 14 of 16 \n15 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  that examination of all the class members’ claims for relief will produce a common answer to the \ncrucial question why was I disfavored .”  Id. (emphases in original).   \nThe same goes here.  Plaintiffs wish to sue about hundreds of thousands of home loan \ndecisions at once.  Without some glue holding the alleged reasons for all those decisions together, \nit will be impossible to say that examination of all the class members’ claims for re lief will \nproduce a common answer to the crucial question why was I denied .  Plaintiffs did not identify any \nties that bind for purposes of commonality . \n2. Disparate Treatment  \nWells Fargo  says,  with good reason , that plaintiffs’ opening brief argued only a disparate \nimpact theory for class certification.  See Dkt. No. 232 at 9.  Even so , plaintiffs say in their reply \nthat they “allege both disparate impact and disparate treatment theories ,” and that they alleged in \ntheir motion that “Wells Fargo’s knowing and continued use of its CORE/ECS system that \nadversely affected Minority Applicants ‘constitutes disparate treatment under the law.’”  Dkt. \nNo. 252 at 2 -3 (citation and emphasis omitted).    \nPlaintiffs are not on solid ground here, but the issue is of no moment .  In Dukes , plaintiffs \nalleged that Wal -Mart’s “local managers’ discretion over pay and promotions is exercised \ndisproportionately in favor of men, leading to an unlawful disparate impact on female employees.”  \nDukes , 564 U.S. at 344.  Plaintiffs said that “because Wal -Mart is aware of this effect, its refusal \nto cabin its managers’ authority amounts to disparate treatment.”  Id. at 345.  \nEven so, t he Court concluded  that plaintiffs’ statistical evidence alone was not enough and \nthat “[m]erely showing that Wal -Mart’s policy of discretion has produced an overall sex -based \ndisparity does not suffice”  for certification.   Id. at 357.  For the same reasons, and as discussed, \nplaintiffs’ statistical evidence alone does not satisfy Rule 23(a)(2)’s commonality requirement  \nhere,  and that is true even considering plaintiffs’ cursory disparate treatment argument.  \nCONCLUSION  \nBecause plaintiffs have failed to satisfy Rule 23(a)(2) commonality, none of their proposed \nclasses may be certified.  The Court finds it unnecessary to reach the remaining Rule 23 \nrequirements that are implicated by plaintiffs’ certification requests.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: This case involves Meta Platforms, Inc. and its executives accused of misrepresenting facts related to securities, particularly concerning their cross-check system, algorithm moderation, Instagram's effect on young users, and the prevalence of duplicate accounts. The plaintiffs, Ohio Public Employees Retirement System and others, argue that these misrepresentations resulted in financial losses for investors. The court has granted in part and denied in part Meta's motion to dismiss, allowing some claims to proceed, particularly regarding the alleged use of algorithms to moderate harmful content and the impact of Instagram on mental health. The case involves AI and automation as it questions the algorithms Meta used for content moderation and their potential biases or effects.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: The key legal issue is whether Meta and its executives made materially false or misleading statements about their content moderation practices, specifically regarding the cross-check system, algorithm bias, and the impact of Instagram on young users, thereby violating securities laws.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court granted in part and denied in part the defendants' motion to dismiss. It dismissed claims against some statements as non-actionable or insufficiently supported by facts, but allowed claims related to Meta's algorithm and Instagram's impact on young users to proceed against some defendants, signaling that plaintiffs provided enough evidence to suggest the possibility of a securities law violation.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Think of Meta as a company that you’ve invested your savings in, trusting it to manage its operations well so you can earn profits. Investors accused Meta of lying about how well they were managing harmful content on their platforms, especially considering things like biased algorithms that might promote negative content or false reassurances that Instagram isn’t harmful to young users. The court partly agreed, saying investors have shown potential proof Meta might have misled them and caused financial harm, so certain claims could continue to be explored in court while others were dismissed due to lack of evidence.",

No. 110  \n \n \nThis securities case is about Meta and its senior executives’ alleged misstatements about \nharms that flow  from its various social media platforms.  Defendant’s  motion to dismiss  was heard \nbefore this Court on August 17, 2023 .  Having read the papers filed by the parties and carefully \nconsidered their arguments therein and those made at the hearing, as well as the relevant legal \nauthority, the Court hereby GRANTS IN PART and DENIES IN PART the motion to dismiss , \nfor the following reasons.  \nBACKGROUND1 \nLead Plaintiffs Ohio Public Employees Retirement System and PFA Pension \nForsikringsaktieselskab ’s (collectively, “Plaintiffs”) bring this Private Securities Litigation \nReform Act (“PSLRA”) action against Defendant Meta Platforms, Inc. (“Meta”) and Individual \nDefendants Mark Zuckerberg (Chairman and CEO), David Wehner (Meta’s CFO), Nick Clegg \n(Meta’s  President of Global Affairs), Adam Mosseri (Head of Instagram), Guy Rosen (Meta’s \nChief Information Security Officer), Andy Stone (Meta’s Policy Communications Director), \nAngione Davis (Meta’s Global Head of Security), Karina Newton (Instagram’s Head of Public \n \n1 The Court accepts Plaintiffs’ allegations in the amended complaint as true and construes the \npleadings in the light most favorable to Plaintiffs.  See Manzarek v. St. Paul Fire & Marine Ins. \nCo., 519 F.3d 1025, 1031 (9th Cir. 2008) (citation omitted).  Case 3:21-cv-08812-AMO     Document 143     Filed 09/30/24     Page 1 of 33 \n2 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  Policy), Yann LeCun (Meta’s Chief Artificial Intelligence scientist), Monika Bickert (Meta’s Vice \nPresident of Content Policy), and Pavni Diwanji (Meta’s Vice President) (collectively, \n“Defendants”).   \nIn September and October of 2021, the Wall Street Journal published a series of articles \nentitled the “Facebook Files.”  ECF 97 (First Amended Complaint, “FAC”) ¶¶ 1 -2.  These articles \nrelayed information from whistleblower Frances Haugen, a former Meta data scientist, about \nMeta’s policies and actions, including how it prioritized revenue at the cost of safety.  FAC ¶¶ 1 -4.  \nFrom April 27, 2021,  to October 21, 2021 , the alleged Class Period , Meta made a series of \nstatements regarding its “cross check”  (or “X-check ”) or “whitelisting program,” including that it \nconsistently applied its content moderation policies and held everyone to the same standards.  \nFAC ¶¶ 83 -86, 90 -96.  Meta told the public  that it has a system known as “cross check” where it  \ngives content from certain  newsworthy  pages or profiles additional review.  FAC ¶ 96.  The \nsystem exempted millions of influential users from Meta’s Community Standards.  FAC  ¶¶ 100-\n121. \nIn 2018, Meta made changes to its news feed algorithm purportedly to help users have \nmore “meaningful social interactions” or “MSI.”  FAC ¶¶ 125 -27.  Throughout the Class Period , \nDefendants claimed  that Meta’s news feed algorithm and content moderation policies decreased \nharmful content.  FAC ¶¶ 140 -159.  However, harmful, toxic content and misinformation \nproliferated.  FAC ¶¶ 132 -39. \nDuring the Class Period, Defendants also reassured the public that Instagram did not cause \nharm to young users.  FAC ¶ 202.  They  told investors that there was little existing research on the \nimpact of Instagram on children and that any negative effects of the platform were small.  \nFAC  ¶ 202.  In fact , Meta’s existing internal research showed that Instagram caused or worsened \nmental health issues for young users .  FAC ¶¶ 203, 210 -227.   \nFinally, during the Class Period, Meta  emphasized its user growth metrics when reporting  \nits daily active users ( “DAUs ”) and monthly active users ( “MAUs ”).  FAC ¶¶ 258 -64.  Meta told \ninvestors that it regularly evaluated Facebook metrics to estimate the number of “duplicate” or \n“false” accounts within its MAUs.  FAC ¶ 265.  In reporting its growth rates, Meta did not report Case 3:21-cv-08812-AMO     Document 143     Filed 09/30/24     Page 2 of 33 \n3 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  the prevalence of “SUMA ” (same user, multiple accounts) accounts.  FAC ¶ 270.  An internal \npresentation based on a sample of 5,000 new accounts showed that at least 32% and as many as \n56% were opened by existing users.  FAC ¶ 270.  \nPlaintiffs bring two causes of action against Defendants for violations of Section 10(b) and \nSection 20(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act.  They allege that Defendants made a series of \nalleged false or misleading statements regarding four separate aspects of Meta’s business \noperations: (1) affirming Meta’s c ommitment to holding all users to the same Community \nStandards despite Meta’s practice of “cross check” or “X -Check” and “whitelisting” certain \nindividuals, FAC ¶¶ 13 -21; (2)  misleading investors abo ut Meta’s algorithm and content \nmoderation practices, which encouraged the promotion of divisive content, FAC ¶¶ 22 -25; \n(3) misstatements and omissions about Instagram’s harm to young users, FAC ¶¶ 26 -30; and \n(4) overstating Meta’s growth rate by misleading investors about the number of duplicate accounts \namong its new users, FAC  ¶¶ 31 -34.   \nLEGAL STANDARD  \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a) requires that a complaint contain “a short and plain \nstatement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.”  A defendant may move to \ndismiss a complaint for failing to state a claim upon which relief ca n be granted under Federal \nRule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6).  “Dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) is appropriate only where the \ncomplaint lacks a cognizable legal theory or sufficient facts to support a cognizable legal theory.”  \nMendiondo v. Centinela Hosp. Me d. Ctr. , 521 F.3d 1097, 1104 (9th Cir. 2008).  To survive a Rule \n12(b)(6) motion, a plaintiff must plead “enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on \nits face.”  Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly , 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007).  A claim is facially plausible \nwhen a plaintiff pleads “factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that \nthe defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.”  Ashcroft v. Iqbal , 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009).   \nIn reviewing the plausibility of a complaint, c ourts “accept factual allegations in the complaint as \ntrue and construe the pleadings in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.” Manzarek v. \nSt. Paul Fire & Marine Ins. Co. , 519 F.3d 1025, 1031 (9th Cir. 2008).  Nonetheless, Courts do not \n“accept as true allegations that are merely conclusory, unwarranted deductions of fact, or Case 3:21-cv-08812-AMO     Document 143     Filed 09/30/24     Page 3 of 33 \n4 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  unreasonable inferences.”  In re Gilead Scis. Secs. Litig. , 536 F.3d 1049, 1055 (9th Cir. 2008).  \nSecurities fraud cases have heightened pleading requirements as the complaint must satisfy \nboth the pleading requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b) and the PSLRA.  In re \nVeriFone Holdings, Inc. Sec. Litig. , 704 F.3d 694, 701 (9th Cir. 2012) .  Pursuant to Rule 9(b), \nclaims alleging fraud must “state with particularity the circumstances constituting fraud  . . . [.] ”  \nFed. R. Civ. P. 9(b).  The PSLRA mandates that “the complaint shall specify each statement \nalleged to have been misleading, [and] the reason or reasons why the statement is \nmisleading . . . [.]” 15 U.S.C. § 78u –4(b)(1)(B).  The PSLRA further requires  that the complaint \n“state with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted with the \nrequired state of mind.”   Tellabs, Inc. v. Makor Issues & Rts., Ltd. , 551 U.S. 308, 31 4 (2007)  \n(quoting 15 U.S.C.  § 78u–4(b)(2)(A) ).  This means a plaintiff must allege that “the defendant[] \nmade false or misleading statements either intentionally or with deliberate recklessness.”  In re \nVeriFone Holdings , 704 F.3d at 701 (quoting Zucco Partners, LLC v. Digimarc C orp., 552 F.3d \n981, 991 (9th Cir. 2009)).  \nOn January 27, 2023, Defendants filed the instant motion to dismiss.  ECF 110.   \nDISCUSSION  \nI. REQUEST FOR JUDICIAL NOTICE  \nWhile the scope of review on a motion to dismiss is generally limited to the contents of the \ncomplaint, courts may take judicial notice of facts that are “not subject to reasonable dispute.”  \nFed. R. Evid. 201(b).  Courts may consider documents incorporated into the complaint by \nreference, Tellabs , 551 U.S. at 322, and take  judicial notice of documents on which complaints \nnecessarily rely, Lee v. City of Los Angeles , 250 F.3d 668, 688 (9th Cir. 2001), publicly available \nfinancial documents such as SEC filin gs, Metzler Inv. GMBH v. Corinthian Colls., Inc. , 540 F.3d \n1049, 1064 n.7 (9th Cir. 2008), and publicly available articles or other news releases of which the \nmarket was aware, Heliotrope Gen., Inc. v. Ford Motor Co. , 189 F.3d 971, 981 n.18 (9th Cir. \n1999).    \n Defendants argue that the Court should consider three newspaper articles and posts \n(Exhibits 1, 3, and 4) that are incorporated by reference in the First Amended Complaint.  Case 3:21-cv-08812-AMO     Document 143     Filed 09/30/24     Page 4 of 33 \n5 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  ECF 110-1.  Plaintiffs oppose this request, arguing that Defendants may not use the articles to \ncontradict the complaint.  ECF 116.  The Court may not assume the truth of an incorporated \ndocument “if such assumptions only serve to dispute facts in a well -plead ed complaint.”  Khoja v. \nOrexigen Therapeutics, Inc. , 899 F.3d 988, 1003 (9th Cir. 2018) .  However, the Court may \nconsider the context in which the allegedly false statement was made.  See id.  at 1002 ( holding \nthat incorporation by reference “prevents plaintiffs from selecting only portions of documents that \nsupport their claims, while omitting portions of those very documents that weaken – or doom – \ntheir claims”); see also In re Intel Corp. Sec. Litig. , 2019 WL 1427660, at *6 (N.D. Cal. Mar. 29, \n2019) (same).  Plaintiffs quote the exhibits extensively in the FAC and allege that each document \ncontained a false or misleading statement.  See FAC  ¶¶ 90, 419, 475 -76, 482 -83.  As Exhibits 1, 3, \nand 4 “form the basis of [p laintiffs’] claims,” the Court takes judicial notice of  these exhibits.  \nKhoja , 899 F.3d at 1004 . \n Defendants also seek judicial notice of Meta’s Form 10 -K for fiscal year 2020.  ECF 110 -1 \nat 2.  Plaintiffs oppose this request, arguing that the 10 -K preceded the Class Period by several \nmonths.  ECF 116 at 4.  However, Plaintiffs cite no authority showi ng that such timing makes \njudicial notice improper.  Indeed, the Ninth Circuit has repeatedly held that courts may take \njudicial notice of matters of public record, such as SEC filings.  See Metzler , 540 F.3d at 1064 n.7 ; \nDreiling v. Am. Exp. Co. , 458 F.3d  942, 946  n.2 (9th Cir. 2006) ; MGIC Indem. Corp. v. Weisman , \n803 F.2d 500, 504 (9th Cir. 1986) .  The Court accordingly takes judicial notice of the Form 10 -K \nin Exhibit 2.  \n Both parties  request that the Court take judicial notice of the Meta Oversight Board’s \nPolicy Advisory Opinion on Meta’s Cross -Check Program for the “limited purpose of establishing \nthat the Oversight Board made the statements contained in the report.”  ECF 115 (Ex. A ) at 2 -3; \nECF 121.  Courts may take judicial notice of matters of public record and of records and reports of \nadministrative bodies.  Khoja , 899 F.3d at 999, 1001.  Thus, the Court takes judicial notice of this \nexhibit.  \nII. SECTION 10(B) CLAIM  \nPlaintiffs challenge 60 statements  made by Defendants as false or misleading in violation Case 3:21-cv-08812-AMO     Document 143     Filed 09/30/24     Page 5 of 33 \n6 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b -5.  To state a claim under Section 10(b) and \nRule 10b -5, a plaintiff must allege “(1) a material misrepresentation or omission by the defendant; \n(2) scienter; (3) a connection between the misrepresentation or omission and the purchase or sale \nof a security; (4 ) reliance upon the misrepresentation or omission; (5) economic loss; and (6) loss \ncausation.”  In re Quality Sys., Inc. Sec. Litig. , 865 F.3d 1130, 1140 (9th Cir. 2017) (quoting \nHalliburton Co. v. Erica P. John Fund, Inc. , 573 U.S. 258, 267  (2014)) ; see 17 CFR § 240.10b –\n5(b); 15 U.S.C. § 78j(b) .  “Rule 9(b) applies to all elements of a securities fraud action, including \nloss causation.”  Oregon Pub. Emps. Ret. Fund v. Apollo Grp. Inc. , 774 F.3d 598, 605 (9th Cir. \n2014).   \nDefendants move to dismiss the Section 10(b) claim for failure to allege (1) a \nmisrepresentation or omission, (2) scienter, and (3) loss causation.  The “more exacting pleading \nrequirements” of the PSLRA require that the complaint plead both falsity and scienter with \nparticularity, and Defendants argue that the pleading here falls short of that standard.  See Zucco \nPartners , 552 F.3d at 990; see also  15 U.S.C. § 78u4(b)(1).   The Court takes up the three \nchallenged elements in turn.  \nA. Material Misrepresentation or Omission  \nThe first issue is whether Plaintiffs sufficiently allege a material misrepresentation or \nomission.  Defendants argue that the challenged statements are not material misrepresentations or \nomissions because they are (1) opinion statements; (2) nonactionable statements of corporate \noptimism; and (3) not false or misleading.  The Court addresses each  argument  in turn.  \n1. Opinion Statements  \nMeta argues that statements of opinion about its content moderation efforts are not \nactionable because Plaintiffs have not alleged that they are both subjectively and objectively false.  \nMot. at 30 (citing FAC ¶¶ 426, 424, 427, 437, 439, 442).  Expressions of opinions – as opposed to \nstatements of fact – are only actionable if they are both subjectively and objectively false or \nmisleading.  Rubke v. Capitol Bancorp Ltd , 551 F.3d 1156, 1162 (9th Cir. 2009)  (citing Va. \nBankshares, Inc. v. Sandberg , 501 U.S. 1 083, 1094 -96 (1991) ).  “To be misleading, a statement \nmust be ‘capable of objective verification. ’ ”  Retail Wholesale & Dep ’t Store Union Loc. 338 Ret. Case 3:21-cv-08812-AMO     Document 143     Filed 09/30/24     Page 6 of 33 \n7 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  Fund v. Hewlett -Packard Co. , 845 F.3d 1268, 1275 (9th Cir. 2017)  (quoting Oregon Pub., 774 \nF.3d at 606).   \nIn several opinion statements  (Statements 19, 20, 25, 27 )2 that Plaintiffs offer in support of \ntheir Section 10(b) claim, they fail to allege that the statements were objectively and subjectively \nfalse or misleading.  For example, in Statement 19 , Defendant Wehner states “I think more than \nanyone else in the industry, we invest on the safety and security side to sort of keep bad content \noff the site . . . [.]” FAC ¶ 426 .  Plaintiffs fail to allege any facts showing that this statement  is \nobjectively false – i.e., that Meta does not do more to prevent misinformation than others in the \nindustry.  Plaintiffs also fail to allege  facts showing that Wehner did not believe this statement to \nbe true.  Accordingly, Statement 19 is not actionable.  Similarly, Plaintiffs fail to plead  that \nStatement 20  was objectively or subjectively false  when made .  In Statement 20, Zuckerberg \nstated that Meta  announced a “big shift” in 2018 “knowing that people would spend less time on \nFacebook ” to help that have more “meaningful social interactions,” and that Meta viewed  the shift  \n“success because it improves the experience of our users .”  Statement 20 ( FAC ¶ 427).  Plaintiffs \nfail to allege that this statement was false or that Zuckerberg did not believe it to be true.  The \nCourt therefore  dismisses the claims based on Statements 20  on this basis  as well .  \nHowever, the Court cannot agree that Statements 25 or 27 are opinion statements  because \nDefendants  make factual assertions  in these statements : \n• “You may claim [Facebook] amplifies ideas you disagree with, but it’s simply false.” \nStatement 25 (FAC ¶ 437). \n• “The idea that there is always a causal link between social media and polarization is \nnot true . . .  the research [shows that] because most people. . . tend to have a more \nheterogenous and mixed ideological composition of [] friends on Facebook than you do  \nif you read the same partisan newspaper or watch the same cable TV or news outlet,” \nsocial media is “not as narrow in terms of its ideological diet.”  Statement 27 ( FAC ¶ \n442). \n \n2 The Court refers to the statements as they are numbered (1 -60) in the Appendix submitted by the \nparties.  ECF 140 -1, Exhibit A.  \n Case 3:21-cv-08812-AMO     Document 143     Filed 09/30/24     Page 7 of 33 \n8 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  These statements assert  that Facebook does not amplify ideas that users disagree with and that \nthere is no causal link between social media and polarization.  As these statements are “capable of \nobjective verification,” Retail Wholesale , 845 F.3d at 1275 ( citation omitted), the Court cannot \ndismiss them as nonactionable opinion statements.3 \n2. Corporate Puffery  \nDefendants also argue that several statements  (Statements 2, 4, 7, and 16, 17, 19, 21 -24, \n26, 27, and 33 ) regarding Meta’s enforcement of community standards and its algorithm and \ncontent moderation efforts are nonactionable statements of corporate optimism.  “[V]ague, \ngeneralized assertions of corporate optimism or statements of ‘mere puffing’ are not actionable \nmaterial misrepresentations under federal securities laws” because no reasonable investor would \nrely on such statements .  City of Royal Oak Ret. Sys. v. Juniper Networks, Inc. , 880 F. Supp. 2d \n1045, 1063 (N.D. Cal. 2012)  (citations omitted).  This is because “[w]hen valuing corporations,  . . \n. investors do not rely on vague statements of optimism like ‘good,’ ‘well -regarded,’ or other feel \ngood monikers .”  In re Cutera Sec. Litig. , 610 F.3d 1103, 1111 (9th Cir. 2010) .  However,  “even \n‘general statements of optimism, when taken in context, may form the  basis for a securities fraud \nclaim’ when those statements address specific aspects of a company’s operation that the speaker \nknows to be performing poorly.”  Quality Sys. , 865 F.3d at 1143  (citation omitted) .  “Statements \nby a company that are capable of objective verification are not “puffery” and can constitute \nmaterial misrepresentations .”  Oregon Pub. , 774 F.3d at 606.   \nDefendants argue that Statements 19, 22, and 33 about Meta’s algorithm and content \nmoderation efforts are nonactionable  statements of corporate optimism : \n• “I think more than  anyone else in the industry, we  invest on the safety and  security side \nto sort of keep  bad content off the site before  it gets ranked and put into  what people \nsee. . . . I think we really do more than anyone else in the industry on the safety and \nsecurity front to prevent things like misinformation and bad content going into the \n \n3 Defendants also argue that Statements 18 (FAC ¶ 424) and 26 (FAC ¶ 439) are non-actionable \nopinion statements.  As Defendants analyze whether the statements are false or misleading along \nwith the remaining statements, the Court does not separately address them in this section.  \n Case 3:21-cv-08812-AMO     Document 143     Filed 09/30/24     Page 8 of 33 \n9 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  system in the first place.” Statement 19 (FAC  ¶ 426).4 \n• “We’re taking significant steps to fight the spread of misinformation . . . [.]” Statement \n22 (FAC  ¶ 429).5 \n• “[F]or the last several years, our team that has been focused on kind of trust and safety \noverall, has been more focused on content moderation, so making sure that we can \nidentify harmful content and take it down and also working on making sure that we \ncontinue improving privacy and supporting and providing world -class controls there.”  \nStatement 33 (FAC ¶ 457) . \nStatements that Meta takes “significant steps” to fight disinformation, that it believes it does more \nthan others in the industry on safety and security, and is focused on “trust and safety” and \nimproving privacy are too generalized and do not describe a “specific and testable characteristic” \nof Meta’s platform.

Corp. , 811 F.3d 1200, 1206 -07 (9th Cir. 2016) \n(concluding that “strong credit culture and underwriting integrity remain paramount at CVB” was \nnon-actionable puffery ); In re Yahoo! Inc.

Aug. 30, 2017)  (concluding  that “protecting our system and our users’ \ninformation is paramount to ensure Yahoo users enjoy a secure user experience and maintaining \nour users’ trust” was non -actionable puffery as it did not state any specific characteristics of \nDefendants’ products or services).  As Statements 19, 22, and 33 are too vague and generalized to \nbe actionable, the Court dismisses the claims based on those statements.  See Baltazar  v. Apple \nInc., 2011 WL 6747884, at *4 (N.D. Cal. Dec. 22, 2014) ( holding that “[i]f an alleged \nmisrepresentation would not deceive a reasonable consumer or amounts to mere puffery, then the \nclaim may be dismissed as a matter of law.”).    \n \n4 Although the Court already found that Statement 19 is an opinion statement that Plaintiff failed \nto adequately plead, it also finds that  this statement is corporate puffery.  \n \n5 This statement also proclaims that “[o]ur machine learning models to find potentially violating \nCOVID -19 and vaccine content are trained to surface content in 19 languages .”  However,  \nPlaintiffs have not offered  any allegations showing that this  portion of the statement  is false  or \nmisleading . \n Case 3:21-cv-08812-AMO     Document 143     Filed 09/30/24     Page 9 of 33 \n10 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  However, the Court cannot agree that the additional statements classified by  Defendants as \npuffery  (Statements 2, 4, 7, and 16, 17, 21, 23, 24, 26, and 27) are too vague or generalized to be \nactionable.   “[T]here is a difference between enthusiastic statements amounting to general puffery \nand opinion -based statements that are anchored in misrepresentations of existing facts. ”  City of \nSunrise Firefighters ’ Pension Fund v. Oracle Corp. , 527 F. Supp. 3d 1151, 1172 (N.D. Cal. 2021)  \n(internal quotation marks and citations omitted).  For example, in Statement 2, Meta told the \nBoard that “it applies a ‘cross check’ system to some ‘high profile’ accounts to ‘minimize the risk \nof errors in enforcement’ . . . [but] ‘it has never had a general rule that is more permissive for \ncontent posted by political leaders .’ ”  Statement 2 (FAC ¶ 389).  Meta also stated that  it removes \ncontent that violates its standards and does not have special protections for any groups .  Statement \n4 (FAC ¶ 393 ); Statement 16 (FAC ¶ 419).  These statements suggest specific actions that Meta \ntook and rules that it implemented or enforced.   Thus, these statements can be verified and are not \ncorporate puffery.  See In re Cutera , 610 F.3d at 1111 . \nWhile p ortions  of Statements 4 and 7 relate to Meta’s vague goals and aspirations ,6 \nDefendants fail to address  the remaining portions of the statements , which state more concrete \nfacts .  In Statements 4 and 7, Defendants claim that they  remove all content that violates Meta’s \nCommunity Standards,  and that Meta assesses everyone under the same Community  Standards.  \nStatement 4 (FAC ¶ 393); Statement 7 (FAC ¶ 399).  Defendants do not explain why these \nstatements are not capable of objective verification and the Court cannot find that  the statements \nare corporate puffery . \nSimilarly, the Court cannot agree  that Statements 17 , 18, 21, 23, 24, 26, and 27  fail as too \nvague or general .  Meta argues  only that these statements are “subjective assessments” of the \ncontent Meta wants on its apps or what is  in its financial or reputational interest.  Mot. at 29.  \nHowever, the statements assert that Meta removes certain content from its platform, has reduced \nthe prevalence of disinformation, and that it is not in Facebook’s interest to push users towards \n \n6 See FAC ¶¶ 393,  399 (Meta “strive[s] to enforce our policies evenly”); Klein v. Facebook, Inc. , \n580 F. Supp. 3d 743, 795 (N.D. Cal. 2022)  (finding the statement “[k]eeping the global \ncommunity safe is an important part of our mission”  too vague to be actionable) . \n Case 3:21-cv-08812-AMO     Document 143     Filed 09/30/24     Page 10 of 33 \n11 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  extreme content.  Such assertions are objectively verifiable.  See In re Yahoo! , 2017 WL 3727318, \nat *26 (finding that “physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with federal \nregulations to protect personal information about you”  is not puffery as it made a specific \nguarantee that Defendants “use safeguards that complied with federal regulations to protect users’ \ninformation”).  Therefore, the Court cannot dismiss the claims  based on Statements 2, 4, 7, 16 -18, \n21, 23, 24, 26, and 27 as on this basis .  \nTo recap, the Court finds  that Statements 19 , 22, and 33 are not actionable statements of \ncorporate puffery  and Plaintiffs failed to allege that Statement 22  is objectively and subjectively \nfalse  or misleading .  Statements 1-18, 21, 23 -32, and 34 -60 remain live.  \n3. False or Misleading  \nThe Court next addresses whether Plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged that the remaining 56 \nstatements (Statements 1 -18, 21, 23 -32, 34 -60) are false or misleading.  “For a statement to be \nfalse or misleading, it must ‘directly contradict what the defendant knew at that time’ or ‘omit[] \nmaterial information.’  ”  Weston Fam. P’ship LLLP v. Twitter, Inc. , 29 F.4th 611, 619 (9th Cir. \n2022) (quoting Khoja , 899 F.3d at 1008 -09).  Statements that are “literally true” may still be \nmisleading due to “their context and manner of presentation.”  Miller v. Thane Int’l, Inc. , 519 F.3d \n879, 886 (9th Cir. 2008).  “The most direct way to sho w both that a statement was false when \nmade and that the party making the statement knew that it was false is via contemporaneous \nreports or data, available to the party, which contradict the statement.”  Nursing Home Pension \nFund Local 144 v. Oracle Corp. , 380 F.3d 1226, 1230 (9th Cir. 2004) .   \nThe parties categorize the challenged statements in four categories: (a) “Cross Check” or \nenforcement of community standards; ( b) algorithm and content moderation efforts; ( c) \nInstagram’s impact on young users; and ( d) the prevalence of duplicate accounts .  The Court \nanalyzes whether the challenged  statements are false or misleading in  each of the four categories . \na. Cross Check: Enforcement of Community Standards  \nPlaintiffs allege  16 statements  (Statements 1-16) that Defendants made about cross -check \nthroughout the Class Per iod.  Meta’s “cross -check” or “ X-check” program exempts influential \nusers from its community standards.  FAC ¶ 100.  Plaintiffs allege that cross -check exempted Case 3:21-cv-08812-AMO     Document 143     Filed 09/30/24     Page 11 of 33 \n12 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  content posted by VIPs rather than allowing “newsworthy” content to remain online.  FAC  ¶¶ 100-\n115, 403; see FAC ¶ 102 (cross check “shield[ed] millions of VIP users from the company’s \nnormal enforcement process”).  They allege that the following statements are false or misleading:  \nMeta applies its community standards and policies to everyone and all types of content \n(Statements 1, 3 -5, 7, 12, and 13); Meta removes harmful content no matter who posts it \n(Statements 6, 10, 13, and 14); cross -check is simply a system of additional revi ew for certain \nprofiles or pages (Statements 9, 15, and 16); and cross -check applies in limited newsworthy \ncircumstances (Statements 2, 8, and 11).    \nDefendants move to dismiss claims  based on these  statements, arguing that Plaintiffs do \nnot provide particularized allegations contradicting the alleged misstatements.  Mot. at 23 -24.  \nThey argue that Plaintiffs cite “isolated sentences, devoid of context” from unsourced internal \nMeta documents from 2019 and 202 0, a year to two years before the class period .  Id.  To show \nthat a statement was false when made, a plaintiff may point to “contemporaneous reports or data.”  \nSee Nursing Home , 380 F.3d at 1230.  Where a  complaint relies on internal reports , it must contain \n“at least some specifics from those reports as well as such facts as may indicate their reliability.”  \nLipton v. Pathogenesis Corp. , 284 F.3d 1027, 1036 (9th Cir. 2002)  (citation omitted).   In the FAC, \nPlaintiffs quote Wall Street Journal articles which reported that internal Meta documents showed \nthat “most of the content flagged by the cross -check system did not face subsequent reviews,” and \nby 2020, at least 5.8 million users were on the cross -check list.  FAC  ¶ 103.  According to a 2019  \ninternal audit, at least 45 teams at Meta were involved in whitelisting, many of which “chose not \nto enforce the rules with high profile accounts at all.”  FAC  ¶ 104.  A 2019 audit found that Meta \n“currently review[s] less than 10% of XChecked content.”  FAC  ¶ 106.   \nPlaintiffs fail to allege specific facts to overcome the heightened pleadings requirements of \nthe PSLRA and Rule 9(b).  In re Verifone Holdings , 704 F.3d at 701.  Plaintiffs argue that the \nquotations from internal Meta documents and whistleblower testimony “surpass[] the level of \ndetail required by the PSLRA.”  ECF 113 (“Response”)  at 21.  However, Plaintiffs plead selective \nquotes from unidentified internal Meta documents that the Wall Street Journal reported.  See \nFAC  ¶¶ 103 -115.  They fail to allege who drafted these internal documents, who received or Case 3:21-cv-08812-AMO     Document 143     Filed 09/30/24     Page 12 of 33 \n13 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  reviewed them, or what the reports entailed.  Essentially, Plaintiffs fail to state with particularity \nthe needed “who, what, when, where, and how of the misconduct charged  . . . [.]” Davidson v. \nKimberly -Clark Corp. , 889 F.3d 956, 964 (9th Cir. 2018); see In re Silicon Graphics Inc. Sec. \nLitig. , 183 F.3d 970, 985 (9th Cir. 1999)  (finding that the complaint did not contain “adequate \ncorroborating details” where plaintiff did not provide an “adequate description of [the] contents” \nof reports or “facts as may indicate their reliability”).7  Accordingly, the Court dismisses the claim \nbased on Statements 1, 2, 3-7, 9, 12 -14, 15, and 16.   \nWith respect to the statements that cross -check only applied to a limited number of posts, \nPlaintiffs also point to an October 2021 transparency report published by Meta’s Oversight Board.  \nThat report acknowledged that it was misleading to state that cross -check applied to only a “small \nnumber of decisions.”  FAC ¶ 119.  The report indicates that Meta had not been “fully \nforthcoming in its responses on cross -check .”  FAC ¶¶ 119 -20.  Considering the 2019 and 2020 \nreports in tandem with the 2021 transparency report, Plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged that \nstatements that cross -check only applied in limited newsworthy situations (Statements 8 and 11) \nwere misleading.  See Nursing Home , 380 F.3d at 1230  (holding  that the “most direct way to show \nboth that a statement  was false when made and that the party making the statement knew that it \nwas false is via contemporaneous reports or data, available to the party, which  contrad ict the \nstatement ”).  Therefore, the claim  based on Statements 8 and 11 stand.  \nb. Algorithm and Content Moderation Efforts  \nPlaintiffs next challenge 23 statements (Statements 17 -39) that Defendants made about \nMeta’s algorithm and content moderation.  Throughout the Class Period, Meta stated  that it \nproactively removed hate speech and misinformation from its platforms, did not profit from \npolarization or prioritize profit over safety, and that hate speech prevalence on Facebook \n \n7 Statement 2 was made to the Meta Oversight Board in response to questions it asked Meta.  \nFAC  ¶ 389.  In order to be actionable, a statement must be made “in a manner reasonabl y \ncalculated to influence the investing public.”  McGann v. Ernst & Young , 102 F.3d 390, 393 (9th \nCir. 1996)  (citations omitted).  Plaintiffs have not alleged that Meta’s statement to its Board was \nmade in such a manner.  Moreover, even if the statement were otherwise actionable, Plaintiffs \nhave failed to allege who made these statements and when.  See Davidson , 889 F.3d at 964.  \nAccordingly, the Court dismisses the Section 10(b) claim based on Statement 2.  \n Case 3:21-cv-08812-AMO     Document 143     Filed 09/30/24     Page 13 of 33 \n14 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  decreased due to changes it made to the platform.  FAC ¶¶ 422, 424, 426 -430, 435, 437, 439, 442, \n445, 447, 450, 451, 454, 457, 459, 461, 463, 465 -467.  Plaintiffs allege that these statements are \nmaterially false or misleading because Meta’s  algorithm amplified harmful content “by design,” \nMeta’s content -moderation tools did not sufficiently address harm on the platform, most hate \nspeech removed was reported by the community, not removed proactively, and Meta profited from \nharmful content.  Response  at 26 -27.  Meta argues that none of the statements were false or \nmisleading , addressing algorithm and content moderation  separately.   Following the motion’s \nconvention, the Court first addresses whether Plaintiffs have adequately alleged that the algorithm \nstatements are false or misleading and then takes up the content moderation statements.   \ni. Algorithm Statements  \nThe challenged  algorithm statements (Statements 17 -18, 2 1, 23-25) are:  \n• “There are certain types of content we simply don’t allow on our services .”  Statement 17 \n(FAC ¶ 422) . \n• “[W]e don’t want [] extremist content or any of that stuff on our services . . . we go out of \nour way to try to reduce it .”  Statement 18 ( FAC ¶ 424) . \n• The algorithm “reduce[d] the distribution of many types of content .”  Statement 21 \n(FAC  ¶ 428). \n• Meta “remove[s] information that contributes to the risk of imminent violence or physical \nharm” and “introduced tools that allow us to proactively detect and remove violating \ncontent .”  Statement 23 ( FAC ¶ 430)  \n• Meta’s investment in AI has made its “spam detection and [] integrity systems more \neffective at identifying stuff .”  Statement 24 ( FAC ¶ 435)  \n• It is “simply false” that Facebook “amplifies ideas you disagree with .”  Statement 25 \n(FAC  ¶ 437).  \nPlaintiffs argue that these statements are false and misleading because the algorithm amplified \ntoxic content, Meta profited from polarization, its systems did not sufficiently address harm, and \nMeta took action on very little hate content.  Response  at 29.  Plaintiffs point to the Wall Street \nJournal  (the “ Journal ”), which reported  that “[i]nternal [Meta] research” showed that content Case 3:21-cv-08812-AMO     Document 143     Filed 09/30/24     Page 14 of 33 \n15 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  expressing “anger and outrage was far more likely to score higher and was weighted more heavily \nby the algorithm.”  FAC ¶ 135; see FAC ¶ 136.  Plaintiffs also cite an internal Meta research \nreport from the Journal article titled  “What is Collateral damage?” that concluded based on \n“compelling evidence” that the algorithm itself led to the proliferation of harmful content .  FAC ¶ \n167; see also FAC ¶¶ 166, 188, 568 (internal  Meta  research  and repo rts from 2018 and 2019  \nconcluding that  Meta’s approach has “unhealthy side effects on important slices of public content” \nand that content moderation was not sufficient to address harm on the platform).   In sum, Plaintiffs \nallege that the Journal quoted internal Meta reports or memos from 2017 -2019 that concluded  the \nFacebook algorithm had a side effect of causing harmful content to proliferate.   \nHowever,  as with the cross -check statements, Plaintiffs selectively quote from Meta \nreports referenced in the Journal article without “adequate corroborating details” of the contents \nof the reports that would indicate their reliability, such as who wrote the reports, or what  research \nor content  they contained.  See In re Silicon Graphics , 183 F.3d  at 985 (finding that complaint \nfailed to provide “specifics” from internal reports such as the sources of information, who drafted \nthe reports, or which officers received them).  Further,  in relying on  reports from 2017, 2018, and \n2019 , Plaintiffs do not show that the challenged statements made in 2021 were false when made.  \nNursing Home , 380 F.3d at 1230  (requiring that a statement was false “when made” based on \n“contemporaneous” reports or data) ; Crews v. Rivian Auto., Inc. , 2023 WL 4361098, at *8 (C.D. \nCal. July 3, 2023)  (same) .  Plaintiffs ’ allegations  are thus insufficient to show that the statements \nabout the algorithm were false when made.  See In re Syntex Corp. Sec. Litig. , 95 F.3d 922, 930 \n(9th Cir. 1996)  (finding that internal memorandum written months after statement did not make \nmemorandum false).  Even if the Court were to consider the reports, Plaintiffs offer no factual \nallegations  that contradict Meta’s statements that it was taking significant steps to fight \nmisinformation (Statement 22, FAC ¶ 429), that Meta removes misinformation  from its platforms  \n(Statement 23, FAC ¶ 430), or that Meta’s investment in artificial intelligence makes its spam \ndetection more effective (Statement 24, FAC ¶ 435).  Additionally,  the conclusion in the reports  \nthat the algorithm had negative side effects does not contradict Defendants’ assertion that they \nwork  to reduce misinformation or extremist content on their apps , had reduced such content, or Case 3:21-cv-08812-AMO     Document 143     Filed 09/30/24     Page 15 of 33 \n16 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  that it is not in their interest to push users toward such content (Statements 17, 18, 21, 22, 23).  \nThe Court  therefore  dismisses the claims based on Statements 17 -18 and 21-25. \nii. Content Moderation Statements  \n Plaintiffs also allege that Defendants made materially false and misleading statements \nabout its content moderation efforts (Statements 2 6-39), including :  \n• “[W]e catch the vast majority of [hate speech] before anyone reports it to us .  . . the idea \nthat we have an incentive to prioritize this, is I think one of the most misleading \nallegations  . . . [.]” Statement 26  (FAC ¶ 439) ; \n• “The idea that there is always a causal link between social media and polarization is not \ntrue . . . the research [shows that] because most people. . . tend to have a more \nheterogenous and mixed ideological composition of [] friends on Facebook than you do  if \nyou read the same partisan newspaper or watch the same cable TV or news outlet,” social \nmedia is “not as narrow in terms of its ideological diet.”  Statement 27 (FAC ¶ 442) ; \n• Meta banned over 250 white supremacist groups from its platform and continued to \nenforce its ban on hate groups .  Statement 28  (FAC ¶ 445);   \n• Meta has “no incentive [] to do anything but remove . . . language that incites or facilitates \nviolence” and bans hate groups.  Statement 29 (FAC ¶ 447);  \n• Meta tries to “keep the prevalence of hate speech on our platform as low as possible” and \nthe “improvement in prevalence on Facebook is due to changes we made to reduce \nproblematic content in News  Feed. . . . Today we proactively detect about 97% of hate \nspeech content we remove.”  Statement 30 (FAC ¶ 450);  \n• “[H]ate speech prevalence on Facebook continues  to decrease ” due to changes Meta \n“continue [s] to make to reduce problematic content in the newsfeed .”  Statement 31  (FAC \n¶ 451) ; \n• A proposal requiring Meta to take additional steps to address hate speech and violent \ncontent on its platform was “unnecessary and not beneficial” to shareholders as Meta  \nalready remove s information that violates its Community Standards  on violence, bullying, \nand harassment .  Statement 32  (FAC  ¶ 454).  Case 3:21-cv-08812-AMO     Document 143     Filed 09/30/24     Page 16 of 33 \n17 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  • Meta is “making sure fewer people see misinformation on our apps” and has been focused \non “reducing viral misinformation.”  Statement 34 (FAC ¶ 459) ; see Statement 33 \n(FAC  ¶ 457) (Meta has focused on identifying harmful content to be able to take it down) .  \n• Meta removed “31.5 million pieces of hate speech content from Facebook, compared to \n25.2 million in Q1, and 9.8 million from Instagram, up from 6.3 million in Q1.”  Statement \n35 (FAC ¶  461); see Statement 36 (FAC ¶ 463); Statement 39 (FAC ¶ 467).  \n• “At the heart of [the Wall Street Journal ] series is an allegation that is just plain false: that  \nFacebook conducts research and then systematically and willfully ignores it if the findings \nare inconvenient fo r the company .”  Statement 37 (FAC ¶ 465).  \n• “We do not profit from polarization, in fact, just the opposite.” Statement 38 (FAC ¶ 466).  \nPlaintiffs argue that these statements  touting Meta’s content moderation practices  are false  or \nmisleading  because Meta “estimate[s] that [it] may take action on as little as 3 -5% of hate and \n~0.6% of V&I [violence and incitement] on Facebook despite being the best in the world at it,” \nhate speech was “inordinately prevalent,” content moderations practices wer e “not remotely \nsufficient,” and “98 per cent of the Hate Speech contents are reported reactively.”  Response  at 29 -\n30 (citing FAC ¶¶ 124, 79 -88, 192 -93).  Defendants argue that Plaintiffs fail to allege that any of \nthe content moderation statements were false or misleading.  Mot. at 32-33.  The Court agrees.  \n First, Plaintiffs have failed to point to factual allegations  in their complaint  that it was false \nor misleading for Meta to state that it banned hate groups (Statement 28), profited  from – or had \nan incentive to promote  – polarization (Statements 29, 38), or that friends on Facebook are less \nheterogeneous than a partisan newspaper or TV show (Statement 27).  Accordingly, the Court \ndismisses the claims based on Statements 27, 28, 29, and 38.  \n Second, Plaintiffs rely on an undated internal analysis of “Hate Speech break -down by \ndetection source,” which found that 98% of hate speech is reported reactively by the community \nand only two percent is caught proactively.  FAC ¶ 193.  However, Plaintiffs fail to allege when \nthis re port was made, by whom, or what data it analyzed.  See Lipton , 284 F.3d at 1036 (holding \nthat “negative characterizations of reports relied on by insiders, without specific reference to the \ncontents of those reports, are insufficient to meet the heightened pleading requirements of the Case 3:21-cv-08812-AMO     Document 143     Filed 09/30/24     Page 17 of 33 \n29 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  2. Scienter Allegations as to Instagram’s Harm to Young Users  \nAs to Instagram’s harm to young users, P laintiffs allege scienter based on: ( a) Defendants’ \nawareness of contemporaneous reports;  (b) the motive to conceal the research;  and (c) the \nprominence of the se issues  and Defendants speaking about them .  The Court considers  each \nbelow.  \na. Contemporaneous Knowledge  \nPlaintiffs argue that Defendants were aware of reports or data about  Instagram harming  \nteen mental health because the research was available to all Meta employees.  FAC ¶ 534.   \nHowever, simply pleading that Defendants had “access to internal data” or reports cannot support \nan inference  that Defendants were aware of the research .  See Lipton , 284 F.3d at 1026 (finding no \ninference of scienter where plaintiffs “assert[ed] in conclusory terms that defendants had access to \ninternal data demonstrating a decline in sales,” but failed to identify any internal reports of such \ndata or plead “the contents of any such report or the purported data”).   Plaintiffs also allege that \ntop executives reviewed “deep dive” research about Meta’s social media platforms harming \nteenagers’ mental health, and that a 2020 presentation to Zuckerberg cited this information.  \nFAC  ¶ 534.  Again, Plaintiffs fail to allege the contents of the research that top executives \nreviewed (or which  top executives reviewed the research ).  See City of Dearborn Heights , 856 \nF.3d at 620 (allegations of scienter  were not sufficiently particular  where plaintiff alleged that \ndefendants had “direct access to the data room” but did not allege that defendants personally \naccessed the data room or that the information was disclosed to them) ; see also Sanders v. \nRealreal, Inc. , 2021 WL 1222625, at *15 (N.D. Cal. Mar. 31, 2021)  (no scienter where some \nupper -level employees had “clear access” to the relevant spreadsheets).   Accordingly, Plaintiffs’ \nallegations of contemporaneous knowledge fail to su pport a strong inference of scienter.  \nb. Motives to Conceal Instagram Research  \nPlaintiffs  also allege that Defendants were motivated to hide Meta’s internal research \nbecause they knew that disclosing it would reduce the number of young users on their platforms \nand harm their profits.  FAC ¶ 581.  As with the scienter allegations for cross -check, ab ove, \nPlaintiffs’ conclusory and “generalized assertions of motive” do not support an inference of Case 3:21-cv-08812-AMO     Document 143     Filed 09/30/24     Page 29 of 33 \n30 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  scienter.  See Lipton , 284 F.3d at 1038.  \nc. Prominence of Issues and Speaking About Them  \nPlaintiffs also allege that the Court can infer scienter because Defendants publicly \nacknowledged their awareness of Meta’s research in this area and purported to speak \nknowledgeably about it.  Response  at 41  (citing FAC ¶¶ 244, 246, 251 -52, 488, 492, 495 -96, 545 -\n55).  They add that the issues were of significant prominence given that Meta commissioned \nmulti -year research and Congress raised these issues with Meta at hearings on Instagram’s harm to \nyoung users.  Id. (citing FAC ¶¶ 241 -43, 255 -57, 571 -72, 58 0).  Zuckerberg testified to Congress \nthat Meta is studying its platform’s harm to children and testified about research he had seen.  \nFAC  ¶¶ 241,  554-55.  Newton, Instagram’s head of public policy, stated that the Wall Street \nJournal article improperly focused on limited findings and cast them in a negative light.  \nFAC  ¶ 492.  Davis, Meta’s Head of Safety, testified before a Senate Committee titled  “Protecting \nKids Online: Facebook, Instagram, and Mental Health Harms”  about Meta’s internal research in \nthis area .  FAC ¶ 495.   \nWhere Defendants directly address a specific  issue or data, particularly in relation to a \ngovernment inquiry , courts may infer that Defendants were aware of the issue or data referenced.  \nSee Reese , 747 F.3d at 571 (inferring that Defendant  had access to the data given Defendant ’s \nposition and the fact that she made a statement specifically addressing the data at issue in the \ncontext of a public and government inquiry ).  Like in Reese , Defendants Zuckerberg, Newton, and \nDavis publicly and directly  addressed the research on Instagram’s harm to young users, suggesting \nthat they had access to the relevant information.  See id. ; see also S. Ferry , 542 F.3d at 785 \n(holding that “detailed and specific allegations about management ’s exposure to factual \ninformation within the company” support an inference of scienter) .  Indeed,  “an assertion that \nDefendants were unaware of an alleged issue can be directly contradicted by the fact that [they] \nspecifically addressed it in [their] statement[s] .”  Shenwick , 282 F. Supp. at 1147 . \nHowever, the allegations as to Mosseri  (Instagram’s CEO ) and Diwanji  (Vice President of \nYouth Products ) do not support a finding of scienter.  In questions to Mosseri about whether social \nmedia is good for children, Mosseri referenced external research  on this issue .  FAC ¶¶ 244, 246, Case 3:21-cv-08812-AMO     Document 143     Filed 09/30/24     Page 30 of 33 \n31 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  251.  As to Diwanji, the only allegation is that in a blog post, she claimed that Meta had convened \nexperts to develop a comprehensive plan on child safety and well -being.  FAC  ¶ 488.  Those \nallegations fail to support a finding that either Mosseri or Diwanji was aware of Meta’s internal \nresearch.  See, e.g. , Glazer Capital Mgmt. v. Magistri , 549 F.3d 736, 743 -49 (9th Cir.  2008) (no \nstrong inference of scienter on the part of the company CEO in the absence of facts showing he \nwas personally aware of illegal payments or that he was actively involved in details of Asian \nsales) ; see also In re Enovix Corp. Sec. Litig. , 2024 WL 349269, at *15 (N.D. Cal. Jan. 30, 2024)  \n(concluding that “ the consolidated complaint does not state with specificity what defendants knew \nand when ”) (emphasis in original).  \nGiven that  Zuckerberg, Newton, and Davis specifically address ed Meta’s research about \nInstagram harming children , the Court finds Plaintiffs have alleged  a strong inference of scienter.   \nIndeed, Plaintiffs must “raise a strong inference of fraud  . . . [but] do not have to conclusively \neliminate all doubt.”  SEB Inv. Mgmt. AB v. Wells Fargo & Co. , 2024 WL 3579322, at *11 (N.D. \nCal. July 29, 2024)  (quoting In re LDK Solar Sec. Lit. , 584 F. Supp. 2d 1230, 1255 -56 (N.D. Cal. \n2008) ).11 \nC. Loss Causation  \nUnder the PSLRA, a plaintiff must show “loss causation.”  That is, they must show a \n“causal connection betwee n the deceptive acts that form the basis for the claim of securities fraud \nand the injury suffered by the plaintiff.”  In re Gilead , 536 F.3d at 1055  (internal quotation marks \nand citation omitted).  The misrepresentation need not be the “sole” cause of the loss, but it must \nbe a “substantial” one.  See id.   Typically, loss causation is shown through “corrective disclosures” \nthat reveal the truth to the market and “cause[ ] the company ’s stock price to drop and investors to \n \n11 Defendants allege that Plaintiffs have failed to allege scienter as to the Individual Defendants.  \nFor the reasons stated above, the Court cannot agree as to Zuckerberg, Clegg, Newton, and Davis.  \nSee Supra II(B).  However, Plaintiffs fail to plead with particularity that the remaining Individual \nDefendants – Mosseri, Bickert, Stone, Wehner, LeCun, Rosen, or Diwanji – made a false or \nmisleading statement with scienter.  See Veal v. Lendingclub Corp. , 2020 WL 3128909, at *15 \n(N.D. Cal. June 12, 2020), aff’d, 2021 WL 4281301 (9th Cir. Sept. 21, 2021)  (dismissing claims \nwhere the complaint “lumps all Defendants together with respect to the scienter allegations”).  \nAccordingly, the Court dismisses the Section 10(b) claim as to those Defendants.    \n Case 3:21-cv-08812-AMO     Document 143     Filed 09/30/24     Page 31 of 33 \n32 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  lose money.”  Lloyd , 811 F.3d at 1209 .  The test for loss causation “requires no more than the \nfamiliar test for proximate cause.”  Mineworkers ’ Pension Scheme v. First Solar Inc. , 881 F.3d \n750, 753 (9th Cir. 2018) (cit ation omitted ). \n Here, Plaintiffs have adequately alleged loss causation.  As to the cross -check  statements , \nPlaintiffs allege that disclosures on September 13, 21, and 28 and October 21, 2021, revealed \ninformation about cross -check that proximately caused Meta’s stock to decline.  FAC ¶¶ 279 -90, \n322-27, 333 -39, 514.   Defendants argue that they had previously made public statements about \ncross -check, so the disclosures were not “new.”  Mot. at 28 (citing FAC ¶¶ 90, 105 -06).  However, \nthe FAC alleges that those earlier “dis closures” were false or misleading .  See FAC ¶¶ 90, 105 -06.  \nThus, they did not disseminate knowledge to the market.  Moreover, proof that “news of the truth \ncredibly entered the market and dissipated the effects of prior misstatements” is an issue for trial \nor summary judgment.  Amgen Inc. v. Connecticut Ret. Plans & Tr. Funds , 568 U.S. 455, 482  \n(2013)  (citation and internal brackets omitted).  As to Instagram harming young users, Plaintiffs \nallege that disclosures on September 14 and 28 caused Meta’s stoc k price to fall nearly  $13 a \nshare .  FAC ¶¶ 291-301, 329-332, 334.   Further, on October 3, 2021, the Meta whistleblower \nidentified herself as the credible source of previously -disclosed information, and revealed \nadditional information about Facebook’s research findings, causing Meta’s stock to drop $16.78 \nper share.  FAC  ¶ 514.   “[A] stock price drop  [that]  comes immediately after the revelation of \nfraud can help to rule out alternative causes.” Mineworkers ’ Pension Scheme , 881 F.3d at 754.  \nThat is so here.  Plaintiffs have thus plausibl y alleged  that the disclosures about the broad \napplication of the cross -check policy and Instagram’s research on its harm to young users were at \nleast a substantial cause of the loss of value.   See In re QuantumScape , 580 F. Supp. 3d at 742. \nIII. SECTION 20(A) CLAIM  \nPlaintiffs also bring  a Section 20(a) claim against Defendants Zuckerberg, Wehner, Clegg, \nMosseri, Rosen, Stone, Davis, Newton, LeCun, Bickert, and Diwanji.  FAC ¶¶ 609 -616.  Under \nSection 20(a) of the Exchange Act, “certain ‘controlling’ individuals [are] also liable for violations \nof [S]ection 10(b) and its underlying regulations.”  Zucco Partners , 552 F.3d at 990 (citing 15 \nU.S.C. § 78t(a)).   Because a Section 20(a) claim is derivative, “a defendant employee of a Case 3:21-cv-08812-AMO     Document 143     Filed 09/30/24     Page 32 of 33 \n33 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  corporation who has violated the securities laws will be jointly and severally liable to the plaintiff, \nas long as the plaintiff demonstrates ‘a primary violation of federal securities law’ and that ‘the \ndefendant exercised actual power or control over the  primary violator.’ ” Id. (citation omitted).   \nPlaintiffs ’ allegations about Individual Defendants ’ “title and res ponsibilities ” are “sufficient to \nestablish control at the motion to dismiss stage. ”  Kyung Cho v. UCBH Holdings, Inc. , 890 F. \nSupp. 2d 1190, 1205 (N.D. Cal. 2012)  (citation omitted) (citing cases).  Because Lead Plaintiff's \nSection 20(a) claim rises and falls with its claim under Section 10(b), the claim is DISMISSED \nWITH LEAVE TO AMEND  to the same extent as the Section 10(b) claim.  The Section 20(a) \nclaim otherwise survives consistent with the Court ’s analysis of the viable portion of the Section \n10(b) claim.  See Zaidi v. Adamas Pharms., Inc. , 650 F. Supp. 3d 848, 865 (N.D. Cal. 2023).  \nCONCLUSION  \n Accordingly, the Court GRANTS in part and DENIES in part the motion to dismiss .  The \nCourt DISMISSES the claims based on Statements 19, 22, and 33 as a mat ter of law.  The Court \nDENIES the motion to dismiss the claims based on Statements 8 and 11 as to Defendants Meta, \nZuckerberg, and Clegg , and Statements 41, 43, 45 -48, and 51-56 as to Defendants Meta, \nZuckerberg, Newton, and Davis.   The Court DISMISSES with leave to amend  the claims based \non the remaining statements and as to the remaining Defendants.  If Plaintiffs elect to amend, a ny \namended complaint must be filed by October 30, 2024 .  No additional parties or claims may be \nadded without leave of Court or stipulation of Defendants.  \nIT IS SO ORDERED.  \nDated:  September 30, 2024  \n \n  \nARACELI MARTÍNEZ -OLGUÍN  \nUnited States District Judge  \n \nCase 3:21-cv-08812-AMO     Document 143     Filed 09/30/24     Page 33 of 33",

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: This case involves a shareholder derivative action brought against Stem, Inc. and its board members, challenging alleged misleading statements in the proxy materials related to a merger involving Stem, Inc. AI is pertinent because Stem offers AI-driven clean energy storage systems. The court granted the motion to dismiss all claims, including federal Section 14(a) securities claims, for failing to meet pleading standards and declined jurisdiction over state claims.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the plaintiffs have sufficiently pleaded claims under the federal securities laws and state law derivative claims, particularly concerning allegedly misleading statements in proxy materials.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court recommended dismissal of the federal securities claims for insufficient pleading under the PSLRA and Rule 8. The derivative state law claims were dismissed without prejudice, as the court opted not to exercise supplemental jurisdiction. A motion to intervene was denied as moot.\n\n4. **ELI5 explanation**: Imagine a company run by a team of people who manage its operations; they're supposed to tell the truth about the company's plans and actions because they have investors. Some investors thought the leaders didn't tell the whole truth about a business deal involving AI technology that makes energy storage better. The court said the investors didn't explain clearly enough how the company's statements were misleading or false, so the case couldn't move forward as is.",

BACKGROUND \nA. The Parties  \nStem is a Delaware corporation headquartered in San Francisco, California.  (D.I. 34 at ¶  \n44)  It offers artificial intelligence (“AI”) -driven clean energy storage systems ( e.g., batteries and \nrelated software and hardware) to its customers, which include commercial and industrial \nenterprises, independent power producers, renewable project developers and energy grid operators.  ( Id. at ¶  2)  Stem was formerly known as Star Peak Energy Transition Corp. (“Star \nPeak”); it is a successor by merger to legacy Stem, Inc. (“Legacy Stem”).  ( Id. at ¶¶ 1, 3, 8)  Star \nPeak was a special purpose acquisitio n company, “a publicly traded corporation with a two- year \nlife span formed with the sole purpose of effecting a merger . . . with a privately held business to enable it to go public.”  ( Id. at ¶  3) \nPlaintiffs are current shareholders of Stem Common Stock.  (D.I. 1 at ¶ ¶ 26, 27;  D.I. 34 at \n¶ 43)  Hanna facially alleges that she has held Stem common stock continuously and at all \nrelevant times  (i.e., from  December 4, 2020 through April 3, 2023) .  (D.I. 34 at ¶  43; see id . at ¶  \n1)  Gera has continuously held Stem common stock since purchasing it on February  23, 2021.  \n(D.I. 1 at ¶  26)  Bhavsar has held Stem common stock continuously since purchasing it on \nJanuary 29, 2021.  ( Id. at ¶  27)  The suit is filed  derivatively on behalf of Stem.  ( D.I. 34 at ¶ 1)   Case 1:23-cv-01011-MN     Document 73     Filed 01/31/25     Page 2 of 20 PageID #:\n<pageID>3 \n  Individual Defendant Sponsor  is a Delaware limited liability company that sponsored \nStar Peak.  ( Id. at ¶ 3)  The remaining Individual Defendants are current and former members of \nStem /Star Peak ’s Board of Directors  and/or executives at Stem /Star Peak .  (Id. at ¶ ¶ 45-98)   \nB. Factual Background  \nOn December 4 , 2020, Star Peak filed a  Form 8 -K with exhibits with the United States \nSecurities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), announcing it ha d entered an agreement to \nmerge with Legacy Stem .  (Id. at ¶  8)  The post -Merger entity was expected to be worth $1.35 \nbillion  and have $608 million in gross proceeds.  ( Id. at ¶¶ 8, 142)  Thereafter, Star Peak “filed a \nregistration statement in connection with the proposed M erger on December 17, 2020, on Form \nS-4 with the SEC (the ‘ Registration Statement’ ), followed by a joint prospectus and proxy \nstatement on Form 424B3 (the ‘ Merger Proxy, ’ and together with the Registration Statement, the \n‘Offering Documents ’).”  (Id. at ¶  8)  The Boards of Star Peak and Legacy Stem filed the Merger \nProxy on March 30, 2021, seeking  shareholder approval for the Merger and c ertain charter \nproposals , among other things.  ( Id. at ¶  23)  With shareholder approval, the companies merged \non April 28, 2021 (the “Merger”) .  (Id. at ¶¶ 8, 154)   Legacy Stem survived as a wholly owned \nsubsidiary of Star Peak, and Star Peak renamed itself “Stem, Inc.”  ( Id. at ¶ 154)  Stem then \nundertook the business operations of Legacy Stem.  ( Id.)   \nAdditional facts relevant to resolution of the instant M otions  will be discussed in Section \nIII.  \nC. Procedural Background  \nPlaintiffs’ allegations in this case rel ate in part to  allegation s in a related securities case:  \nIn re Stem, Inc. Sec . Litig ., Civil Action No. 3:23- cv-2329- MMC (N.D. Cal.  May 12, 2023) (the \n“Securities Action”).  The Securities Action is a class action lawsuit , which was initiated in the Case 1:23-cv-01011-MN     Document 73     Filed 01/31/25     Page 3 of 20 PageID #:\n<pageID>4 \n United States District Court for the Northern District of California (“Northern District of \nCalifornia”) on May 12, 2023 against Stem , Star Peak and  a group of the Individual Defendants .  \nIn re Stem, Inc. Sec. Litig., Civil Action No. 3:23- cv-2329- MMC , D.I. 1 (N.D. Cal. May 12, \n2023) .1  The claims in the Securities Action include alleged  violation s of Section  14(a)  (“Section \n14(a)”) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”)  and Rule 14a -9, violations  \nof Section  20(a) of the Exchange Act, violations  of Section  10(b) (“Section 10(b)”) of the \nExchange Act and Rule 10b- 5, and violations  of the Exchange Act for Insider Selling.  I d., D.I. \n87 at ¶¶ 378- 420 (N.D. Cal. Oct. 17, 2023) .  The defendants moved to dismiss all claims in the \nSecurities Action, and the Northern District of California granted the defendants ’ motion in its \nentirety.  Petersen v. Stem , Inc., Case No. 23- cv-02329- MMC, 2024 WL 4602710 (N.D. Cal. \nAug. 30, 2024) .  Thereafter, the plaintiffs filed a first  amended consolidated complaint .  In re \nStem, Inc. Sec. Litig., Civil Action No. 3:23- cv-2329- MMC, D.I. 127 (N.D. Cal.  Nov. 8, 2024).  \nThe defendants have  moved to dismiss all claims within the first amended consolidated \ncomplaint, and the Securities Action remains pending.  Id ., D.I. 128 (N.D. Cal. Dec. 20, 2024).  \nPlaintiffs Gera and Bhavsar began the instant lawsuit on August 26, 2023, via the filing \nof a complaint in the Northern District of California, brought on behalf of Stem and against \ncertain of the Defendants .  (D.I. 1)  Pursuant to the parties’ stipulation, the case was transferred \nto this Court on September 15, 2023.  (D.I. 20)   \nOn December 15, 2023, Plaintiff Hanna filed another derivative action  in this Court on \nbehalf of Stem against all Defendants  (the “Hanna Action”) .  (Civil Action No. 23- 1436- MN, \n \n1 The Securities Action was consolidated with related cases in the Northern District \nof California.   In re Stem, Inc. Sec.

(D.I. 32)  \nThe operative Complaint , which was then re -filed, (D.I. 34), asserts nine claim s:   \n● First Claim: Violation of Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act , 15 \nU.S.C. § 78n(a)(1) , and Rule 14a -9, 17 C.F.R. § 240.14a -9, \nAgainst Scheyer, Morgan, Wilds, Daley, Litowitz, Rogers and \nShaper , (id. at ¶¶ 456- 64); \n  ● Second C laim:  Breach of Fiduciary Duties A gainst Individual \nDefendants , (id. at ¶¶ 465- 77); \n  \n● Third C laim:  Unjust Enrichment  Against Individual Defendants, \n(id. at ¶¶ 478- 82); \n \n● Fourth C laim:  Abuse of Control Against Individual Defendants, \n(id. at ¶¶ 483- 86); \n ● Fifth Claim:   Gross Mismanagement Against Individual \nDefendants, ( id. at ¶¶ 487- 91); \n  \n● Sixth C laim:  Waste of Corporate Assets Against Individual \nDefendants, ( id. at ¶¶ 492- 97); \n  \n● Seventh C laim:  Contribution Under Section  10(b)  of the Exchange \nAct, 15 U.S.C. §§ 78j(b), and Section  21D (“Section 21D”) of the \nPrivate Securities Litigation Reform Act (“PSLRA”) ,\n2 15 U.S.C. § \n78u-4(f), Against Carrington, Bush, Scheyer, Wilds, Morgan, \nDaley, Litowitz, Rogers , Johnson, Patel, Russo, Ho and Shaper , \n(id. at ¶¶ 498- 502);  \n \n● Eighth C laim:  Contribution Under Section  21D of the PSLR A, 15 \nU.S.C. § 78u- 4(f), and Section  11(f) (“Section 11(f)”) of the \nSecurities Act of 1933 (the “Securities Act”), 15 U.S.C. § \n \n2 Plaintiffs assert a claim for contribution “[u]nder Section . . . 21D of the \nExchange Act[.]”  ( D.I. 34 at  175; see also id. at ¶¶  38, 501, 511)  However, the  statutory citation \nthat Plaintiffs utilize here is to Section 21D of the PSLRA , 15 U.S.C. § 78u -4(f), as t he PSLRA  \n“governs the application of any private right of action for contribution asserted pursuant to the Exchange Act [,]” Lemon Bay Partners LLP v.

(D.I. 34 at ¶  438)  Plaintiffs assert that any such demand would have been futile.  ( Id. \nat ¶¶ 437- 55)   \nOn April 1, 2024, Stem filed Stem’s  Motion to Dismiss , (D.I. 40) ; the Individual \nDefendants ’ Motion to Dismiss was filed o n the same day,  (D.I. 42).  Manetta filed the  Motion to \nIntervene on June 20, 2024.  (D.I. 48)  All of the Motions were fully briefed as of August 2, \n2024.  (D.I. 64)  The Motions were all referred to the Court for resolution by United States \nDistrict Judge Maryellen Noreika  on September 5, 2024.  (D.I. 70)   \nII. STANDARD OF REVIEW   \nPursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a), the complaint must set forth “ a short \nand plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief. ”  Fed. R. Civ. P. \n8(a)(2).  The allegations “must be simple, concise, and direct.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(d)(1).  \nWhen presented with a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, a \ncourt conducts a two -part analysis.  Fowler v. UPMC Shadyside , 578 F.3d 203, 210 (3d Cir. \n2009).  First, the court separates the factual and legal elements of a claim, accepting all of the complaint’s well- pleaded facts as true, but disregarding any legal conclusions.  Id.  at 210- 11.  \nSecond, the court determines whether the facts alleged in the complaint are sufficient to show that the plaintiff has a “plausible claim for  relief.”  Id. at 211 (quoting Ashcroft v. Iqbal , 556 U.S. \n662, 679 (2009)).  “A claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct Case 1:23-cv-01011-MN     Document 73     Filed 01/31/25     Page 6 of 20 PageID #:\n<pageID>7 \n alleged.”  Iqbal , 556 U.S. at 678.  In assessing the plausibility of a claim, the court must “accept \nall factual allegations as true, construe the complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, \nand determine whether, under any reasonable reading of the complaint, the plaintiff may be entitled to relief.”  Fowler , 578 F.3d at 210 (quoting Phillips v. Cnty. of Allegheny , 515 F.3d 224, \n233 (3d Cir. 2008)).  \nIII. DISCUSSION  \nWith their motion s, Stem and the Individual Defendants make various arguments for \ndismiss al; the Court will address certain of these arguments herein.  In doing so, it will segregate \nits analysis by addressing the three categories of claims in this action:  (1) the claims seeking contribution (i.e., the Seventh and Eighth Claims, or collectively , the “contribution claims”); (2) \nthe First Claim, which alleges violation of Section 14(a) (the “Section 14(a) claim” and together with the contribution claims, the “ federal claims” ); and (3) the claims founded in state law  (i.e., \nthe Second, Third, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth and Ninth Claims,  or collectively , the “state law \nclaims”) .\n3  Thereafter, the Court will discuss the Motion to Intervene.   \nA. Contribution Claims  \n \nThe Seventh and Eighth Claims both seek contribution from certain Defendants who are \nalso named in the Securities Action.   (D.I. 34 at ¶¶  498-512)  As was noted above, these two \nclaims are brought pursuant to Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act, Section 21D of the PSLRA \nand Section 11(f) of the Securities Act.  ( Id.)  In arguing for dismissal, Stem  asserts that the se \ncontribution claims should be dismissed as unripe.  (D.I. 41 at 6- 7)   \n \n3 The Court addresses Stem’s and the Individual Defendants’ motions together, in \nlight of the cohesive nature of the briefing and the parties’ frequent cross -referencing of \narguments made therein.  ( See D.I. 41 at 18, 19; D.I. 43 at 1, 2; D.I. 49 at 3 n.4, 17 n.13; D.I. 50 \nat 15) \n Case 1:23-cv-01011-MN     Document 73     Filed 01/31/25     Page 7 of 20 PageID #:\n<pageID>8 \n In their answering brief, Plaintiffs did not address Stem’s argument.  (D.I. 49 at 5-9; see \nD.I. 61 at 2  (Stem noting Plaintiffs’ lack of response) )  As a result, Plaintiffs  have forfeited or \nwaived any argument that the contribution claims are ripe and should not be dismissed.  See e.g. , \nTurner v. Lam Rsch. Corp., Civil Action No . 23-435-CJB, 2024 WL 4766208, at *4 (D. Del. \nNov. 13, 2024) ; Jackson v. NuVasive, Inc., Civil Action No. CV 21-53-RGA, 2023 WL \n6387866, at *2 (D. Del. Sept. 29, 2023) ; vMedex, Inc. v. TDS Operating, Inc., C.A.  No. 18-1662 \n(MN), 2020 WL 4925512, at *7 (D. Del. Aug. 21, 2020).4  For this reason, the Court \nrecommends that the Seventh and Eighth Claims be dismissed  with prejudice.   \nB. Section 14(a) Claim \nThe First Claim asserts a negligence- based claim under Section 14(a) of the Exchange \nAct5 against Scheyer, Morgan, Wilds, Daley, Litowitz, Rogers and Shaper.  (D.I. 34 at ¶¶  456-\n64)  “Section 14(a), and Rule 14a-9 promulgated thereunder, prohibit a corporation from issuing \na proxy ‘containing any statement which . . . is false or misleading with respect to any material \n \n4  The Court also notes that, even absent waiver or forfeiture here, it appears that \nStem’s argument regarding lack of ripeness would have been  correct  on the merits .  See, e.g., \nDiBattista v. Greco , Civil Action No. 20-590-RGA, 2021 WL 327399, at *7 (D. Del. Jan. 31, \n2021) (citing cases) ; (D.I. 41 at 6- 7). \n \n5 Section 14(a) claims may sound either in fraud or negligence (or both).  Cal. Pub. \nEmp.s’ Ret. Sys. v. Chubb Corp., 394 F.3d 126, 160 (3d Cir. 2004) ; Gould v. Am. -Hawaiian S. S. \nCo., 535 F.2d 761, 777 (3d Cir. 1976) .  Plaintiffs state  that the First Claim does not sound in \nfraud, and they do not disagree with Defendants’ position that the claims sound in negligence.  \n(D.I. 50 at 9 n.6)  Because the First Claim alleges that “[i]n the exercise of reasonable care, the Individual Defendants should have known that . . . the statements . . . were materially false and misleading[,]” (D.I. 34 at ¶ 460), the Court agrees  that the claim should be treated a s sounding in \nnegligence, s ee Smith ex rel. Zion Oil & Gas, Inc. v. Carrillo, Civil Action No. 18-1399- RGA, \n2019 WL 6328033, at *7-8 (D. Del. Nov. 26, 2019) (observing that the plaintiff “allege[d] that Defendants ‘should have known’ that ‘the statements’ in the proxy statement were ‘materially false and misleading’” and noting that the Section 14(a) claim s in the pleading were alleged to be \nsolely based on negligence ). \n Case 1:23-cv-01011-MN     Document 73     Filed 01/31/25     Page 8 of 20 PageID #:\n<pageID>9 \n fact, or which omits to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein \nnot false or misleading.’”  Kiger v. Mollenkopf , Civ. No. 21- 409-RGA, 2021 WL 5299581, at *2 \n(D. Del. Nov. 15, 2021)  (quoting 17 C.F.R. § 240.14a -9(a)) (citing 15 U.S.C. § 78n(a)(1)) .  To \nadequately state a Section 14(a) claim, the c omplaint must allege: “(1) a proxy statement \ncontained a material misrepresentation or omission which (2) caused the plaintiff injury and (3) that the proxy solicitation itself, rather than the particular defect in the solicitation materials, was an essent ial link in the accomplishment of the transaction.”   Tracinda Corp. v. DaimlerChrysler \nAG, 502 F.3d 212, 228 (3d Cir. 2007)  (internal quotation marks omitted ); see also Garfield v. \nShutterfly, Inc., 857 F. App’x 71, 74 (3d Cir. 2021) ; In re Keryx Biopharm s., Inc. , 454 F. Supp. \n3d 407, 412 (D. Del. 2020) ; City of Detroit Police & Fire Ret. Sys. v. Hamrock , C.A. No. 20-\n577-LPS, 2021 WL 877720, at *5 (D. Del. Mar. 9, 2021) . \nAs an initial matter, the parties dis pute whether the heightened pleading requirements of \nthe PSLRA extend to Plaintiffs ’ Section 14(a) claim  premised upon negligence.  (D.I. 43 at 2, 8; \nD.I. 49 at 9 & n.6)   The United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit has yet to decide \n“whether Section 14(a) claims pled in terms of negligence are subject to Rule 9(b) or PS LRA \nparticularity requirements.”   Jaroslawicz v. M&T Bank Corp., Civil Action No.  15-897-RGA, \n2017 WL 1197716, at *3  (D. Del. Mar. 30, 2017) ; see also Jaroslawicz v.

Jan. 27, 2022) .   \nHerein, the Court will assess the First Claim’s allegations by requiring that they meet \nRule 9(b)’s and the PSLRA’s heightened pleading requirements .  There is no question that since \nPlaintiffs allege that “the statements contained in the Merger Proxy were materially false and misleading [,]” albeit negligently, (D.I. 34 at ¶  460), Plaintiffs’ Section 14(a) claim is subject to Case 1:23-cv-01011-MN     Document 73     Filed 01/31/25     Page 9 of 20 PageID #:\n<pageID>10 \n the PSLRA.

Feb. 26, 2021); see also  Resnik v. Woertz , 774 F. Supp. 2d 614, 630 (D. Del. 2011); In \nre Keryx Biopharms ., 454 F. Supp. 3d at 412; Schaper v. LENSAR, Inc., C.A. No. 23- 692-JLH, \n2024 WL 4817656, at *2  (D. Del. Nov. 18, 2024) .  And t he text of Section 78u- 4(b)(1) of the \nPSLRA states that :  \nIn any private action arising under this chapter in which the \nplaintiff alleges  that the defendant –  \n (A) m ade an untrue statement of a material fact; or  \n (B) omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances in which they were made, not misleading;  \n the complaint shall specify each statement alleged to have been misleading, the reason or reasons why the statement is misleading, and, if an allegation regarding the statement or omission is made on information and belief, the complaint shall state with \nparticularity all facts on which that belief is formed.  \n 15 U.S.C. § 78u- 4(b)(1).   The statute is unambiguous; the heightened pleading requirement \n“applies ‘ [i]n any  private action arising under’ the Exchange Act.”  Kooker ex rel.  Hecla Mining \nCo. v. Baker , 497 F. Supp. 3d 1, 6 (D. Del. 2020)  (quoting 15 U.S.C. § 78u -4(b)(1)) (emphasis in \noriginal) ; see also  Wayne Cnty. Emp.s’  Ret. Sys. v.

The refore, Section 78u- 4(b)(1) \nextend s Rule 9(b)’s requirements to Section 14(a) claims , like this one, that relate to the making \nof misleading statements .  And i n light of this, to plead their Section 14(a) claim , Plaintiffs must \n“set fort h the details of allegedly fraudulent statements or omissions, including who was Case 1:23-cv-01011-MN     Document 73     Filed 01/31/25     Page 10 of 20 PageID #:\n<pageID>11 \n involved, where the events took place, when the events took place, and why any statements were \nmisleading .”  In re Rockefeller Ctr. Props ., Inc. Sec. Litig., 311 F.3d 198, 217 (3d Cir. 2002) ; see \nalso City of Southfield Fire & Police Ret. Sys. v. Hayward Holdings, Inc., Civ. No. 2:23- CV-\n04146 (WJM), 2024 WL 4370833, at *6 (D.N.J. Oct. 2, 2024) ; see In re Wilmington Tr. Sec. \nLitig. , 852 F. Supp. 2d 477, 489 (D. Del. 2012) .   \nFrom there , the Court turns to the Individual Defendants ’ arguments as to why the First \nClaim should be dismissed.  (D.I. 43 at 2-10)  The Court need only address the firs t of those \narguments, as it is fundamental, and it impacts the scope of the entire claim  in many ways .   \nThis first argument implicates not only Section 78u- 4(b)(1)’s requirement that PSLRA \npleaders must  “specify each statement alleged to have been misleading, [and] the reason or \nreasons why the statement is misleading ,” but also a claimant’s basic pleading obligations even \nunder Rule 8.  A c laimant run s afoul of both of th ese pleading requirements  if its complaint  does \n“not easily provide a one -to-one connection between [assertedly] misleading statements  [on the \none hand] and the reasons why the statements are [said to be] misleading” on the other hand.  Gera v. Palihapitiya, No. CV -23-02164- PHX- MTL, 2024 WL 3818602, at *4 (D. Ariz. Aug. 14, \n2024) .  Such complaints are “commonly referred to as puzzle pleadings because, like loose \npieces of a jigsaw puzzle, the r eader must actively put together random allegations of misleading \nstatements and other elements to form the basis of a claim.”   Id.; see also In  re Honeywell Int ’l, \nInc. Sec. Litig., 182 F. Supp. 2d 414, 416, 426 (D.N.J. 2002) .   \nGenerally, a puzzle pleading is one that “ recite[s] lengthy statements attributed to the \ndefendants, followed by a generalized list of reasons that the statements may have been false or misleading  or a generalized list of omissions that were required to make the statement not \nmisleading.”  Tarapara v. K12 Inc., Case No. 16- cv-4069- PJH, 2017 WL 3727112, at *9 (N.D. Case 1:23-cv-01011-MN     Document 73     Filed 01/31/25     Page 11 of 20 PageID #:\n<pageID>12 \n Cal. Aug. 30, 2017) ; see also  City of Southfield Fire & Police Ret. Sys. , 2024 WL 4370833, at \n*7.  To avoid improper puzzle pleading, allegations of false or misleading statements must be \naccompanied , e.g., “by pleading[] of specific facts indicating why those statement[s] were false[  \nor misleading .]”  Petersen , 2024 WL 4602710, at *4 ( internal quotation marks and citations \nomitted) ; see also In re Wilmington Tr. Sec. Litig., 852 F. Supp. 2d at 490.  Complaints that \nengage in  puzzle pleading are routinely dismissed for failure  to set out  their allegations with \nsufficient particularity.  Petersen , 2024 WL 4602710, at *4; Gera , 2024 WL 3818602, at *4.  \n The Individual Defendants argue that Plaintiffs have in fact engaged in impermissible \npuzzle pleading here.   (D.I. 43 at 2- 3)6  They say this is so because , inter alia :  (1) Plaintiffs do \nnot always identify which potions of the alleged misstatements at issue are supposedly false or misleading ; and (2) the Complaint tends to set out various  paragraphs including certain \nstatements , and then follow that up with a single paragraph asserting that these alleged \nstatements  were in some way false or misleading for any one of several r easons.  ( Id.)   \n Plaintiffs , for their part,  deny that they have engaged in puzzle pleading.  In explaining \nwhy not, they direct the Court to the allegations in paragraphs 217 to 244 of the Complaint, which are the allegations that describe the content of the relevant Merger Proxy.  (D.I. 50 at 10-11 (citing D.I. 34 at ¶¶ 217- 44))  Plaintiffs argue that “[u]nder a clearly -delineated sub -heading \nin the Complaint, Plaintiffs detail the alleged statements and omissions in the Merger Proxy that rendered it materially false or misleading and describe precisely wh y this was the case.”  ( Id.; see \nalso id. at 2 (“Far from a ‘puzzle’ pleading, the Complaint describes the Merger Proxy in detail and outlines exactly which portions of the Merger Proxy were materially false and misleading.”))   \n \n6  The Co urt notes Stem also raise s this argument in its briefing.  (D.I. 41 at 18)  Case 1:23-cv-01011-MN     Document 73     Filed 01/31/25     Page 12 of 20 PageID #:\n<pageID>13 \n  Plaintiffs’ Complaint—including the 28 paragraphs that describe the Merger Proxy (the \n“Merger Proxy paragraphs”) —surely is a puzzle.  And th e 28 paragraphs that Plaintiffs point the \nCourt to most certainly do not “detail” the alleged materially false or misleading statements at \nissue and “describe precisely  why this was the case. ”  Instead, they (and the Complaint  more \nbroadly)  leave the  reader  well confused on these fronts . \nThe Merger Proxy paragraphs begin by explaining how the Merger Proxy was filed in \nMarch 2021 pursuant to Section 14(a), and how it called for shareholders to take a number of actions, including to :  (1) consider and vote to approve the  proposed merger with Legacy Stem; \n(2) consider and vote on certain charter proposals; (3) consider and vote on a proposal to approve issuance of certain shares on the New York Stock Exchange; and (4) approve an incentive plan proposal.  (D.I. 34 at ¶¶ 217- 21)  Then the Merger Proxy paragraphs list out various statements \nmade in the Merger Proxy —a least 17 different statements in all, many of which are set out in \nvery lengthy block quotes .  (Id. at ¶¶ 222 -38)  Sometimes, the se quoted portions of the Merger \nProxy i nclude certain material that is bolded and italicized, suggesting that the pleader considers \nthem to be particularly important .  (See, e.g., id. at ¶¶ 222- 32)  Yet nowhere in these paragraphs , \nor in the paragraphs following them, does the Complaint explain why  it has bolded and italicized \nany such content, or why  it is that these bolded or  italicized portions are said in some way to \nrelate to any alleged misstatements or omissions at issue.  ( Id.); see also  City of Southfield Fire \n& Police Ret. Sys. , 2024 WL 4370833, at *7 (“At the outset, the Court notes that many of the \nfalse and misleading statements alleged in the [complaint] are lengthy block quotes that are at places highlighted with bold and italics.  This formatting leaves the Court and Defendants to guess whether Plaintiff is claiming that only the highlighted portions are actionable misstatements or the highlighting is merely for emphasis and the entire paragraph is false or Case 1:23-cv-01011-MN     Document 73     Filed 01/31/25     Page 13 of 20 PageID #:\n<pageID>14 \n misleading.”) ; Lauria v. Biosante Pharms., Inc., 968 F. Supp. 2d 951, 957- 59 (N.D. Ill. 2013)  \n(same).   Moreover, the various block quotes are often repetitive .  In a number of them, the same \nmaterial is excerpted that had previously been excerpted  in a prior paragraph , but now with \ndifferent portions of that  material being highlighted for emphasis .  (See, e.g.,  D.I. 34 at ¶¶ 227, \n229, 231, 232, 237, 238)  And this all happens with no acknowledgement that such  repetition is \noccurring, nor with any explanation as to what the pleader is trying to convey by doing this .  \nAdditionally , the Complaint makes no effort to place any of the alleged false or misleading  \nstatements into understandable categories that might otherwise assist the reader .  See  Lord Abbett \nAffiliated Fund , Inc. v. Navient Corp., Civ. No. 16- 112-GMS CONSOLIDATED, 2017 WL \n3891676, at *3 (D. Del. Sept. 6, 2017). \nThen the Merger Proxy p aragraphs seem to try to sum up in one paragraph —paragraph \n239—by simply referring back to all of the quoted material that came before it, and asserting \ngenerally  that th is material shows that the Merger P roxy was : \n[M]aterially false and misleading because it created a false \nimpression of Legacy Stem’s business, operations, and prospects and, relatedly the value of the Company’s investment and future post-Merger .  The Merger Proxy failed to disclose, inter alia : (1) \nLegacy Stem’s business and competitive standing were overstated, particularly concerning its strategic partnerships and revenues tied to its software; [and]  (2) the post -Merger Company’s business and \nfinancial prospects were also exaggerated.   \n \n(Id. at ¶ 239)  But in this paragraph, t he Complaint never clearly explains what it is talking about.  \nIt does not specify wh at “business, operations and prospects” or “value  of . . . investment and \nfuture post -Merger” or “business and competitive standing” or “ strategic partnerships and Case 1:23-cv-01011-MN     Document 73     Filed 01/31/25     Page 14 of 20 PageID #:\n<pageID>15 \n revenues”- type information it is speaking to.7  And  to the extent the pleading is asserting that \nportions of the previously- referenced block quotes give off one of the types of “false \nimpression[s]” at issue, it never indicates which  portions it is referring to, or why  that is so .  See \nCity of Southfield Fire & Police Ret. Sys. , 2024 WL 4370833, at *7 (“[I]n addition to lack of \nclarity regarding which  statements are purportedly actionable, it is also unclear why  each \nstatement is false or misleading.”) (emphasis in original).8  The additional allegations found in \nthe body of the First Claim itself  are no different.  ( See, e.g., id. at ¶¶ 459 -60) \nIt should go without saying that the Court and Defendants “ should not have to play \nconnect -the-dots in order to identify the facts and trends upon which plaintiffs base their claim .”  \nLord Abbett , 2017 WL 3891676, at *3.9  And yet that is what the Plaintiffs’ allegations regarding \n \n7  To the extent those references are meant to relate to other content in the 519 -\nparagraph Complaint, the Complaint’s allegations need to make clear  what is being referred to.  \nAnd they do not . \n \n8  Just by way of example, in the Merger Proxy paragraphs, the Complaint includes \nthe following bolded and italicized statement (contained in a larger block of text):  “Stem \nenables consumers and partners to optimize energy use  by switching between  battery power, \nonsite generation and grid power.”  (D.I. 34 at ¶ 228 (emphasis in original))  Is this statement alleged to be “materially false and misleading”?  If so, why?  Is the allegation that this statement has something to do with creating “a false impression of Legacy Stem’s business, operations, and prospects and, relatedly the value of the Company’s investment and future post -Merger”?  ( Id. at  \n¶ 239)  If so, how?  Or does it relate to the assertion about how the proxy overstated “Legacy Stem’s business and competitive standing” or exaggerated its “business and financial prospects”?  (Id.)  Or is it there for some other reason?  Is its falsity related to other allegations in some other \nportion of the pleading?  The reader (and more importantly Defendants) are never told.   \n \n9  See also Constr. Workers Pension Fund- Lake Cnty. & Vicinity v.

Pac. Biosciences of Cal ., Inc., 940 F. Supp. 2d 1105, 1112 (N.D.

Thus, the Complaint’s  failure to set out its \nallegations with clarity and specificity amounts to improper puzzle pleading, and lacks the detail \nrequired by both the PSLRA and Rule 8.  See Gera , 2024 WL 3818602, at *12 (holding the \nplaintiff’s assertion that block quotes from proxy statements were false or misleading “because they led investors to believe that the Individual Defendants followed [the company’s]  code of \nconduct and performed their role in risk oversight, and because the statements failed to disclose certain information regarding [the company’s]  technology, potential unprofitability, past \nbusiness practices, and merger ” was too vague of an explanation to satisfy PSLRA’s particularity \nrequirement and Rule 8(a); the plaintiff needed to “ identify the exact portions of the quotes that \ndo any of these things and explain—in detail and with specificity —how they do so”) ; In re \nAstraZeneca PLC  Sec.

Sept. 12, \n2022)  (holding that, rather than demonstrating how and why each statement  was materially false \nor misleading, the amended complaint  was a puzzle pleading that  “in boilerplate fashion, . . . \nidentifies statements through the class period, italicizes t hem within long block quotes, and then, \nafter each one, repeats a copy -and-pasted list of omissions”) , aff’d sub nom. 2023 WL 3477164, \nat *6  (2d Cir.

Therefore, the Court recommends th at the Individual Defendants’ \nMotion to D ismiss the First Claim be granted for  failure to comply with the PSLRA ’s heightened \npleading requirements (and indeed, with even Rule 8’s requirements) .   \nPlaintiffs ask that if the motions are granted as to the First Claim, that they be permitted \nleave to amend.  (D.I. 50 at 19- 20)  Because the Court cannot say for sure that Plaintiff s could \nnot plead a viable Section 14(a) claim at this stage, and in light of Federal Rule  of Civil \nProcedure  15’s admonition that leave to amend should be freely permitted “when justice so \nrequires[,]” Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a)(2), the Court recommends that dismissal of the First Claim b e \nwithout prejudice.  \nC. State Law Claims  \nPlaintiffs’ remaining claims are all based in Delaware state law.  (D.I. 34 at ¶¶ 465- 97, \n513-19)  The Court has discretion as to whether to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the \nstate law claims.  See  28 U.S.C. § 1367(a) ; City of Detroit Police & Fire Ret. Sys. , 2021 WL \n877720, at *7.  Where the plaintiff’s federal claims have been dismissed, t he district court “‘ must  \ndecline’ to exercise supplemental jurisdiction . . . ‘unless considerations of judicial economy, \nconvenience, and fairness to the parties provide an affirmative reason for doing so.’”  Stone v. Martin , 720 F. App’ x 132, 136 (3d Cir. 2017)  (citation omitted) (emphasis in original) .   \nPlaintiffs have not articulated an understandable  basis  as to why th is Court should retain \njurisdiction over the state law claims if the federal claims (i.e., the F irst, Seventh and Eighth \nClaims ) are dismissed.  ( See D.I. 49 at 6; D.I. 50 at 19; D.I. 61 at 4)   Because the Court \nrecommends dismissal of all federal claims, it also recommends that the Court decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over Plaintiffs ’ state law claims  and dismiss those claims .  See Case 1:23-cv-01011-MN     Document 73     Filed 01/31/25     Page 17 of 20 PageID #:\n<pageID>18 \n Mack v. Resolute Energy Corp., Civil Action No. 19- 77-RGA, 2020 WL 1286175, at *14 (D. \nDel.

June 8, 2022), report and \nrecommendation adopted sub nom., 2022 WL 3099235 (D. Del. June 23, 2022).10  \nTherefore, t he Court recommends dismissal of the state law claims (i.e., the Second, \nThird, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth and Ninth Claims ) on this basis  without prejudice .11  \nD. Motion to Intervene  \nAfter Defendants filed their respective m otions, Manetta filed his Motion to Intervene.  \n(D.I. 48)  In that Motion, Manetta explains that he is investigating whether to bring derivative \nclaims on behalf of Stem (claims as to which he served an inspection demand pursuant to 8 Del. C. § 220, or “Section 220” ), and that  he seeks to  permissively intervene for the limited purpose \nof:  (1) seeking a stay of this action while he pursues his Section 220 demand; or (2) limiting the \n \n10  To the extent Plaintiffs argue that Defendants have “waived” the right to assert \nthat the Court should decline to exercise jurisdiction over the state law claims  (if the Court \ndetermines that the federal claims should be dismissed), (D.I. 50 at 19), the Court disagrees.  \nStem  noted in its  briefing that i f the federal claims were dismissed , the Court could always \ndecline to exercise jurisdiction over the state law claims.  (D.I. 41 at 1)  And in any event, the \ndecision as to whether to exercise supplemental jurisdiction is one for the Court to make. \n \n11   The Court notes that Stem also argues  that, inter alia , the state law claims should \nnot proceed in this C ourt due to the presence of a forum selection clause in Stem’s certificate of \nincorporation that directs that such claims be brought in the Delaware Court of Chancery.  ( D.I. \n41 at 8- 9; D.I. 61 at 3- 4; see also  D.I. 44, ex. 25 at Art. XI § 11.1)   Plaintiffs’ primary response \nto this is that Defendants waived the right to make this argument as part of Defendants’  \nagreement that this case should be transferred to this Court from the Northern District of California.  (D.I. 49 at 5- 6)  In light of the Court’s recommended resolution above, the Court \nneed not reach this issue.  \n Case 1:23-cv-01011-MN     Document 73     Filed 01/31/25     Page 18 of 20 PageID #:\n<pageID>19 \n collateral estoppel effect of any potential adverse ruling on Defendants’ motions to dismiss to the \nnamed Plaintiffs  only ( and not to him) .  (D.I. 48 -1 at 1-3)  The Court notes that the impetus for \nthe Motion to Intervene is Manetta’s concern that if the Court issues an “adverse ruling on [the issue of] demand futility[,]” he wi ll “likely [be] precluded from relitigating an adverse ruling on” \nthat issue.  (D.I. 48- 1 at 8; see also id . at 7 ; D.I. 57 at 14; D.I. 64 at 3, 7- 8)  However, herein, the \nCourt has not ruled on demand futility; therefore, no decision herein could be given preclusive \neffect on those grounds.  See Drulias v. Guthrie , Case No. 2: 19-cv-01636- SVW -AGR, 2019 WL \n13240415, at *6 (C.D. Cal. Oct. 23, 2019) .  For this reason, the Court recommends that the \nMotion to Intervene be denied as moot.  Id.  \nIV. CONCLUSION For the reasons stated above, the Court recommends  that the Individual Defendants ’ \nMotion to Dismiss be GRANTED without prejudice as to the First Claim.  It recommends  that \nStem’s Motion to Dismiss be GRANTED as to the Second through Ninth Claims, in that the \nCourt grant that motion as to the Seventh and Eighth Claims with prejudice, and grant the motion as to the state law claims without prejudice ( i.e., by declin ing to exercise jurisdiction over the \nstate law claims where no federal claim has been success fully pleaded ).\n12  Additionally, the \nCourt recommends  that the Motion to Intervene  be DENIED as MOOT.  \nThis Report and Recommendation is filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1)(B), Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 72(b)(1), and D. Del. LR 72.1.  The parties may serve and file specific written objections within fourteen (14) days after being served with a copy of this Report and Recommendation.  \n \n12  In light of the nature of the Court’s recommended resolution here, the Court need \nnot address at this time Stem or the Individual Defendants’ other arguments as to why the claims \nshould be dismissed. \n Case 1:23-cv-01011-MN     Document 73     Filed 01/31/25     Page 19 of 20 PageID #:\n<pageID>20 \n Fed.

    "summary": "**1. Summary:**\nIn this case, plaintiffs Daniel and Samuel Gilk claim that the defendants conspired to misappropriate trade secrets and business opportunities belonging to their company, Fly Boatworks, LLC. The plaintiffs allege that the defendants, former colleagues and investors, formed a rival company, Axocon, to usurp a lucrative contract with Martac Corp., a deal involving integration of artificial intelligence, drone technology, and their boat design, the F2 Carbon. The court found in favor of the plaintiffs, granting their request for a preliminary injunction to prevent the defendants from further pursuing the contract and using Fly Boatworks' trade secrets.\n\n**2. Key Legal Issue:**\nThe key legal issue in this case is whether the defendants misappropriated trade secrets and business opportunities belonging to Fly Boatworks, LLC, and whether the plaintiffs are entitled to injunctive relief to prevent further use and disclosure of these trade secrets.\n\n**3. Court's Holding:**\nThe court granted the plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction upon determining that they have a likelihood of success on the merits and face irreparable harm without the injunction. Conversely, the court denied the defendants' motion for injunctive relief as they did not demonstrate a likelihood of success or irreparable harm.\n\n**4. ELI5 Explanation:**\nImagine you and your friend made a super cool boat and had a planned deal with a company that uses smart technology. Your other friends, who you trusted with your design, secretly tried to steal your customer by starting their own company and offering them a similar product. You went to court to stop them from doing this, and the judge agreed with you. The judge told your friends they can’t use your idea or take deals meant for you, and they must stick to rules you all agreed on before.",

The Gilks seek a temporary restraining order (“TRO”) \nand preliminary injunction enjoining this conduct.   \nDefendants also seek a TRO and preliminary injunction because they allege \nthat the Gilks (and their counsel) illegally hacked into Defendant Fisher’s email \naccount and stole confidential information, including attorney -client privileged \ncommunications.   \nBecause the Gilks have demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits \nand irreparable harm, the Court will grant the Gilks’ motion for preliminary \ninjunction.  In contrast, because Defendants have demonstrated neither a \nlikelihood of success on the mer its nor irreparable harm, the Court will deny \nDefendants’ motion for preliminary injunction.  \nBACKGROUND  \nI. FACTS  \nThe Gilks founded Fly Boatworks in 2012 to build and sell skiff boats.  (Am. Compl. \n¶ 15, June 10, 2025, Docket No. 40.)  Beginning in 2019, the Gilks  began working with \nFisher to create a new skiff model, the F2 Carbon.  (Id. ¶ 16.)  Over the next two years, \nthe Gilks and Fisher collaborated to develop the F2 Carbon which included inventing ten \nprimary components and the F2 Carbon manufacturing molds.  (Id.  ¶ 18.)  In 2021, Fisher, \nGalt, and Baker (collectively, “Individual Defendants”) invested in Fly Boatworks and entered into the Fly Boatworks Operating Agreement (“Operating Agreement”) with the \nGilks.  ( Id. ¶ 22.)  Pursuant to the Operating Agreemen t, Daniel Gilk, Samuel Gilk, and CASE 0:25-cv-02158-JRT-LIB     Doc. 61     Filed 07/11/25     Page 2 of 26-3- \n Fisher each own 22.22% of Fly Boatworks, while Galt and Baker each own 16.67%.  ( Id. ¶ \n23.)  The Gilks were responsible for engineering duties.  ( Id. ¶ 31.)  Fisher conducted \ndevelopment operations and financial management and sales.  ( Id. ¶ 32.)  Galt and Baker \nacted as silent investors.  (Id. ¶ 33.)      \nThe Gilks concede that Fisher contributed to the development of the F2 C arbon by \nproviding broad visions but maintain that the specific design work was performed by the \nGilks.  ( Id. ¶ 17.)  The Gilks claim to be the primary creators of, among others, “the specific \ndesign method which allowed the jet pump integration with the hull . . .  , the specifically \nshaped hull and stern design . . .  , the internally -actuated trim tab design[, and] the cap \n(or deck) assembly . . .  .”  (Id. ¶ 19.)  The Gilks further con tend that their contributions are \nwhat make the F2 Carbon a revolutionary product.  ( Id. ¶ 20.)  \nDevelopment of the F2 Carbon continued for several years.  By the end of 2022, \nthe first F2 Carbon prototype had been built and initial testing and marketing began.  ( Id. \n¶ 36.)  Over the next two years, the Gilks continued to revise and refine the F2 Carbon.  (Id. ¶ 37.)  During that time, the Gilks built and delivered four F2 Carbons to consumers.  \n(Id. ¶ 38.)  Without a means to manufacture the F2 Carbons, the Gilks built each F2 Carbon \nin house.  ( Id.)   \nFly Boatworks began negotiations with Martac in October 2024.  ( Id. ¶ 40.)  Fly \nBoatworks and Martac worked together to integrate the F2 Carbon components into CASE 0:25-cv-02158-JRT-LIB     Doc. 61     Filed 07/11/25     Page 3 of 26-4- \n Martac’s M18.1  (Id. ¶ 43.)  The Gilks allege that they developed and designed all of the \nnew components for the M18.  ( Id.)   \nIn December 2024, Fisher sent a proposal, on behalf of Fly Boatworks, to Martac \noffering to “develop, produce, and deliver the best jet -driven Hyper skiff on the market, \ndesigned to Martac’s specifications.” ( Id. ¶¶ 44 –45.)  The M18 product would integrate \nMartac’s unmanned, artificial intelligence, and drone technology and rapidly scale up \nproduction utilizing Martac’s global and military connections.  (Id.  ¶ 46.)  The projected \nprofit from this partnership was $23 million annually.  (Id. ¶ 51.)  \nThe Gilks allege that when the M18 design was finalized to meet Martac’s needs, \nthe Individual Defendants formed Axocon and began negotiating with Martac on behalf \nof Axocon instead of Fly Boatworks.  ( Id. ¶¶ 53, 57– 58.)  The Gilks allege, however, that \nFisher continues to request M18 engineering services from the Gilks.  ( Id. ¶ 59.)   \nThe Gilks argue that the Individual Defendants have created several businesses to \nfurther their theft of Fly Boatworks’ business opportunities .  Axocon was formed after Fly \nBoatworks began negotiations with Martac and is equally owned by all three Individual \nDefendants.  (Id.  ¶ 60.)  Fisher created Marine Aerospace Composites LLC (“MASC”) \nallegedly to secure the manufacturing contract with Martac.  (Id. ¶ 61; Decl. of Daniel Gilk \n(“D. Gilk Decl.”) ¶¶ 31– 32, Ex. H, May 20, 2025, Docket No. 11.)  Galt is believed to own \n \n \n1 The products are referred to as both M18 and M19 but are used by the parties \ninterchangeably.   (See Compl. ¶ 47.)  For clarity, the Court will exclusively use M18.  CASE 0:25-cv-02158-JRT-LIB     Doc. 61     Filed 07/11/25     Page 4 of 26-5- \n Oversight Resources, LLC (“Oversight”), which has received several invoices from MASC \nrelated to the construction of the M18 mold.  (Am. Compl.  ¶ 62; D. Gilk Decl. ¶ 34.)    \nThe Gilks allege significant clandestine behavior by the Individual Defendants to \nsteal Fly Boatworks’ business opportunities.  Fisher allegedly sent many outstanding bills \nto Oversight , described paying those bills out of his own pocket to “avoid tracking ,” and \ndirected payments to personal accounts.  (Am. Compl.  ¶¶ 63 –64, 83 –84.)  Fisher has also \nallegedly filed a patent application on behalf of Axocon that names himself, Galt , and \nBaker as inventors and incorporates the Gilks ’ and Fly Boatworks’ inventio ns.  ( Id. ¶¶ 65 –\n70.)  The Gilks  cite to communications about entering into an exclusive contract between \nAxocon and Martac and removing any Fly Boatworks’ branding.  ( Id. ¶¶ 89 –95. 96– 97.)  \nThe Gilks further allege that the Individual Defendants have used Axocon as an alter ego \nof Fly Boatworks to  defraud the Gilks.  ( Id. ¶¶ 105, 112.)    \nAs part of the overall conspiracy, the Gilks allege that the Individual Defendants’ \nconduct  intended to force the dissolution of Fly Boatworks.  The Gilks cite to a draft email \nfrom Galt to Fisher and Baker, intended to be sent to the Gilks, that claims that Fly \nBoatworks cannot continue operations because it carried too much debt and thus should  \nbe dissolved, or the Operating Agreement should be amended.  ( Id. ¶ 74.)  Fisher also \nemailed the Fly Boatworks owners expressing an intent to exit Fly Boatworks and \nrequest ing a buyout.  (Id. ¶ 75.)  Galt and Baker then called due Member Loan #4, for  \nwhich the Gilks and Fisher were personally liable.  (Id. ¶¶ 85 –88.)   CASE 0:25-cv-02158-JRT-LIB     Doc. 61     Filed 07/11/25     Page 5 of 26-6- \n Believing that a prototype would be delivered to Martac on May 28, 2025, and a \ncontract would  be signed on June 2, 2025, the Gilks initiated this action individually and \non behalf of Fly Boatworks.  (Compl., May 20, 2025, Docket No. 1.)  \nII. PROCEDURAL HISTORY  \nThe Gilks bring causes of actions against Defendants for misappropriation of trade \nsecrets, breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duties, breach of the covenant of good \nfaith and fair dealing, civil conspiracy, conversion/civil theft, unjust enrichment, \naccounting, tortious interference with prospective economic advantage and contract, and \nfraud.  (Am. Compl.  ¶¶ 118– 92.)  The Gilks sought immediate injunctive relief through a \nmotion for TRO and preliminary injunction .  (Pls.’ Mot. for TRO and Prelim. Inj. , May 20, \n2025, Docket No. 8.)   \nThe Court held a hearing to establish a briefing schedule for the Gilks’ TRO motion.  \n(Min. Entry, May 27, 2025, Docket No. 19.)  The Court then issued a TRO, largely stipulated \nto by the parties, to preserve the status quo until the Court could issue an o rder on the \nGilks’ pending motion .  (TRO, May 29, 2025, Docket No. 20.)  \nDefendants responded to the Gilks’ TRO motion, and Defendants simultaneously \nfiled their own motion for TRO and preliminary injunction, (Defs.’ Mem.

STANDARD OF REVIEW  \nCourts evaluating a motion for a temporary restraining order or a preliminary \ninjunction weigh four factors, commonly referred to in the Eighth Circuit as the Dataphase  \nfactors: (1) the movant’s likelihood of success on the merits , (2) the threat of irreparable \nharm to the movant in the absence of relief , (3) the balance between that harm and the \nharm injunctive relief would cause to the other litigants , and (4) the public interest.  \nRodgers v. Bryant , 942 F.3d 451, 455 (8th Cir. 2019) (citing Dataphase Sys ., Inc. v. C L Sys., \nInc., 640 F.2d 109, 113 (8th Cir. 1981) (en banc)); S.B. McLaughlin & Co. v. Tudor Oaks \nCondo. Project , 877 F.2d 707, 708 (8th Cir. 1989).  “ The party seeking injunctive relief bears \nthe burden of proving all the Dataphase factors. ”  Watkins Inc. v. Lewis , 346 F.3d 841, 844 \n(8th Cir. 2003).  \nWhen applying these factors, “a court should flexibly weigh the case’s particular \ncircumstances to determine whether the balance of equities so favors the movant that \njustice requires the court to intervene.”  Hubbard Feeds, Inc. v. Animal Feed Supplement, \nInc., 182 F.3d 598, 601 (8th Cir. 1999) (quoting United Indus. Corp. v. Clorox Co ., 140 F.3d \n1175, 1179 (8th Cir. 1998)).  That said, injunctive relief is an “extraordinary remedy , and \nthe burden of establishing the propriety of an injunction  is on the mo vant .” Watkins , 346 \nF.3d at 844 (citations omitted) . CASE 0:25-cv-02158-JRT-LIB     Doc. 61     Filed 07/11/25     Page 7 of 26-8- \n II. PLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR TRO AND PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION   \nThe Gilks seek a TRO and preliminary injunction enjoining the Defendants from \nusurping Fly Boatworks’ business opportunities with Martac.  The Gilks bring ten separate \ncauses of action against the Defendants.2  In essence, all causes of action hinge on \nwhether or not the Defendants were using the Gilks’ and Fly Boatworks’ proprietary \ninformation for their own financial gain.   \nDefendants begin by challenging the procedural adequacy of the Gilks’ complaint \nand the evidentiary value of Daniel Gilks’ declarations.  To the extent the first complaint was deficient, the Gilks’ remedied that deficiency by filing an amended verified com plaint  \nas required by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23.1.   With respect to Defendants’ \nevidentiary concerns, the Court will address admissibility issues when necessary .  But \ncourts in this C ircuit have frequently applied a less strict standard to evidenc e at this early \nstage in litigation.  See Cooke v. Randolph, Neb. City Council , No. 8:23 -249, 2023 WL \n6519374, at *2 n.3 (D. Neb. Oct. 5, 2023); Kohls v. Ellison , No. 24 -3754, 2025 WL 66514, \nat *2 (D. Minn. Jan. 10, 2025); see also  USA Visionary Concepts, LLC v. MR Int’l, LLC, No. \n4:09-874, 2009 WL 10672094, at *5 (W.D. Mo. Nov. 17, 2009) (finding that the rules of \nevidence typically are inapplicable in evaluating a preliminary injunction).  So the Court \nwill not exclude Daniel Gilk ’s declarations for the p urposes of this motion .    \n \n \n2 The claims for breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duties, and breach of the covenant \nof good faith and fair dealing are only against the Individual Defendants because Axocon was not \na member of Fly Boatworks.  But that distinction does not impact the  analysis here.  CASE 0:25-cv-02158-JRT-LIB     Doc. 61     Filed 07/11/25     Page 8 of 26-9- \n A. Likelihood of Success on the Merits  \nShowing likelihood of success on the merits does not require “a mathematical \n(greater than fifty percent) probability of success on the merits.”  Heartland Acad. Cmty. \nChurch v. Waddle , 335 F.3d 684, 690 (8th Cir. 2003).  Rather, the movant needs to show \nthat they have a “fair chance of prevailing.”  Id.  \nTo be successful, the Gilks need to show that their innovations in the F2 Carbon \nand as integrated into the M18 (“Skiff Innovations”) are trade secrets or that the \nopportunity with Martac continues to belong to  Fly Boatworks.3  At this stage of the case, \nthe Gilks’ have shown a likelihood of success on both.  \n1. Trade Secrets  \n“A trade secret is information that: (1) is not generally known or readily \nascertainable, (2) has value as a result of its secrecy, and (3) is the subject of reasonable \nefforts under the circumstances to protect its secrecy.”  Wyeth v. Nat. Biologics, Inc., 395 \nF.3d 897, 899 (8th Cir. 2005); see also 18 U.S.C. § 1839(3).   \nDefendants concede that the Skiff Innovations could be trade secrets but argue \nthat the Skiff Innovations are generally known or readily ascertainable and that the Gilks \ndid not take reasonable efforts to protect the secrecy of the Skiff Innovations.  \n \n \n3 The Court analyzes Fly Boatworks’ opportunity to bring the Skiff Innovations to market \nunder the context of the negotiations with Martac, despite being made aware that the \nopportunity with Martac may be paused.  Any opportunity to bring the Skiff Innovations to \nmarket belongs to Fly Boatworks, even if not in partnership with Martac.  So the outcome remains the same.  CASE 0:25-cv-02158-JRT-LIB     Doc. 61     Filed 07/11/25     Page 9 of 26-10- \n First, the specifics of the F2 Carbon, and particularly its integration into the M18, \nwere unlikely to be generally known or readily ascertainable.  Defendants suggest that \nbecause the Gilks’ relied on publicly available designs, included specifications of the F2 \nCarbon on the Fly Boatworks’ website, previously sold four F2 Carbons, and shared the \nspecifics with Martac, the Skiff Innovations are generally known o r reasonably \nascertainable.    \n But t he evidence suggests  otherwise.  For one, despite having access to all the \nspecifics, Fisher still appears to be asking the Gilks for M18 engineering services.  (Suppl. \nD. Gilk Decl. ¶ 11.)   The fact that Fisher may not even be able to reverse engineer the \nM18 without the Gilks’ aid makes it difficult to conclude that someone else, with less \ninformation, would be able to recreate the M18 from available information .  Additionally, \nChris Morejohn, who Defendants argue created the skiff that the Gilks copied, \nacknowledged that the Gilks were doing something new.  ( Id. ¶ 13, Ex. GG at 2 (“What \nyou have done is what I [ Chris Morejohn ] have been hoping for in sharing my designs and \nideas online, something new.”).)  An acknowledgement by an expert in the field of the \nnovelty of the Skiff Innovations indicates that the Skif f Innovations are not generally \nknown.   Indeed, Chris Morejohn promised  to protect that secrecy.  ( Id. (“I just want to say \nhere in writing all that you shared with me will not be shown to anyone else unless you \nsay it’s ok.”).)  Finally, mere negotiations with a potential partner or website descriptions \ndo not render trade secrets unprotectable.  T rade secrets ’ holders  are not bound to CASE 0:25-cv-02158-JRT-LIB     Doc. 61     Filed 07/11/25     Page 10 of 26-11- \n absolute secrecy and may confide in another to “apply [the trade secret] to the uses for \nwhich it is intended.”  Kewanee Oil Co. v. Bicron Corp. , 416 U.S. 470, 475 (1974).   Without \ninternet marketing and business negotiations, Fly Boatworks would never have been able \nto apply the Skiff Innovations to their intended uses.  Accordingly, the Gilks’ have likely \ndemonstrated that the Skiff Innovations are not generally known or readily ascertainable.   \nSecond, the Gilks likely took reasonable efforts to protect the secrecy of the Skiff \nInnovations. Despite the fiduciary duties imposed by the Operating Agreement and \nimplied confidentiality, Defendants suggest several other measures the Gilks and Fly \nBoatworks could have taken.  But the fact that more could have been done does not mean \nthat the current measures were inadequate.  See AvidAir Helicopter Supply, Inc.  v. Rolls -\nRoyce Corp. , 663 F.3d 966, 974 (8th Cir. 2011) (“Reasonable efforts to maintain secrecy \nneed not be overly extravagant, and absolute secrecy is not required.”).  It seems entirely \nreasonable that in a closely held company with only five members, reliance on only \nfiduciary duties to preserve confidential information would be reasonable.   Id. (citing \nKewanee Oil Co. , 416 U.S. at 475 (“[S]ecrecy is not lost, however, if the holder of the trade \nsecret reveals the trade secret to another in confidence, and under an implied obligation \nnot to use or disclose it.” (quotation omitted)) ).  The eviden ce also suggests that even \nthose not bound by fiduciary duties understood the information was shared under implied confidentiality.  ( See, e.g. , Suppl. D. Gilk Decl. ¶ 13, Ex. GG at 2 (email from Chris \nMorejohn that he intended to keep the information secret unless otherwise advised).)  CASE 0:25-cv-02158-JRT-LIB     Doc. 61     Filed 07/11/25     Page 11 of 26-12- \n The Gilks’ have demonstrated that Fly Boatworks’ efforts to protect the secrecy of the \nSkiff Innovations were likely reasonable.  \nDefendants argue that even if the Skiff Innovations are trade secrets, they belong \nto Fly Boatworks (or Martac) and they have not been pled with sufficient specificity.   First,  \nthere is no evidence suggesting the Skiff Innovations belong to Martac, and Defendants provide none other than conclusory statements.  Second, the Gilks acknowledge that the \nSkiff Innovations belong to Fly Boatworks and seek to protect Fly Boatworks’ interest \nthrough this derivative action .  Third, though the Gilks may need to identify the Skiff \nInnovations more specifically to actually prevail, they have provided adequate specificity \nfor the Court to determine the likelihood of success on the merits of their trade secrets \nclaim.  \nIn sum, the Gilks have demonstrated a likelihood of success in showing that the \nSkiff Innovations are trade secrets.  \n2. Fly Boatworks’ Opportunities  \nDefendants rely on the Gilks’ alleged refusal to use dicyclopentadiene advance \npolymer composite material and refusal to scale up manufacturing to suggest that the \nGilks and Fly Boatworks relinquished those Martac opportunities.   But Defendants \npresent no evidence of the Gilks’ refusal, nor why such alleged refusal should be \nconsider ed a relinquishing of opportunities.  Defendants’  clandestine behavior further \nsuggests this was not simply  businesspeople identifying  available opportunities.   Rather , \nit appears Defendants identified weaknesses in Fly Boatworks’ business operation and CASE 0:25-cv-02158-JRT-LIB     Doc. 61     Filed 07/11/25     Page 12 of 26-13- \n thought they could fulfill the contract with Martac more competently.  Defendants’ \nsupposed superior vision to meet Martac’s needs does not divest Fly Boatworks of their \nright to the Martac business opportunity.  Accordingly, the Gilks have shown that the \nMartac M18 opportunity likely still belongs to Fly Boatworks .        \n* * * \nIn sum, the Gilks  have shown a likelihood of success on the only two issues \naddressing the merits of their claims: that the Skiff Innovations are trade secrets and that \nAxocon’s negotiations with Martac overlap with Fly Boatworks’ opportunities.   Because \nthe Gilks’ have shown a likelihood of success on those two issues, the overall likelihood -\nof-success- on-the-merits Dataphase  factor weighs in favor of granting the Gilks’ motion \nfor TRO and preliminary injunction.   \nB. Irreparable Harm  \n“Irreparable harm occurs when a party has no adequate remedy at law, typically \nbecause its injuries cannot be fully compensated through an award of damages.”  Phyllis \nSchlafly Revocable Tr. v. Cori , 924 F.3d 1004, 1009 (8th Cir. 2019) (quoting Gen. Motors \nCorp. v. Harry Brown’s, LLC , 563 F.3d 312, 319 (8th Cir. 2009)).  The movant must \ndemonstrate that irreparable harm is “ likely  in the absence of an injunction,” not merely \npossible.  Hotchkiss v. Cedar Rapids Cmty.  Sch. Dist., 115 F.4th 889, 893 (8th Cir. 2024) \n(quoting Winter v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc. , 555 U.S. 7, 22 (2008)).  \nBecause the Skiff Innovations are likely trade secrets and the threat of \nmisappropriation of trade secrets may constitute irreparable harm , Prime Therapeutics CASE 0:25-cv-02158-JRT-LIB     Doc. 61     Filed 07/11/25     Page 13 of 26-14- \n LLC v. Beatty , 354 F. Supp. 3d 957, 974 (D. Minn. 2018), the Gilks must only  show that the \nmisappropriation of the Skiff Innovations is reasonably certain to occur and would cause \nharm with out an inadequate remedy at law, Gen. Motors Corp. , 563 F.3d at 319.   The Gilks \nhave met their burden here because the Defendants’ emails suggest active negotiation \nwith Martac that excludes Fly Boatworks entirely, and the loss of the Martac deal would \nharm Fly Boatworks’ goodwill, reputation, ability to bring Skiff Innovations to market firs t, \nand its entire existence.  \nThe harm is reasonably certain to occur absent an injunction.  There is email \nevidence that the Defendants, through Axocon, had  plans to deliver a prototype and a \nprojected contract signing date.  (D. Gilk Decl. ¶¶ 43, 48, Ex. V, Ex. AA at 9– 10.)  Despite \nDefendants’ argument that their actions would benefit Fly Boatworks, Fisher sent the \nemail regarding the delivery of the protot ype to Martac a week after he requested to be \nbought out from Fly Boatworks.  ( Compare D. Gilk Decl. ¶ 43, Ex. V (email about pro totype \nsent May 12, 2025) , with D. Gilk Decl. ¶ 41, Ex. S (email from Fisher expressing intent to \nleave Fly Boatworks and asking to be bought out sent May 5, 2025).)  It is difficult to understand why Fisher would continue to diligently work to deliver a prototype to Martac \non behalf of Fly Boatworks when he had already asked to be bought out.\n4  Also, the most \nrecent proposed contract wa s between Axocon and Martac.  (D. Gilk Decl. ¶ 47, Ex. Z \n \n \n4 The Court was made aware at oral argument that the prototype has been delivered to \nMartac on behalf of Fly Boatworks as required under the TRO, but that does not change the \nrelevance of this information for the pending motions.  CASE 0:25-cv-02158-JRT-LIB     Doc. 61     Filed 07/11/25     Page 14 of 26-15- \n (“We’re truly excited about the partnership between Axocon Polymers Inc. and \nMARTAC .”).)  In drafting that contract, the Defendants discussed  the necessity to remove \nany Fly Boatworks’ branding.  ( Id., Ex. AA at 9 –10.)  The Gilks have shown that the harm  \nis likely to occur.     \nAnd while monetary damages may offset most of the harm to the Gilks and Fly \nBoatworks, such damages  are unlikely to be sufficient on their own.  For example, if Fly \nBoatworks ended up losing the contract , and Axocon instead made a profit of $25 million \nannually, courts could redistribute the financial gain to  Fly Boatworks.  But the Gilks claim \ntwo additional harms that nudge the overall harm into the irreparable category.  First, the \nGilks allege that their goodwill and status as an innovator in the market  will be irreparably \nharmed because they will lose their ability to bring the Skiff Innovations to the market first.  Once someone introduces the Skiff Innovations into the market, no other company \ncan be the first to do so.  That harm is difficult to ascertain and difficult to compensate.  \nCf. Paisley Park Enters., Inc. v. Boxill, 253 F. Supp. 3d 1037, 1049 (D. Minn. 2017) (finding \nirreparable harm if unreleased songs were to be released because once published it \npermanently deprives the owner of determining when if ever, that information should be \nreleased).  Second, the monetary harms threaten the existence of Fly Boatworks —\nbecause Defendants may usurp a large contract from Fly Boatworks, just as Fisher is \nrequesting to be bought out and Member Loan #4 has been called due.  Such an existential \nthreat to the co mpany is sufficient to constitute irreparable harm.  Packard Elevator v. CASE 0:25-cv-02158-JRT-LIB     Doc. 61     Filed 07/11/25     Page 15 of 26-16- \n I.C.C., 782 F.2d 112, 115 (8th Cir. 1986).  The Gilks have shown that monetary damages are \ninsufficient to remedy the harms.    \nIn conclusion, the Gilks have shown a threat of irreparable harm which weighs in \nfavor of the Court entering a preliminary injunction.  \nC. Balance of Harms  \nThe Gilks and Fly Boatworks  face imminent harm to their reputation and to the \ncontinued existence of their company.  Defendants argue that if the Court grants the \nGilks’ motion, Fisher will be unable to work on behalf of Fly Boatworks, the Martac deal \nwill not materialize, and the Individual Defendants, as majority owners in Fly Boatworks, \nwill be substantially harmed.  Defendants also argue that Galt and Baker will be precluded \nfrom asserting their contractual rights to call Member Loan #4 due, and Axocon may be \nunable to protect it s intellectual property if the Court enjoins the patent application.    \nAlmost all of Defendants’ purported harm is not in fact harm at all, with the \npotential exception of the repayment of Member Loan #4.  First, the Gilks’ motion does \nnot seek any relief regarding Axocon’s provisional patent, it simply uses that as evidence.  \nSecond, Defendants argue that the relief requested by the Gilks would “freeze out” Fisher.  \nBut Fisher has already requested that the other Fly Boatworks’ members buy him out.  \nThird, the relief requested does not prohibit continued negotiations and cont racting with \nMartac; it simply requires that conduct to be on behalf of Fly Boatworks.   Thus,  it is \nunclear how Fly Boatworks, and the Individual Defendants through their investments, \nwould suffer any harm if the Court grants the Gilks’ motion.  Finally, though the Court has CASE 0:25-cv-02158-JRT-LIB     Doc. 61     Filed 07/11/25     Page 16 of 26-17- \n considered that the injunction would prevent Galt and Baker from collecting on their \npayment from Member Loan #4, the Gilks nevertheless dispute the right to call Member \nLoan #4 due at all, claiming that Galt and Baker breached the Operating Agreement firs t. \nBecause the only harm adequately argued by Defendants , the inability to collect \non Member Loan #4,  can easily be remedied through monetary damages, and  the Gilks \nand Fly Boatworks face significant harm without adequate remedy at law, the balance of harms factor weighs in favor of granting the Gilks’ motion.   \nD. Public Interest  \nAlong with rehashing likelihood of success and threat of irreparable harm \narguments , Defendants rely on the interest the public has in enforcing contracts.  The \npublic interest in the enforcement of contracts is certainly important, Kato Eng’g, Inc. v. \nHanley , 367 F. Supp. 3d 918, 924 (D. Minn. 2018) (citing Cherne Indus., Inc. v. Grounds & \nAssoc., Inc., 278 N.W.2d 81, 94 (Minn. 1979)), but that interest is not in jeopardy through \nthe issuance of this  preliminary injunction.  In fact, because the Gilks argu e that Galt and \nBaker may be prohibited from recovering Member Loan #4 if they breached the Operating \nAgreement  first, the public interest of judicial enforcement of contracts is served by a \npreliminary injunction because it will allow the Court to evaluate the merits more \nthoroughly.  Additionally, the public interest of protecting a company’s goodwill, \nreputation, and trade secrets , Medtronic, Inc. v. Advanced Bionics Corp. , 630 N.W.2d 438, \n456 (Minn. Ct. App. 2001),  is served through a preliminary injunc tion.   So, the public \ninterest Dataphase  factor supports granting the Gilks’ motion for preliminary injunction.     CASE 0:25-cv-02158-JRT-LIB     Doc. 61     Filed 07/11/25     Page 17 of 26-22- \n C. Balance of Harms  \nDefendants have not shown a threat of irreparable harm, where the Gilks are likely \nto suffer from an inability to present legitimate legal claims and an evidentiary windfall to \nDefendants.  This factor weighs against granting Defendants’ motion for a preliminary \ninjunction.  \nD. Public Interest  \nDefendants argue that the public has an interest in protecting privacy and \npreventing unlawful conduct.  While true, the public also has an interest in preventing the \ntheft of trade secrets and other confidential business information.  Neither party presen ts \nstrong public interest arguments here.  But if the Court granted the Defendants’ motion for TRO and preliminary injunction, the Gilks would be prohibited from using all the \ninformation in Fisher’s email and that would prevent the Court from issuing a merits \ndecision  on the trade secrets issue.  The public interest factor weighs slightly in favor of \ndenying Defendants’ motion for preliminary injunction.  \n* * * \nBecause all four Dataphase  factors weigh against granting Defendants’ motion for \nTRO and preliminary injunction, the Court will deny Defendants’ motion.  However, to ensure fairness throughout this litigation, the Gilks will be ordered to disclose a list of the \ndocuments obtained a nd the Defendants remain free to challenge the admissibility and \nprivilege status of those documents at a later stage in the litigation.  CASE 0:25-cv-02158-JRT-LIB     Doc. 61     Filed 07/11/25     Page 22 of 26-23- \n CONCLUSION  \nThe Gilks began Fly Boatworks to design skiff boats and brought i n Fisher, Galt, and \nBaker as investors.  Fly Boatworks was progressing well, even negotiating a potentially \nlucrative deal with Martac.  Then, the relationship between the members disintegrated , \nand litigation over the Skiff Innovations ensued.  Both parties moved for immediate injunctive relief.  Because the Dataphase  factors favor the Gilks’ motion, the Court will \nenter a preliminary injunction with the same terms as the active TRO.  The Cou rt will not \nrequire a bond.  Because the Dataphase  factors weigh against the Defendants’ motion, \nthe Court will deny Defendants’ motion for TRO and preliminary injunction.  The Court \nwill, however, require the Gilks to identify all of the documents obtained from the \nflyboatworksjet@gmail.com  email address.  The Court encourages the parties  to explore \nsettlement options in order to allow further development of the invention.  \nORDER  \nBased on the foregoing, and all the files, records, and proceedings herein, IT IS \nHEREBY ORDERED that : \n1.

    "summary": "### 1. Summary:\n\nPlaintiffs, Quantum Labs, Inc., and Serban Porumbescu filed a lawsuit against Maxim Integrated Products Inc. and its CEO, Tunc Doluca, alleging that the defendants caused hazardous waste, specifically cobalt contaminants, to be released at a facility operated by the plaintiffs. The court partially granted and partially denied the defendants' motion to dismiss the amended complaint. The court dismissed certain claims related to CERCLA violations due to the plaintiffs' failure to adequately allege a \"release into the environment\" and dismissed Mr. Doluca from the claim altogether. Other claims were dismissed with and without leave to amend, while some were allowed to proceed.\n\n### 2. Key Legal Issue:\n\nThe key legal issue is whether the plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged violations of environmental statutes (CERCLA and RCRA) and common law claims like fraud and waste concerning alleged hazardous waste releases at their facility. The defendants sought dismissal based on insufficient factual allegations, failure to establish elements such as release into the environment, and the applicability of statutes of limitations.\n\n### 3. Court's Holding:\n\nThe court granted in part and denied in part the defendants' motion to dismiss. It found the CERCLA claim insufficient because the plaintiffs did not adequately allege a \"release into the environment.\" The fraud claim was dismissed without leave to amend because the alleged reliance was on behalf of a corporate entity, not the individual plaintiff. The RCRA claim was allowed to proceed, while some claims were dismissed with prejudice, and others were dismissed with leave to amend.\n\n### 4. ELI5 Explanation:\n\nImagine Quantum Labs is like a landlord who rents their space to a company called Maxim. Quantum claims Maxim left some messy, potentially harmful chemicals behind, kind of like a tenant spilling dangerous paint around an apartment. The court was checking if Quantum had enough evidence or a good reason to hold Maxim legally responsible for the mess. CERCLA is a law that's a bit like a rulebook for cleaning up big spills. The court said, \"Quantum, you didn't convince us there was a spill outside the lines of your building,\" so those claims can't go forward right now. But, one claim about possibly dangerous conditions sticking around is still up in the air, and Quantum gets another shot to better explain some of their points.",

BACKGROUND  \nMr. Planck  owns and Quantum operates a facility at 2108 Bering Drive, Unit B, San Jose, Case 5:18-cv-07598-BLF   Document 55   Filed 11/18/19   Page 1 of 14 \n2 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  California (“Quantum Facility”)1.  See FAC  ¶ 2, ECF 36.  On December 17, 2012, Maxim and a  \nthird party, Hyperion  Group, Inc. (“Hyp erion”)2 entered into a “Research and Development Support \nServices Agreement” (“RDSSA”), in which Hyperion agreed to provide research and development \nservices (related to manufacturing silicon wafers) to Maxim at the Quantum Facility.  FAC ¶¶ 40, \n15, 16.  Maxim rented laboratory space in Quantum Facility and by approximately April 2014, had \n“installed its equipment for its satellite operation.”  Id. ¶ 46.  In June 2014, routine sampling of \nwastewater discharged from  the Quantum Facility (conducted pursuant to San Jose Water Pollution \nControl District Self -Monitoring requirements ) revealed presence of cobalt.  Id. ¶ 47.  According to \nthe FAC, cobalt was present in “wastewater exiting the Quantum Facility” because it entered “a \ndrain, toilet, or other connecti on to the sanitary sewer system.”  Id.  Plaintiffs allege that “the \nwastewater containing the Cobalt Contaminants3 was subject to leaking from sewer conveyances by \nway of leaching and discharges in cracks and misaligned joints while in route to the sanitar y sewer \ntreatment works.”   Id. ¶ 48.    \nIn December 2014, Maxim conducted sampling for cobalt inside of the Quantum Facility \nusing a “wipe” methodology  and the sampling revealed cobalt dust at levels as high as “nearly 100 \ntimes in excess of what Maxim’s internal guidelines deemed to be a safe level.”  Id. ¶ 56.  A \nconsultant, hired by Maxim, performed cobalt sampling at the Quantum Facility on or around \nJanuary and April 2015.  Id.  ¶ 57.  The sampling result – which Maxim shared with Mr. Planck – \nrevealed “cobalt contamination at concentrations 10 to 100 times higher than those allowed by \nCAL/OSHA.”  Id.  On or around June 2015, Maxim shut down its operatio ns at the Quantum Facility \nand by the end of September 2015, all Maxim personnel left.  Id. ¶ 50.   \nIn November 2017, Mr. Plan ck hired a consulting firm to test for the presence of cobalt the \nQuantum Facility (with a Maxim representative in attendance) —the results of which “showed cobalt \n                                                 \n1 Mr. Planck is also the owner of Quantum.  FAC ¶ 8.  \n \n2 According to the FAC, Hyperion is Quantum’s parent company.  See FAC ¶¶ 21 -35. \n \n3 The alleged contaminants are  “cobalt metal power” and “cobalt oxide ,” which the FAC refers to \ncollectively as “Cobalt C ontaminants.”   FAC ¶ 5.

Plaintiffs \nclaim that “the Cobalt Contaminants remain present at the Quantum Facility on surfaces and in the \nambient air at concentra tions which may present an imminent and substantial endangerment to \nhealth and the environment.”  Id. ¶ 109.  \nAccording to the FAC, Defendants knew but concealed from Mr. Planck that “Maxim \nintended to use, handle, and store cobalt pellets while performing operations at the Quantum \nFacility” and that “that Maxim’s operations would generate a waste stream consisting of the known \ncarcinogens cobalt metal power and cobalt oxide.”  Id. ¶¶ 4 -5.  The FAC lists over twenty  \ncommunications  between Mr. Planck and vari ous Maxim representatives, in which Maxim’s \nrepresentatives did not disclose the use of cobalt at the Quantum Facility.  See i d.  ¶¶ 18 -37.  \nAdditionally, Plaintiffs allege that pursuant to the RDSSA, a Maxim representative provided Mr. \nPlanck with a sched ule of materials to be utilized at the Quantum Facility but “intentionally \nomit[ed]” Maxim’s use of cobalt.  Id. ¶ 41.   \nPlaintiff s allege that cobalt metal power and cobalt oxide are “known carcinogens” under \nCalifornia law and both are “listed hazardous substances” under the Comprehensive Environmental \nResponse Compensation and Liability Act, 42 U.S.C. 9601 et seq.  (“CERCLA”).  Id. ¶¶ 5-6.  \nQuantum  filed this action on December 19, 2018, asserting 11 ca uses of action against Maxim  and \nMr. Doluca .  See ECF 1.  Defendants filed a motion to dismiss, which the Court granted with leave \nto amend in part and without leave to amend in part.  ECF 35.  Quantum , now joined by Mr. Planck, \nfiled a First Amended Complaint, asserting eight (8) causes of action.  \n(1) Violatio ns of CERCLA , 42 U.S.C. §§ 9607 (a) and 9613 (f)(1) – (Plaintiffs against All \nDefendants);  \n(2) Violations of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) 42 U.S.C. \n§6972(a)(1)(B) – (Plaintiffs against Maxim);  \n(3) Fraud —Intentional Concealment of Material Facts – (Mr. Planck against Maxim);  \n(4) Negligence and Negligence Per Se – (Plaintiffs  against Ma xim) ; \n(5) Continuing Private Nuisance –  (Mr. Planck against Maxim);  \n(6) Waste – (Mr. Planck against Maxim) ;  Case 5:18-cv-07598-BLF   Document 55   Filed 11/18/19   Page 3 of 14 \n4 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  (7) Trespass – (Mr. Planck against Maxim); and  \n(8) Breach of Contract – (Quantum against Maxim).  \nSee generally FAC.   \nII.

Iqbal , 556 U.S. 662, 678 \n(2009) (quoting Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly , 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007)).  When considering such \na motion, the Court “accept[s] factual allegations in the complaint as true and construe[s] the \npleadings in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.”  Manzarek v. St. Paul Fire & Marine \nIns. Co. , 519 F.3d 1025, 1031 (9th Cir. 2008 ).  “Threadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of \naction, supported by mere conclusory statements, do not suffice.”  Iqbal , 556 U.S. at 678 (citing \nTwombly , 550 U.S. at 555).   \nIII.   DISCUSSION  \nDefendants move to dismiss Plaintiffs ’ claims for: (1) violat ions of CERCLA under 42 \nU.S.C.  §§9607 (a) and 9613 (f)(1), (2) violations of RCRA, (3) fraud, and (4) waste.  See generally \nMot.  Additionally, Defendants move to strike Plaintiffs’ request for civil penalties pursuant to \nCalifornia Health & Safety Code § 2 5359.7.  Id. at 22.  In their opposition, Plaintiffs note that they \nare willing to “stipulate to the dismissal of their CERCLA §9613 claim without prejudice.”  Opp’n \nat 4 n. 1, ECF 40.  Plaintiffs also “submit to the dismissal of their claims for Waste and  Civil \nPenalties with prejudice.”  Id. at 15.  \nA. CERCLA Claim  \ni. CERCLA Claim against Maxim  \nCERCLA authorizes private parties to institute civil actions to recover the costs involved in \nthe cleanup of hazardous wastes from those responsible for their creation.  See 42 U.S.C. § 9607(a) .  \nTo prevail in a private cost recovery action under CERCLA, a plaint iff must establish that (1) the \nsite on which the hazardous substances are contained is a “facility” under CERCLA ’s definition of Case 5:18-cv-07598-BLF   Document 55   Filed 11/18/19   Page 4 of 14 \n5 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  that term4, (2) a “release” or “threatened release” of a “hazardous substance” from the facility has \noccurred; (3) such “relea se” or “threatened release” has caused the plaintiff to incur response costs \nthat were “necessary” and “consistent with the national contingency plan”; and (4) the defendant is \nwithin one of four classes of persons subject to the liability provisions under  42 U .S.C.  § 9607 (a).  \n3550 Stevens Creek Assocs. v. Barclays Bank of California , 915 F.2d 1355, 1358 (9th Cir. 1990) . \nDefendants argue that the CERCLA claim  in the FAC  fails to “adequately plead the essential \nelement of a ‘release’ or ‘threatened release’ of any ‘hazardous substance’ from the facility. ”  Mot. \nat 9.  CERCLA defines “release” as “any spilling, leaking, pumping, pouring, emitting, emptying, \ndischarging, injecting, escaping, leaching, dumping, or disposing into the environm ent[.]”   42 \nU.S.C. § 9601(22).  And the term “environment” means “(A) the navigable waters, the waters of the \ncontiguous zone, and the ocean waters of which the natural resources are under the exclusive \nmanagement authority of the United States …, and (B) any other surface water, ground water, \ndrinking water supply, land surface or subsurface strata, or ambient air within the United States ….”  \n42 U.S.C. § 9601(8).   \nPlaintiffs argue that the  FAC allegations satisfy the “release into the environment” elemen t \nof their CERCLA claim because Defendants (1) allowed “cobalt -laden wastewater” to exit the \nconfines of the Quantum Facility “subject to leaking from sewer conveyances by way of leaching \nand discharges in cracks and misaligned joints while in route to the  sanitary sewer treatment works” \nand (2) “abandoned the cobalt contaminated equipment” and “Cobalt Contaminants were deposited \non all surfaces inside the vacuum chamber, in the lab housing of the Temescal unit (hearth \nevaporator), and in other areas of the  Quantum Facility.”  Opp’n at 4 -5; see also FAC ¶ 48, 65. \nFirst, Plaintiffs’ allegation that the cobalt -contaminated wastewater was “subject to leaking \nfrom sewer conveyances” is insufficient.  See FAC ¶¶ 48, 94.  “Release” and “environment” are \nspecifical ly defined under CERCLA – and based on those definitions, the wastewater conveyance \n                                                 \n4 “The term ‘facility’ means (A) any building, structure, installation, equipment, pipe or pipeline \n(including any pipe into a sewer or publicly owned treatment works), well, pit, pond, lagoon, \nimpoundment, ditch, landfill, storage  container, motor vehicle, rolling stock, or aircraft, or (B) any \nsite or area where a hazardous substance has been deposited, stored, disposed of, or placed, or \notherwise come to be located; but does not include any consumer product in consumer use or any  \nvessel. ”  42 U.S.C. § 9601(9) .  Case 5:18-cv-07598-BLF   Document 55   Filed 11/18/19   Page 5 of 14 \n6 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  system is not the “environment” (i.e., navigable waters, ocean waters , surface water, ground water, \ndrinking water supply, land surface or subsurface strata, or ambient air) and speculation of \ncontaminants being “subject to leaking” is not “release”  (i.e., spilling, leaking, pumping, pouring, \nemitting, emptying, discharging,  injecting, escaping, leaching, dumping, or disposing).    \nPlaintiffs argue that “[s]uch a mechanism for the release and dispersal of contaminants has \nbeen widely recognized as giving rise to liability under CERCLA Section 9607(a)” and cite two \ncases – both unhelpful to Plaintiffs’ cause.  In State of Cal. v. Montrose Chem. Corp. of Cal ., it was \nalleged that defendants released “ DDT into the environment through ocean dumping, discharge into \nthe sewer collection system, surface water runoff into the Los Angel es/Long Beach Harbors ” and \n“PCBs into the marine environment through discharge into the sewer collection system and, from \nthere, into the San Pedro Channel. ” 104 F.3d 1507, 1511 (9th Cir. 1997) .   In other words, in  \nMontrose , there were allegations of actu al (not speculative) release into the “environment” as \ndefined under CERCLA ( i.e., Los Angeles/Long Beach Harbors  and San Pedro Channel ).  See i d.  \nUnlike the circumstances in  Montrose , here, Plaintiffs simply speculate that cobalt contaminants in \nthe wast ewater (last detected in June 2014) were “subject to leaking” from sewer conveyances “by \nway of leaching and discharges in cracks and misaligned joints while in route to the treatment \nworks.”  FAC ¶ ¶ 94, 47.   \nSimilarly,  in Lincoln Properties, Ltd. v. Higg ins, tests had revealed that “water in San \nJoaquin County wells ” adjacent to defendant’s shopping center had been contaminated by “several \nhazardous chemical compounds ” used by three dry cleaning facilities in the shopping center.  No. \nCIV. S -91-760DFL/GGH, 1993 WL 217429, at *1 (E.D. Cal. Jan. 21, 1993) .  The re, hazardous \nmaterials had p assed from the floor drains into the sewer system  and eventually “ leaked through \njoints in th e existing sewer line and migrated to the water table.”   Id. *3-7.  No such allegations are \nmade here.  Thus, the FAC’s allegations regarding cobalt -contaminated wastewater are insufficient \nto establish  a “release” or “threatened release” into the environm ent. \nSecond, the cobalt -contaminated equipment in the Quantum Facility is not a claim of release \ninto the environment.  Plaintiffs argue that “[c]ourts have … recognized that disposal may occur \ninside a building rather than directly to the ‘outside.’”  Opp ’n at 5.  As an initial matter, Plaintiffs Case 5:18-cv-07598-BLF   Document 55   Filed 11/18/19   Page 6 of 14 \n7 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  seem to equate “disposal” with “release into the environment.”  But CERCLA provides specific \ndefinitions for these two distinct (albeit related) concepts5.  As the Ninth Circuit has explained , to \nprevail in a CERC LA claim, “ release ” or “threatened release ” into the environment  must be alleged.  \nStevens Creek , 915 F.2d at 1358.  To be clear, disposal of hazardous waste may lead to release into \nthe environment – but the FAC does not make that connection because it fa ils to allege that a release \noccurred as a result of the abandonment of Defendants’ cobalt -contaminated equipment at the \nQuantum Facility.  \nMoreover, the Ninth Circuit’s guidance on this issue is contrary to Plaintiffs’ argument.  In \nStevens Creek , the Nint h Circuit provided definitions for “release” and “environment” under \nCERCLA  and added  “[o]ther courts considering this language have concluded that the \n‘environment’ referred to in the statute ‘includes the atmosphere, external to the building,’ but not \nthe air within a building.”  915  F.2d at 1360 (collecting cases).  With this binding authority in mind, \nPlaintiffs’ reliance on district court decisions  outside of the Ninth Circuit is misplaced.  See Opp’n \nat 5-6. \nAt the Hearing , Plaintiffs’ counsel requested an opportunity to amend the CERCLA claim if \nand when subsequent testing of the soil surrounding the sewer lines does in fact reveal  release of \ncobalt.  See Transcript 15:12 -16:8, ECF 52.  As noted at the Hearing, the Court a grees that such \nfindings would constitute “good cause” under Rule 16.   \nDefendants argue that the FAC also fails to sufficiently allege two other elements of \nCERCLA claims: (1) that Plaintiffs incurred c osts that were “necessary” and “consistent with the \nNational Contingency Plan” and (2) that Maxim was a “generator” or “operator” under CERCLA . \nMot. at 9 -14.  Because the Court has determined that Plaintiffs’ CERCLA claim fails based on the  \n“release” or “threatened release” into the environment  element , the Court need not address \nDefendants’ other argument s. \nThus, the Court GRANTS Defendants’  motion to dismiss the CERCLA claim ( claim 1) \n                                                 \n5 “The term ‘disposal ’ means the discharge, deposit, injection, dumping, spilling, leaking, or \nplacing of any solid waste or hazardous waste into or on any land or water so that such solid waste \nor hazardous waste or any co nstituent thereof may enter the environment or be emitted into the air \nor discharged into any waters, including ground waters. ”  42 U.S.C. § § 6903(3), 9601(29).  Case 5:18-cv-07598-BLF   Document 55   Filed 11/18/19   Page 7 of 14 \n8 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  against Maxim with LEAVE TO AMEND if and when evidence of “release into the environment” \nis obtained.  \nii. CERCLA Claim against Mr. Doluca  \nPlaintiffs ’ CERCLA allegations against Mr. Doluca, Maxim’s CEO, fail for the same \nreasons as discussed above.  In addition , Plaintiffs were on notice to be “mindful of the Court’s \ndirection” that Quantum’s  original allegations against Mr. Doluca  in his personal capacity did not \n“even remotely make out a viable claim .”  ECF 35 at 5.  The FAC fails to cure those deficiencies.  \nPlaintiffs allege that Mr. Doluca is liable under CERCLA as an “arranger” of hazardous \nwaste.  See Opp’n at 7 -10; FAC ¶ 96.   The stated basis for Plaintiffs’ allegations is that Mr. Doluca \n(1) was the sole and exclusive individual at Maxim with the authority to approve the operations \nconducted at the Quantum Facility, (2) approved Maxim’s plans for operations at the Quantum \nFacility, (3) knew that the operations at the Quantum Facility would involve the use, hand ling, and \ndisposal of cobalt, subject to state and federal regulations, and (4) intended  for cobalt -contaminated \nwaste stream to be disposed of at the Quantum Facility.  FAC ¶¶ 97 -100, 39.   \nWhile CERCLA does not define what it means to be an “arranger” of hazardous waste \ndisposal, the Supreme Court has explained that “an entity may qualify as an arranger under § \n9607(a)(3) when it takes intentional steps to dispose of a hazardous substance.”   Burlington N. & \nSanta Fe Ry. Co. v. United States , 556 U.S. 599, 611 (2009).  “While actions taken with the intent  \nto dispose of a hazardous substance are s ufficient for arranger liability, actions taken with the mere \nknowledge  of such future disposal are not.”  Team Enterprises, LLC v. W. Inv. Real Estate Tr. , 647 \nF.3d 901, 908 (9th Cir. 2011).  Mr. Doluca’s approval of Maxim ’s operations at the Quantum faci lity \nand his knowledge of cobalt use  are not enough to establish “arranger” liability.   \nPlaintiffs’ conclusory allegations that Mr. Doluca “knew and intended” for cobalt -\ncontaminated waste stream to be disposed of the Quantum Facility does not survive the  motion to \ndismiss.  See In re Gilead Scis. Sec. Litig. , 536 F.3d 1049, 1055 (9th Cir. 2008) (“[C]ourt[s] [are \nnot] required to accept as true allegations that are merely conclusory, unwarranted deductions of \nfact, or unreasonable inferences.”).  Plaintiff s’ assertion that Mr. Doluca’s general knowledge of \nMaxim ’s operations  as its CEO and his “scientific background and expertise” somehow create Case 5:18-cv-07598-BLF   Document 55   Filed 11/18/19   Page 8 of 14 \n9 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  liability as an “arranger” of hazardous waste is not well  taken.  See Opp’n at 9.  The Court agrees \nwith Defendan ts that under Plaintiffs’ theory , CERCLA liability would attach to any corporate \nofficer with experience and knowledge of her or his company’s business.   See Reply at 7 -8, ECF \n42. \nAccordingly, Plaintiffs’ CERCLA claim as to Mr. Doluca is DISMISSED WITHOUT \nLEAVE TO AMEND.  \nB. RCRA Claim  \nNext, Defendants argue that FAC’s RCRA claim is deficient . For their RCRA claim, \nPlaintiffs must plead that Maxim (1) has contributed to the past or present handling, storage, \ntreatment, transportation, or disposal of any solid o r hazardous waste which (2) may present an \nimminent and substantial endangerment to health or the environment.  42 U.S.C. § 6972(a)(1)(B).  \nMoreover, for claims alleging  violations of RCRA, a plaintiff must provide notice to the relevant \nparties sixty -days before filing suit.   See 42 U.S.C. § 6972(b)(1)(A) ; see also Hallstrom v. Tillamook \nCounty , 493 U.S. 20,  33 (1989) (“[W]here a party suing under the citizen suit provisions of RCRA \nfails to meet the notice and 60 –day delay requirements of § 6972(b), the district court must dismiss \nthe action as barred by the terms of the statute.”) .  The purpose of the notice requirement is to give \nthe alleged violator an opportunity to bring itself into compliance and render unnecessary a citizen’s \nsuit.  N. California River Watch v. Honeywell Aerospace , 830 F. Supp. 2d 760, 765 (N.D. Cal. 2011) \n(citing Ctr. for Biological Diversity v. Marina Point Dev. Co. , 566 F.3d 794, 800 (9th Cir.  2009)  \n(internal quotation omitted).  \nFirst, Maxim  argue s that Plaintiffs h ave failed to allege  an “imminent and substantial \nendangerment to health and the environment .”  Mot. at 16 -17.  In its previous order the Court noted \nthat the “most recent test for the presence of cobalt in its facility was in November 2017” and \ntherefore the Complaint lacked allegations of “an imminent and substantial endangerment to health \nor the environment.”  ECF 35 at 5.  In its present motion, Maxim  argue s that Plaintiffs have failed \nto cure this deficiency because the FAC alleges —without factual deta il—that the present \nconcentrations of Cobalt in Quantum Facility’s ambient air may present an imminent and substantial \nendangerment to health and the environment.  Mot. at 17.  The Court disagrees.  Case 5:18-cv-07598-BLF   Document 55   Filed 11/18/19   Page 9 of 14 \n10 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  Plaintiffs have alleged that cobalt containments were  detected at the Quantum facility, in \nconcentrations well -above the permitted limits.  FAC ¶¶ 56, 57, 67, 69.  Also, the FAC alleges that \n“as of the time of filing of this First Amended Complaint, the Cobalt Contaminants remain present \nat the Quantum Facility o n surfaces and in the ambient air at concentrations  which may present an \nimminent and substantial endangerment to health and the environment .”  Id. ¶ 109.  According to \nthe FAC, cobalt metal power and cobalt oxide are (1) “listed hazardous substances” unde r CERCLA \nand (2) carcinogens under California law.  Id. 5-6.  Viewing the allegations in the light most \nfavorable to Plaintiffs, the Court is persuaded that the FAC contains sufficient allegation that the \ncobalt contaminants at the Quantum Facility “may pr esent an imminent and substantial \nendangerment to health or the environment” as required by RCRA.  \n Second, Maxim  argue s that the RCRA claim must be dismissed because Plaintiffs failed to \nsatisfy the mandatory requirement to provide statutory compliant notice.  Mot. at 17 -18.  Maxim \ndoes not conten d that Plaintiffs’ RCRA notice was untimely or lacked the required content – only \nthat the notice was deficient because Maxim was denied access to the Quantum Facility after it \nreceived the notice and therefore was “denied the opportunity to ‘bring itself into compliance.’”  \nMot. at 17 -18.  Plaintiffs respond that “Maxim is arguing facts wh ich are improper in the context of \na Motion to Dismiss,” namely its exchanges with Mr. Planck regarding access to the Quantum \nFacility.  The Court agrees with Plaintiffs. The parties’ correspondence  regarding access  is beyond \nthe pleadings and not properly subject to judicial notice and therefore irrelevant in the context of \nMaxim ’ motion to dismiss.  Intri-Plex Techs., Inc. v. Crest Grp., Inc. , 499 F.3d 1048, 1052 (9th Cir. \n2007) (“Generally, a court may not consider ma terial beyond the complaint in ruling on a \nFed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) motion.”).  \nThus, Maxim ’s motion to dismiss the RCRA claim  (claim 3)  is DENIED.  \nC. Mr. Planck’s Fraud Claim  \nMaxim seeks  dismissal of  Mr. Planck’s fraud claim because Mr. Planck  signed the RDSSA  \non behalf of Hyperion  and therefore , Mr. Planck , in his personal capacity,  may not allege detrimental \nreliance on Maxim’s representations.    See Mot. at 20 -21.  Maxim also argues that the FAC’s fraud \nallegations  fail because (1) they are  barred by the stat ute of limitation  and (2) do not  state the claim Case 5:18-cv-07598-BLF   Document 55   Filed 11/18/19   Page 10 of 14 \n11 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  with particularity.    Id. at 18 -20, 21.  \ni. Detrimental Reliance  \nThe elements for a fraud claim in California are “(a) misrepresentation (false representation, \nconcealment, or nondisclosure); (b) knowledge of fa lsity (or ‘scienter’); (c) intent to defraud, i.e., to \ninduce reliance; (d) justifiable reliance; and (e) resulting damage.’”  Small v. Fritz Companies, Inc. , \n30 Cal. 4th 167, 173 (2003).  Mr. Planck alleges that he “did not know or have any reason to suspect \nthat Maxim had fraudulently concealed … material facts [regarding the use of cobalt] from him \nprior to entering into the RDSSA.”  FAC ¶ 119.  He further alleges that had he had known, he “never \nwould have allowed Maxim to carry out its operations at the Quantum Facility.”  FAC ¶ 118.   \nMaxim argues that Mr. Planck may not allege “detrimental reliance” in his individual \ncapacity, because he was not a party to the RDSSA —Hyperion was.  Mot. at 20-21.  Mr. Planck \nresponds that he (1) “is the sole owner and representative of Hyperion Group and Quantum,” (2) “is \nthe only representative of Hyperion and Quantum that negotiated with Maxim representatives \nregarding t he terms and conditions of the RDSSA,” and (3) “signed the RDSSA on Hyperion \nGroup’s behalf.”  Opp’n at 3.  The Court agrees with Maxim.  \nIn establishing a cause of action for fraud, “a plaintiff must allege that a material and \nknowingly false representati on was made with the intent to induce action, and that such \nrepresentation caused reasonable and detrimental reliance on the part of the plaintiff .”  Pulver v. \nAvco Fin. Servs. , 182 Cal. App. 3d 622, 640 (Ct. App. 1986)  (citation omitted) .  Setting aside \nPlaintiffs’ irrelevant (but amusing) reference to artificial intelligence, Hyperion and Mr. Planck are \nnot interchangeable under the law.  A shareholder may not sue as an individual if his or her injuries \nare merely incidental to or an indirect result of in juries to the corporation.  Pastor v. ERI , 162 F.3d \n1169 (9th Cir. 1998) (citing Pareto v. FDIC , 139 F.3d 696, 699 (9th Cir.  1998) ).  Thus, Mr. Planck \nmay not bring a fraud cause of action in his individual capacity, when the alleged misrepresentation \nwas made to Hyperion —not Mr. Planck.  \nThe Court and the parties have been down this road before.  Quantum, in its original \nComplaint, brought fraud claims on behalf of Quantum.  See ECF 1 ¶¶ 122 -143.  Defendants \nchallenged those allegations in their first moti on to dismiss, arguing that “Plaintiff must plead and Case 5:18-cv-07598-BLF   Document 55   Filed 11/18/19   Page 11 of 14 \n12 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  prove that it (not a third party) actually and justifiably relied on the defendant’s alleged \nmisrepresentation.”  ECF 18, 17 -18.  In its opposition, Quantum acknowledged this deficiency and \nrequested “l eave to amend the Complaint to assert the Fraud claims directly on behalf of those \nindividuals and entities that were directly defrauded by Maxim.”  ECF 22 at 15 -16.  The Court \ngranted Quantum’s request for leave to amend its fraud allegations.  See ECF 35  at 4.  Now, i n the \nFAC , Quantum and Mr. Planck have, again, brought a fraud claim on behalf of a party “not directly \ndefrauded by Maxim.”  At the Hearing, counsel for Plaintiffs stated “[w]e’ve tried Quantum, we’ve \ntried Mr. Planck.  Plaintiffs respectful ly request leave to amend to assert the fraud claim on behalf \nof Hyperion.”  Transcript at 23:15 -17.  Plaintiffs have not presented any reason(s) for not adding \nthe correct party to their FAC and thus, the Court is not persuaded that Plaintiffs should get a third \nbite at this apple.6  Mr. Planck’s claim for fraud (claim 3) is DIMISSED WITHOUT LEAVE TO \nAMEND.  \nii. Statute of Limitation  \nMaxim argues  that Mr. Planck’s fraud claim is barred by the statute of limitations, which is \nthree years.  Mot. at 18 -20; s ee als o Cal. Civ. Proc. Code § 338(d).  Mr. Planck does  not challenge  \nthat the discovery of cobalt (basis for his fraud cause of action) took place outside of the statute of \nlimitation.  Instead, Mr. Planck  relies on a tolling agreement  the parties entered into on February 2, \n2017  (“The Tolling Agreement) ”.  See Opp’n at 12 -13; FAC ¶¶ 122 -27.  The Tolling Agreement, \non its own , does not save Mr. Planck’s fraud claim because it only extended the applicable statute \nof limitation to December 31, 201 7 and the complaint in this action was not filed until December \n19, 2018.  See FAC ¶ 122, ECF 1.  Recognizing that  fact, Mr. Planck relies on correspondence \nbetween counsel in “late 2017 and early 2018” regarding an extension of the Tolling Agreement.  \nFAC ¶¶ 1 23-27.  The Tolling Agreement provides that it “constitutes the entire agreement between \nand among the Parties” and “shall not be modified, amended, or extended except by an instrument \n                                                 \n6 The Court indicated at the Hearing that because this case is at an early stage, it was inclin ed to \nallow leave to amend to bring fraud claims on behalf of Hyperion.  See Transcript at 23:20 -21. \nHowever, upon further reflection, the Court finds that Plaintiffs were fully aware of the deficiency \nregarding  their fraud claim, had the opportunity to co rrect that deficiency, and failed to do so.  \nTherefore, a second leave to amend is not justified.   Case 5:18-cv-07598-BLF   Document 55   Filed 11/18/19   Page 12 of 14 \n13 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  in writing signed by each Party .”  Tolling Agreement § 7 (emphasis adde d), ECF 38 -5.   \nMaxim argues  that the Tolling Agreement was never extended because (1) it was not signed \nby the parties , as required by the clear language of the Tolling Agreement , (2) the conditions for the \nextension (exchange of insurance policies prior to mediation) were never met , and (3) the email \ncorrespondence was not a “complete agreement” because it lacked a “specific length of tolling \nperiod .”  Mot. at 18 -20.  Mr. Planck responds  that the correspondence and “clear course of conduct” \nbetween counse l establish that the parties agreed to extend the Tolling Agreement.  Opp’n at 12 -13.   \nAs noted at the Hearing, the Court is doubtful that allegations of “course of conduct” —even if \nproperly pled  and proven —can overcome the clear language of the Tolling A greement requiring \nthat any extension must be “signed by the parties.”  That said, the Court has dismissed Mr. Planck’s \nfraud claim because it is brought on behalf of the wrong party, and thus, it need not decide the issue \nof statute of limitation  and decl ines to do so . \niii. Particularity  \nMaxim argues  that Mr. Planck has failed to allege the specific “who, what, when, where, \nand how” of the alleged omissions.  Mot. at 21.  Mr. Planck  respond s that the FAC “lists twenty -\nfour (24) separate, specific, and distinct allegations of fraudulent omissions by Maxim’s employees \nwhile communicating with Mr. Planck.”  Opp’n at 14 (citing FAC ¶¶ 17 -35).  Maxim replies  that \nthe FAC contains 24 separate allegations of omissions “using nearly the exact same form.”  Reply \nat 11.  \nAgain, because the Court has dismissed Mr. Planck’s fraud claim  on other grounds , it does \nnot decide the issue of “particularity .”  \nIn sum, Mr. Planck’s claim for fraud is DISMISSED WITH OUT  LEAVE TO AMEND.  \nIV. REQUEST FOR JUDICIAL  NOTICE    \nDefendants request judicial notice of (1) certified copies of all grant deeds recorded within \nthe last 10 years with the Santa Clara County Recorder for Quantum Facility  and (2) an “Official \nNotice of Inspection” of the Quantum Facility dated 12/17/2014 an d stamped “Received” by Santa \nClara County Department of Environmental Health on January 20, 2015.  ECF 39 at 2.  Plaintiffs \nrequest that this Court take judicial notice of Mr. Doluca’s biography posted on Maxim’s website.

Consequently,  the Court DENIES the parties’ \nrespective  requests for judicial notice.  \nV. ORDER  \n For the foregoing reasons, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that:  \n(1) Claim 1  of Plaintiffs’ FAC  for violations of CERCLA, 42 U.S.C. § 9613 (f)(1) is \nDISMISSED WITHOUT PREJUDICE.  \n(2) Defendants’ motion to dismiss claim 1 of Plaintiffs’ FAC for violations of CERCLA, 42 \nU.S.C. § 9607 (a) is GRANTED WITH LEAVE TO AMEND as to Maxim and \nGRANTED WITHOUT LEAVE TO AMEND as to Mr. Doluca.  \n(3) Maxim’s motion to dismiss claim 2 of Plaintiffs’ FAC for violations RCRA 42 U.S.C. \n§6972(a)(1)(B) is DENIED.  \n(4) Maxim’s motion to dismiss claim 3 of Plaintiffs’ FAC for Fraud is GRANTED WITHOUT \nLEAVE TO AMEND . \n(5)  Claim 6  of Plaintiffs’ FAC for Waste is DI SMISSED WITH PREJUDICE.  \n(6) Plaintiffs’ request for civil penalties pursuant to California Health & Safety Code § \n25359.7 is STRICKEN  WITH PREJUDICE.  \n(7) Any amended pleading shall be filed on or before December 18, 2019.  \n(8) Leave to amend is granted only as to Plaintiffs’ existing claims; Plaintiffs may not add \nclaims without leave of the Court.  \n \nIT IS SO ORDERED.  \n \nDated:   November 18, 2019  \n ______________________________________  \nBETH LABSON FREEMAN  \nUnited States District Judge  \nCase 5:18-cv-07598-BLF   Document 55   Filed 11/18/19   Page 14 of 14",

The court dismissed the complaint, finding that the statements in question were forward-looking and accompanied by appropriate cautionary language, thus protected by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act (PSLRA). The case involved artificial intelligence (AI) indirectly as Vicor's business and stock fluctuations were connected to developments and contracts related to AI platforms.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether Vicor Corporation made material misrepresentations with the requisite scienter that influenced the plaintiffs' trading actions, thereby violating securities laws under the Exchange Act.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court granted the motion to dismiss, holding that the plaintiffs failed to adequately plead any material misstatements or scienter. The statements were found to be forward-looking with proper cautionary language and thus not actionable under the PSLRA. The court dismissed the complaint with leave to amend.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine a company makes a prediction about a future business deal, and lots of people buy its stock expecting that deal to happen. Among those people, some were betting that the company's stock would fall (short-sellers), but because the stock price temporarily went up, they lost money. These people sued, saying the company misled them with false promises. The court said the company didn't really promise anything guaranteed; they just shared hopes or expectations for the future with lots of warnings, so the company didn't break the rules. The lawsuit was dismissed, but they can try again if they find better reasons.",

INTRODUCTION  \nIn this case, a putative class of short -sellers have sued  a publicly traded corporation over \nalleged misrepresentations that spurred a dramatic rise in values.  Plaintiffs aver that, when these \nalleged misrepresentations came to light, stock prices plummeted.  Having had to cover their short \npositions in light of the  initial  rise, Plaintiffs seek damages under the Exchange Act.  Defendants \nmove to dismiss the allegations, contending that no misrepresentations were made and that, at any \nrate, they lacked the necessary scienter to be found liable.  For the reasons explained bel ow, \nDefendants’ motion is granted, and the operative complaint is dismissed with leave to amend.  \nII. BACKGROUND  \nAccording to Plaintiffs’ first amended complaint  (“FAC”) , Dkt. No. 27, Defendant Patrizio \nVinciarelli is the founder and CEO of Defendant Vicor Corporation, which  designs, develops, \nmanufactures, and markets modular power components and power systems for deployment in \nareas such as high -performance computing, industrial equipment automation, robotics, satellites, \nand more.  Plaintiffs aver that, starting in 2022, V icor’s stock  slid 20% in value  when it was Case 3:24-cv-04196-RS     Document 40     Filed 06/06/25     Page 1 of 13 \nORDER GRANTING MOTION TO DISMISS  \nCASE NO.  24-cv-04196 -RS \n2 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  revealed that Nvidia, another tech company, would not be u sing Vicor’s designs in its new \nartificial intelligence (“AI”) computer chips.  Previously, Vicor’s two largest customers had been \nNvidia and Google.  By May 2023, the company was reporting decreased net revenues and \naccounts receivable —leading Plaintiffs to take short positions on the company’s stock.  \nOn July 25, 2023, Vicor released its second quarter earnings report, which featured the \nfollowing statement, attributed to Vinciarelli:  \n \nQ2 bookings remained weak, ahead of production release of an AI platform with a \nLateral Power Distribution Network (‘PDN’) using a 4G Chi pset, now expected \nto ramp in Q4.  The same 4G Chi pset will support a more adept Lateral -Vertical \nPDN, enabling a reduction of nearly 100W in total power consumption at heavy \nworkloads and superior processor performance.  \nFAC ¶  32 (emphasis added) .  Later that day, Vinciarelli spoke to investors and analysts on an \nearnings call .  One analyst asked whether the expected “ramp” was from a new customer .  \nVinciarelli responded:  \n \nIt’s an existing customer. It’s a new generation for the existing customer. And \nit’s a chipset that can be deployed either in a lateral PDN, which is substantially \nhandicapped from a power system perspective to the point that it limits power \ndelivery, power capability, process of performance, in that it gives rise to large \nlosses within the copper of the substrate to the GPU, that it powers. It gives rise to \nfurther losses within the system itself, or into the limitations of lateral power \ndelivery applied at the 1,000 amp level. With a 4G chipset, we can enable a lateral \nsolution w ith the same handicaps, or with a vertical element using the same \nchipset, a lateral vertical solution, which is unique, highly differentiated, in that it \nimproves system efficiency by about 10%. And it improves a number of \nlimitations relating to process of performance . \nId. ¶ 36 (emphasis added) .  When another analyst inquired about the “lateral vertical opportunity” \ndescribed in the p ress release, Vinciarelli elaborated that, “Based on customer input expectation, \nas of now .  . . the lateral implementation will go first.  And that’s the one we’re anticipating for Q4 \nramp.  I can’t tell you when the lateral vertical was going to production, but my expectation is that \nit would be after the lateral.”  The analyst asked,  “is this going to be a significant customer or is \nthis m ore of an incremental volume that you’re going to expect?” Vinciarelli answered,  “This is a \nsignificant customer.”   Id. ¶ 38. Case 3:24-cv-04196-RS     Document 40     Filed 06/06/25     Page 2 of 13 \nORDER GRANTING MOTION TO DISMISS  \nCASE NO.  24-cv-04196 -RS \n3 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California   Plaintiffs aver that the above statements —the press release, the earnings call statement \nabout an existing customer, and the related statement about the customer being a significant one —\n“gave the unmistakable impression that a concrete deal had been reach ed for an existing —not \nspeculative —large customer of a significant number of purchases in the fourth quarter, which \nwould have reversed Vicor’s trend of declining and weak sales.”  Id. ¶ 43.  The market apparently \nreacted: whereas stocks closed on July 25,  2023 at $59 per share, they opened the next morning at \n$77.40 and closed at $93.70 —after more than 4.5 million shares had changed hands, 5x more than \naverage.  Plaintiffs, who had shorted Vicor  stock , claim that they were forced to cover their \npositions at a significant loss of $35 per share on average, plus approximately $15 per share they \nthink they would have realized but for the need to cover.   Id. ¶¶ 45–47. \n Everything changed a few months later, when Vicor held its third quarter earnings call  in \nOctober 2023 .  Asked about the significant, existing customer that it had touted as driving the \nexpected fourth quarter ramp, Vicor’s VP of Sales Phil Davies said  “we’re having substantial \nconversations now with customers that will diversify us away from the two big guys that we’ve \nbeen doing business with[.]”  Id. ¶ 53.  Another analyst chimed in, asking, “with the one major \ncustomer though, do they have two differen t designs with you? .  . . two different GPUs that are \ngoing to be used, in one using lateral, the other’s going to be using lateral -vertical?”  and \nVinciarelli responded by addressing the analyst by name: “John, we’re not going to talk about any \none customer.  I’m sorry but bear with us, that’s not a level of specificity we want to get involved \nwith.”  The analyst, John Dillon from Goldman Sachs, reiterated the question about “a major GPU \ncustomer,” and Davies answered him as follows:  \nSo what we talked about there was that we have lateral and lateral -vertical \nsolutions for not just one customer. We are bringing that solution forward, and we \nhave customers looking at that, both of those solutions. And certainly, the number \nof customers l ooking at lateral deployment is a little bit higher than the number \nwith lateral -vertical, but we have both.   \nId. ¶ 55.  A different analyst later chimed in about the “major customer,” asking about the \n“Dynamics relative to your last call,” and Vinciarelli said , “I think I made clear that we really Case 3:24-cv-04196-RS     Document 40     Filed 06/06/25     Page 3 of 13 \nORDER GRANTING MOTION TO DISMISS  \nCASE NO.  24-cv-04196 -RS \n4 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  don’t want to go into the level of detail.  And to be clear, well, I appreciate the reason for the \ninterest, the curiosity, it’s really got very little to do with Vicor’s opportunity in the medium and \nlong term.  And that’s what we’re really focused on.”   Id. ¶ 56. \nAfter the October 2023 call, investors fled.  Vicor stock  dropped over 20% and closed at \n$53.19 per share that day; the next day , trading opened at $39.01.  Nearly a year later —and after \nthe filing of the instant litigation —Vicor put out a press release explaining that its July 2023 \nannouncement was true: it had “booked” $30 million in “non -cancellable, non -returnable” orders \nfrom t he customer, and its statement reflected what Vicor “understood to be” the customer’s \n“allocation for a new program.”  Id. ¶ 63 (discussing September 2024 press release).   \nPlaintiffs assert two claims: one claim under Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule \n10b-5(b), and a separate claim (against Vinciarelli personally) under Section 20 of the Exchange \nAct.  As to the first claim, Plaintiffs aver manipulation or deception that was material and “in \nconnection with” the purchase or sale of securities , made with scienter in a way that caused \ndamages.  As to the second claim, Plaintiffs aver that Vinciarelli acted as the controlling person of \nVicor and made misrepresentations with scienter such that he is liable personally as a control \nperson.  \nDefendants move to dismiss the complaint on four grounds:  \n1. No facts pleaded support any inference that any statement by Vicor or Vinciarelli \nwas false or  misleading when made;  \n2. No facts pleaded support  any inference of scienter, much less the strong  inference \nrequired under the PSLRA;  \n3. No plausible theory in which Plaintiffs, all short -sellers betting against Vicor, could \nhave reli ed on Defendants’  allegedly misleading statements; and  \n4.

LEGAL STANDARD  \nA complaint must contain “a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the \npleader is entitled to relief.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2).  While “detailed factual allegations” are not \nrequired, a complaint must include sufficient facts to “state a claim to relief that is plausible on its \nface.”  Ashcroft v. Iqbal , 556 U.S. 662, 678  (2009) (citing Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly , 550 \nU.S. 544, 570 (2007)).  A claim is facially plausible “when the pleaded factual content allows the \ncourt to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.”  Id.  \nA motion to dismiss a complaint under Rule 12(b)(6) of the Feder al Rules of Civil Procedure tests \nthe legal sufficiency of the claims alleged in the complaint.  See Parks Sch. of Bus. v. Symington , \n51 F.3d 1480, 1484 (9th Cir. 1995).  Dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) may be based either on the \n“lack of a cognizable legal theory” or on “the absence of sufficient facts alleged under a \ncognizable legal theory.”   Balistreri v. Pacifica Police Dep ’t, 901 F.2d 696, 699 (9th Cir. 1988).  \nWhen evaluating such a motion, the court must accept all material allegations in the complain t as \ntrue, even if doubtful, and construe them in the light most favorable to the nonmovant.  Twombly , \n550 U.S. at 570 .  “[C]onclusory allegations of law and unwarranted inferences,” however, “are \ninsufficient to defeat a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim.”  Epstein v. Wash. Energy \nCo., 83 F.3d 1136, 1140 (9th Cir. 1996); see also Iqbal , 556 U.S. at 678 (citing Twombly , 550 U.S. \nat 555 (“Threadbare recitals of the elements of the cause of action, supported by mere conclusory \nstatements, do not suffice.”)).  \nComplaints in securities fraud cases  must also meet the pleading standards set forth by the \nPrivate Securities Litigation Reform Act (“PSLRA”).   The PSLRA mandates that “securities fraud \ncomplaints ‘specify’ each misleading statement; that they set forth the facts ‘on which [a] belief’ \nthat a statement is misleading was ‘formed’; and that they ‘state with particularity facts giving rise \nto a stron g inference that the defendant acted with the required state of mind.’”   Dura Pharm., Inc. \nv. Broudo , 544 U.S. 336, 345 (2005) (alterations in origi nal) (quoting 15 U.S.C. §§  78u–4(b)(1) –\n(2)).  Furthermore, securities claims which are “grounded in fraud” must meet the pleading \nrequirements of Rule 9(b).   In re Rigel Pharms., Inc. Secs. Litig. , 697 F.3d 869, 886 (9th Cir. \n2012).  “To satisfy Rule 9(b), a pleading must identify the who, what, when, where, and how of Case 3:24-cv-04196-RS     Document 40     Filed 06/06/25     Page 5 of 13 \nORDER GRANTING MOTION TO DISMISS  \nCASE NO.  24-cv-04196 -RS \n6 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  the misconduct charged, as well as what is false or misleading about [the purportedly fraudulent] \nstatement, and why it is false.”  Cafasso, U.S. ex rel. v. Gen. Dynamics C4 Sys., Inc. , 637 F.3d \n1047, 1055 (9th Cir. 2011) (internal quotation marks omitted) (alteration in original).  \nIV. DISCUSSION  \nA. Section 10(b) and Rule 10b -5 \n“To be viable, a claim brought under § 10(b) and Rule 10b -5 must contain six essential  \nelements: ‘(1) a material misrepresentation or omission by the defendant; (2) scienter; (3) a  \nconnection between the misrepresentation or omission and the purchase or sale of a security (4) \nreliance upon the misrepresentation or omission; (5) economic loss; and (6) loss causation.’”   \nRetail Wholesale & Dep’t Store Union Local 338 Ret. Fund v. Hewlett -Packard Co. , 845 F.3d  \n1268, 1274 (9th Cir. 2017) (quoting Matrixx Initiatives, Inc. v. Siracusano , 563 U.S. 27, 37 –38 \n(2011)).   Defendant s argue that Plaintiffs’ complaint fails to meet that standard in three  specific \nways: ( 1) failure to plead any mate rial, misleading statement; ( 2) failure to plead scienter; ( 3) \nfailure to plead reliance on the allegedly misleading statements.   \n1. Material, Misleading Statements  \nTo plead falsity adequately under the PSLRA, “the complaint shall specify each statement \nalleged to have been misleading, the reason or reasons why the statement is misleading, and, if an \nallegation regarding the statement or omission is made on informatio n and belief, the complaint \nshall state with particularity all facts on which that belief is formed.”  15 U.S.C. §  78u-4(b)(1). \nThis means “ Plaintiffs must plead with particularity which statements were made, when they were \nmade, why they were false at the  time they were made, and how the Defendant who made the \nstatement acted with scienter at the time the statements were made.”  Veal v. LendingClub Corp. , \n423 F.Supp.3d 785, 819 (N.D. Cal. 2019).  Defendant s contend that Plaintiffs’ complaint fails \nplead with particularity why the statements described in the complaint were false when they were \nmade.  \nPlaintif fs respond with a lengthy explanation of how, when Defendants said they “expected \nto ramp in Q4” an AI platform with a 4G ChiP -set, they gave the false impression that Vicor had Case 3:24-cv-04196-RS     Document 40     Filed 06/06/25     Page 6 of 13 \nORDER GRANTING MOTION TO DISMISS  \nCASE NO.  24-cv-04196 -RS \n7 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  an actual  customer who had agreed to make new purchases.  Opp. Br., Dkt. No. 37, at 12 –15.  \nPlaintiffs believe this message was cemented by Vinciarelli’s subsequent statements about a \nsignificant, existing customer driving the ramp.  This message must have been clearly delivered, \nPlaintiffs claim, given  the stock trading that occurred on the heels of the call.  The complaint states \n“Vicor represented it had contracts with an existing significant customer that were related to \nVicor’s newest product and which  Vicor would deliver starting in Q4 2023.”  FAC at ¶  78.  See \nalso id. at ¶ 40 (“had agreed to make product purchases”), ¶ 43 (“concrete deal”).  Yet, according \nto Plaintiffs, this was all a lie—there was no such concrete deal with an existing customer.  \nDefendants right ly highlight that  many of  the above characteri zations  are incorrect : they \nnever said anything about contracts or agreements or concrete deals.  To the contrary, they were \nclear that they only “expected” to ramp —i.e., they had  “anticipat[ion]” — based on  “customer \ninputs .”  As Defendants  fairly  summarize, “This lawsuit is based purely on the disclosure of an \nanticipated future business opportunity that did not materialize in the expected time frame.”  Mot. \nat 12.  Once the recharacterizations in the  operative  complaint are stripped away, the allegedly \nmisleadin g statements at issue reduce to the following:  (1) that Vicor “Expected to ramp in Q4” a \nnew AI platform using a 4G ChiP -set; (2) that the platform was a “new g eneration for the existing \ncustomer” and (3) that the customer was a “significant ” one.   \nPlaintiffs contend that these disclosure s must have been  false when made because, during \nthe subsequent October 2023 call, Vicor’s top brass backed away from discussing the Q4 ramp  \nand signaled, apparently for the first time, a plan to diversify its customer base.  Framing this \nretreat  as a “cover up”, Plaintiffs provide one relevant case as support for the proposition that \nallegations supporting the existence of an alleged cover -up of a fraud are relevant to inferring \nfalsity.  See SEC v. Dropil, Inc. , No. 20-cv-00793 -SBD -FMX, 2020 WL 7348021, at *6 (C.D. Cal. \nOct. 23, 2020) .  The cited language, however, describes how a detailed explanation “of allegedly \nmaterial misrepresentations that define the contours of the scheme and subsequent cover up”  can \nsupport an “inference of scienter” .  Id.  That statement does not support the premise that alleging a \ncover -up satisfies the material misrepresentation element of a PSLRA claim; to the contrary, it Case 3:24-cv-04196-RS     Document 40     Filed 06/06/25     Page 7 of 13 \nORDER GRANTING MOTION TO DISMISS  \nCASE NO.  24-cv-04196 -RS \n8 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  suggests that a cover -up allegation, combined with details about allegedly false statements , can \nsuffice to satisfy the scienter element.  In that case , the SEC detailed four ways in which the \nDefendant had misrepresented aspects of its securities’ offerings.  Id. at *2.  Those  allegations, \ntaken together with related allegations of fabricated responses to subpoenas,  sufficed to state a \nclaim .  In the present case, such details and allegations are entirely absent.   The mere averment \nthat Defendants changed their tune in Q3 does not suffice to allege material misrepresentations \noccurred in Q2.  \nMoreover, even if it were true that alleging a cover -up supports the inference of falsity , no \nfacts in the complaint plausibly aver anything to cover -up.  Plaintiffs seem to suggest  that the July \n2023 announcement was a market manipulation to enable insider trading.  FAC ¶  100 (averring \nthat, following the announcement, “Vicor insiders .  . . sold well over $1 million in Vicor shares”); \n¶ 102 (“Vinciarelli attempted to prevent his own and other Vicor shares from being loaned to short \nsellers.  Using whatever  means Defendants could to increase the value of Vicor’s shares was \nobviously intended, at least in part, to lift the price of the stock as a way to self -enrich as well as to \ncombat short sellers, creating a short squeeze.”)   These speculative  and conclusory  allegations, \nhowever, fail to aver plausibly a material misstatement .  Indeed, t hey do not  explain why it is not  \nequally as plausible that Vinciarelli was being optimistic .  See In re Daou Sys., Inc. , 411 F.3d \n1006, 1021 (9th Cir. 2005) (concluding that  statements regarding the defendant’s expectations \nmay have been “overly optimistic when made,” but  they did “not rise to the level of material \nmisrepresentation actionable after enactment of the PSLRA ”).  Even taken as true, the averment \nthat insiders traded heavily following the July 2023 call does not, standing alone, suggest that the \nnews on the call was false; it just as easily suggests that the insiders who  allegedly  traded believed \nthe news to be true.  \nPlaintiffs next contend that, even if Vicor never technically used the terms “orders” or \ncontracts,” it is still liable if it “gave a misleading impression”  as alleged in the complaint.   Opp. \nBr. at 18.  Yet, the cases Plaintiffs cite in support of that notion are inapt.  In one, the Ninth Circuit \nsimply confirmed that, where a complaint identified four confidential witnesses who would testify Case 3:24-cv-04196-RS     Document 40     Filed 06/06/25     Page 8 of 13 \nORDER GRANTING MOTION TO DISMISS  \nCASE NO.  24-cv-04196 -RS \n9 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  as to the falsity of certain statements, the material misrepresentation element was met.  See Berson \nv. Applied Signal Tech., Inc. , 527 F.3d 982, 985 (9th Cir. 2008).  No such facts are present here.  \nIn the other, the Ninth Circuit acknowledged that “even if a statement is not false, it may be \nmisleading if it omits material information.”  Khoja v. Orexigen Therapeutics, Inc. , 899 F.3d 988, \n1008 –09 (9th Cir. 2018).  Here, there is no plausible averment in the complaint that Defendants’ \nannouncement of expe ctations omitted material information.  Plaintiffs claim Vicor “never \ndisclosed the truth about the customer or the nature of their discussions, and only later disclosed \nthat it had nothing concrete at the time and had merely announced the deal with the si gnificant \ncustomer without a placement of firm orders.”  Opp. Br. at 18.  This conclusory allegation is \nunsupported —the complaint provides no basis on which to conclude that Vicor “had nothing \nconcrete” or that it hid that fact such that it committed any material omission.  \nFinally, it bears mentioning that the PSLRA provides a safe harbor for forward looking \nstatements, such as “a projection” of revenues, a “statement of the plans and objectives of \nmanagement for future operations,” or “any statement of the assumptions under lying or relating \nto” any forward -looking statement.  See 15 U.S.C. §  78u-5(i)(1) ; see also , Harris v. I vax Corp. , \n182 F.3d 799, 805 (11th Cir. 1999) (affirming finding that  a statement was a “forward -looking \nstatement” because it was a statement that meant “things were looking  up”).   This safe harbor \napplies where a statement is “accompanied by meaningful cautionary  statements identifying \nimportant factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward -\nlooking statements” or where the statement is “immaterial.” 15 U.S.C. §§ 78u -5(c)(1)(A).   To \nsatisfy the safe harbor, cautionary language must only appear once per presentation or document, \nnot directly before ever y single statement being challenged.  Wenger v. Lumisys, Inc. , 2 F. Supp. \n2d 1231, 1242 (N.D. Cal. 1998).  \nDefendants provided appropriate cautionary language with both the press release and \nduring the July 2023 call.  The language was clear : “Any statement in this press release that is not \na statement of historical facts  is a forward -looking statement” and is “based upon management’s \ncurrent expectations and estimates as  to the prospective events and circumstances that may or may Case 3:24-cv-04196-RS     Document 40     Filed 06/06/25     Page 9 of 13 \nORDER GRANTING MOTION TO DISMISS  \nCASE NO.  24-cv-04196 -RS \n10 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  not be within the company’s control and as  to which there can be no assurance.” Vinciarelli Decl. \nEx. 3 , Dkt. No. 32 -4 at 5.  At the beginning of the call, investors and the public were warned that \n“various remarks we make during this call may constitute forward -looking statements for purposes \nof the safe harbor provisions under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1 995 .  . . we \ncan offer no assurances that any forward -looking statement will, in fact, prove to be correct. \nActual results may differ materially from those explicitly set forth in or implied by any of our \nremarks today….” Vinciarelli Decl.  Ex. 4 at 1:26 –2:51.  ‘ \nPlaintiffs halfheartedly suggest that Defendants fail to explain the forward -looking nature \nof the at -issue statements, but on their face, the statements are necessarily  forward looking; they \ncame in Q2 yet concerned Q4, and they revolved around the words “expect” and “anticipate.”  The \nstatements about an existing, significant customer are only relevant to these forward -looking \nprojections of what was to come.  Plaintiffs next try to rech aracterize what was said —“Vicor \nannounced it had a deal with Nvidia o r Google for Vicor’s new ChiP -set, which was concrete \nenough that Vicor acknowledged the Q4 ramp ,” Opp. Br. at 20 —but, as noted supra , nothing of \nthe sort was actually said .  Defendants announced that they expected a Q4 ramp due to inputs from \nan existing, significant customer ; that’s it.  The press -release disclosure specifically says words \nlike “expects” or “anticipates” are ones that “identify forward -looking statements.”  Dkt. No. 32 -4 \nat 5.  The call disclosure stated that “any statements regarding cur rent and planned products, \ncurrent and potential customers .  . . as well as management’s expectations for sales growth .  . . are \nforward -looking statements .  . . we can offer no assurances that any forward -looking statement \nwill, in fact, prove to be corre ct.”  Dkt. No. 32 -5 at 1:26-2:51.  Combined , these disclosures and \nthe forward -looking nature of the at -issue statements place them outside the ambit of the PSLRA.  \nUltimately, Plaintiffs fail to allege facts giving rise to a plausible inference that material \nmisstatements were made.  The actual verbiage used by Vicor and Vinciarelli was plainly forward -\nlooking, and there is nothing in the complaint to support a findi ng that those forward -looking \nstatements were false when made.  \n Case 3:24-cv-04196-RS     Document 40     Filed 06/06/25     Page 10 of 13 \nORDER GRANTING MOTION TO DISMISS  \nCASE NO.  24-cv-04196 -RS \n11 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  2. Scienter  \nTo plead scienter adequately under the PSLRA, the complaint must “state with \nparticularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted with the required state \nof mind.”  15 U.S.C. § 78u -4(b)(2)(A) (emphasis added). A “strong inference”  exists “if a \nreasonable person would deem the inference of scienter cogent and at least as compelling as any \nopposing inference one could draw from the facts alleged.”  Tellabs, Inc. v. Makor Issues & \nRights, Ltd. , 551 U.S. 308, 324 (2007).  A dual inquiry applies for assessing whether the strong \ninference standard is met: the court first “determines whether any one of the plaintiff’s allegations \nis alone sufficient to give rise to a strong inference of scienter; s econd, if no individual allegations \nare sufficient, it conducts a ‘holistic’ review to determine whether the allegations combine to give \nrise to a strong inference of scienter.”  Glazer Cap. Mgmt., L.P. v. Forescout Techs., Inc. , 63 F.4th \n747, 766 (9th Cir. 2023) (quoting Zucco  Partn ers, LLC v. Digimarc Corp. , 552 F.3d 981, 992 (9th \nCir. 2009) ). \nNone of the  complaint ’s allegations, standing alone, give rise to a strong inference of \nscienter.  It  primarily contends that element  is proven by the specificity of Defendants’ statements \nand the fact that they would have had records to clue them into the uncertain nature of the \nexpected Q4 ramp.  Yet, t hese averments are insufficient plausibly to allege the scienter required \nby the PSLRA.  “ Plaintiffs do not provide any  specific facts, documents, reports, or sources to \nshow that Defendants had information contrary to what  was projected in their press release \nstatements.  Without such specifics, the Court cannot ascertain whether  there is any basis to the \nallegations that Defendants had actual or constructive knowledge” of adverse  facts.”   Stocke v. \nShuffle Master , Inc., 615 F.Supp.2d 1180, 1188 (D. Nev. 2009) (internal citation omitted).   Even a \nholistic r eview of the allegations fails to give rise a strong inference of scienter.  \nPlaintiffs argue in the alternative that Vicor’s statements were made with reckless \ndisregard of their falsity.  “For a deal of this magnitude and importance to fall apart so quickly \nstrongly suggests that Defendants lacked any basis warranting the unquali fied assertions of fact \nmade on the [call].”  FAC ¶  95.  See also  id. ¶ 106 (“If Vicor did not have actual knowledge of the Case 3:24-cv-04196-RS     Document 40     Filed 06/06/25     Page 11 of 13 \nORDER GRANTING MOTION TO DISMISS  \nCASE NO.  24-cv-04196 -RS \n12 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  misrepresentation and/or omissions alleged, the n it was reckless in failing to obtain such \nknowledge.”).  These allegations suffer fatal flaws.  First, they mischaracterize what Vicor \nactually said, which was merely that it expected to ramp up production of a new system for an \nexisting, substantial cust omer —not that there was a done deal of particular magnitude and \nimportance.  Second, they rely on an unfounded premise that the news must have been false \nbecause the expected ramp did not occur as expected.  It is just as plausible that the news was true \nand then things changed.1 \nAt bottom, Plaintiffs’ complaint is rife with conclusory allegations about Defendants’ \nknowledge and intent in making the July 2023 statements.  Once such conclusions are set aside, \nthe remaining allegations in the complaint fail plausibly to aver that Defendants acted with \nscienter.  \n3. Reliance  \nReliance is generally presumed when the statement in question was issued to the public, \nthough that presumption is rebuttable where it is completely implausible that any reasonable \ninvestor could have relied on the statement in purchasing the securities.  See In re Infineon Techs. \nA.G. Sec. Litig. , 266 F.R.D. 386, 395 (N.D. Cal. 2009) (“A presumption of reliance cannot exist \nwhere such a presumption would be unreasonable.”).  Because Plaintiffs are short -sellers, \nDefendants contend that they could not have relied on the market price for Vicor  stock nor \nDefendants’  statement —they were betting against the company.   See Zlotnick v. TIE Commc’ns , \n836 F.2d 818, 823 (3d Cir. 1988) (declining to presume reliance on the part of a short seller and \nstating that  “since [the plaintiff] decided that the market price was not an accurate valuation of the \nstock at the time  of his short sale, we should not presume that it was reasonable for him to rely \n \n1 Plaintiffs  also aver that Vinciarelli had scienter because he is the Chairman of the Board and \nCEO of Vicor.  FAC ¶  97.  Scienter, however, may not be inferred solely from an individual \ndefendant’s position within the company.  See Zucco Partners , 552 F.3d at 99 8.  Nor may it be \ninferred  solely  from the fact that he signed certain financial statements.  Id. at 1003 –04.  As for the \nhinted -at insider trading allegations, the Complaint never connects Vinciarelli or any identified  \nindividual t o the alleged trading.

Plaintiffs respond that, although they rely on \na fraud on the market theory for class -wide reliance, the named Plaintiffs have pleaded direct \nreliance on the July 2023 statements.  See FAC at ¶¶115 –17.  Defendants suggest that whether \nshort -sellers are entitled to the presumption of reliance, and whether they can even assert a \nsecurities fraud claim as a putative class, may be open questions in the Ninth Circuit.  See Mot. at \n21 n.23.  \nBecause the complaint fails to allege plausibly both the material representation and scienter \nelements of the claim, this order does not reach the question of whether reliance was sufficiently \nalleged to state a claim.  \nB. Section 20  \nDefendant also argues that Plaintiffs fail to state a “Control Person” claim pursuant to 15 \nU.S.C. §  78t(a).  “Under Section 20(a), a defendant employee  of a corporation who has violated \nthe securities laws will be jointly and severally liable to plaintiff, as  long as the plaintiff \ndemonstrates a primary violation of federal securities law and that the defendant  exercised actual \npower or control over the primary violator. ”  Inchen Huang v. Higgins , 443 F.Supp.3d  1031, 1059 \n(N.D. Cal. 2020) ( internal quotation marks and citation omitted ). \nFor the reasons explained above, Plaintiffs have failed to plead plausibly that there was a \nprimary violation of federal securities law in this case.  As a result, the control person claim \nagainst Vinciarelli necessarily fails in parallel.  \nV. CONCLUSION  \nBecause the operative complaint fails to aver  plausibly any  material misstatements or \nscienter as required by the PSLRA, Defendants’ motion to dismiss is granted with leave to amend.   \n \nIT IS SO ORDERED . \nDated:  June 6, 2025  \n______________________________________  \nRICHARD SEEBORG  \nChief United States District Judg e \nCase 3:24-cv-04196-RS     Document 40     Filed 06/06/25     Page 13 of 13",

    "summary": "1. **Summary:** In this case, TCF National Bank sued Market Intelligence, Inc., alleging fraud and breach of contract related to Field Asset Verifications (FAVs) purchased from Market. These FAVs were unreliable alternatives to property appraisals. The court granted summary judgment to the defendants, concluding that TCF’s claims were barred by the statute of limitations, as TCF was aware of the FAVs' issues more than six years before filing the lawsuit in 2011. Although the case involves property valuation methods, it does not directly involve AI or automated systems.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue:** Whether TCF's claims against Market are barred by the six-year statute of limitations under Minnesota law.\n\n3. **Court's Holding:** The court held that all of TCF's claims are barred by the statute of limitations because TCF was aware of the defects in the FAVs by 2004, and no evidence supported tolling the statute of limitations.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation:** Imagine you bought a bunch of gadgets from a company, and they didn't work as promised. You found out early on they were faulty but did nothing until years later. When you tried to sue, the court said, \"Sorry, you waited too long — you passed the deadline to complain,\" which is like your complaint's expiration date being up.",

TCF brings this \naction seeking to re cover damages for what it claims are losses caused by the \nshortcomings of Market’s FAVs.  The Court has previously issued two rulings in this \ncase.  In July 2012 , the Court issued an order dismissing without prejudice several of \nTCF’s claims but permitting  others to proceed.  TCF then amended its complaint and TCF NATIONAL BANK,  \n \n Plaintiff,  \n \nv. \n \nMARKET INT ELLIGENCE, INC. , \nFIDELITY NATIONAL \nINFORMATION SERVICES, INC.,  LSI \nAPPRAISAL, LLC, and LE NDER \nPROCE SSING SERVICES, INC.,  \n \n Defendant s. Civil No. 11-2717 (JRT/ LIB) \n \n \n \nMEMORANDUM OPINION \nAND  ORDER  GRANTING \nDEFENDANTS ’ MOTION FOR \nSUMMARY JUDGMENT  \n CASE 0:11-cv-02717-JRT-LIB   Document 92   Filed 10/14/14   Page 1 of 31- 2 - Defendants  again moved to dismiss.  I n a January 2013 order , the Court denied the \nmotion on all claims.  There are now six claims before the Court: (1) fraudulent \ninducement, (2) negligent appraisal, (3) breach of contract, (4) breach of the covenant of \ngood faith and fair dealing, (5) fraud, and (6) consumer fraud.   \nDefendants now move  for summary judgment on all claims, arguing both that all \nclaims are barred by the six -year statute of limitations u nder Minnesota law and that \nDefendants  are entitled to summary judgment on the merits for each of the six claims .  \nTCF also moves  for summary judgment, but only on its claims for fraudulent \ninducement, fraud, and consumer fraud  and on  Defendants’  affirmati ve defenses.   Also \nbefore the Court is Defendants’  motion to exclude the testimony of TCF’s expert witness.  \nThe Court concludes that all of TCF’s claims are barred  by the statute of limitations, as  \nthe evidence indicates that TCF was aware of the inadequa cies of FAV s by at least 2004, \nwhich is more than six years before it filed its complaint in 2011, and there is no evidence \nupon which a reasonable jury could conclude that TCF is entitled to any tolling of the \nstatute of limitations.  The Court will thus grant Defendants’  motion for summary \njudgment, deny TCF’s motion for partial summary judgment, and deny as moot \nDefendants’ motion to exclude TCF’s expert.  \n \nBACKGROUND  \nI. PARTIES  \nPlaintiff TCF is a national bank ing association which loans money to consumers \nfor residential mortgages in Minnesota and other states.  (Aff. of Douglass Hiatt ¶  2, \nMay 1, 2014, Docket No. 61.)  Defendant  Market Intelligence , Inc.  was a company CASE 0:11-cv-02717-JRT-LIB   Document 92   Filed 10/14/14   Page 2 of 31- 3 - incorporated in Massachusetts , but  ceased to exist in 200 4 when it merged into Market \nIntelligence, LLC, which ceased to exist in 2005 when merged into its parent company, \nFidelity National Information Solutions, Inc.  (Decl. of Brian Melendez, Ex. I at 6, May  1, \n2014, Docket No. 62.)   Defendant Lender Processing Services, Inc. is a wholly own ed \nsubsidiary of Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. , and Defendant LSI Appraisal, \nLLC is a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of Lender Processing Services, Inc.  ( Id.)  \nThese mergers  and corporate identi ties are not material to the instant  dispute .   \n \nII. AGREEMENT  TO PURCHASE FAVS  \nTCF initially began purchasing FAVs from Market for its c onsumer mortgage \nlending activities in Illinois in 200 0.  (See Ex. to Mem. in Supp. of Defs.’ Mot. for \nSumm. J. (“Defs.’ Ex.”), Ex. 25 (Dep. of Mark Rohde (“Rohde Dep.”) ) 19-20, May  1, \n2014, Docket No. 74; id., Exs. 1 -2.)1  In late 2001, Timothy Meyer, then -director of \nconsumer lending for TCF in Minnesota, spoke with Mark Rohde, who held a similar role \nwith TCF in Illinois, about TCF’s experience in Illinois.  (See Defs.’ Ex., Ex. 28 (Dep. of \nTimothy B. Meyer (“Meyer Dep.”)) 5, 9 -11.)  B ased on this discussion, Meyer \nrecommended to his superiors in December 2001 that TCF order FAVs from Market for \nuse in Minnesota.  (Id. at 29-30.)  \n                                              \n1 Defendants filed evidentiary exhibits  in support of their motion for summary judgment \nas two separate docket entries titled “Exhibit” following their memorandum.  The Court will \nrefer to this set of documents  in its entirety as “Defs.’ Ex. ” and will specify  the relevant \nattachment number  when citing to individual exhibits within the set .  Except for depositions a nd \nunless otherwise noted, page numbers refer to the CMECF pagination.  CASE 0:11-cv-02717-JRT-LIB   Document 92   Filed 10/14/14   Page 3 of 31- 4 -  Meyer  then negotiated an Agreeme nt to Purchase Services (“Agreement”) \nbetween TCF  and Market on June 11, 200 2.  ( Id. at 31 -32; see also Melendez Decl., \nEx. D (“Agreement to Purchase Services”) .)  He does not remember with whom he spoke  \nat Market before signing the contract.  ( Meyer Dep.  12-13, 31.)  The record indicates that, \nbefore entering into the Agreement, TCF ordered 13 test FAVs for properties in \nMinnesota in December 2001.  ( Decl. of Lisette C. Howells ¶  3(c), May 1, 2014, Docket \nNo. 75.)   \nMuch of the dispute surrounding the merits of TCF’s claims centers on what \nMarket represented was involved in a n FAV.  The Agreement  define d an FAV as \nfollows:  \nThe FAV is a residential real property evaluation derived from a process \nthat combines an external data source value (previous appra isal, automated \nestimate, prior sales price, etc.) with a “drive -by” exterior inspection of the \nsubject property by an agent licensed in residential real estate in the state in \nwhich the property is located. The agent, who may be an appraiser but is \nusuall y a real estate agent , also provides at least one comparable sale, and \nother local market data. This product is intended primarily for use in \nconsumer/home equity lending and the second mortgage market. The Field \nAsset Verification is not an appraisal and does not include either (a)  a \nphysical inspection of the interior of the subject property, or \n(b) photographs of the interior or exterior of the property, although \nphotographs will be provided on request as will additional market  data such \nas active listin gs. \n \n(Agreement to Purchase Services  3-4 (emphasis added) .)  The Agreement also \ndistinguished b etween appraisals and other “evaluation” products, which included FAVs:  \nEvaluation  shall mean the act or process of estimating value; an estimate \nof market value  of residential real estate based upon some or all of the \nfollowing: information obtained from TCF and/or the owner of the subject \nproperty, available public records, available market data, and/or a field \ninspection conducted by a real estate professional who may or may not be \nan appraiser.  Evaluations are not appraisals  and do not necessarily CASE 0:11-cv-02717-JRT-LIB   Document 92   Filed 10/14/14   Page 4 of 31- 5 - comply with USPAP  . . . . While these estimates of market value are \nderived from sources that MI believes to be reliable, in no case does MI \nrepresent or warrant tha t an evaluation r epresents actual market value.  \n \n(Id. at 2 (emphasis added). )   \n \nIII. PRE -CONTRACT DISCUSSIONS AND PREPARATIONS  \nIn supports of its claims that Market induced TCF into purchasing FAVs on the \nbasis of misrepresentations as to their quality, TCF points to several representations and \npieces of marketing materials upon which it claims to have relied in agreeing to purcha se \nFAVs from Market.   \n \nA. The Hybrid Approach  \nTCF focuses most significantly on one piece of marketing material  called  “The \nHybrid Approach to Collateral Evaluatio n: Artificial Intelligence and Street Smarts” \n(“The Hybrid Approach”).  (See Melendez Decl., Ex . A (“The Hybrid Approach”).)  TCF \npoints to one portion of The Hybrid Approach in particular :  \nQUALITY CONTROL  \nMarket Intelligence understands that our clients rely on our property \nevaluation and appraisal products to make important financial decisions. \nThe estimates of market value which we provide are an integral part of both \nthe loss mitigation process, and collateral underwriting for consumer \nlending.  Quality is a function of teamwork, all hands in the organization \nworking together focused on the same  goal; serving the client.  Quality \nControl begins with the careful selection and supervision of our field agents \nand continues through a 100% review process by qualified real estate \nanalysts and appraisers  . . . . The Market Intelligence Quality Control \nPolicies and Procedures Manual, which thoroughly outli nes the Market \nIntelligence Property Evaluation Quality Assurance Program and the \nMarket Intelligence Appraisal Quality Assurance Program, is available \nupon request.  \n CASE 0:11-cv-02717-JRT-LIB   Document 92   Filed 10/14/14   Page 5 of 31- 6 - (Id. at 17  (emphasis added) .)  TCF’s  arguments rely most significantly on the \nportion in emphasis  – that qualified real estate agents and appraisers were involved \nin a quality review process for FAVs.  It also points to another , similar  statement \nin The Hybrid Approach:  \n100% QUALITY REVIEW:  \nAll evaluations and appraisals are reviewed for quality as part of the MI \nprocess.  Field work is reviewed and signed off by a qualified real estate \nappraiser .  Random audits of field data are also conducted as part of an \nongoing review process.  \n \n(Id. at 4.)  The Hybrid Approach also contains language stating that “[w]ith over 15,000 \nappraisers and real estate professionals, and its proprietary vendor management system, \n[Market] can deliver a wide range of collateral evaluation products  within competitive \ntime frames, ” and includes a chart comparing different valuation products, in which \n“FAV drive -by” is distinguished from “Appraiser drive -by.”  (Id. at 2, 5.) \n TCF points to deposition testimony indicating that, in contrast to the statement in \nThe Hybrid Ap proach that its “estimates of market value” are put “t hrough a 100% \nreview process by qualified real estate analysts and appraisers ,” (The Hybrid Approach \n17), FAVs were not reviewed or quality -checked by a licensed real estate appraiser.  \nMarket’s manager  of quality control for evaluation products testified in her deposition as \nfollows:  \nQ:  [W]as there any point in the FAV review process for the FAVs that \nwere produced by TCF that involved an appraiser?  \nA:  Not - for the FAVs for TCF, not in the - they - you know, no appraisal \nlicense. These were not the appraisal product.  They were an alternative \nproduct.   I’m not aware of appraisers.  \n \n(Melendez Decl., Ex. S (Dep. o f Ellen Silverstein) 56 -57.) CASE 0:11-cv-02717-JRT-LIB   Document 92   Filed 10/14/14   Page 6 of 31- 7 -  \nB. Evidence of Reliance  on the Hybrid Approach  \nTCF argues that its “assent to the Agreement was induced by” these  statements in \nThe Hybrid Approach and that “TCF would not have entered into the Agreement but for” \nthese statements.  (Pl.’s Mem. in Supp. of Mot. for Partial Summ. J. at 4, May 1, 2014, \nDocket No. 60.)  In support of this claim , it cites to the affidavit of its in -house counsel \nand Chief Compliance Officer, Douglass Hiatt.  ( See Hiatt Aff. ¶  7 (“TCF’s assent to the \nAgreement was induced by Market Intelligence’s false statements.  TCF would not have \nentered into the Agreement but for Market Intelligence’s false statements.”).)   \nIt is not entirely clear  how and when TCF obtained The Hybrid Approach .  Hiatt \ntestified that he had two copies of The Hybrid Approach  in his file, one of which he \nreceived from Meyer .  Hiatt  testified that he received that copy in December 2001 when \nMeyer a sked him to review the contract  and that while he was negotiating the contract he \n“would have had the materials and . . . scanned through them, yes.”  (Melendez Dec l., \nEx. T (Dep. o f Doug lass Hiatt (“Hiatt Dep.”)) 27 4-75.)  Tim Meyer testified that he \nrecalled seeing some documents that he received in 2001 or 2002, although he was not \nentirely sure wh ich materials.  (Meyer Dep. 88 -89.)  He testified that what he reca lled \nstanding out from the marketing materials in connection with TCF’s “retention of \nMarket” was :  \nProbably the biggest thing that I recall is them talking about that they have \nthis network of 15,000 appraisers and real estate professionals who are the \nones that do their FAV inspections. And I placed a lot of reliance on it. It \nwasn’t just anybody, it was a real estate professional or appraisal (sic) was \nphysically driving by the property to validate the value.  \n CASE 0:11-cv-02717-JRT-LIB   Document 92   Filed 10/14/14   Page 7 of 31- 8 - (Id. at 89 .)  This appears to be a reference  to a portion of The Hybrid Approach , although \nMeyer also stated he believed the marketing materials he received in 2001 contained a \nprice list, (id. at 21 -23), and there is no price list in The Hybrid Approach.  \n \nIV. TCF’S CONCERNS ABOUT FAVS  \nNot long after executing the Agreement, TCF noticed problems with the FAVs it \npurchased from Market.   \n \nA. Mara Letter in 2002  \nTCF first raised concerns about FAVs with Market on August 29, 2002, when \nMeyer sent a letter to Ted Mara  at Market  regarding a disc repancy TCF discovered \nbetween a property’s FAV and appraisal value.  The letter stated:  \nAttached is a Field Asset Verification done by Market Intelligence in \nAugust 2002.  This account was caught by one of my Regional Managers \nand raises some questions that I hope you can shed some light on  . . . . A \ncustomer purchased the property one year ago for $149,000 and the county \nassessed tax value is $120,000.  The customer estimated the property value \nat $235,000 and TCF subsequently ordered a FAV.  The FAV ca me back at \na value of $210,000  . . . . We acknowledge that Minnesota has had higher \nthan normal appreciation as compared to other markets in the country, but \ngiven the significant value increase, my Regional Manager, at our own \nexpense, ordered a full appr aisal on the property which subsequently was \ncompleted and valued the property at $165,000  . . . . I would appreciate it if \nyou could help us reconcile the significant difference between the FAV \nvalue and the appraisal.  It seems unlikely that there would be this much \ndisparity in the values, since in the FAV process, a real estate broker or \nappraiser is actually the one doing the driveby.  I would appreciate a \nresponse in writing such that we can continue to have comfort level [sic] \nwith the quality of wor k that Market I ntelligence does in our market.  \n   \n(Melendez Decl., Ex. E.)   Meyer testified that Mara did not respond in writing but that he \nrecalls “[t]hat [he] received a phone call from [Mara] and describing this as an aberration, CASE 0:11-cv-02717-JRT-LIB   Document 92   Filed 10/14/14   Page 8 of 31- 9 - reassuring [Meyer] on the quality review process that [Market has] reinforcing the \nsoundness of [Market’s] work.”  (Meyer Dep. 49.)  Neither party has produced  any notes \ntaken during that phone call.  Although TCF has not established Hiatt’s personal \nknowledge of this phone cal l, Hiatt stated in his affidavit that Market “responded to \nMr. Meyer’s letter by assuring TCF that Market Intelligence was not engage in practices \nthat would produce a ‘significant difference between the FAV value and the appraisal’ in \nother cases.”  (Hiat t Aff. ¶  15 (it is not clear what Hiatt is quoting).)  TCF argues that this \nresponse was fraudulent and the proper response for Mara to make at this time would \nhave been to explain that no appraisers were involved in the quality review  process.  \n(Pl.’s Mem  in Supp. of Mot. for Partial Summ. J.  at 23 -24.)  TCF also asserts that Market \n“intended to induce TCF’s continued reliance upon Market Intelligence’s assurances so \nthat TCF would keep ordering Field Asset Valuations.”  (Hiatt Aff. ¶ 16.)  According to \nMeyer, Mara ’s statements to him  in that call convinced Meyer to continue using Market’s \nFAVs for nearly three years after the phone call : when asked if he was satisfied with \nMara’s response, he answered “[y]es.  That’s why we continued to use him.”   (Meyer \nDep. 57.)   \n \nB. Developments in 2004  \nBeginning in early 2004, borrowers began to approach TCF to refinance their \nloans to account for appreciating real estate prices in Minnesota, which required full \nappraisals.  ( Id. at 52 -53.)  This led TCF to discover signi ficant discrepancies between \nFAV and appraisal values for many properties, with FAV values being consistently \nhigher than the appraisal value.  (Id. at 53.)  Meyer testified that :  CASE 0:11-cv-02717-JRT-LIB   Document 92   Filed 10/14/14   Page 9 of 31- 10 - One of the things that we saw in early 2004 is that loans where we had \noriginated them using the FAV to start with, it may b e up against the dollar \nthreshold, that we had to do a full appraisal, that we began to see appraisal \nvalues coming in significantly different, lower, than what we saw for the \nFAVs at the time we originated some loans. . . . So I originate a loan to you \nin 2002.  The FAV said your house is worth a hundred thousand.  In the \nbeginning of 2004 you say I want to increase my loan, maybe I want to go \nup to a hundred percent loan to value, and then we say okay, we’r e going to \ndo an appraisal on the house and the appraisal came in at 50,000.  \n \n(Id. at 52 -53.)  He testified that this information came to his attention from regional \nmanagers in their normal course of approving loans.  ( Id. at 53.)  He said that when such \nconcerns were brought to his attention , \n[t]ypically what I would do is at that point in 2004, whenever that started, I \njust use the phrase early, became concerned about whether or not using \nQCEs or FAV was an appropriate way to value properties.  And so [we] \nbegan accumulating instances where there was that disparity in values, and \nthen at some point in 2004 I did share that with our credit quality review \narea to ask for their input on that.  \n \n(Id. at 54.)   \nOn July 8, 2004, an individual within TCF sent a memo to Meyer and copying \nother TCF personnel regarding AVM2 and FAV valuation methods.  (Defs.’ Ex., Ex. 10.)  \nThe memo states that “FAVs are the ones that had a majority of values in excess of \n100%” and “only 52% of Market Intelligence’s (MI) AVMs were l ess than 100%.”  (Id.)  \nThe memo further  states that “[t]he results suggest that HVEs are generally a good \nmeasure of value in Minnesota whereas the FAV finding supports the inclusion of that \nvaluation method in a more conservative LTV matrix,” and that [t ]hese findings are \n                                              \n2 An AVM is a product similar to an FAV, except that it does not include a drive -by or \nreview by a qualified real estate agent or analyst .  (See The Hybrid Approach 7.)  Some AVMs \nare c alled “insured AVMs,” which means there is some guaranty the value provided in the AVM \nis accurate.  (Rohde Dep. 55.) AVMs are not at issue in this case . CASE 0:11-cv-02717-JRT-LIB   Document 92   Filed 10/14/14   Page 10 of 31- 11 - substantially different than what we found in our AVM study a couple of months ago.”  \n(Id.)  The memo observes th at the “reasons for the dispari ty are unclear, but  may \ninclude  . . . [d]ifferent models used by Market Intelligence for the two studies [AVM and \nFAV].  There is no obvious evidence of this but the large difference in results beg[s] the \nquestion.”  ( Id.)   \nMeyer testified in response to a question about why Powers sent this analysis, that \n“we had  . . . begun to see properties wh ere we had originated a loan using an FAV later \nthan when we did appraisals, seeing significant disparities in values, and I believe I had \nsent him a summary of those loans showing the difference in values. ”  (Meyer Dep. 61.)  \nWhen asked what he recalled d oing after receiving the memo, Meyer responded “[t]he \nonly thing I’ll say is ultimately this culminated in us terminating our contract with Market \nIntelligence.  This whole process.”  ( Id. at 63.)  He agreed to a clarification that the \n“process” he referre d to “began sometime early in 2004 and  . . . continued to July of 2004 \nwhen you’re finding what you’ve described as being differences between appraised \nvalues and prior FAVs,” and explained that this finding led him to terminate the \nagreement with Market b ecause  he “just no longer trusted the FAV values” and had \n“ultimately lost faith in [FAVs] as a valuation method.”  ( Id. at 63 -64.)  When asked \nwhether he had any communication with anyone at Market about his loss of faith or to \nseek an explanation about t he differences , he said no and explained , “[b]ecause I’d \nalready had a conversation about my concerns, you know, in a prior year, and at that \npoint, you know, my - my conclusions were based on fact, where there was so many \ndisparities in values that I lost  confidence and I really wasn’t interested in hearing another CASE 0:11-cv-02717-JRT-LIB   Document 92   Filed 10/14/14   Page 11 of 31- 12 - confidence speech or slick sales pitch about why that was still a good thing to use.”  ( Id. \nat 64.)   \nOther evidence in the record includes a memo to Meyer dated September  8, 2005 , \nwhich  summariz es a file review in which the customer had a loan originating in 2003 \nwith a n FAV of $235 ,000, “based on the customer’s  estimated value of $75,000 at the \ntime,” for which TCF had recently received an appraisal of $142,000.  ( Id., Ex. 12.)  The \nmemo  observed: “[i]nteresting that the customer’s estimated value would’ve ballooned to \n$275,000,” and that “[it] is situations like these that validate our decision not to use \nordinary automated property values and I beli eve using the insured automated va luation \nmethod has eliminated any risk of originating loans where we would be in a similar \nsituation.”  ( Id.) \nOn February 11, 2005, Meyer sent a letter to Market indicating that TCF would be \nterminating the agreement on June 11, 2005, pursuant to the Agree ment.  (Defs.’ Ex., \nEx. 11.)  By the time of the cancellation, TCF had ordered 2,989 FAVs from Market \nIntelligence, which were used to initiate loans totaling $300 million.  (Hiatt Aff.  ¶¶ 13, \n18-19.)  Since then,  TCF has continued to discover additional F AVs that it believes \nMarket preformed improperly.   (Id. ¶ 19.)  \n \nV. POST -CANCELLATION OF THE AGREEMENT  \n On August 11, 2008, an attorney for TCF sent a letter to Market labeled \n“Re: Claim of TCF National Bank for damages for breach of contract between Market \nIntelligence, Inc. and TCF National Bank,” referring a “claim against [Market] for \ndamages suffered as a result of [Market’s] breach of the contract.”  ( Defs.’ Ex. , Ex.  13 at CASE 0:11-cv-02717-JRT-LIB   Document 92   Filed 10/14/14   Page 12 of 31- 13 - 88.)  The letter described the factual basis for the claim as “mortgages that have  been \nforeclosed upon, are in the process of foreclosure, or have such low actual value that TCF \nabandoned the property because it was not economically feasible to foreclose,” that “ TCF \nissued the loans secured by[] the mortgages . . . based on the appraisa ls provided through \n[Market],” (id.), and that “there is a very significant difference between most of the \nappraisals obtained through [Market] as compared to the appraised values TCF obtained \nfrom other appraisers after  defaults on the mortgage loans .” (Id. at 89.)  The letter states \n“I believe that the facts [in the spreadsheets] clearly establish that the appraisals obtained \nthrough Market Intelligence under the contract attached as Tab 1 were the result of gross \nnegligence.”  ( Id.)   \nOn April 2, 2010, Claire Graupmann of TCF created a memo summarizing six \nFAVs and concluding that they were all performed in a grossly negligent manner.  \n(Melendez Decl., Ex. G  at 1.)  Specifically, she found that some of the FAVs used \ncomparables that wer e significantly older than the subject property, ignored potential \ncomparable sales within the same building  or on the same street , and failed to consider \ndamage to a house that was visible from the street.  ( Id. at 2 -3.)   \n \nVI. THIS ACTION  \nA. Procedural History  \nTCF filed this action on September 21, 2011, initially bringing  eight claims  \nagainst Defendants : fraudulent inducement, negligent appraisal, gross negligence, fraud, \nconsumer fraud, deceptive trade practices, interference with business, and breach of the \nduty of good faith and fair dealing.  (Compl., Sept. 21, 2011, Docket No. 1.)  Defendants  CASE 0:11-cv-02717-JRT-LIB   Document 92   Filed 10/14/14   Page 13 of 31- 14 - moved to dismiss, and the Court dismissed without prejudice the gross negligence, \nconsumer fraud, interference, and good faith and fair dealing claims.  See TCF Nat. B ank \nv. Mkt. Intelligence, Inc.  (“2012 TCF Order ”), Civ. No. 11-2717, 2012 WL 3031220 \n(D. Minn. July 25, 2012) .  TCF then filed its First Amended Complaint, bringing six \nclaims: (1) fraudulent inducement, (2) negligent appraisal, (3) breach of contract, \n(4) breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, (5) fraud, and (6) consumer \nfraud .  (First Am. Compl., Aug. 22, 2012, Docket No. 28.)  Defendants  again moved to \ndismiss, seeking dismissal of the breach of contract, consumer fraud, and good faith an d \nfair dealing claims, and the Court denied the motion.  TCF Nat. Bank v. Mkt. Intelligence, \nInc. (“2013 TCF Order ”), Civ. No . 11-2717, 2013 WL 53837 (D. Minn. Jan. 3, 2013) .   \n \nB. TCF’s Arguments  \nWith the claims now pending against Defendants , TCF generally alleges that \nMarket induced it to purchase FAVs based on false representations  – specifically the \nstatement in the Hybrid approach regarding appraiser involvement in the quality review \nprocess  – without which TCF would not have purchased FAVs from Market.  (See Pl.’s \nMem. in Supp. of Mot. for Summ. J. at 4 (citing Hiatt Aff. ¶  7).)  TCF alleges that the \nFAVs performed by Market ultimately “had grossly overestimated the value of properties \nwhos e mortgages were in default or foreclosure,” and that these infla ted values would \nhave been caught by a “competent appraiser.”  ( Id. at 9 (citing Hiatt Aff. ¶  19).)  TCF \nargues that these “inflated values in [Market]’s FAVs induced TCF to enter into loans \nthat TCF would not have entered  into if the values had been reali stic,” because without \nthe inflated values, “the mortgages would not have qualified under TCF’s underwriting CASE 0:11-cv-02717-JRT-LIB   Document 92   Filed 10/14/14   Page 14 of 31- 15 - criteria.”  ( Id. at 10 (citing Hiatt Aff. ¶  20).)   These arguments  are at the core of all six of \nTCF’s claims.   \n \nC. Instant Motions  \nAfter the Court denied the second motion to dismiss, Defendants  answered the \namended complaint and alleged numerous affirmative defenses, including failure to state \na claim, statute of limitations, and over a dozen other defenses.  (Defs.’ Answer to Pl.’s \nAm. Compl., Jan. 17, 2013, Docket No. 41.)  Defendants  now move  for summary \njudgment on all of TCF’s claims .  (Defs.’ Mot. for Summ. J., May 1, 2014, Docket \nNo. 70.)  TCF moves for partial summary judgment on its fraud -related claims  – \nfraudulent induce ment, consumer fraud, and fraud  – against Defendants  and on \nDefendants’  affirmative defenses.  (Pl.’s Mot. for Partial Summ. J., May 1, 2014, Docket \nNo. 58.)  Market also moves to exclude TCF’s expert witness, Robert H. Strachota , on \nthe grounds that his repo rt contains legal conclusions, is premised on the incorrect \ncontention that Market’s FAVs were appraisals , fail s to disclose the source of the \ninformation used in his report , and has not adequately described  his methodology .  (See \nMem. in Supp. of Mot. to Exclude Expert Testimony, May 1, 2014, Docket No. 65.)  The \nCourt concludes that all of TCF’s claims are barred by the statute of limitations, which is \nsix years for each of its claims, and that no reasonable jury could find that TCF is entitled \nto any form of tolling.  The Court will thus grant Defendants’  motion f or summary \njudgment and decline  to reach the merits of TCF’s claims or the propriety of its expert , \ndeny TCF’s motion for partial summary judgment , and deny Defendants’  motion to \nexclude TCF’s expert as moot.  CASE 0:11-cv-02717-JRT-LIB   Document 92   Filed 10/14/14   Page 15 of 31- 16 -  \nANALYSIS  \nI. STANDARD OF REVIEW  \nSummary judgm ent is appropriate where there are no genuine issues of material \nfact and the moving party can demonstrate that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of \nlaw.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a).  A fact is material if it might affect the outcome of the suit, \nand a dis pute is genuine if the evidence is such that it could lead a reasonable jury to \nreturn a verdict for either party.  Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc. , 477 U.S. 242, 248 \n(1986).  A court considering a motion for summary judgment must view the facts in the \nlight most favorable to the non -moving party and give that party the benefit of all \nreasonable inferences to be drawn from those facts.  Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith \nRadio Corp. , 475 U.S. 574, 587 (1986).  \n \nII. STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS  \nDefendants  argue that  all of TCF’s claims are barred by the six -year statute of \nlimitations.  They  argue  that TCF’s fraud claims  – fraudulent inducem ent, fraud, and \nconsumer fraud  – are barred because the evidence indicates that TCF discovered any \nbasis for a cause of action b efore September 2005 , which was six years before TCF \ncommenced this action in September 2011 .  They argue that TCF’s contract -based claims  \n– breach of contract and breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing  – are barred \nbecause the contract term inated in June 2005 and there is no evidence of fraudulent \ninducement to support tolling the state of limitations.  Finally, they argue that TCF’s \nclaim for negligent appraisal is barred because under  the applicable damages rule, CASE 0:11-cv-02717-JRT-LIB   Document 92   Filed 10/14/14   Page 16 of 31- 17 - damages on account of any  negligent appraisal would  have occurred before September \n2005.  \nTCF does not address Defendants’  arguments about when  the statute of limitations \nwould begin to run for each of its claims or types of claims under Minnesota law, but \nrather argues that the st atute of limitations should be tolled  for all of its claims  on the \nbasis  of fraudulent concealment.  TCF claims that it exercised due diligence with Meyer’s \ninquiry to Mara in 2002 about the single incidence of disparity but that Mara’s response \nfraudulent ly convinced TCF that there were no problems with Market’s FAVs, such that \n“TCF did not begin to suspect” that the FAVs were significantly different from appraisal \nvalues until 2010, and “did not learn about it in fact until discovery in this lawsuit in \nFebruary 2014.”  (Pl.’s Mem. in Opp’n to Mot. for Summ. J. at 5 -6, May  22, 2014, \nDocket No. 78 .)   \n The Court will first set out the applicable statute of limitations for each of TCF’s \nclaims.  Then, because TCF does not appear to dispute Defendants’  argumen ts regarding \nwhen those statute of limitations began  to run under Minnesota law, the Court will \naddress those issues only briefly.  The Court will then turn to TCF’s argument that all of \nthose statute of limitations periods should be tolled on account of f raudulent \nconcealment.  \n \nA. Applicable Statue of Limitations  \nAs the Court explained in its order on Defendants’  first motion to dismiss: “ A six -\nyear statute of limitations governs fraud and certain tort claims in Minnesota ” and applies \nto “contract actions and  actions based upon a liability created by statute.”   2012 TCF CASE 0:11-cv-02717-JRT-LIB   Document 92   Filed 10/14/14   Page 17 of 31- 27 - the FAVs, as is required for fraudulent concealment.  See Veldhuizen , 839 F. Supp. at \n674.  This alone is sufficient to defeat tolling on account of fraudulent concealment .  Cf. \nMarvin Lumber & Cedar Co. v. PPG Indus., Inc. , 223 F.3d 873, 878 (8th Cir. 2000)  \n(plaintiff’s “ generalized allegations that [defendant] fraudulently misrepresented” the \neffectiveness of a preservative did not “ constitute fraudulent concealment, ” where the \nplainti ff, at all times, “ had access to each of the very facts that establish Marvin ’s breach \nof contract action, namely [the preservative’s ] alleged failure to prevent rot on \ndefendant’s  products ”). \nSecond, the July 2004 memo does indicate that TCF suspected tha t the \ndiscrepancies were due to differing practices in conducting FAVs, such that a reasonabl e \njury would have expected it to investigate  these practices with Market .  The memo sent to \nMeyer in 2004 by Powers observed that the reasons for disparities betwe en FAVs and \nappraisals were unclear, but suggested that the disparities could stem from Market using \ndifferent models for FAVs as compared to AVM.  ( See Defs.’ Ex., Ex. 10.)  It is not \nclear, and the record sheds little light upon, how difficult it would h ave been for TCF to \n“independently discover the practices that Market used,” 2013 TCF Order , 2013 WL \n53837 , at *3, because TCF made no attempt whatsoever.  Where the record indicates that \nTCF suspected that Market’s methods consistently had a negative effe ct on the quality of \nFAVs but failed to make any efforts to investigate those methods, no reasonable jury \ncould find that TCF exercised reasonable diligence.5 \n                                              \n5 Defendants additionally argue that TCF has an obligation, as a consumer mortgage \nlender, to adequately test appraisal values it uses in assessing prospective mortgages, and that it \n \n (Footnote continued on next page.)  CASE 0:11-cv-02717-JRT-LIB   Document 92   Filed 10/14/14   Page 27 of 31- 28 - Finally, the record now indicates that the Mara statement did not effectively quell \nTCF’s concerns about FAVs’ reliability , because TCF developed new concerns in 2004 \nwhich led it to terminate the contract.  As of 2004 and 2005, TCF knew that many of the \nFAVs were far off from actual appraisals of the same property, but did not communicate \nwith Market about this and instead decided to terminate the Agreement on account of its \nconcerns.  The record further indicates that TCF actually contemplated bringing some \nsort of breach of contract action against Market in 2008 on account of the disparities \nbetween the FAVs and actual appraisals.  Even if the evidence did not indicate that TCF \nactually knew  about the defects in FAVs beginning in 2004 and 2005 despite Mara’s \nassurances in 2002, no reasonable jury could conclude that it would have been reasonab le \nto rely on Mara’s assurances after discovering the additional, numerous discrepancies in \n2004 and 2005.6   \n____________________________________  \n(Footnote continued.)  \n \ndid so here, which should have alerted it to the problems TCF now claims were part of \nDefendants’ development of FAVs.  TCF does not address this argument, and the Court \nconsiders it to additionally support Defe ndants’ arguments on the issue of fraudulent \nconcealment, but that it is not dispositive.    \n \n6 TCF points to Thompson v. Lutheran Bhd ., Civ. No. 01 -2433, 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS \n26513 (D. Minn. Oct. 23, 2003), for the proposition that a buyer or customer’s a larm at a product \nreturning less value than anticipated does not amount to knowledge of a defect or trigger a duty \nto investigate for the purposes of tolling on the basis of fraudulent concealment.  ( See Pl.’s Mem. \nin Opp’n to Mot. for Summ. J. at 7-9.)  T here, the court considered a variety of fraud and \nnegligent misrepresentation claims brought after plaintiffs, upon the guidance of defendant \nfinancial advisor, surrendered one life insurance policy for newer policies and the value of the \nnew policies decl ined.  Thompson , 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 26513, at *2 -4.  The court denied the \ndefendant’s motion to dismiss, finding that the plaintiffs’ complaint adequately alleged facts \nupon which it could be found that the defendant made representations which concealed  defects \nwith the policies and that plaintiffs did not have knowledge of those defects and exercised \nreasonable diligence in seeking to uncover those problems.  Id. at *22 -25.  Specifically, the court \nheld that the fact that one plaintiff was “alarmed” whe n he received an update on his policies did \n \n (Footnote continued on next page.)  CASE 0:11-cv-02717-JRT-LIB   Document 92   Filed 10/14/14   Page 28 of 31- 29 - TCF argues that, although it may have known of the disparities  in 2004 and 2005 , \nit did not know about the specific falsity with regard to the appraiser involvement in \nquality review, w hich it claims it  did not discover until 2010 and did not confirm until \n2014.  But the “facts constituting” TCF’s  claims , see Hope , 457 F.3d at 790,  for the \npurposes of fraudulent concealment  are not limited to the allegation that Market \nmisrepresented the extent of appraiser involvement in developing FAVs.  That is the \nbasis of TCF’s fraud -related claims discussed above, but TCF’s contract and negligen t \nappraisal claims  are based on a wide variety of defects with the FAVs: that they did not \ninclude  enough information, they were negligently made because they ignored relevant \npieces of information, and Market assur ed TCF  that its practices generally would  not \nproduce a “significant difference” between the FAV value and the appraisal value.  (First \nAm. Compl. ¶¶ 50-51, 64 -65.)  These are the facts constituting TCF’s claims, and TCF \n____________________________________  \n(Footnote continued.)  \n \nnot “provide him actual notice of his claims based on a failure to disclose,” and instead merely \nindicated that he might have been damaged.  Id. at *23 -24.  The court found that even if the \nalarm triggered a duty  to investigate, there was a fact question not amenable to disposition on a \nmotion to dismiss as to whether the plaintiffs could have discovered the basis of their claims \nsooner because, after receiving the alarming update, the plaintiff “ did attempt to ma ke a \nreasonable investigation.”  Id. at *26 (emphasis added).  The Court is not persuaded that this case \ncounsels in favor of fraudulent concealment here, or specifically that TCF’s observation of \nnumerous problems with FAVs in 2004 did not trigger a duty to investigate further.  An \nindividual’s alarm at the decreasing value of a life insurance policy is very different from a \nnational bank’s internal discovery, upon analysis and comparison of appraisal and appraisal \nalternative results, that one alternative  to appraisal consistently results in higher value estimates.  \nA reasonable jury could conclude that the former is not notice of any actual defect (life insurance \npolicies drop in value without wrongdoing), and that it therefore does not trigger a duty to \ninvestigate.  Here, where TCF relied upon appraisals or appraisal alternatives for its consumer \nlending business and took care to monitor the reliability of various methods of those estimates, \nno reasonable jury could conclude that it was reasonable to not  investigate the possible reasons \nfor the disparate values produced by FAVs.  CASE 0:11-cv-02717-JRT-LIB   Document 92   Filed 10/14/14   Page 29 of 31- 30 - has not presented sufficient evidence to permit a reasonable jury to find th at TCF did not \nor should not have known these facts before September 2005.   \nIn sum, TCF was actually aware of the defects giving rise to its claims  – the \nfrequent disparity between FAV and appraisal values  – before September 2005.  Given \nTCF’s renewed con cerns about FAV reliability in 2004 and 2005, no reasonable jury \ncould conclude that not further investigating the cause of these problems was an exercise \nof due diligence or that it was reasonable to decline to investigate on account of Mara’s \nresponse to  Meyer’s letter in 2002.   \nThe Court thus concludes that TCF is not entitled to tolling on the grounds of \nfraudulent concealment and will grant  Market’s motion for summary judgment on the \ngrounds that the statutes of limitations bar all of TCF’s claims.   Because the Court \ndismisses all of TCF’s claims on statute of limitations grounds, it need not address the \nparties’ arguments regarding the merits of TCF’s claims  and will deny both TCF’s partial \nmotion for summary judgment7 and Market’s motion to exclude T CF’s expert as moot.  \n \nORDER  \nBased on the foregoing, and all the files, records, and proceedings herein, IT IS \nHEREBY ORDERED that: \n1. Defendants ’ Motion for Summary Judgment  [Docket No. 70] is \nGRANTED . \n                                              \n7 To the extent that, as part of its partial motion for summary judgment, TCF argues that \nMarket has waived its statute of limitations argument, the Court concludes that this def ense was \nadequately raised and is not waived.

(\"Iris\"), which sought to file a late malpractice claim against Heller Ehrman LLP (\"Heller\") related to issues surrounding a patent application for an AI system for genetic analysis. The court upheld the bankruptcy court's decision to deny Iris's motion to allow a late filing, emphasizing that Heller provided multiple warnings to Iris about protecting its patent rights, and Iris's delay in filing the claim was deemed within its reasonable control.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue:** Whether Iris should be allowed to file a late malpractice claim against Heller due to excusable neglect.\n\n3. **Court's Holding:** The court affirmed the bankruptcy court's decision, concluding that the delays in filing the claim were within the reasonable control of Iris and did not constitute excusable neglect. Therefore, Iris's motion to allow a late malpractice claim was denied.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation:** Imagine you have a friend who's supposed to keep an eye on your pet, but they forget to look after it properly. Despite them telling you multiple times that they can't take care of the pet anymore and that you should find someone else, you ignore the reminders, thinking everything's fine. Later, when you want to complain about your friend's care, the rules say you waited too long to speak up. This case is similar: a company took too long to complain about their lawyer's work on a patent, even though the lawyer gave plenty of heads-up, and the company could have prevented the problem by acting earlier. The court agreed with the earlier decision that the company's delay wasn't excusable.",

(“Iris”), from the bankruptcy court’s order, datedNovember 15, 2012, denying Iris’s motion to allow a late filing of a malpractice claim. Appellee and debtor, Heller Ehrman LLP (“Heller”), has moved to strike certain documents thatIris submitted in support of the appeal.  Pursuant to Civil Local Rule 16-4, the Court deems thiscase submitted on the papers without oral argument.  After review of the record on appeal,consideration of the parties’ papers, and the relevant legal authority, the Court hereby GRANTSHeller’s motion to strike and AFFIRMS the bankruptcy court’s judgment.\nBACKGROUND\nSimon Chin (“Chin”) founded Iris on February 16, 1999, and acted as President and\nCEO  of the company.  (Deposition of Simon Chin (“Chin Depo”) at 11:16-17.)\n1  Heller\npreviously represented Iris in various patent and corporate matters.  (Record on Appeal (“RA”)45, Declaration of Shelley Salinero (“Salinero Decl.”), ¶ 3.)  James Fox (“Fox”), a formerCase 3:12-cv-06232-JSW   Document 20   Filed 08/12/13   Page 1 of 13United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n2associate at Heller, handled Iris’s patent matters and Bruce Jennet (“Jennet”), a former partner\nat Heller, handled Iris’s corporate matters. (RA 45, Salinero Decl., ¶¶ 3-4.)\nIn 2000, Iris applied to the United States Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”) for a\npatent on its artificial intelligence system for genetic analysis.  (RA 18, Corrected Declarationof Simon Chin (“Corrected Chin Decl.”), ¶ 4.)  On April 7, 2006, Iris directed Fox to file apatent continuation application, No. 11/399,733 (“PCA 11/399,733”), to broaden the scope of\nclaims advanced in the original patent.  ( Id., ¶ 5.)  The USPTO issued Iris’s original patent on\nJune 13, 2006.  ( Id., ¶ 4.)\nOn August 16, 2007, Iris received a letter from Heller entitled “Disengagement As\nCounsel To Iris Biotechnologies, Inc,” (“Disenga gement Letter”), which purported to confirm\nthat Heller would no longer act as Iris’s counsel .  (Chin Depo. at 78:19-25; Chin Depo., Ex. 8.) \nOn September 4, 2007, Jennet e-mailed Chin to wish him well.  (Chin Depo., Ex. 11.)  Chinreplied and acknowledged Heller’s work throughout the years.  (Chin Depo. at 117:2-13.)  OnNovember 5, 2007, Heller submitted a request to the USPTO seeking to withdraw as Iris’spatent attorney of record.  (RA 7, Declaration of Simon Chin (“Chin Decl.”), Ex. D.) \nOn November 21, 2007, Heller e-mailed Iris (“November E-mail”) to follow up on the\nDisengagement Letter and requested instructions as to whom to transfer Iris’s patent files. (Chin Depo. at 117:15-118:11; Chin Depo., Ex. 12.)  On December 10, 2007, after it did notreceive a response from Iris about whom to transfer the files, Heller forwarded Iris’s originalpatent files to Chin’s attention.  (Chin Depo. at 118:5-9; Chin Depo., Ex. 13.)  Heller deliveredand included documents relating to PCA 11/399,733 in the package of transferred materials. (Chin Depo, Exs. 12-13.)  Heller also drafted a letter (“Transfer Letter”) that advised Iris to fileall necessary change of address and powers of attorney forms with the USPTO for all matters\nincluded in those materials.  (Chin Depo., Ex. 13.)  Subsequently, on December 20, 2007, Chine-mailed Fox to challenge and question Heller’s competence as a law firm in handling Iris’slegal matters.  (Chin Depo. at 135:23-140:1; Chin Depo, Ex. 14.)  \nOn March 13, 2008, the USPTO denied Heller’s request to withdraw as Iris’s USPTO\nattorney of record.  (RA 8, Chin Decl., Ex. E.)  The USPTO sent notices to both Heller andCase 3:12-cv-06232-JSW   Document 20   Filed 08/12/13   Page 2 of 13United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n3Chin.  ( Id.)  On March 21, 2008, the USPTO issued a notice of a non-final rejection of PCA\n11/399,733 (“2008 Rejection Notice”) and advised that a timely filed Terminal Disclaimercould be used to overcome the non-final rejection of PCA 11/399,733.  (RA 9, Chin Decl., Ex.F at 4.)  Because Iris never filed change of a ddress and power of attorney forms, the USPTO\nsent the 2008 Rejection Notice to Heller.  ( Id. at 2.)  On April 4, 2008, Heller allegedly\nforwarded Chin the original 2008 Rejection Notice and warned Chin that Heller no longerhandled Iris’s patent matters.  (RA 33, Declaration of Richard Anderson, ¶ 5, Ex. B.)  Thebankruptcy court concluded that the record did not support a finding that Iris received this\ndocument.  (RA 68, Nov. 15, 2012 Hearing Tr. at 6:11-15.)\nOn October 7, 2008, the USPTO issued a notice of abandonment of PCA 11/399,733\n(“2008 Abandonment Notice”) for failure to respond to the 2008 Rejection Notice.  (RA 13,Chin Decl., Ex. J.)  On October 10, 2008, Heller allegedly sent a letter to Chin that enclosed the2008 Abandonment Notice from the USPTO and notified him again that Heller had ceased tohandle Iris’s legal matters.  (RA 51, Declaration of Jennifer Vail, ¶ 4, Ex. B.)  The bankruptcycourt also concluded that the record would not support a finding that Iris received thisdocument.  (RA 68, Nov. 15, 2012 Hearing Tr. at 6:19-23.)\nOn December 28, 2008, Heller filed for bankruptcy relief.  (RA 45, Salinero Decl., ¶ 7.) \nChin first learned about the Heller bankruptcy from the news.  (Chin Depo. at 87:3-9.)  By\n2009, Iris ceased to communicate with anyone from Heller regarding its legal matters.  ( Id. at\n151:14-21.)  In fact, after Chin learned about Heller’s bankruptcy, Chin neither attempted topersonally contact Heller nor requested that anyone on his behalf contact Heller.  ( Id. at 153:12-\n15.)\nIn 2009, Iris retained John Jeffrey (“Jeffrey”), a Canadian patent attorney, to correspond\nwith the Canadian Patent Office and review the prosecution of related United States andEuropean patent applications.  (Chin Depo. at 220:4-20; Chin Depo, Ex. 27.)  In 2009, Jeffrey\nforwarded a report to Chin that detailed the status of Iris’s United States and European patentapplications and that included informati on about PCA 11/399,733.  (Chin Depo. at 233:1-25.) \nChin did not review these materials until June 2011, due to “more important things.”  ( Id. atCase 3:12-cv-06232-JSW   Document 20   Filed 08/12/13   Page 3 of 13United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n4260:5-8.)  Once Chin reviewed Jeffrey’s report, Ch in instructed Jeffrey to apply for re-issuance\nand broadening of a Canadian patent with the Canadian patent office.  ( Id. at 265:22-266:6.) \nThe Canadian patent covered the same invention set forth in PCA 11/399,733.  ( Id. at 157:1-6.) \nAs a result of Jeffrey’s attempt to re-issue and broaden the Canadian patent, in August 2011,Jeffrey reported back to Iris that PCA 11/399,733 had been abandoned.  ( Id. at 266:2-5; Chin\nDepo. Exs. 4, 21.)\nOn April 23, 2012, Chin contacted Tom Willoughby (“Willoughby”), counsel for the\nHeller Creditors Committee, to discuss his view that Iris had a malpractice claim against Heller. (Corrected Chin Decl., ¶ 17.)  Willoughby informed Chin that the deadline to file a malpracticeclaim expired on April 27, 2009.  (Chin Depo. at  188:20-25., Chin Depo., Ex. 23.)  On April 30,\n2012, Iris sent Willoughby a letter outlining Iris’s malpractice claim against Heller.  (ChinDepo., Ex. 4.)  Willoughby referred the matter to special counsel for the bankruptcy planadministrator, and, on June 11, 2012, the special counsel rejected Iris’s malpractice claim citingto Iris’s failure to file a claim before the claims bar deadline.  (Chin Depo., Ex. 23.)  The specialcounsel also rejected Iris’s malpractice claim because Iris filed an untimely claim thatcontravened Heller’s approved bankruptcy plan order and because Heller would experienceprejudice from the delayed claim.  ( Id.)\nOn August 20, 2012, Iris filed a motion to allow a late filing of a malpractice claim in\nthe United States Bankruptcy Court for the Northe rn District of California.  (RA 1, Iris Motion\nto Allow Late Filing.)  Following oral argument,  the bankruptcy court denied Iris’s motion and\nset forth its finding on the record.  (RA 68, N ov. 15, 2012 Hearing Tr. at 3:22.)  On November\n20, 2012, the bankruptcy court issued an order that denied Iris’s malpractice claim for thereasons set forth on the record.  ( Id.)  \nThe Court will address additional facts as necessary in the analysis.\nANALYSIS\nA. Heller’s Motion to Strike.\nHeller moves to strike two documents submitted by Iris that it claims are not part of the\nrecord on appeal.  Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure 8006 provides that the record onCase 3:12-cv-06232-JSW   Document 20   Filed 08/12/13   Page 4 of 13United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n5appeal “shall include the items designated by the parties, the notice of appeal, the judgment,\norder, or decree appealed from, and any opinion, fi ndings of fact, and conclusions of law of the\ncourt.”  Papers not filed with the bankruptcy court or admitted into evidence by that court arenot part of the bankruptcy clerk’s record a nd cannot be part of the record on appeal.  Cf.\nKirshner v. Uniden Corporation of America , 842 F.2d 1074, 1077 (9th Cir. 1988) (noting\nsimilarly that papers not filed in the district court or admitted into evidence by that district courtare not part of the district clerk’s record and cannot be part of the record on appeal).\n1. Exhibit 3 to the February Declaration of Daniel R. Sterrett.In support of its opening brief, Iris submitted a declaration from Daniel R. Sterrett, dated\nFebruary 1, 2013.  Heller moves to strike Exhibit 3 to that declaration.  Exhibit 3 outlines thetransaction history for PCA 11/399,733 from April 2006 to January 2012.  Although Exhibit 3does not contain a bankruptcy court docket number, Iris alleges that Heller previously filed andasked for judicial notice of a similar print out from the USPTO’s website.  (RA 29, HellerRequest for Judicial Notice (“Heller RJN”), E x. 1.)  Although both documents derive from the\nUSPTO website, the parties actually submitted different documents from different tabs on thewebsite.  Because both parties neither filed nor designated Exhibit 3 with the bankruptcy court,Exhibit 3 cannot be construed as part of the record on appeal.\nAccordingly, the Court GRANTS Heller’s motion to strike Exhibit 3.  Although the\nCourt grants the motion to strike, the Court notes that the information upon which Iris sought toinclude - that Heller remained the counsel of record in the USPTO’s records until September13, 2011 - is contained within the document that Heller submitted in support of its Request forJudicial Notice.  ( See Heller RJN, Ex. 1.) \n2. Exhibit 1 to the March Declaration of Daniel R. Sterrett.Heller also moves to strike Exhibit 1 to the declaration of Daniel Sterrett, dated March\n22, 2013 (“Exhibit 1”), which Iris submitted in support of its reply brief.  Exhibit 1 detailsHeller’s billing and invoice statements to Iris for services rendered from January 1987 untilApril 2008.  Although Iris previously designated with the bankruptcy court the billingCase 3:12-cv-06232-JSW   Document 20   Filed 08/12/13   Page 5 of 13United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n6statements dated April 2008, Iris failed to file or designate with the bankruptcy court the billing\nstatements dating back to January 1987.\nIris asserts that a May 20, 2008 e-mail included an attachment of the billing statements\ndating back to January 1987.  ( See RA 12, Chin Decl., Ex. I)  Iris argues that this 2008 e-mail\nprovides sufficient grounds to incorporate the entirety of the billing statements into the recordon appeal and deny the motion to strike.  However, pursuant to Federal Rule of BankruptcyProcedure 8006, the Court cannot allow Iris to create a new record on appeal.  Cf. Kirshner , 842\nF.2d at 1077 (noting that papers not filed in the district court or admitted into evidence by thatdistrict court are not part of the record on appeal ).  The Court also notes that even if the Court\nallowed the additional billing statements into the record, it does little to further Iris’s argumentsthat Heller continued to represent Iris, notwithstanding Heller’s prior Disengagement Letter. (Compare  Sterrett Decl., Ex. 1 at 33 with Chin Depo., Ex. 8) (showing that August 31, 2007\nrepresented Heller’s last billing entry and August 16, 2007 marked the date of Heller’sdisengagement as counsel).  Accordingly, the Court GRANTS Heller’s motion to strike Exhibit\n1 insofar as it includes billing statements for dates prior to April 2008.B.  Appeal of Bankruptcy Court’s Order De nying Iris’s Motion to File a Late Claim.\n1.  Standard of Review.District courts have jurisdiction to hear  appeals from final judgments, orders, and\ndecrees of bankruptcy judges.  28 U.S.C. § 158.  The Court reviews for abuse of discretion abankruptcy court’s decision to grant or deny a motion for an extension of time to file a claim onthe grounds of excusable neglect.  See Pioneer  Inv. Services Co. v. Brunswick Associates Ltd.\nPartnership , 507 U.S. 380, 398 (1993) (“To be sure, were there any evidence of prejudice to\npetitioner or to judicial administration in this case,  or any indication at all of bad faith, we could\nnot say that the Bankruptcy Court abused its discretion in declining to find the neglect to beexcusable.”) (internal citations omitted); cf. Pincay v. Andrews , 389 F. 3d 853, 858 (9th Cir.\n2004) (reviewing district court’s decision to gran t motion for extension of time to file appeal\nbased upon excusable neglect for abuse of discretion”).  The Court must affirm unless it has thedefinite and firm conviction that the lower court committed a clear error of judgment in theCase 3:12-cv-06232-JSW   Document 20   Filed 08/12/13   Page 6 of 13United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n2The other factors under Pioneer  and Pincay  requires the bankruptcy court to\nexamine the danger of prejudice to the debtor, the length of the delay and its potential impacton judicial proceedings, and the good faith intentions of the movant.  See Pioneer , 507 U.S.\nat 395; see also Pincay , 389 F.3d at 858.  Iris does not specifically dispute the bankruptcy\ncourt’s conclusions with respect to these factors.  The Court also finds that the bankruptcycourt did not abuse its discretion in its analysis of these factors.\n7conclusion it reached after weighing the relevant factors.  Pincay , 389 F. 3d at 858 (citing Marx\nv. Loral Corp. , 87 F. 3d 1049, 1054 (9th Cir. 1996)); see also Kode v. Carlson , 596 F.3d 608,\n612 (9th Cir. 2012) (“[W]e reverse under the abuse of discretion standard only when the district\ncourt reaches a result that is illogical, implausible, or without support in the inferences that maybe drawn from the record.”).\n2. The Bankruptcy Court Did Not Abuse its Discretion.Iris argues that the bankruptcy court erred when it denied its motion for leave to file a\nlate malpractice claim based upon excusable negl ect.  Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure\n9006(b)(1) empowers a bankruptcy court to permit a late filing if the movant’s failure to complywith an earlier deadline resulted from “excusable neglect.”  Because Congress has not providedguidance to determine what sorts of actions constitute excusable neglect, the Court’s“determination is at bottom an equitable one, taking account of all relevant circumstancessurrounding the party’s omission.”  Pioneer , 507 U.S. at 395.  These circumstances include:\n“the danger of prejudice to the debtor, the length of the delay and its potential impact on judicialproceedings, the reason for the delay, including whether it was within the reasonable control ofthe movant, and whether the movant acted in good faith.”  Id.; see also Pincay 389 F.3d at 855.\nIris only takes issue with the bankruptcy court’s application of the third Pioneer  factor – the\nreason for the delay.  Under the third Pioneer  factor, the Court must consider Iris’s reason for\nthe delay and examine whether the delay remained within Iris’s reasonable control.  See\nPioneer , 507 U.S. at 395;  Pincay , 389 F.3d at 858.\n2  \nIris contends that the record shows that Heller remained counsel of record for Iris, made\nmisrepresentations to it, omitted material information and, thus, argues that Heller actuallycaused Iris’s delay in filing a claim.  In support of this argument, Iris relies on In re Zilog, Inc. ,\n450 F.3d 996, 1007 (9th Cir. 2006) and  Challas v. Goetz , 2007 WL 3095418 (Bankr. N.D. Cal.Case 3:12-cv-06232-JSW   Document 20   Filed 08/12/13   Page 7 of 13United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n8Oct. 19, 2007).  However, in In re Zilog , the court of appeals found excusable neglect based\nupon affirmatively misleading e-mails sent by Zilog attorneys that caused Zilog employees tofile untimely claims.  450 F.3d at 1006-1007.  In this case, and despite remaining counsel ofrecord under the USPTO, Heller never relayed misleading statements.  Rather, it repeatedlyadvised Iris to protect its rights in, for example, the Disengagement Letter, the November E-mail, and the Transfer Letter.  The bankruptcy court also noted that Chin knew of Heller’sdissolution, thought Heller lacked competence, and knew that information about Iris’ patentsexisted on the USPTO website.  This Court cannot say it was implausible for the bankruptcy toconclude on that factual record that Heller was not the reason Iris delayed in seeking to file alate malpractice claim.  \nThe Court also finds Iris’ reliance on Challas  inapposite.  There, the court addressed\nwhether a cause of action was discharged, pursuant to 11 U.S.C Section 1141(d), uponconfirmation of a bankruptcy plan.  The answ er to that question depended upon whether the\ncreditor had a “fair contemplation” that he might have had a claim against the debtor beforeconfirmation.  Challas  does not address or make rulings on what sort of actions constitutes\nexcusable neglect.  To the extent Iris relies on Challas  to argue that it was not aware of a\npotential malpractice claim until well after Heller filed for bankruptcy, the Court finds Challas\ndistinguishable on its facts.\nAs the bankruptcy court recognized, Heller provided Iris with multiple warnings that it\nshould protect itself in order to avoid experi encing prejudice to its rights.  (RA 68, Nov. 15\nHearing Tr. at 8:17-11:7.)  Again, by way of example: the August 2007 disengagement letter\nsevering the attorney-client relationship between Heller and Iris; the November 2007 e-mailinquiring where to transfer Iris’s legal files; the December 2007 delivery of Iris’s patent files;\nand finally, the clear understanding that Heller filed for Chapter 11 dissolution in 2009.  ( Id.) \nFor the reasons outlined below, the Court finds that the bankruptcy court did not abuse itsdiscretion when it concluded that these warnings supported its conclusion that Iris caused itsown delay in filing a claim as well as exerted reasonable control over the delay.  Case 3:12-cv-06232-JSW   Document 20   Filed 08/12/13   Page 8 of 13United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n9First, the bankruptcy court noted that th e Disengagement Letter provided significant\ncaution to Iris.  In particular, Heller explicitly stated that it would “no longer act as counsel toIris Biotechnologies, Inc., and [Heller would] have no further responsibility to render legalservices in connection therewith.”  (Chin Depo., Ex. 8.)  Heller did not, however, that it would\n“remain available to confer with [Iris] or [Iris’ s] new attorney to the extent necessary to avoid\nprejudice to [Iris’s] rights.”  ( Id.)  Moreover, Heller advised Iris that, “in connection with the\ntermination of [Heller’s] services for Iris, [He ller would], ... deliver files to [Iris], or to an\nattorney whom [Iris] designate[s] in writing to receive the files.”  ( Id.)  Heller explicitly\ncommunicated to Iris its view that their attorney-client relationship had not only ended but alsothat Iris needed to take steps to protect its rights.  These cautionary statements, taken as awhole, negate Iris’s contention that Heller misled Iris and prevented Iris from filing a timelymalpractice claim.  In actuality, Heller’s Disengagement Letter represents one of manywarnings that clearly informed Iris to protect its rights as well as left Iris with reasonablecontrol over filing a timely claim.\nSecond, the bankruptcy court noted that Heller warned Iris to protect its rights in its\nNovember E-mail.  In particular, Korey Mingus, a pa tent analyst at Heller, stated that “I would\nlike to take this time to follow-up with you regarding Mr. Jennett’s disengagement letter sent toyou on August 16, 2007.  We have, as of yet, not received instructions as to whom to transferthe patent files[.] ...  We are therefore now pr eparing to transfer to your attention the patent\nfiles[.] ... If you would like us to  transfer these files to the attention of someone else, please\nadvise us by November 30, 2007.”  (Chin Depo., Ex. 12.)  At a minimum, the e-mail alerted andreminded Iris that Heller had ceased to represent Iris in connection with its patent matters. Iris’s failure to provide information to Heller about where to transfer Iris’s files, despiteHeller’s several attempts to acquire such knowledge, reinforces the conclusion that Iris exertedreasonable control over the delay.\nThird, the bankruptcy court noted that Heller’s Transfer Letter, sent in conjunction with\nthe transferred patent files, represented another warning to Iris to protect its rights andemphasized that Iris exercised reasonable control over its delay.  When Heller transferred Iris’sCase 3:12-cv-06232-JSW   Document 20   Filed 08/12/13   Page 9 of 13United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n10patent files, Heller included files relating to PCA 11/399,733 in “Box 6” and stated Iris would\nbe responsible for filing all necessary change of  address forms, power of attorney forms, and\nextensions of time for all of the matters included in the transferred documents with the USPTO. (Chin Depo., Ex. 13.)  Heller also stated, “[w]e have not made copies of the files beingtransferred.  ... Also enclosed is a current docket.  The information is considered accurate, butshould not be relied on without first reviewing the files.  You should review all files promptly to\nverify the status of each matter.”  ( Id.)  Heller also provided Iris with all of Iris’s patent\ndocuments.  In an e-mail Chin sent to Fox on December 20, 2007, Chin even acknowledgedtransfer and receipt of “six boxes of papers.”   (Chin Depo., Ex. 14.)  Despite Heller’s repeated\nwarnings and cautionary letters, Iris appears to rely on its ignorance of the contents of thetransferred files as a basis to argue its neglect was excusable.  However, the bankruptcy courtnoted that the parties involved were a sophisticat ed, intellectual client and a dissolving law firm. \n(RA 68, Nov. 15 Hearing Tr. at 8:17, 9:19.)  It also noted that its conclusion \nmight have been\ndifferent if “this was simply a dispute between  a former client of an ongoing law firm.”  ( Id. at\n9:8-10.)  The Court cannot say that these facts, coupled with the warnings encompassed in theDisengagement and Transfer letters render the bankruptcy court’s conclusion “illogical,implausible, or without support in the inferences that may be drawn from the record facts.” Kode , 596 F.3d at 612.\nIn any event, in the Transfer Letter, Heller clearly suggested that Iris review its files,\nalerted Iris to take the necessary steps to ensure the proper handling of its legal matters, andwarned Iris of possible prejudice to its rights should it fail to comply.  Moreover, because Hellerno longer retained control over Iris’s original files, the Court cannot find that the bankruptcycourt abused its discretion in concluding that Iris could have taken steps to protect its owninterests, or at the very least, understood that its rights would be compromised with continuedinaction.  Iris simply failed to heed Heller’s warnings.\nFourth, the bankruptcy court noted that Chin’s knowledge of Heller’s dissolution\nwarned Iris once again of its need to protect its rights and further evidenced Iris’s control overits delay in filing a claim.  Chin testified he probably first learned about the Heller bankruptcyCase 3:12-cv-06232-JSW   Document 20   Filed 08/12/13   Page 10 of 13United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n3Kode , 596 F.3d at 612.\n11from the news.  (Chin Depo. at 151:5.)  After 2009, however, Iris ceased to communicate with\nanyone from Heller regarding its legal matters.  ( Id. at 151:17-18.)  Chin neither attempted to\npersonally contact nor requested that anyone on his behalf contact Heller.  This behavior\nreinforces that Chin not only knew about Heller’s  bankruptcy but also recognized that Heller no\nlonger represented Iris.\nFifth, the bankruptcy court also cited to the fact that Chin believed that Heller “lacked\ncompetence.”  Chin’s statement derived from an e-mail, dated December 20, 2007, that Chinsent to Fox following his receipt of Iris’s transferred patent files.  In that e-mail, Chin stated, “to\nlearn that we were not even notified about the patent that was issued to us three months ago, orabout these two Canadian Office Actions when they were received, that goes further toconfirmed [ sic] what we said a few months ago that Heller is no longer the same firm that we\nhired back in 1999.  It appears that Heller Ehrman has evolved into a firm that has problems notonly with greed, but also competence and ethics .”  (Chin Depo., Ex. 14.)  Although Iris disputes\nthat Chin’s e-mail shows that Chin believed Heller lacked competence, based on its review ofthe e-mail, the Court cannot say the bankruptcy court’s conclusion is without support.\nSixth, the bankruptcy court noted that Chin knew valuable and significant information\nabout Iris’s patents existed on the USPTO website, even if he did not know how to access it(Chin Depo. at 171:2-6.)  The bankruptcy court conc luded that those facts also showed that “the\ndelay and who had control over that delay land[ed] squarely on Iris’s lap.”  (RA 68, Nov. 15Hearing Tr. at 10:14-16.)  The Court cannot say that it was “illogical, implausible, or without\nsupport in the inferences that may be drawn from the record facts\n3,” for the bankruptcy court to\nconclude that Chin exercised significant control and had ample time to review Iris’s files,maintain Iris’s patents, and file a more timely malpractice claim.\nSeventh, and finally, the bankruptcy court noted that “had Iris attended to its own\nprotection of its own interest and come forth much more quickly, even after the claims bar dateand asked to file a late claim, then indeed [t he third factor] would weigh less heavily againstCase 3:12-cv-06232-JSW   Document 20   Filed 08/12/13   Page 11 of 13United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n4Even if the Court accepted Iris’s allegation that Iris first discovered Heller’s\nmalpractice when Jeffrey informed Iris, on August 22, 2011, that PCA 11/399,733 wasabandoned, the Court remains unpersuaded that the bankruptcy court abused its discretion inholding that Iris still should have filed a more timely malpractice claim.  Iris did not contactHeller’s creditors committee until April 23, 2012, and provides no information that wouldexplain the reason for the delay between August 2011 and April 2012.\n12[Iris] and in favor of Heller.”\n4  (Id. at 10:19-23.)  In particular, instead of reviewing the patent\nfiles Heller sent to Chin in December 2007 to protect Iris’s rights, Chin focused on and stayed“busy” with Iris’s initial public offering.  (Chin Depo. at 118:1-119:20.)  Later in 2009, whenJeffrey sent Chin a report on Iris’s intellectual properties in the U.S. and Europe, Chin “did nothave the time” to read through the reports and did not do so until 2011.  (Chin Depo. at 157:5-158:3.)  Furthermore, when Jeffrey notified Chin of the abandoned PCA \n11/399,733, Chin\ninstead responded by directing Jeffrey to reactivate his abandoned patent.  ( Id. at 156:4.) \nThough the Court understands that companies engaged in business often juggle a plethora ofresponsibilities ranging from events and activities to regulatory filings and corporate deadlines,the press of business does not justify a finding of excusable neglect.  See e.g. , Selph v. Council\nof City of Los Angeles , 593 F.2d 881, 883 (9th Cir. 1979), overruled on other grounds by  United\nArtists Corp. v. La Cage Aux Folles, Inc. , 771 F.2d 1265, 1269 (1985).  Chin’s busy schedule\nand attendance to his other priorities cannot be construed as a basis for finding excusableneglect.\nUnder Pioneer and Pincay , courts examine both the reason for Iris’s delay in filing a late\nclaim and whether Iris exerted reasonable control over the delay in filing a late claim–a point\nthat Iris ignores.  See Pioneer , 507 U.S. at 395; see also Pincay , 389 F.3d at 858.  The\nbankruptcy court properly analyzed the third factor under both prongs.  Therefore, after\nweighing all of the relevant circumstances relating to the third factor, the Court finds that thebankruptcy court did not abuse its discretion in  refusing to find excusable neglect and holding\nthat the reason for the delay, including whether it reasonably rested in the control of Iris,weighed heavily in favor of Heller and heavily against Iris.////Case 3:12-cv-06232-JSW   Document 20   Filed 08/12/13   Page 12 of 13United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n13\nCONCLUSION\nThe Court recognizes Iris must cope with a harsh result; however, the Court finds the\nbankruptcy court did not abuse its discretion in applying the factors set forth in Pioneer and\nPincay .

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) filed a motion for default judgment against Tradewale LLC and Tradewale Managed Funds for allegedly defrauding investors by misrepresenting their use of artificial intelligence in forex trading. Despite claims of high returns with minimal risk, Tradewale used customer funds for personal expenses rather than forex trading, and the court granted the CFTC's motion for default judgment due to the defendants' failure to respond to the lawsuit.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: The main legal issue is whether Tradewale LLC and Tradewale Managed Funds violated the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) and CFTC regulations by fraudulently soliciting investments and failing to register as a commodity trading advisor (CTA).\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court granted the CFTC's motion for default judgment, finding that Tradewale had defrauded investors by making false claims about using AI for trading and misappropriating funds. The court issued a permanent injunction against Tradewale, ordered restitution of $713,520 to affected customers, and imposed a civil monetary penalty triple the amount of misappropriated funds.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine you gave money to a company because they promised to use cool robots (AI) to make you a lot of money by trading currencies. Instead, they spent your money on themselves and didn't actually use any robots to trade. The government agency in charge of making sure companies tell the truth took them to court, and the court decided the company was guilty because they didn't even show up to defend themselves.

In support of the Motion, Plaintiff  filed a Memorandum \nof Law  (“Moving Br .,” ECF No. 14-1) , and a Declaration of Christopher Giglio  (“Giglio Decl.”, \nECF No. 14- 2).  The Court decides the matter without oral argument pursuant to Federal Rule of \nCivil Procedure 78 and Local Civil Rule 78.1.  For the reasons stated below, CFTC’s  Motion will \nbe GRANTED. Case 3:21-cv-17776-ZNQ-DEA   Document 21   Filed 05/04/23   Page 1 of 17 PageID: <pageID>2 \n I. BACKGROUND \nA. Factual Background1 \nCFTC  is an independent federal regulatory agency charged by Congress with the \nresponsibilities for administering and enforcing the provisions of the Commodity Exchange Act \n(“the Act” or “CEA”) and CFTC  Regulations.  ( Complaint (“ Compl.”) ¶ 15 , ECF No. 1.)   \n Defendant Tradewale LLC was a limited liability company organized in Illinois, dissolved \nin around September 2020.  ( Id. ¶ 16.)  Defendant Tradewale Managed Funds is an entity \npurportedly located in London, United Kingdom offering forex investments.  ( Id. ¶ 17.)  Tradewale \nManaged Fund has never been registered in any capacity with CFTC.  ( Id.)   \nDefendant Valdas  Dapkus (“Defendant Dapkus”)  is an individual whose last known \naddress is in Lombard, Illinois.  ( Id. ¶ 18.)  Defendant Dapkus is the sole authorized signatory for \nTradewale LLC’s United States bank accounts.  ( Id.)   \nFrom at least 2017 to in or about April 2020 (the “Relevant Period”), Tradewale used the \nmail and other means of instrumentalities of interstate commerce to engage in the business of a  \ncommodity trading advisor.  ( Id. ¶ 20.)  During the Relevant Period, Tradewale, acting through its \nofficers, employees, and agents, including Defendant Dapkus, solicited the retail public using its \nwebsite, tradewale.com.  ( Id.)  Tradewale solicited customers to deposit funds with it in order to \nachieve specific purported returns based on trading, including by trading forex.  ( Id.)  By way of \nexample, Tradewale’s Facebook page claimed its customers received over 55% APY returns based on its supposed “unique trading system.”  ( Id. ¶ 21.)  Tradewale’s Facebook page also indicated \nthat customers could trade on the market with minimal risk and investment.  ( Id.) \n \n1 For purposes of this Motion, the Court will construe the factual allegations contained within the Complaint as true.  \nComdyne I, Inc. v. Corbin, 908 F. 2d 1142, 114 9 (3d Cir. 1990).  Case 3:21-cv-17776-ZNQ-DEA   Document 21   Filed 05/04/23   Page 2 of 17 PageID: <pageID>3 \n Tradewale’s LinkedIn  page stated that it was a London- based financial services compan y \nwith four separate trading systems that had been tested in all market conditions.  ( Id. ¶ 22.)  \nAdditionally , during the Relevant Period, a post entitled “Tradewale – Forex Trading Made Easy” \nwas published on Medium.com (the “Medium.com Post”) purportedl y authored by a senior trader \nat Tradewale.  ( Id.)  The Medium.com post claimed Tradewale used artificial intelligence to trade \nforex, and that Tradewale was good for newbie investors.  ( Id.)  The Medium.com post further \nstated that the “Tradewale team has  mastered the best AI techniques and teamed with savvy human \ninvestment managers” and “promise[d] an average 4.95% monthly return” on forex.  ( Id. ¶ 23.)  \nThe Medium.com post additionally indicated that Tradewale had a “simple fee structure”, \n“accounts under $25,000 pay Tradewale 20 percent of returns”, and accounts with higher capital investments pay “a progressively lower fee.”  ( Id.)   \nTradewale distributed a summary prospectus  to prospective customers entitled “Tradewale \nManaged Fund” (the “Prospectus”)  dated February 28, 2019.  ( Id. ¶ 24.)  The Prospectus stated \nthat 20% of the funds held by Tradewale were invested in forte in January 2018, and 24% of funds were invested in forex in January 2019.  (Id.)  The Prospectus claimed Tradewale achieved average \nmonthly rates of return of 4% to 11%, consistent positive returns resulting in monthly deposits, and that over the past five years, Tradewale provided average annual returns of over 55%.  ( Id. \n¶¶ 24, 25.)  \nCustomers seeking to set up accounts with Tradewale were instructed to wire funds to \nTradewale’s U.S. bank accounts, controlled by Defendant Dapkus, or to send checks to \nTradewale’s businesses addressed in the United States.  ( Id. ¶ 26.)  Tradewale maintained a UPS \nbox located in Downers Grove, Il linois, which was rented beginning in or about March 2018.  ( Id. \n¶¶ 26, 27.)   Case 3:21-cv-17776-ZNQ-DEA   Document 21   Filed 05/04/23   Page 3 of 17 PageID: <pageID>4 \n At least 15 customers deposited a total of at least $700,000 into Tradewale’s U.S. bank \naccounts. ( Id. ¶ 28.)  Customers who invested funds with Tradewale received an online \nconfirmation of their investment.  ( Id. ¶ 29.)  These customers were initially able to track purported \nprofits online and contact Tradewale customer support.  ( Id.)   \nBy in or around mid- 2019, customers were unable to withdraw funds from their Tradewale \naccou nts, and were also unable to access the Tradewale website or to contact customer support.  \n(Id. ¶ 30.)  Most of Tradewale’s U.S. customers were unable to withdraw the funds they invested \nwith Tradewale or any purported profits in their accounts.  ( Id.)   \nCFTC alleges upon information and belief that Tradewale did not trade forex for \ncustomers’ accounts as represented.  ( Id. ¶ 31.)  Tradewale does not have any trading accounts \nwith futures commission merchants or retail foreign exchange dealers registered wi th CFTC.  ( Id.)  \nTradewale’s business bank account statements –  into which customers’ funds were deposited –  \nindicate that Tradewale used customers’ funds for restaurants, drug stores, supermarkets, \ndepartment stores, lodging, and cash withdrawals at ATMs.  ( Id.)   \nThe funds Tradewale received for the purpose of trading forex were contributed by persons \nwho were not eligible contract participants (“ECPs”) as defined in 7 U.S.C. § 1a(18)(A)(xi) (2012).  \n(Id. ¶ 33.)  At no point did Tradewale limit its solici tations to ECPs.  ( Id.)   \nB. Procedural Background  \nOn November 29, 2021,  CFTC filed a four-count Complaint  against Defendants alleging \nviolations of the CEA and CFTC regulations under 7 U.S.C. § 6b(a)(2)(A)- C (futures fraud) (Count \nOne) , violations of CFTC Regulation 5.2(b) (forex fraud) (Count Two) , violations of Section 4o(1) \nof the CEA (Fraud by Commodity T rading Advisor) (Count Three), and violations of Section \n4m(1) of the Act (Failure to Register as a CTA) (Count Four).  On that same day , summonses were Case 3:21-cv-17776-ZNQ-DEA   Document 21   Filed 05/04/23   Page 4 of 17 PageID: <pageID>5 \n issued that included a notice that failure to respond would result in a default.  ( ECF No. 2.)  \nDefendant  Tradewale LLC w as served with  the Summons and Complaint on May November 12, \n2021.  (ECF No.  4.)  Accordingly, D efendant  Tradewale LLC’s answer was  due on December 3, \n2021.  ( See id .)   \nOn December 28, 2021, CFTC filed a Motion for service by publication or email.  (ECF \nNo. 5.)  The Court on January 12, 2022 denied CFTC’s Motion for service by publication or email \nwithout prejudice.  (ECF No. 6.)  On March 21, 2022, CFTC filed a Summons return, attaching proof of delivery to Defendant Tradewale Managed Fund in London, United Kingdom.  (ECF No. 8.)   \nOn March 23, 2022, CFTC filed a request for default as to Defendants Tradewale LLC  and \nTradewale Managed Fund.  (ECF Nos. 9, 10.)  On August 10, 2022, the Court entered a Notice of Call for dismissal pursuant to Local Civil Rule 41.1(a).  (ECF No. 11.)  CFTC thereafter, on September 3, 2022, filed a declaration in response to the notice of call for dismissal, indicating that it was continuing good faith efforts to prosecute the action .  (ECF No. 13.)  That same day, \nCFTC filed a Motion for Default Judgment as to Tradewale LLC and Tradewale Managed Fund.  (ECF No. 14.)  \nAs of the date of this Opinion, all Defendants have failed to respond to the Complaint or \nappear in this action.  \nII. LEGAL STANDARD  \nRule 55 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure governs default.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 55.   \nPursuant to the Rule, the clerk must enter default against a party who “ has failed to plead or \notherwise defend, and that failure is shown by affidavit or otherwise .”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 55(a) .  After \nthis, a plaintiff may seek entry of default judgment under either Rule 55(b)(1) or Rule 55(b)(2).  Case 3:21-cv-17776-ZNQ-DEA   Document 21   Filed 05/04/23   Page 5 of 17 PageID: <pageID>6 \n Doug Brady, Inc. v. N.J. Bldg. Laborers Statewide Funds , 250 F.R .D. 171, 177 (D.N.J. 2008) .  See \nalso Nationwide Mutual Ins. Co. v. Starlight Ballroom Dance Club, Inc., 175 F. App ’x 519, 521, \nn.1 (3d. Cir. 2006) ( “Prior to obtaining a default judgment under either Rule 55(b)(1) or Rule \n55(b)(2), there must be entry of default as provided by Rule 55(a).” ). \n“It is well settled in this Circuit that the entry of a default judgment is left primarily to the \ndiscretion of the district court .”  Hritz v. Woma Corp., 732 F.2d 1178, 1180 (3d Cir. 1984) (citation \nomitted).   However, “entry of default judgments is disfavored as decisions on the merits are \npreferred.”  Animal Sci. Prods. v. China Nat ’l Metals & Minerals Imp. & Exp. Corp., 596 F. Supp. \n2d 842, 848 (D.N.J. 2008) (citing Hritz , 732 F.2d at  1181).  In other words, the district court must \nremain mindful that entry of default “is a sanction of last resort.”  Id. (citing Super 8 Motels, Inc \nv. Kumar , Civ. No. 06- 5231, 2008 WL 878426, at *3 (D.N.J. Apr. 1, 2008) ).   \n“Before entering default judgment, the  court must address the threshold issue of whether it \nhas subject matter jurisdiction and personal jurisdiction over the parties.”   Maersk Line v. TJM \nInt’l L.L.C., 427 F. Supp. 3d 528, 532 (D.N.J. 2019)  (citing Williams v. Life Sav. & Loan, 802 F.2d \n1200, 1203 (10th Cir. 1986)).  After that, “ [i]n assessing whether the entry of default judgment is \nwarranted, the court utilizes a three -step analysis, under which the court must determine (1) \nwhether there is sufficient proof of service[;] (2) whether a sufficient cause of action was stated[;] \nand (3) whether default judgment is proper[.] ”  Paniagua Grp., Inc. v. Hosp. Specialists, LLC , 183 \nF. Supp. 3d 591, 600–01 (D.N.J. 2016)    \nBefore determining whether imposing the extreme sanction of default  is prope r, district \ncourts must make explicit factual findings as to: (1) whether the party subject to default has a meritorious defense, (2) the prejudice suffered by the party seeking default, and (3) the culpability of the party subject to default.  Emcasco Ins . Co. v. Sambrick , 834 F.2d 71, 74 (3d Cir. 1987) .  An Case 3:21-cv-17776-ZNQ-DEA   Document 21   Filed 05/04/23   Page 6 of 17 PageID: <pageID>7 \n entry of default judgment is not a right that plaintiffs are entitled to and a “defendant’s failure to \nappear or answer does not vitiate” the court’s responsibility to examine the complaint.  Paniagua \nGrp., Inc., 183 F. Supp. 3d at 600.   \nIII. DISCUSSION  \nA. Subject Matter Jurisdiction and Personal Jurisdiction \nThis Court possesses jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Section 6c(a) of the Act, 7 \nU.S.C. § 13a –1(a) (2012), which authorizes the CFTC to seek injunctive and other relief in a \nUnited States district court against any person whenever it shall appear to the CFTC that such \nperson has engaged in any act or practice that violates the Act or Regulations. \nThe Court is also satisfied it has personal jurisdiction over Defendant s because the \nComplaint includes allegations, which the Court accepts as true in this context, asserting that Defendant s transacted business in this District and certain transactions , acts, practices, and courses \nof business alleged in this Complaint occurred in this District.  (Compl. ¶ 14.)   The Complaint \nadditionally includes allegations that during the Relevant Period, at least one customer who invested funds with Tradewale resided in Flemington, New Jersey.  ( Id.) \nFinally, venue properly lies with this Court pursuant to Section 6c(e) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. \n§ 13a –1(e) (2012), because the acts and practices in violation of the Act and Regulations occurred \nwithin this District.  \nB. Sufficient Proof of Service  \n Before granting default judgment, the Court must also  consider whether process was \nproperly served on Defendants.   \n  Case 3:21-cv-17776-ZNQ-DEA   Document 21   Filed 05/04/23   Page 7 of 17 PageID: <pageID>8 \n 1. Defendant Tradewale LLC  \nRule 4 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides for service on a corporation within \nthe United States, “by delivering a copy of the summons and complaint to an officer, a managing \nor general agent, or any other agent authorized by appointment or by law to receive service of \nprocess.”  Teamsters Health & Welfare Fund of Phila. and Vicinity v. Dublin Paper Co., Civ. No. \n11-7137, 2012 WL 2018062, at *2 (D.N.J. July 24, 2012).   \nHere, Tradewale LLC dissolved in or about September of 2020.  (Compl. ¶ 16.)  Under \nboth New Jersey and Illinois law, however, a plaintiff may serve the registered agent  of a dissolved \ncorporation under certain circumstances.  See Johnson v. Four States Enters., Inc ., 355 F. Supp. \n1312, 1318 (E.D. Pa. 1972), aff'd, 495 F.2d 1368 (3d Cir.1974) (“[U]nder New Jersey Law, a \ncorporation after dissolution may be sued for a cause of action in tort [or contract] arising before such dissolution, and process may be served on the registered agent of the corporation.”  (internal \ncitation omitted) ); see also  Goode v. PennyMac Loan Servs ., Civ. No. 14- 1900, 2014 WL 6461689, \nat *9 (N.D. Ill. Nov. 18, 2014) (“If a corporation is dissolved, a plaintiff may serve the registered agent on record for five years after the dissolution of the corporat ion.”).  \n As set forth above, t he docket reflects that  an authorized agent of  Defendant Tradewale \nLLC was served with the summons and Complaint on November 12, 2021.  ( See ECF No. 4.)  This \nwas accomplished by personally serving Connor Doyle, authorized to accept service, at 200 E. \nRandolph, Chicago, Illinois, on November 12, 2021 at 9:25 a.m. (See ECF No. 4; see also  Giglo \nDecl. at Ex. D ¶ 6.)    The Court therefore finds that service on Defendant  Tradewale LLC  was \nproper.   \n  Case 3:21-cv-17776-ZNQ-DEA   Document 21   Filed 05/04/23   Page 8 of 17 PageID: <pageID>9 \n 2. Defendant Tradewale Managed Fund  \n“[S]ervice abroad is governed by the terms of the Hauge Convention.”  Trump Taj Mahal \nAssociates v. Hotel Servs., Inc., 183 F.R.D. 173, 176 (D.N.J. 1998) (citing Volkswagenwerk \nAktiengesellschaft v. Schlunk , 486 U.S. 694, 696–700 (1988) ).  “Article 10(a) of the Hague \nConvention permits service of process by mail on foreign corporations so long as the receiving country has not filed objection to this method.”  Id . at 181 (finding that service upon an England \nCorpor ation my international registered mail comports with Article  10(a) of the Hague \nConvention.)   \nHere, the Summons and Complaint were sent by the Clerk of the Court to Tradewale \nManaged Fund in London, England via International Registered Mail.  ( See ECF No.  8.)  Proof of \ndelivery was filed with the Court.  ( See id .)  Accordingly, the Court finds that service on Defendant \nTradewale Managed Fund was proper.  \nC. Sufficient Cause of Actio n \nBefore entering default judgment, the Court must also review the Complaint a nd determine \nwhether the “unchallenged facts constitute a legitimate cause of action .”  DirecTV, Inc. v. Asher , \nCiv. No. 03–1969, 2006 WL 680533, at *1 (D.N.J. Mar. 14, 2006) (citing Wright, Miller, Kane, \n10A Fed. Prac. & P. Civil 3d § 2688, at 58–59, 63).   The Court must also accept CFTC’s  “well -\npleaded” allegations as true.  Comdyne I, Inc., 908 F.2d at  1149.  \n1. Counts One and Two  \nHere,  CFTC alleges violations of Section 4b(a)(2)(A) -(C) of the CEA and CFTC \nRegulation 5.2(b)(1) -(3).  (See Compl.)   \nSection 4b(a)(2)(A) and (C) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 6b(a)(2)(A), (C) (2012), prohibits any \nperson or entity from cheating, defrauding, or misleading another person in connection with off -Case 3:21-cv-17776-ZNQ-DEA   Document 21   Filed 05/04/23   Page 9 of 17 PageID: <pageID>10 \n exchange commodity futures or forex contracts.  Section 4b(a)(2)(A) –(C) of the Act applies to \nforex transactions as if they were futures contracts.  Section 2(c)(2)(C)(iv) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § \n2(c)(2)(C)(iv) (2012).   CFTC  may establish a violation of Section 4b(a)(1)(A) and (C) of the Act \nby showing that Defendants made a material misrepresentation, misleading statement, or deceptive \nomission with scienter.  CFTC v. Rosenberg, 85 F. Supp. 2d 424, 447 (D.N.J. 2000).  Scienter “is \nan ‘intent to deceive, manipulate, or defraud,’ and it may be shown either by conscious behavior or recklessness.”  CFTC v. Equity Fin. Grp. LLC , 572 F.3d 150, 159 (3d Cir. 2009) (quoting Ernst \n& Ernst  v. Hochfelder , 425 U.S. 185, 193 (1976)).  A statement or omission is material if “‘a \nreasonable investor would consider it important in deciding whether to make an investment.’” Rosenberg, 85 F. Supp. 2d at 447 (quoting Saxe v. E.F. Hutton & Co., Inc ., 789 F.2d 105, 109 (2d \nCir. 1986)).  Account balances and profits “‘ constitute information that a reasonable investor \nwould consider important in trading commodity futures . . .’”  CFTC v. Cifuentes , Civ. No. 16-\n6167, 2018 WL 1904196, at * 5 (D.N.J. April 20, 2018) (quoting i d. at 448).   \nSection 4b(a)(2)(B) of the Act prohibits the creation of false reports or statements in \nconnection with off -exchange futures or forex contracts.  “ ‘Delivering, or causing the delivery of, \nfalse account statements to customers  relating to forex trades . . .constitutes a violation of Section \n4b(a)(2)(B) of the Act. ’”  Cifuentes, 2018 WL 1904196, at *5 (quoting CFTC v. Total Call Grp.,  \nCiv. No. 10- 513, 2012 WL 1642196, at *7 (E.D. Tex. Mar. 30, 2012).  \nRegulation 5.2(b) makes it unlawful, in connection with an off -exchange retail forex \ntransaction, to use the mails or any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce to (1) cheat or defraud or attempt to cheat or defraud any person; (2) willfully make a false report or statement; or (3) willfully deceive any person by any means.  Case 3:21-cv-17776-ZNQ-DEA   Document 21   Filed 05/04/23   Page 10 of 17 PageID: <pageID>11 \n The facts of the Complaint, taken as true for purposes of the instant motion, adequately \nallege that Tradewale Defendants  acted with scienter by intentionally making material \nmisrepresentations and omissions to entice individuals  to deposit and invest funds with \nDefendants, and then misappropriated those funds for their own benefit.  ( See Compl. ¶¶ 1–3, 19–\n33.) \n 2. Count Thr ee \nSection 6o(1) of the Act states:  \nIt shall be unlawful for a commodity trading advisor, associated \nperson of a commodity trading advisor, commodity pool operator, or associated person of a commodity pool operator by use of the mails or any means or instr umentality of interstate commerce, \ndirectly or indirectly — \n(A) to employ any device, scheme, or artifice to defraud any client or participant or prospective client or participant; or  \n(B) to engage in any transaction, practice, or course of business which operates as a fraud or deceit upon any client or participant or prospective client or participant.  \n \n“The purpose of § 6o(1) is to ‘ implement[ ] the fiduciary capacity that characterizes the advisor's \nrelationship to his clients. ’”  CFTC v. Perkins , Civ. No. 06- 4674, 2009 WL 806576, at\n *7 (D.N.J. \nMar. 25, 2009) (quoting CFTC v. Savage , 611 F.2d 270, 285 (9th Cir. 1980) ).  \n“Courts hold that while the language of § 6o(1)(A) requires a defendant to act with scienter, \n§ 6o(1)(B) does not. ”  Id. (citing Commodity Trend Serv. v. CFTC , 233 F.3d 981, 993 (7th Cir. \n2000) ).   \nHere, the Complaint alleges that Tradewale Defendants, for compensation or profit, \nengaged in the business of advising others, either directly or through publications, writings, or \nelectronic media, as to the value of or advisability of trading forex, as described by 2(c)(2)(C)(i) \nof the Act.  ( See Compl. ¶  4.)  The Complaint therefore alleges that Tradewale was a Commodity \nTrading Advisor (“CTA”) as defined in Section 1a(12)(A)(i) o f the Act.  Sections 4o(1)(A) and Case 3:21-cv-17776-ZNQ-DEA   Document 21   Filed 05/04/23   Page 11 of 17 PageID: <pageID>12 \n (B) of the Act apply to CTAs, whether registered or not.  See Perkins , 2009 WL 806576, at *7 \n(noting that actual registration as a commodity pool operator with CFTC is not required to “fall \nwithin the ambit of § 6o(1).”); see also  CFTC v. Poole , Civ. No. 05- 859, 2006 WL 1174286, at *4 \n(M.D.N.C. May 1, 2006) (entering default judgment against unregistered defendant for violations of Sections 4(o)(1)(A) and (B)) .   \nAdditionally, the allegations that support CFTC’s forex fraud claims under Sections \n4b(a)(2)(A) -(C) of the Act in Count One additionally support Plaintiff’s Sections 4o(1)(A) and (B) \nfraud claims in Count Three.  See  Cifuentes , 2018 WL 1904196, at *6 (“The same intentional or \nreckless misappropriations, misrepresent ations, and omissions of material fact violative of section \n4b of the Act. . .also violate Sections 4o(1)(A) -(B).” (internal citations omitted)).  Accordingly, \nthe Complaint sufficiently alleges violations of Section 6o(1) of the Act .   \n3. Count Four  \nSection 4m(1) of the Act provides that it is unlawful for any CTA to make use of the mails \nor any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce in connection with its business as a CTA without being registered with the CFTC.  See 7 U.S.C. § 6m(1) (2018).  \nHere, the Complaint alleges that Tradewale Defendants, acted as a CTA because it solicited \nfunds for an investment vehicle by way of the mail or other means of interstate commerce.  ( See \nCompl. ¶¶ 48- 52.)  Because Tradewale was unregistered with the CFTC , Tradewale Defendants, \naccording to the allegations contained within the Complaint, violated Section 4m(1) of the Act.   \nD. Whether Default Judgment is Proper  \nNext, the Court considers whether default judgment is proper. Here, Defendants are subject \nto defau lt because they have failed to respond to the Complaint .  In the absence of a responsive \npleading, there is nothing in the record to indicate that Defendants have any meritorious defenses.  Case 3:21-cv-17776-ZNQ-DEA   Document 21   Filed 05/04/23   Page 12 of 17 PageID: <pageID>13 \n Second , Defendants’ failure to respond and litigate this action  would leave Plaintiff  without \na remedy to obtain damages  that resul ted from Tradewale Defendants fraud or misrepresentations . \nAdditionally, Tradewale Defendants’ failure to litigate this action will result in CFTC being unable \nto fulfill its congressional mandate of enforcing the Act.  Therefore, this Court finds that Plaintiff \nhas been prejudiced and will continue to be further prejudiced if default judgment is not granted.   \nThird, this Court finds that Defendants are presumably cul pable due to their failure to \nrespond to th is action despite  being properly served with the Complaint and Summons .   See Slover \nv. Live Universe, Inc., Civ. No. 08- 02645, 2009 WL 606133,  at *2 (D.N.J. Mar. 9, 2009) \n(“[d]efendant is also presumed culpable where it has failed to answer, move, or otherwise respond”).  As of the date of this Opinion, neither Tradewale Defendant has responded to the \nComplaint.   Therefore, given that Plaintiff satisfies all of the necessary requirements, the Court \nwill enter default judgment for Plaintiff.  \nE. Permanent Injunction  \nSection 6c(a) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 13a –1(a) (2012), authorizes the CFTC  to seek, and the \nCourt  to impose, injunctive relief against any person whenever it shall appear to the CFTC that \nsuch person has engaged in any act or practice that violates the Act or Regulations. \nThe “‘ultimate test’” for entry of an injunction under the Act “‘is whether the defendant ’s \npast conduct indicates that there is a reasonable likelihood of further violations in the future.’”  \nCFTC v. Siegel , Civ. No. 13- 5755, 2014 WL 7404537, at *9 (D.N.J. Dec. 30, 2014)  (quoting CFTC \nv. Wilshire Inv. Mgmt. Corp., 531 F.3d 1339, 1346 (11th Cir. 2008)).  Future violations of the Act \nor Regulations “may be inferred, or even presumed, from past unlawful conduct, and the absence of proof to the contrary.”  CFTC v. Am. Metals Exch. Corp., 693 F. Supp. 168, 171 (D.N.J. 1988) (citing CFTC v. Hunt , 591 F.2d 1211, 1220 (7th Cir. 1979)).  Case 3:21-cv-17776-ZNQ-DEA   Document 21   Filed 05/04/23   Page 13 of 17 PageID: <pageID>14 \n “The scope of injunctive relief can be tailored to meet the circumstances of the violations \nshown.”  Cifuentes , 2018 WL 1904196, at *8.  Courts  have entered permanent injunctions against \nfuture violations of the Act.  See, e.g., Rosenberg, 85 F. Supp. 2d at 455 (permanently enjoining \ndefendants “from future violations of” provisions of the Act). Courts have also permanently \nenjoined defendants from registering with the CFTC and engaging in a ny commodity- related \nactivity.  See Cifuentes , 2018 WL 1904196, at *8 (imposing permanent trading and registration \nbans); see also  Wilshire , 531 F.3d at 1346 ( 11th Circuit upholding the district court ’s permanent \ninjunction prohibiting the defendants from “engaging in any commodity- related activity”).  \nAs set forth above, the well -pleaded facts of the Complaint establish that Tradewale \nDefendants’ unlawful conduct makes it highly likely that they will be repeat violators unless permanently restrained by this  Court.  See Am. Metals Exch. Corp., 693 F. Supp. at  171.  As \nalleged, Tradewale Defendants did not trade forex for customers’ accounts as it represented it \nwould, and used customer’s funds for “restaurants, drug stores, supermarkets, department stores, \nlodging, and cash withdrawals at ATMs .”  (Compl. ¶ 31.)   Injunctive relief is appropriate in these \ncircumstances.   See Rosenberg , 85 F. Supp. 2d at 454 (granting CFTC ’s motion for permanent \ninjunction because defendants’ misappropriation of customer funds was “egregiously fraudulent conduct” that made future violations of the Act likely). \nTherefore, the Court finds that there is a reasonable likelihood that Tradewale Defendants \nwill continue to violate the Act and Regulations unless permanently restra ined and enjoined by th e \nCourt.  The intentional and egregious nature of Defendants’ fraudulent conduct warrants \npermanent injunctive relief, including registration and trading bans.  Case 3:21-cv-17776-ZNQ-DEA   Document 21   Filed 05/04/23   Page 14 of 17 PageID: <pageID>15 \n F. Restitution and Civil Monetary Penalty  \n1. Restitution  \nSection 6c(d)(3)(A) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 13a –1(d)(3)(A) (2012), authorizes the \nCommission to seek, and the Court to impose, equitable remedies for violations of the Act, \nincluding “restitution to persons who have sustained losses proximately caused by such violation \n(in the amount of such losses).”  “Courts calculate restitution ‘as the difference between what Defendants obtained and the amount customers have already received back.’”  Cifuentes , 2018 \nWL 1904196, at *10 (quoting CFTC v. Ross , Civ. No. 09- 54432, 2014 WL 6704572, at *3 (N.D. \nIll. Nov. 26, 2014) ). \nAs a result of Tradewale Defendants’ fraudulent solicitations, Tradewale Defendants \nreceived  a total of at least $713,520.00 from at least 17 customers.  (Giglo Decl. ¶ 18, Ex. G.)  \nNone  of these customers have received any return of their principal investment.  ( Id.)    \nAccordingly, Tradewale Defendants are ordered to pay, on a joint and several basis, \nrestitution in the amount of $ 713,520.00 (seven -hundred thir teen thousand, five -hundred and \ntwenty dollars)  (“Restitution Obligation”) .  Post-judgment interest shall accrue beginning on the \ndate of entry of the accompanying  Order and shall be determined pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1961 \n(2012).  \nCFTC argues that the Nati onal Futures Association (“NFA”) be appointed as m onitor to \nsupervise the distribution of the restitution funds to the affected customers .  (Moving Br. at 22.)  \nThe Court agrees and will appoint the NFA as Monitor to supervise distribution of the Restituti on \nObligation.  See Cifuentes , 2018 WL 1904196, at *10 (appointing the NFA as monitor  to distribute \npayments made against the Restitution Obligation to Defendants’ pool participants).

Civil Monetary Penalty  \nSection 6c(d)(1) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 13a –1(d)(1) (2012), and Regulation \n143.8(a)(4)(ii)(B), 17 C.F.R. § 143.8( a)(4)(ii)(B) (2016), authorize the CFTC  to seek, and the \nCourt to impose, a civil monetary penalty of triple Defendants’ monetary gain from each violation \nof the Act or Regulations, or $167,728 per violation, whichever is greater.  \nThe Court considers numerous factors in determining an appropriate civil monetary penalty \nunder the Act, including (1) whether Defendants’ illegal acts violated core provisions of the Act; \n(2) whether Defenda nts acted with scienter; (3) the consequences resulting from Defendants’ \nviolations; (4) the financial benefits to Defendants; and (4) the harm to Defendants’ customers. See Wilshire , 531 F.3d at 1346; see also CFTC v. Yorkshire Grp., Inc ., Civ. No. 13- 5323, 2016 \nWL 8256380, at *6 (E.D.N.Y. Aug. 19, 2016).  \nCourts  have  routinely award ed civil monetary penalties in cases involving fraud.  See, e.g., \nCFTC v. Onsa, 2014 WL 2960345, at *1 (E.D. Pa. Mar. 20, 2014) (entering civil monetary penalty \nof triple defendants’ gain in commodity pool fraud case due to “the egregiousness of the defendants’ intentional conduct”); see also CFTC v. SK Madison Commodities , LLC , 2014 WL \n3887755, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. June 9, 2014) (entering default judgment and ordering a civil monetary penalty of “triple the amount misappropriated” where defendants “committed repeated violations of core provisions of the[Act] and Regulations.”); CFTC  v. Rolando, 589 F. Supp. 2d 159, 174 (D. \nConn. 2008) (“obtaining customer funds and then hiding [defendant's] true conduct from his \ncustomers were serious violations of the Act ...that strike at the very core of the Act's regulatory \nsystem,” requiring “a substantial civil monetary penalty.”)  \nHere, Tradewale Defendants’ conduct warrants the imposition of a significant monetary \npenalty.  In fraudulently soliciting approximately $713,520.00 in customers ’ funds, Tradewale Case 3:21-cv-17776-ZNQ-DEA   Document 21   Filed 05/04/23   Page 16 of 17 PageID: <pageID>17 \n Defendants spent hundreds of thousands  of dollars of their victims’ money on personal expenses . \n(See Giglio  Decl. ¶ 18, Ex. G. ) \nGiven Defendants’ intentional and egregious conduct, the Court believes that a civil \nmonetary penalty reflecting triple the funds Defendants fraudulently misappropria ted  is proper to \ndeter future fraudulent schemes in violation of the Act and Regulations.  See Cifuentes , 2018 WL \n1904196, at *12.   This penalty is authorized by Section 6c(d)(1) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 13a –1(d)(1) \n(2012), and Regulation 143.8(a)(4)(ii)(B), 17 C.F.R. § 143.8(a)(4)(ii)(B) (2016). \nIV.

    "summary": "1. **Summary:** In this case, the plaintiffs, which include the League of Women Voters and several individuals, sued Steve Kramer and associated companies for orchestrating robocalls using AI-generated \"deepfake\" voice technology to mimic President Biden's voice, with the intent to suppress Democratic voter turnout in New Hampshire by misleadingly telling voters to \"save\" their vote for the general election. The court denied the defendants' motion to dismiss, allowing the claims to proceed under the Voting Rights Act, the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, and New Hampshire state statutes regulating political advertising. The AI and automation are central as they were used to create and distribute the misleading robocalls, representing a novel misuse of technology in election interference.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue:** The key legal issue is whether the defendants' use of AI-generated deepfake robocalls to impersonate a political leader, combined with spoofing caller ID, violated federal and state laws by attempting to suppress voter turnout and infringing on individuals' rights to privacy.\n\n3. **Court's Holding:** The court held that the plaintiffs presented sufficient claim allegations for violations of the Voting Rights Act and other telecommunications laws, establishing standing to sue the defendants. As a result, the court denied the defendants' motion to dismiss, allowing the lawsuit to proceed.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation:** Imagine someone used a high-tech computer program to create a fake phone call that sounded just like the President. This fake call told people to skip voting in a smaller election. Some groups and people found out and got really upset because they thought it was a trick to stop people from voting. They took the people who made the calls to court. The court said there was enough reason to keep going with the case because making fake calls like that to mess with voting is potentially illegal.",

Case No. 24-cv-73-SM-TSM \n        Opinion No. 2025 DNH 042          \n \nSteve Kramer; Lingo Telecom, LLC; \nVoice Broadcasting Corporation; \nand Life Corporation, \n Defendants \n   \nO R D E R \n \n In January of 2024, two days before the New Hampshire \nPresidential Primary Election, defendants directed approximately \n10,000 robocalls to New Hampshire residents they believed were \nlikely Democratic voters.  The calls used an AI-generated \n“deepfake” voice technology to mimic President Biden’s voice and \nwere designed to suppress Democratic voter turnout.  \nSpecifically, the calls urged recipients to “save” their vote for the November general election and warned that if they cast a \nvote in the primary election it would “only enable the \nRepublicans in their quest to elect Donald Trump again” (the Case 1:24-cv-00073-SM-TSM     Document 116     Filed 03/26/25     Page 1 of 48 \n2 “Deepfake Robocall” or “Deepfake Message”)).  In addition to \nemploying an AI-generated voice designed to deceive recipients \ninto believing that President Biden had recorded the message, \ndefendants also “spoofed” the caller ID to falsely show that the \ncall originated from a phone number associated with Kathleen \nSullivan, a prominent attorney and well-known former state \nDemocratic Party leader.  Sullivan was also the chair of a Super \nPAC that led an effort to encourage New Hampshire Democrats to \nwrite in President Biden’s name in the state’s primary election.    \n \n In the wake of those robocalls, the League of Women Voters \nof the United States, the League of Women Voters of New \nHampshire, and three individuals who received the Deepfake \nRobocall, filed suit against Steve Kramer, Voice Broadcasting \nCorporation, Life Corporation, and Lingo Telecom, LLC.  \nPlaintiffs allege that Kramer conceived of and commissioned the \ncreation of the misleading robocalls, while the corporate defendants provided various services to distribute those calls.   \n \n Plaintiffs say defendants’ conduct violated the Voting \nRights Act of 1965, the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, and \ntwo separate provisions of a New Hampshire statute regulating \npolitical advertising.  They seek statutory damages, punitive Case 1:24-cv-00073-SM-TSM     Document 116     Filed 03/26/25     Page 2 of 48 \n3 damages, and an award of attorney’s fees.  They also seek a \nnationwide injunction enjoining all defendants:   \n \nfrom producing, generating, or distributing AI-\ngenerated robocalls impersonating any person, without \nthat person’s express, prior written consent;   \nfrom distributing spoofed telephone calls, texts \nmessages, or any other form of spoofed communication without the express, prior written consent of the individual or entity upon whose half the communication \nis being sent; and  \n \nfrom distributing telephone calls, text messages, or \nother mass communications that do not comply with all \napplicable state and federal laws or that are made for an unlawful purpose.   \n \n \nAmended Motion for Preliminary Injunction (document no. 71).   \n \n Default has been entered against Kramer.  Presently pending \nbefore the court is a motion to dismiss plaintiffs’ Amended \nComplaint filed by defendants Life Corp. and Voice Broadcasting, \nin which they assert that plaintiffs lack standing and that the \nAmended Complaint fails to state any viable claims.  Plaintiffs \nobject.  For the reasons discussed below, that motion to dismiss \nis denied.   \n \nStandard of Review \n When considering a motion to dismiss, the court accepts all \nwell-pleaded facts alleged in the complaint as true, disregards Case 1:24-cv-00073-SM-TSM     Document 116     Filed 03/26/25     Page 3 of 48 \n4 legal labels and conclusions, and resolves reasonable inferences \nin the plaintiff’s favor.  See Galvin v. U.S. Bank, N.A., 852 \nF.3d 146, 155 (1st Cir. 2017).  The court may also consider documents referenced by or incorporated into the complaint.  See \nKando v. Rhode Island State Bd. of Elections, 880 F.3d 53, 56 \n(1st Cir. 2018).   \n \n To avoid dismissal, the complaint must allege sufficient facts to support a “plausible” claim for relief.  See Ashcroft \nv. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009).  To satisfy that \nplausibility standard, the factual allegations in the complaint, \nalong with reasonable inferences, must show more than a mere \npossibility of liability – that is, “a formulaic recitation of \nthe elements of a cause of action will not do.”  Bell Atl. Corp. \nv. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007).  See also Lyman v. Baker, \n954 F.3d 351, 359–60 (1st Cir. 2020) (“For the purposes of our \n[12(b)(6)] review, we isolate and ignore statements in the complaint that simply offer legal labels and conclusions or \nmerely rehash cause-of-action elements.”) (citation and internal \npunctuation omitted).   \n    In other words, the complaint must include well-pled (i.e., \nnon-conclusory, non-speculative) factual allegations as to each \nof the essential elements of a viable claim that, if assumed to Case 1:24-cv-00073-SM-TSM     Document 116     Filed 03/26/25     Page 4 of 48 \n5 be true, allow the court to draw the reasonable and plausible \ninference that the plaintiff is entitled to the relief sought.  \nSee Tasker v. DHL Retirement Savings Plan, 621 F.3d 34, 38-39 \n(1st Cir. 2010).  \n \nBackground \n In June of 2024, plaintiffs filed an Amended Motion for \nPreliminary Injunction (document no. 71), which the court referred to the magistrate judge for a report and \nrecommendation.  On July 31, 2024, the magistrate judge held a \nhearing, before which the parties submitted a stipulation of \nfacts, as well as memoranda in support of and in opposition to \nthe motion for preliminary injunction.  The following statement \nof background facts is drawn from the Amended Complaint \n(document no. 65), the parties’ Stipulation of Facts (document \nno. 87), and the Magistrate Judge’s Report and Recommendation \n(document no. 99).    \nI. The Parties.  \n The three individual plaintiffs in this case, Nancy \nMarashio, James Fieseher, and Patricia Gingrich, are registered \nvoters in New Hampshire.  Each received the Deepfake Robocall on \nJanuary 21, 2024, on their home landline.  Each individual \nplaintiff realized that the message was not from President Biden Case 1:24-cv-00073-SM-TSM     Document 116     Filed 03/26/25     Page 5 of 48 \n6 or his campaign and that the information contained in the call \nwas false.  And, each individual plaintiff voted in the Primary \ndespite having received the Deepfake Robocall.  \n \n The organizational plaintiffs are the League of Women \nVoters of the United States and the League of Women Voters of New Hampshire (collectively, “the League” or the “League \nentities”).  According to the League, its mission is “to \nencourage informed and active participation in the government, \nincrease understanding of major public policy issues, and \ninfluence public policy through education and advocacy.”  \nMemorandum in Support of Preliminary Injunction (document no. \n71-1), at 17.  Additionally (and importantly for purposes of \nstanding), another core function of the League is to combat \nvoter suppression efforts and counsel “citizens to register to \nvote, participate in elections, and engage with the civil \nprocess.”  As discussed below, that “core function” of the League was adversely impacted when defendants attempted to \nsuppress Democratic voter turnout by discouraging Democratic \nvoters from casting a ballot in the September Primary.   \n \n The League-US states that in response to the Deepfake \nRobocalls it changed its VOTE411.org website which provides election-related information to voters and it created a new Case 1:24-cv-00073-SM-TSM     Document 116     Filed 03/26/25     Page 6 of 48 \n7 alert to inform voters about deceptive, threatening, or \nintimidating robocalls – all of which required diversion of \nstaff and money.  See, e.g., Affidavit of Celina Stewart, Chief \nCounsel at the League of Women Voters of the U.S. (document no. 71-30) at para. 12 (“[The League] diverted staff resources to \ncreate the new alert, and will dedicate staff time to updating \nthe website and translating alerts into Spanish to alert voters \nabout similar harmful robocall campaigns.”).  The League-US also says it “has expended, and continues to expend, resources \nproviding additional guidance and training to staff to track \ninauthentic or deepfake robocalls” and planned to expend even \nmore funds to amend its “printed information about voter \nregistration to include warnings about inauthentic robocalls.”  \nMemorandum in Support of Preliminary Injunction (document no. \n71-1), at 12-13.     \n \n According to the Amended Complaint, “Defendants Voice Broadcasting and Life Corp are part of a constellation of \ncompanies owned, controlled, or operated by Walter Monk, via the \nholding company Voice Ventures Inc.  Monk’s companies provide \nrobocalling, political advertising, polling, fundraising and \ntext messaging services.”  Id. at para. 29.  Voice Broadcasting \nleases equipment and software to clients who wish to conduct election-related and other calling campaigns.  Additionally, Case 1:24-cv-00073-SM-TSM     Document 116     Filed 03/26/25     Page 7 of 48 \n8 Voice Broadcasting “advertises its ability to help clients \n‘create a powerfully persuasive set of recorded phone messages’ \nand that its team ‘will call a targeted list of your prospects \nand play your message to them.’  Voice Broadcasting also offers \nto ‘furnish a phone list to dial to, for free,’ and maintains a \n‘database with hundreds of millions of records, which we will \nsearch through to find the people most likely to be interested \nin talking to you.’”  Id. at para. 31. \n \n The Amended Complaint alleges that “Defendant Life Corp provides communications services to Voice Broadcasting to enable \ncalling capabilities on the Voice Broadcasting platform,” id. at \npara. 36, and claims that Life Corp has been cited in the past for “failing to comply with federal laws and regulations \ngoverning the dissemination of robocalls,” id. at para. 37.   \n \n The third corporate defendant, Lingo Telecom, LLC, is “a telecommunications voice service provider, registered in the \nFederal Communication Commission’s (“FCC”) Form 499 Filer \nDatabase as Filer ID No. 802572.  It is registered to provide \ntelecommunication services in all 50 states, Washington, D.C., \nand Puerto Rico.”  Id. at para. 39.  The Amended Complaint \nalleges that, as a voice service provider, Lingo is required to employ an authentication system designed to verify that the Case 1:24-cv-00073-SM-TSM     Document 116     Filed 03/26/25     Page 8 of 48 \n9 party transmitting a call has the authority to use the Caller ID \ninformation they designate.  Id. at para. 40.  That system, \nwhich is known as the “STIR/SHAKEN framework,” helps inform and protect consumers “from illegal spoofed calls by enabling \nauthenticated caller ID information to travel securely with the \ncall itself through the entire call path.”  In the Matter of \nLingo Telecom, LLC, FCC Notice of Apparent Liability (May 28, \n2024) (document no. 71-11), at para. 4.  Despite those requirements, the FCC found that “Lingo signed Life’s spoofed \ntraffic with an A-level attestation without having established a \nverified association with the telephone number used in the \ncalls.”  Id. at para. 19.  The FCC proposed a penalty of \n$2,000,000 against Lingo for its role in the illegal robocall campaign that is the subject of this litigation.  Id. at para. \n1.   \n \n Finally, defendant Steve Kramer is a political consultant who provided services, including automated calls, to political \ncampaigns.  Kramer worked with an associate to create the audio \nmessage through artificial intelligence that mimicked or “deep \nfaked” the voice of President Biden.  On May 24, 2024, the FCC \nissued a “Notice of Apparent Liability for Forfeiture” in which \nit proposed “a penalty of $6,000,000 against Steve Kramer for \nperpetrating an illegal robocall campaign targeting potential Case 1:24-cv-00073-SM-TSM     Document 116     Filed 03/26/25     Page 9 of 48 \n10 New Hampshire voters two days before the state’s 2024 Democratic \nPresidential Primary Election in apparent violation of [several \nfederal statutes].”  In the Matter of Steve Kramer, Notice of \nApparent Liability (May 24, 2024) (document no. 71-3), at para. 1.   \n \nII. The “Deepfake Message” and Robocalls.   \n In November 2023, Defendant Steve Kramer asked an associate \nif he could create an AI-generated voice recording of President \nBiden, and the associate said that he could.  On January 19, \n2024, just days before the New Hampshire Primary, Kramer \nprovided a script to the associate, who then created an AI-\ngenerated recording, mimicking President Biden’s voice, of the \nfollowing message:  \nThis coming Tuesday is the New Hampshire Presidential \nPreference Primary.  Republicans have been trying to \npush nonpartisan and Democratic voters to participate \nin their primary.  What a bunch of malarkey.  We know the value of voting Democratic when our votes count.  \nIt’s important that you save your vote for the \nNovember election.  We’ll need your help in electing \nDemocrats up and down the ticket.  Voting this Tuesday \nonly enables the Republicans in their quest to elect \nDonald Trump again.  Your vote makes a difference in \nNovember, not this Tuesday.  \n \n \nFCC Notice of Apparent Liability – Kramer (document no. 71-3), \nat para. 5 (emphasis supplied).   \n Case 1:24-cv-00073-SM-TSM     Document 116     Filed 03/26/25     Page 10 of 48 \n11  In addition to the deepfake message itself, Kramer needed a \ncaller identification number to associate with the call.  He \nwanted to use the “603” New Hampshire area code, to make it more \nlikely that the call would be answered by New Hampshire \nresidents.  So, he decided to use the telephone number of Kathy \nSullivan, a prominent attorney and well-known former state \nDemocratic Party leader who was associated with President \nBiden’s campaign in New Hampshire.  Kramer then contacted Voice Broadcasting to set up a robocall, using the Deepfake Message, \nand arranged to have it distributed to approximately 25,000 \ntelephone numbers in the evening of Sunday, January 21, just two \ndays before the New Hampshire Primary.  Id. at para. 11.  Kramer \ninstructed Voice Broadcasting to use Kathy Sullivan’s telephone number as the caller ID for the Deepfake Robocall.  He did not \nsecure Sullivan’s permission to use her telephone number in \nassociation with that call.   \n \n At Voice Broadcasting’s suggestion, Kramer agreed to add a final sentence to the Deepfake Message, in a different voice, \nstating: “If you would like to be removed from future calls, \nplease press two now.  Call [the personal telephone number of \nKathy Sullivan] to be removed from future calls.”  Id.  This, of \ncourse, strongly implies that Voice Broadcasting was familiar with the content of the Deepfake Message and realized that it Case 1:24-cv-00073-SM-TSM     Document 116     Filed 03/26/25     Page 11 of 48 \n12 lacked any reference to a required opt-out mechanism.  According \nto the FCC, “By 7:12 p.m. on the night of Sunday, January 21, \nVoice Broadcasting - using Life’s services and equipment - had \ninitiated 9,581 calls carrying the Deepfake Message to potential \nNew Hampshire voters using the Spoofed Number as the caller ID number.”  FCC Notice of Apparent Liability – Kramer, at para. 11 \n(emphasis supplied).\n1     \n \n Voice Broadcasting and Life Corporation are affiliated companies – indeed, plaintiffs claim Life Corp. is an “alter \nego” of Voice Broadcasting.  See Plaintiffs’ Consolidated \nObjection (document no. 85) at 11.  Voice Broadcasting used Life Corporation’s services and equipment to initiate thousands of \nthe Deepfake Robocalls to telephone numbers in New Hampshire.  \nLife Corporation also routed some calls to Lingo Telecom, which \noriginated several thousand calls.  New Hampshire voters \nreceived at nearly 10,000 (perhaps more) robocalls with the deepfake message.\n2  Notice of Apparent Liability – Lingo \n(document no. 71-11), at 5.  \n \n1  The question of which party(s) “initiated” the illegal \nrobocalls at issue is central in determining which party(s) may \nbe liable under the Telephone Consumer Protection Act and is \ndiscussed more fully below.   \n2  In the FCC’s “Notice of Apparent Liability for Forfeiture” \nagainst Lingo Telecom (document no. 71-11), the FCC attributes \n Case 1:24-cv-00073-SM-TSM     Document 116     Filed 03/26/25     Page 12 of 48 \n13  \n The Deepfake Robocalls generated a significant amount of \nmedia coverage and, on February 25, 2024, Kramer publicly \nacknowledged that he had orchestrated the scheme and sent the \nDeepfake Robocalls.  In May, Kramer was indicted on 13 charges \nof felony voter suppression and 13 charges of misdemeanor \nimpersonating a candidate.  In this proceeding, default was \nentered against him in August of 2024.    \n Meanwhile, the Federal Communications Commission, in \nconjunction with the New Hampshire Attorney General and the \nUnited States Department of Justice, opened an investigation \ninto the Deepfake Robocalls.  On May 23, 2024, the FCC issued a \n“Notice of Apparent Liability for Forfeiture” to Lingo Telecom \nthat proposed a penalty of $2,000,000 for violations of 47 \nC.F.R. § 64.6301(a) (document no. 71-11), at para. 1.  The next \nday, the FCC issued a “Notice of Apparent Liability for Forfeiture” to Kramer that proposed a $6,000,000 penalty “for \nperpetrating an illegal robocall campaign targeting potential \nNew Hampshire voters two days before the state’s 2024 Democratic \n \n9,581 robocalls with the deepfake message to Lingo.  Plaintiffs \nassert that Lingo Telecom actually originated and provided A-level attestation to 13,235 robocalls from Life Corp. – a number apparently based on Lingo Telecom’s response to an FCC subpoena, \nbut not verified by the FCC.

The \nFCC later entered a Consent Decree with Lingo Telecom that \nrequires Lingo Telecom to pay a $1,000,000 civil penalty and “to \nimplement a robust compliance plan.”  Notice of Settlement with \nFCC (document no. 91-1), at 2.  \n \n In their First Amended Complaint (document no. 65), plaintiffs advance four claims: violation of Section 11(b) of \nthe Voting Right Act, 52 U.S.C. § 10307(b); violation of \nTelephone Consumer Protection Act, 47 U.S.C. § 227(b)(1)(B); \nviolation of N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. (“RSA”) 664:14-a; and \nviolation of RSA 664:14-b. \n \nDiscussion \nI. Standing.  \n Defendants Life Corporation and Voice Broadcasting \nCorporation assert that neither the organizational plaintiffs \nnor the individual plaintiffs have standing to bring the claims \nasserted in the Amended Complaint.  Specifically, defendants \nargue that plaintiffs have not sufficiently alleged an injury-\nin-fact or plausibly alleged that their injuries were caused by \nLife and Voice.  The court disagrees.   \n Case 1:24-cv-00073-SM-TSM     Document 116     Filed 03/26/25     Page 14 of 48 \n15  To establish standing, a plaintiff must demonstrate three \nthings: injury in fact, causation, and redressability.  That is \nto say, a plaintiff must show that: (1) they have suffered (or \nlikely will suffer) an actual injury; (2) the injury was likely \n(or will likely be) caused by the defendant; and (3) the \nrequested judicial relief would likely redress that injury.  \nSee, e.g., Food & Drug Admin. v. Alliance for Hippocratic Med., \n602 U.S. 367, 380 (2024); In re Fin. Oversight & Mgmt. Bd. for \nPuerto Rico, 110 F.4th 295, 308 (1st Cir. 2024).  Organizational \nplaintiffs, like the League, can either have standing in their \nown right, or they can have what is known as “associational \nstanding,” to redress an injury suffered by their members.  See \ngenerally Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Env’t Servs. \n(TOC), Inc., 528 U.S. 167, 181 (2000).  Here, the League \nentities assert that they have organizational standing in their own right to redress particular injuries that they have \nsuffered.   \n \n For the individual plaintiffs, establishing standing is relatively straight forward.  The Voting Rights Act provides, in \npertinent part, that no person “shall intimidate, threaten, or \ncoerce, or attempt to intimidate, threaten, or coerce any person \nfor voting or attempting to vote.”  52 U.S.C. § 10307(b) (emphasis supplied).  The individual plaintiffs received the Case 1:24-cv-00073-SM-TSM     Document 116     Filed 03/26/25     Page 15 of 48 \n16 Deepfake Robocalls.  And, there can be little debate that those \ncalls were specifically designed to dissuade potential \nDemocratic voters from casting a ballot in the primary election \nby means of a “threat” and/or “intimidation.”  The “threat” \ncommunicated by the Deepfake Robocalls was that if an individual \nvoted in the primary, their subsequent vote in the general would \nbe invalidated (“save your vote for the November election”).  \nThe calls also threatened that if the recipient voted in the primary, they would undermine President Biden’s re-election \nefforts (“Voting this Tuesday only enables the Republicans in \ntheir question to elect Donald Trump again.”).   \n \n As the United States District Court for the Southern \nDistrict of New York has noted,   \nThere is limited precedent discussing what “threaten” \nand “intimidate” mean in the context of Section 11(b).  \nBut the plain meaning of those terms, the few cases \nthat interpret Section 11(b), and cases that interpret the same or similar language in other civil rights \nstatutes all indicate that intimidation includes \nmessages that a reasonable recipient, familiar with \nthe context of the message, would interpret as a \nthreat of injury - whether physical or nonviolent - intended to deter individuals from exercising their \nvoting rights.  Threats, intimidation or coercion may \ntake on many forms.  As the Court explained \npreviously, actions or communications that inspire \nfear of economic harm, legal repercussions, privacy violations, and even surveillance can constitute unlawful threats or intimidation under the statute. \n  Case 1:24-cv-00073-SM-TSM     Document 116     Filed 03/26/25     Page 16 of 48 \n17 Nat’l Coal. on Black Civic Participation v.

Mass. 2017) (“This court agrees \nwith the majority of courts finding that Congress, when it \nenacted the TCPA, recognized receiving unsolicited telemarketing \ncalls is a legally cognizable harm and comprises a “concrete” \ninjury.

Unsolicited \ntelemarketing phone calls . . . by their nature, invade the privacy and disturb the solitude of their recipients.”) \n(collecting cases) (citations and internal punctuation omitted; \nemphasis supplied).  \n \n The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reached a \nsimilar conclusion in Van Patten v. Vertical Fitness Grp., LLC, \n847 F.3d 1037 (9th Cir. 2017), noting that:  \n \nAs the Supreme Court [has] explained . . . “both \nhistory and the judgment of Congress play important \nroles” in supporting our conclusion that a violation of the TCPA is a concrete, de facto injury.  Actions \nto remedy defendants’ invasions of privacy, intrusion \nupon seclusion, and nuisance have long been heard by \nAmerican courts, and the right of privacy is recognized by most states.  And in enacting the TCPA, \nCongress made specific findings that “unrestricted \ntelemarketing can be an intrusive invasion of privacy” and are a “nuisance.”  Congress sought to protect consumers from the unwanted intrusion and nuisance of \nunsolicited telemarketing phone calls and fax \nadvertisements. . . .. Case 1:24-cv-00073-SM-TSM     Document 116     Filed 03/26/25     Page 44 of 48 \n45  \nThe TCPA establishes the substantive right to be free \nfrom certain types of phone calls and texts absent \nconsumer consent.  Congress identified unsolicited contact as a concrete harm, and gave consumers a means to redress this harm. . . ..   \n \nCongress aimed to curb telemarketing calls to which \nconsumers did not consent by prohibiting such conduct \nand creating a statutory scheme giving damages if that \nprohibition was violated. . . . [T]he telemarketing \ntext messages at issue here, absent consent, present \nthe precise harm and infringe the same privacy \ninterests Congress sought to protect in enacting the \nTCPA.  Unsolicited telemarketing phone calls or text \nmessages, by their nature, invade the privacy and \ndisturb the solitude of their recipients.  A plaintiff \nalleging a violation under the TCPA need not allege any additional harm beyond the one Congress has identified.   \n  \n847 F.3d at 1042–43 (citations and internal punctuation omitted; \nemphasis supplied).   \n \n So it is in this case.  Representative Paul Spies, one of the primary sponsors of House Bill 332 (which was eventually \nenacted as RSA 664:14-a), testified that the bill was designed to protect against caller ID spoofing in political robocalls – \nconduct which prevented voters from knowing who made the call, \nwho paid for the call, if a political candidate was endorsing \nit, or how to opt out of future calls.  He described robocalls \nwithout accurate caller-ID information or an opt-out mechanism \nas representing an interference with citizens’ right to privacy \nand the quiet enjoyment of their homes.  See House Committee on Case 1:24-cv-00073-SM-TSM     Document 116     Filed 03/26/25     Page 45 of 48 \n46 Election Law, Written Testimony of Rep. Paul Sies (Jan. 29, \n2003), available at https://gc.nh.gov/bill_status/legacy \n/bs2016/sos_archives.aspx?lsr=76&sy=2003&sortoption=&txtsessionyear=2003&txtbillnumber=hb332, “House Actions.”  Those rights \nwere plainly invaded when defendants directed the Deepfake \nRobocalls to the individual plaintiffs’ landlines.   \n \n Whether the League entities have standing to assert claims under RSA 664:14-a and/or RSA 664:14-b is a closer question.  In \nparticular, those organizations have not clearly articulated how \nthey were injured by defendants’ failure to state the name of \nthe candidate, measure, or organization(s) on whose behalf the \nrobocall was made.  Nor have they clearly stated the harm they \nsuffered as a result of defendants’ failure to state the name of \nthe person or organization paying for the delivery of the \nmessage.  See generally RSA 664:14-a.  Perhaps a stronger case \ncan be made that, for the reasons discussed above, the League \nentities were directly and demonstrably injured by defendants’ \nuse of the spoofed caller ID information, the confusion that \ncaused on the part of voters, and the economic cost that imposed \non the League entities.  See generally RSA 664:14-b.   \n  But, at this juncture at least, the court need not resolve \nwhether the League entities have standing to advance the state Case 1:24-cv-00073-SM-TSM     Document 116     Filed 03/26/25     Page 46 of 48 \n47 statutory claims set forth in the complaint.  It is enough that \nthe individual plaintiffs plainly have standing to bring those \nclaims.  And, when multiple plaintiffs file suit, it is \nsufficient if at least one plaintiff has standing to assert each \nclaim advanced.  See generally Town of Chester v. Laroe Estates, \nInc., 581 U.S. 433, 439-40 (2017) (When there are multiple \nplaintiffs, “[a]t least one plaintiff must have standing.”); \nVillage of Arlington Heights v. Metro. Hous. Dev. Corp., 429 \nU.S. 252, 264 & n.9, (1977) (“[We] have at least one individual \nplaintiff who has demonstrated standing . . . Because of the \npresence of this plaintiff, we need not consider whether the \nother plaintiffs have standing to maintain the suit.”); \nChildren’s Health Def., Inc. v. Rutgers, the State Univ. of New \nJersey, 93 F.4th 66, 75 (3d Cir. 2024) (“When multiple \nplaintiffs sue, at least one plaintiff must have standing to \nassert each claim.”); Hyland v. Navient Corp., 48 F.4th 110, \n117–18 (2d Cir. 2022) (“Standing is satisfied so long as at \nleast one named plaintiff can demonstrate the requisite \ninjury.”) (collecting cases).   \n  Consequently, even if the League entities lack standing to \nbring the claims under RSA 664:14-a (and perhaps even 664:14-b), \nthe presence of the individual plaintiffs – who plainly do have \nstanding – is sufficient to allow those claims to proceed.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: The case involves Blackbird Special Project, LLC, a qui tam plaintiff, alleging that Invitation Homes, Inc., violated the California False Claims Act by failing to obtain necessary permits for home renovations and thereby evading permit fees and higher property taxes. AI and automated systems were crucial to Relator's claims, as they used proprietary software, including AI and machine learning, to gather evidence of unpermitted renovations by analyzing differences between pre- and post-renovation images of properties.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the Plaintiff’s allegations of fraud under the California False Claims Act should be dismissed due to the public disclosure bar or the failure to state a claim with requisite specificity.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court denied Defendant’s motion to dismiss, finding that the Plaintiff’s use of websites like Zillow did not trigger the public disclosure bar and that Plaintiff’s detailed allegations and statistical analysis sufficed to state a plausible claim under the California False Claims Act.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: In simpler terms, a group called Blackbird accused Invitation Homes of cheating by not getting permits to fix up houses, avoiding fees and higher taxes. Blackbird used clever tech to spot the cheats, comparing old and new property photos to show changes were made. Invitation Homes argued that everyone could know this info already and Blackbird didn’t provide enough proof. However, the court said Blackbird's tech-assisted investigation was detailed enough to let the case continue, like showing your math homework was done neatly and correctly enough to think there might be a mistake in your teacher’s textbook.",

(ECF No. 10.)  The Court decides the matter on the papers submitted and \nwithout oral argument.  See Civ. L.R. 7.1(d.1).  For the reasons stated below, Defendant’s \nmotion to dismiss is denied.   \nI. BACKGROUND  \n Qui tam plaintiff Blackbird Special Project, LLC1 (“Relator”) brings this false \nclaims action on behalf of eighteen municipalities in California and Roes 1 through 250 \n \n1 The investigation leading up to this case was started by Deckard Technologies, Inc., which then \ntransferred the investigation in March of 2020 to Blackbird Technologies, LLC, a spin-off of Deckard.  \n(ECF No. 1- 2, at 9 n.2.)  Both companies are collectively referred to as “Relator” for convenience.   Case 3:22-cv-00260-BAS-MMP   Document 16   Filed 01/03/23   PageID.<pageID>   Page 1 of 12 \n   2 \n22-cv-260-L-MDD  1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 (collectively, “Plaintiffs”) against Invitation Homes, Inc. (“Defendant”).  According to \nthe first amended complaint, Defendant is a prem ier home -leasing company whose \npredecessor  was fo unded  in 2012.  (ECF No. 1 -2, at 9; ECF No. 10, at 11. )  Since 2012 , \nDefendant has bought  homes  for the purpose of renting them out  in many states,  \npredominantly  in California.  ( Id. at 6.)   In August of 2017, Defendant merged with \nStarwood Waypoint Homes (“Starwood”), another owner and operator of single -family \nhomes, increasing Defendant’s portfolio of single -family homes in California by about \n5,500.  ( Id. at 9, 18.)  As of December 31, 201 9, Defendant owned almost 80,000 single -\nfamily homes in twelve states, including over 12,000 in California.  ( Id. at 7, 9. )   \n The first amended complaint  alleges that Defendant violated the California False \nClaims Act (“CFCA”), Cal. Gov’t Code § 12651, by renovating thousands of homes \nwithout obtaining the necessary permits thereby  depriving Plaintiffs of permit fees.  ( Id. \nat 9, 17.)   Relator alleges that Defendant’s failure to obtain permits also allowed it to \navoid  revaluations that would have happe ned if permits  were obtained , thus evading  \nincreased property taxes on the improved properties and further defrauding Plaintiffs.  \n(Id. at 7 n.1, 17.)  Relator claims that Defendant intentionally ignored permitting laws to \navoid the fees and increased taxe s as well as get renovated homes on the rental market as \nsoon as possible.  ( Id. at 17.)   \n To support these assertions, Relator used proprietary software to scour different \nrental listing websites such as Zillow.com2 and Defendant’s website to identify homes \nowned by Defendant.  Relator then used its proprietary “lookback” technology to access \npre-renovation  images of the homes from a  multiple listing service (“MLS”)3 and \ncompare them with post -renovation images from the rental advertisements.  ( Id. at 19–\n \n2 Zillow.com is an online rental marketplac e that hosts a database of homes for sale, homes for rent, and \nhomes not currently on the market as well as home value and rent estimates, among other home -related \ninformation.  See Zillow, About Us , https://www.zillow.com/corp/About.z . \n3 A multiple listing service is a database that provides information about properties for sale  in a specified \ngeographical location.  See, e.g. , MLS.com , What is MLS.com?, https://www.mls.com.

Relator provides fifteen examples of the before and after comparisons to illustrat e \nthat renovations took place.  ( See id. )  Relator then accessed the permit records through \nthe Plaintiffs’ websites for each of  the homes in the examples and found that no permits \nwere pulled for any of the renovations.  ( See id. )      \nRelator also used Plaintiffs’ permit records to compar e the percentage of \nDefendant’s homes for which one or more building permits were obtained after \nDefendant acquired the property with the percentage of all other homes in the jurisdiction \nwhich had permits pulled in the same time period.  ( Id. at 30.)  Rela tor provided the \nresults of this comparison for four of the Plaintiffs  and noted that Defendant obtained \npermits at a lower percentage in all four municipalitie s.  (Id.)  Relator contends that this  \ncomparison of permit rates supports an inference of a widespread fraudulent scheme taking place across the state of California.  ( Id. at 31.)   \nDefendant now moves to dismiss Plaintiffs ’ first amended complaint on two \ngrounds: (1) the complaint is barred by the public disclosure doctrine under section  \n12652(d)(3)  of the California Government Code, and (2) Plaintiff has failed to state a \nclaim upon which relief can be granted and to plead such a claim with the requisite particularity pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) and 9(b).  (ECF No. 10.)  The Court addresses each argument in turn.    \nII. PUBLIC DISCLOSURE DOCTRINE  \nThe public disclosure doctrine provides that “[t] he court shall dismiss” a qui tam \naction  “if substantially the same allegations or transactions as alleged in the action or \nclaim we re publicly disclosed.”4  Cal. Gov’t Code § 12652(d)(3).   This is because “where \nthere has been a public disclosure the governmental authority is ‘already in a position to \n \n4 The statute bars dismissal on public disclosure grounds when the motion is opposed by the \n“prosecuting authority of a political subdivision.”  Cal. Gov’t Code § 12652(d)(3).  Here, only the \nprosecuting authorities from the cities of Corona and Riverside filed a notice opposing dismissal on the basis of public disclosure.  (ECF No. 12.)  Therefore, the Court denies Defendant’s motion to dismiss on public disclosure grounds only as to these two plaintiffs  from the outset but must determine the \ndoctrine’s applicability as to all other plaintiffs.  Case 3:22-cv-00260-BAS-MMP   Document 16   Filed 01/03/23   PageID.<pageID>   Page 3 of 12 \n   4 \n22-cv-260-L-MDD  1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 vindicate society's interests, and a qui tam action would serve no purpose.’”  State of \nCalifornia v. Pac. Bell Tel. Co., 48 Cal. Rptr. 3d 427, 431 (2006) (quoting U.S. ex rel. \nFeingold v. AdminaStar Fed., Inc. , 324 F.3d 492, 495 (7th Cir. 2003)).   It follows that \ndismissal is only warranted if “ the publicly available information is already sufficient to \nplace the government on notice of the alleged fraud.”  Id. (quoting U.S. ex rel. Longstaffe \nv. Litton Indus., Inc. , 296 F. Supp. 2d 1187, 1192 (C.D. Cal. 2003) ).   \n In accordance with the underlying policy, the statute does not preclude qui tam \nactions based on any  public disclosure.  Rather, the information must have been publicly \ndisclosed in one of the specific channels  identified in the statute.  See State of California \nv. Pac. Bell Tel. Co. , 48 Cal. Rptr. 3d 427, 432– 33 (2006)  (“The fora identified in the \nstatute further limit our review.”)  Most relevant here, the sources covered under the \npublic disclosure doctrine include news media  and government reports.  See Cal. Gov’t \nCode § 12652(d)(3).   \nDefendant asserts that Zillow.com , the MLS, and Defendant’s website qualify as \nnews media under CFCA’s public disclosure bar.  (ECF No. 10, at 18.)  Defendant takes \nthe position that “websites accessible to anyone on the internet meet the definition of \n‘news media.’”  ( Id.)  Thus, Defendant claims,  Plaintiffs’ reliance on such websites \ntrigger the public disclosure bar which is fatal to their claim.  ( Id.)   \n The Court declines to adopt Defendant’s broad interpretation of the term  “news \nmedia .”  Although the Supreme Court has held that the public disclosure bar has a \n“generally broad scope,” it also recognized that “[b]y its plain terms, the public \ndisclosure bar applies to some methods of public di sclosure and not to others.”   Schindler \nElevator Corp. v. U.S. ex rel. Kirk , 563 U.S. 401,  408, 414 (2011) .5  In other words, b y \n \n5 Precedent developed under the federal False Claims Act may be considered insofar as the federal and \nstate statutes are the same.  Ci ty of Pomona v. Superior Ct., 107 Cal. Rptr. 2d 710, 716 (2001) ; State of \nCalifornia ex rel. Bowen v. Bank of Am. Corp., 23 Cal. Rptr. 3d 746, 758 n.11 (2005) .  Here, federal law \nis instructive because the public disclosure provisions of the two statutes are functionally identical.  \nCompare Cal. Gov’t Code § 12652(d)(3), with 31 U.S.C. § 3730(e)(4).   Case 3:22-cv-00260-BAS-MMP   Document 16   Filed 01/03/23   PageID.<pageID>   Page 4 of 12 \n   5 \n22-cv-260-L-MDD  1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 enumerating specific sources that narrow the definition of a public disclosure, the statute \ndoes not “capture all information that could be described as ‘public’ in common \nparlance.”  United States ex rel. Integra Med Analytics LLC v. Providence Health & \nServs. , No. CV 17- 1694 PSG (SSX), 2019 WL 3282619, at *10 (C.D. Cal. July 16, \n2019), rev'd and remanded on other grounds , 854 F. App'x 840 (9th Cir. 2021) .  Another \ncourt in this district found  that “ applying the news media provision to anything ever \npublished publicly on the internet is contrary to the ordinary meaning of the term ‘news \nmedia .’”  United States ex rel. MC2 Sabtech Holdings, Inc. v. GET Eng'g Corp. , 580 F. \nSupp. 3d 876, 889  (S.D. Cal. 2022)  (quoting Integra , 2019 WL 3282619 , at *1 2).  This \nCourt agrees.    \nIn MC2 Sabtech Holdings , the court  considered  whether the defendant company ’s \nwebsite  and filings with the  California Secretary of State were “news media” for \npurposes of the federal False Claims Act.  See MC2 Sabtech Holdings, 580 F. Supp. 3d at \n889– 90.  In concluding that neither source was “news media,” the court found that the \ninformation on the websites appeared unlikely to be considered particularly newsworthy, \nand the websites themselves were not “curated” but simply pub lished information about \nthe organizations.  Id. at 890.  The court also found that even though the websites were \nintended to circulate information widely, the “conveyance of this information [was] \nmerely ancillary” to the organizations’ primary businesses.  Id.   Most importantly, the \ncourt found that the websites did not fall under the “‘broad ordinary meaning’ of the term \n‘news media’ ” such that  they “could reasonably be described as ‘news media’ as at least \nsome people would [use] that term in everyday speech .”  Integra , 2019 WL 3282619, at \n*15 (quoting Schindler Elevator Corp. , 563 U.S. at 408).     \nThe same analysis  applies  here.  The content contained in the websites that Relator  \nrelies on, mainly rental listi ngs, is unlikely to be considered newsworthy rather than \ninformational.  Further, although the websites are intended to circulate information \nwidely, the conveyance of information on the websites is ancillary to the organizations’  \nprimary business es of providing a marketplace for real estate and  information about Case 3:22-cv-00260-BAS-MMP   Document 16   Filed 01/03/23   PageID.<pageID>   Page 5 of 12 \n   6 \n22-cv-260-L-MDD  1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 rental homes.  As such, the Court finds that the websites Relator  relied on do not fit into \nthe broad ordinary meaning of the term “news media.”   Accordingly, the Court finds that \nthe disclosures in the first amended complaint are not public disclosures for purposes of \nthe statute.  \n Defendant also argues that the municipal records reviewed by Relator are \ngovernment reports and are thus public disclosures under the statute.   (ECF No. 10, at16–\n17.)  Even assuming that a disclosure qualifies as a public disclosure under the statute, \ndismissal is only warranted where such disclosure reveals the “allegations or  \ntransactions” underlying the complaint.  Cal. Gov’t Code § 12652(d)(3).  In analyzing \nwhether the transactions underlying a relator’s complaint were publicly disclosed, the \nNinth Circuit adopted the following analysis:  \nIf X + Y = Z, Z represents  the allegation of fraud and X and Y represent  its \nessential  elements .  In order to disclose the fraudulent transaction publicly, \nthe combination of X and Y must be revealed, from which readers or \nlisteners may infer Z, i.e., the conclusion that fraud has been committed.  \n \nU.S. ex rel. Found. Aiding The Elderly v. Horizon W. , 265 F.3d 1011, 1015 (9th Cir. \n2001) (quoting U.S. ex rel. Springfield Terminal Ry. Co. v. Quinn,  14 F.3d 645, 654 (D.C. \nCir. 1994)).     \n Here,  X represents actions taken by Defendant that would require a permit, while \nY represents Defendant’s failure to obtain one.  Taken together, one may infer that fraud \nwas committed.  The Court has already found that the websites Relator  used to \ndemonstrate that Defendant performed permit -requiring renovations were not public \ndisclosures.  So, assuming arguendo  that the databases Relator  used to show Defendant \nfailed to obtain permits are government reports for purposes of the statute , these \ndisclosures by themselves  are not enough to implicate the public disclosure doctrine \nbecause X is still missing from the equation.   Without X, an inference of fraud cannot be \nmade, and the government is not put  on notice of the alleged fraud.  Consequently, the Case 3:22-cv-00260-BAS-MMP   Document 16   Filed 01/03/23   PageID.<pageID>   Page 6 of 12 \n   7 \n22-cv-260-L-MDD  1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 Cour t declines to dismi ss Plaintiff’s complaint on public disclosure grounds as to all \nPlaintiffs. \nIII. F AILURE TO STATE A CLAIM  \nHaving determined that dismissal is not warranted under the public disclosure \ndoctrine , the Court turns to Defendant’s motion to dismiss for failure to sta te a claim \nunder Federal R ules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) and 9(b).   \nA. Legal Standard s  \ni. Motion to Dismiss Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6)  \nA 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss tests the sufficiency of the complaint.  Navarro v. \nBlock , 250 F.3d 729, 732 (9th Cir. 2001).  A pleading must contain, in part, “a short and \nplain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. \n8(a)(2).  But plaintiffs must also plead “enough facts to state a claim to r elief that is \nplausible on its face.”  Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly , 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007); see also \nFed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6).  The plausibility standard demands more than “a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action,” or “‘naked assertion s’ devoid of ‘further \nfactual enhancement.’”  Ashcroft v. Iqbal , 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) (quoting Twombly , \n550 U.S. at 557).  Instead, the complaint “must contain allegations of underlying facts sufficient to give fair notice and to enable the opposing party to defend itself effectively.”  Starr v. Baca, 652 F.3d 1202, 1216 (9th Cir. 2011).  \nIn reviewing a 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, “[a]ll allegations of material fact are \ntaken as true and construed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.”  Cah ill \nv. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. , 80 F.3d 336, 337 –38 (9th Cir. 1996).  However, a court need not \ntake legal conclusions as true merely because they are cast in the form of factual \nallegations.  See  Roberts v. Corrothers , 812 F.2d 1173, 1177 (9th Cir. 1987).  Similarly, \n“conclusory allegations of law and unwarranted inferences are not sufficient to defeat a \nmotion to dismiss.”  Pareto v. FDIC , 139 F.3d 696, 699 (9th Cir. 1998).  \n \n  Case 3:22-cv-00260-BAS-MMP   Document 16   Filed 01/03/23   PageID.<pageID>   Page 7 of 12 \n   8 \n22-cv-260-L-MDD  1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 ii. Motion to Dismiss Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b) \nIn addition to meeting the pleading demands of Rule 8, Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 9(b)  requires a plaintiff bringing a claim grounded in fraud to “state with \nparticularity the circumstances constituting fraud or mistake .”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(b); see \nalso Vess v. Ciba- Geigy Corp. USA, 317 F.3d 1097, 1103– 04 (9th Cir. 2003) .6  The \nallegations of fraud must be “specific enough to give defendants notice of the particular \nmisconduct . . . so that they can defend against the charge and not just deny that the y \nhave done anything wrong.”  Bly -Magee v. California , 236 F.3d 1014, 1019 (9th Cir. \n2001) (internal quotations omitted).   This is accomplished by describing the  “who, what, \nwhen, where, and how” of the  charged  misconduct.  Vess , 317 F.3d  at 1106  (quotation \nomitted) .  While “mere conclusory allegations of fraud are insufficient, ” Moore v. \nKayport Package Exp., Inc. , 885 F.2d 531, 540 (9th Cir. 1989) , “[m]alice, intent, \nknowledge, and other conditions of a person's mind may be alleged generally.”  Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 9(b) . \nB. Count One —Violation of California False Claims Act (Cal. Gov’t Code \n§ 12651(a)(7))  \nRelator  alleges a violation of the “reverse false claims” provision of the CFCA.  \nSee State of California ex rel. Bowen v. Bank of Am. Corp ., 23 Cal. Rptr. 3d 746, 750  \n(2005) .  To state a claim u nder such provision, Relator  must  allege with particularity that \nDefendant (1) concealed or improperly avoided or decreased an obligation to pay the \ngovernment, and (2) did so knowingly.  Cal. Gov’t Co de § 12651 (a)(7).      \nThe use of representative examples is one means for a plaintiff to meet the \npleading obligation under Rule 9.  Ebeid ex rel. U.S. v. Lungwitz, 616 F.3d 993, 998  (9th \nCir. 2010) ; see also  Aflatooni ex rel. U.S. v. Kitsap Physicians Serv. , 314 F.3d 995, 1002 \n(9th Cir. 2002)  (“Evidence of an actual false claim is the sine qua non of a False Claims \n \n6 Neither party disputes the applicability of Rule 9 to Plaintiff’s claim under the CFCA.  ( See generally \nECF Nos. 10, 11.)   Case 3:22-cv-00260-BAS-MMP   Document 16   Filed 01/03/23   PageID.<pageID>   Page 8 of 12 \n   9 \n22-cv-260-L-MDD  1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 Act violation.” (internal quotation omitted)). 7  Rel ator need not “identify representative \nexamples of false claims to support every  allegation,” but must “allege particular details \nof a scheme to submit false claims paired with reliable indicia  that lead to a strong \ninference  that claims were actually submitted,” or in this case, not submitted despite an \nobligation to do so.  Ebeid , 616 F.3d at 998– 99 (emphas is added ) (quoting U.S. ex rel. \nGrubbs v. Kanneganti , 565 F.3d 180, 190 (5th Cir. 2009)).  \nDefendant maintain s that the first amended  complaint falls short on both aspect s of \na well- pled claim for fraud.  First, Defendant argues that Relator  failed to allege an y \nspecific false claim with the requisite particularity.  (ECF No. 10, at 21– 24.)  Defendant \naddresses the photos in the complaint and notes that Relator excluded  facts that  establish \nDefendant or its predecessor owned the homes depicted in the photos when the purported \nrenovations occurred.  ( Id. at 21.)   Defendant also provides reasons to doubt the \ncompleteness of the online permitting records Relator  used, arguing that even if it is \nestablished that the renovations took place Relator  cannot prove that Defendant failed to \nobtain the necessary permits based on such unreliable sources.  ( Id. at 24.)   Because of \nthese deficiencies, Defendant asserts that Relator  has not identified a representative \nexample of a false claim and thus fails to allege particular details of a scheme to survive a \nmotion to dismiss.  ( Id. at 21 –24.)  \nSecond, Defend ant argues that Relator  failed to allege a scheme with the requisite \nparticularity that warrants the inference of any false claims.  (ECF No. 10, at 24 –29.)  \nSpecifically, Defendant states that Relator’s statistical analysis contains none of the rigor or detail required to withstand a motion to dismiss, as it contain s scant explanation of its \ndata analysis and stat es only in vague and conclusory terms that it “implemented artificial \nintelligence and machine learning.”  ( Id. at 26.)  Defendant also attacks the inference of \n \n7 Like the public disclosure doc trine, the reverse false claims provisions of the federal and state statutes \nare the same.  Compare Cal. Gov't Code § 12651(a)(7) , with 31 U.S.C. § 3729(a)(1)(G) .   Case 3:22-cv-00260-BAS-MMP   Document 16   Filed 01/03/23   PageID.<pageID>   Page 9 of 12 \n   10 \n22-cv-260-L-MDD  1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 fraud by noting that the complaint presents statistics for only four of the eighteen \nmunicipalities.  ( Id.)  \nThe Court finds that Relator has sufficiently alleged specific  evidence of unlawful \nconduct .  Relator provides details including that “who” ( the Defendant  company) (see \ngenerally ECF No. 1- 2); the “what” ( undertaking renovations that require a permit and \nfailing to obtain such a permit)  (id. at 17 –30); the “when” (since the Defendant company \nwas founded in 2012 and  started purchasing homes following the 2007 to 2008 financial \ncrisis) ( id. at 9); the “where” (in each of the  named  eighteen  municipalities including \nfifteen specific addresses described  in the complaint) ( id. at 9, 20– 30); and the “how” \n(intentionally ig noring permitting laws) ( id. at 17).  The ownership of the homes at issue, \nthe nature and value of any renovations performed including whether they necessitated a \npermit, and the reliability and completeness of the permit databases are all factual \ndetermin ations to be resolved at a later stage of the proceedings.  Here, the allegations in \nthe complaint, when taken as true, fill in the details necessary to plead particular instances  of fraud .  See, e.g., United States ex rel. Lupo v. Quality Assurance Servs., Inc. , \n242 F. Supp. 3d 1020, 1026 (S.D. Cal. 2017)  (finding sufficient pleading under Rule 9 \nwhere the complai nt included th e who, what, when , where, and ho w of the alleged fraud ).  \nMoreover, Relator’s allegations provide reliable indicia to sup port a strong \ninference of a fraudulent scheme .  Relator described its  process of comparing the rates at \nwhich permits were pulled for Defendant’s properties with other properties in the same jurisdiction and gave a plausible explanation for the results.   The  alleged disparities \nbetween  the rates  leads to a strong inference that Defendant engaged in a pattern of \nfraudulent activity  beyond the specific examples in the complaint.  This reliable indicia  of \nfraud in combination with the examples are sufficient to state a claim under Rule 9.   See \nUnited States v. Mariner Health Care, Inc. , 552 F. Supp. 938, 948 (N.D. Cal.  2021)  \n(“[Relator ’s] statistical models, combined with the particular details it has provided \nregarding the ‘ who, what, when, where, and how’ of the fraudulent scheme, are sufficient \nto state a claim under the FCA. ”).        Case 3:22-cv-00260-BAS-MMP   Document 16   Filed 01/03/23   PageID.<pageID>   Page 10 of\n12 \n   11 \n22-cv-260-L-MDD  1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 Although Defendant provides alternative explanations for the statistical disparities,  \n(ECF No. 10, at 28 –29), where there are “two alternative explanations, one advanced by \ndefendant and the other advanced by plaintiff, both of which are plausible, plaintiff's \ncomplaint survives a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) ,” Starr v. Baca , 652 F.3d \n1202, 1216 (9th Cir. 2011).  In fact, a “complaint may be dismissed only when \ndefendant's plausible alternative explanation is so convincing that plaintiff's explanation \nis im plausible.”  Id.   While Defendant’s explanations for the statistical disparities may \nalso be plausible, they do not undermine Relator’s theories to the point of implausibility . \n Defendant also assert s that Relator  failed to adequately plead that Defendant \nknowingly  concealed or avoided an obligation, which is required to state a claim under \nthe CFCA.  (ECF No. 10, at 29) ; Cal. Gov’t Code § 12651(a)(7).   Under the C FCA’s \nscienter requirement, “innocent mistakes, mere negligent misrepresentations and \ndifferences in interpretations will not suffice to create liability.”  United States v. Corinthian Colleges, 655 F.3d 984, 996  (9th Cir. 2011) .  Instead, Relator must allege \nactual knowledge of falsity or reckless disregard of the truth.  See id.      \nAllegations that Defendant “buried [its] head in the sand and failed to make simple \ninquiries which would alert [it] that false claims are being submitted” is sufficient to \nplead scienter.   Godecke v. Kinetic Concepts, Inc. , 937 F.3d 1201, 1211 (9th Cir. 2019) \n(quoting United States v. United Healthcare Ins. Co. , 848 F.3d 1161, 1174 (9th Cir. \n2016)) .  Therefore, Relator can sufficiently plead scienter e ither by alleging that \nDefendant knew of its obligation to obtain a permit and did not do so, or by alleging that \nDefendant did not  inquire as to whether its renovations required permits in the first place.   \nDefendant was allegedly aware of local laws and regulations requiring permits as \nevidenced by its statement on its 10-k form.  ( See ECF No. 1 -2, at 18 –19.)  By showing \nthat Defendant failed  to obtain permits despite general awareness of the existence of \npermitting laws and regulations, Relato r has sufficiently pled that, at the very least, \nDefendant was unaware that a permit was required due to its own lack of inquiry.  Thus, \nthe complaint satisfies the scienter pleading requirement.  Whether Defendant knew the Case 3:22-cv-00260-BAS-MMP   Document 16   Filed 01/03/23   PageID.<pageID>   Page 11 of\n12 \n   12 \n22-cv-260-L-MDD  1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 laws existed and reasonably beli eved it was in compliance is a factual dispute not ripe for \nresolution on a motion to dismiss.  ( See ECF No. 10, at 30.)     \nDefendant’s arguments that Relator did not plead scienter as to Defendant’s \nindependent contractors and Starwood are likewise unavailing. (ECF No. 10, at 30.)   \nNeglecting to hold a contractor or Starwood responsible for investigating whether a \npermit is required employs the same state of mind as failing to do the inve stigating itself.   \nTherefore, Relator has met all requirements to sufficiently state a claim under the CFCA.        \nIV. CONCLUSION  \nFor the reasons stated above, Defendant’s motion to dismiss is DENIED.   \n IT IS SO ORDERED.  \n \nDated :  January 3 , 2023   \n  \n \nCase 3:22-cv-00260-BAS-MMP   Document 16   Filed 01/03/23   PageID.<pageID>   Page 12 of\n12",

    "summary": "1. **Summary:**\n   In this case, Shree Veer Corporation and Chief Hospitality, LLC, filed a lawsuit against OYO Hotels, Inc., alleging breach of contract and fraud. The plaintiffs claimed that OYO misrepresented the effectiveness of its AI-driven revenue management and booking software, which was supposed to increase business for OYO-franchised hotels. The court dismissed the plaintiffs' claims of fraud by nondisclosure and fraudulent inducement for failing to meet the pleading standards under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) and 9(b), allowing the plaintiffs to amend their complaint.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue:**\n   The key legal issue is whether OYO committed fraud by nondisclosure and fraudulent inducement by allegedly not fully disclosing the limitations and deficiencies in its revenue management and booking software systems.\n\n3. **Court's Holding:**\n   The court granted OYO's motion to dismiss the fraud claims due to the plaintiffs' failure to plead their allegations with sufficient particularity and detail as required by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. However, the court allowed the plaintiffs an opportunity to amend their complaint to address these deficiencies.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation:**\n   Imagine you and your friends own a hotel and sign a deal with a company that promises advanced computer programs to attract more guests and money. Later, you find out the company's promises might not be true, and you didn't make as much money as expected. You sue them for tricking you but the judge says you didn't explain your case well enough. The judge lets you try again to make your explanation clearer so the court can understand what went wrong.",

First, Plaintiffs  contend  that Defendant Case 3:20-cv-03268-L   Document 20   Filed 09/30/21    Page 1 of 12   PageID <pageID> \nMemorandum Opinion and Order - Page 2 \n \n breached its contracts with them “ by, at a minimum, improperly  withholding the guaranteed \nrevenue payments required by the contracts between each Plaintiff and  Defendant .”  Pl.’s First \nAm. Compl. 10, ¶ 31.   \nSecond, they contend that OYO committed fraud by nondisclosure causing them injury \nwhen it “partially disclosed [] information to Plaintiffs” through Defendant’s CEO , Mr. Ritesh \nAgarwal (“Mr. Agarwal”)  including, but not limited to:  \na. Defendant’s sophisticated revenue management and guest stay booking  \nsoftware platforms would increase the property owners’ business;  \nb. Defendant’s guest stay booking algorithms and revenue modeling tools \nwere  state-of-the-art and drew on data and sophisticated modeling from \nhotel  operations around the world and were developed using the best \nartificial  intelligence and/or machine learning talent and resources available \nanywhere;  \nc. Defendant’s software was incomparable and bolstered by Defendant’s  \nemployment of over two thou sand software engineers around the world that  \ncontinually optimize the revenue management and booking software;  \nd. Defendant’s revenue management and booking software mechanisms were \nso accurate that Defendant could predict, down to the dollar, major revenue \ngrowth  for each hotel that entered into an agreement with Defendant (which \nwould  allow Defendant to offer the guaranteed revenue agreement more \nfully  described below);  \ne. The opportunity to work with Defendant (by converting their properties to \nOYO -branded h otels) was infallible because even if Defendant’s revenue \nmanagement and booking software did not operate as promised and could \nnot yield the guaranteed revenue, Plaintiffs and all other prospective \nfranchisees could rely on the contractual guaranteed mini mum revenue as \nbackstop mechanism.1 \nId. 12, ¶¶ 34-38.   \nThird, Shree  Veer and Chief Hospitality contend that OYO committed common law fraud \nand fraudulent inducement because it knew the statements above and a statement in a March 27, \n \n1 The court will reference these statements collectively as the “Agarwal Statements.”  Case 3:20-cv-03268-L   Document 20   Filed 09/30/21    Page 2 of 12   PageID <pageID> \nMemorandum Opinion and Order - Page 3 \n \n 20202 letter Plaintiffs received from Defendant “[r]epresenting Plaintiffs’ available roo ms to be \n‘unavailable ’ because of the  COVID -19 pandemic .”  Id. at 14, ¶ 45b; see id.  at 13 -14, ¶¶ 43-45.  \nOn November 17, 2020, Defendant OYO filed its motion to dismiss Plaintiffs’ original petition.  \nIn response, Plaintiffs filed their First Amended Complaint on December 8, 2020.   On December \n22, 2020, Defendant OYO filed its M otion to Dismiss Plaintiff’s First Amended Complaint \nPursuant to Rules 12(b)(6) and 9(b).  \nIn 2019, Defendant OYO began its market expansion into the United States.  Id. at 2, ¶ 8.  \nOYO’s basic business model  relied on  “[s]uccessfully inducing small, independent -minded hotel \nproperty owners to re -open  as an OYO -franchised  hotel .”  Id. at 3, ¶ 9  (emphasis in original) .  As \npart of its expansion strategy,  in June or July 2019,  OYO  held a meeting in San Francisco, \nCalifornia,  for small and independent hotel property owners, including Plaintiffs’ representative, \nwhere Mr. Agarwal “ used this captive audience opportunity to make affirmative  representations \nabout the quality of their business model and specifically about the sophistication  and superiority \nof Defendant’s revenue management and guest stay booking software platforms .”  Id. at 4, ¶ 13.  \nPlaintiffs contend that Mr. Agarwal’s statements at this meeting —the Agarwal Statements —were \nfraudulent and “ an attempt to induce small or independent property owners  [including Plaintiffs] \nto hand control over all bookings and revenue manage ment over to Defendant by entering into  \ncontracts similar to those signed by Plaintiffs. ”  Id. ¶ 14.  OYO also established a Minimum \nRevenue Guarant ee Mechanism (“Revenue Guarantee”) as an incentive to guarant ee a minimum \nrevenue margin for newly franchise d properties.   See id. at 5, ¶ 15.  According to Plaintiffs, by late \n2019, these guaranties turned out to be more than OYO could maintain, so “it was forced to offer \n \n2 As Defendant OYO correctly points out, Plaintiffs mistakenly and repeatedly refer to this letter in their \nFirst Amended Complaint as “the April 2, 2020 letter.”  E.g., Pl. First Am. Compl. 8, ¶ 26; 14, ¶ 45b.  The \nletter is in fact dated March 27, 2020.  Pl. First Am. Compl., Ex. 3.

Id. at 6-7, ¶¶ 20-21.   \nWhen the World Health Organization declared COVID -19 a global pandemic, Defendant \nOYO informed Plaintiffs in its March 27, 2020 letter that “ legal orders and other developments  \nrelated to the Coronavirus (COVID -19) crisis makes the guest rooms of your  OYO hotel \n‘unavailable ’” under the contracts and it would therefore suspend the Revenue Gu arant ee.  Id. at \n7, ¶ 23; id., Ex. 3.  Plaintiffs contend that their rooms were not “unavailable” or, in the alternative, \nthe word “unavailable” in the contracts is ambiguous.  Id. at 8, ¶¶ 24-25.  Between April 2020 and \nSeptember 2020, OYO withheld Revenue Guarantee payments  from Chief Hospitality  and Shree \nVeer, totaling $769,500  and $329,059 , respectively .  Id. at 8-9, ¶ 26 ; see id. , Ex. 1 at 6; Ex. 2 at 6 .  \nAccording to Plaintiffs, Defendant Oyo “ quietly and fraudulently sought to force their franchisees \nto bear the  financial losses and the associated risks that were contractually allocated to OYO in the \nentirely  foreseeable scenario of reduced travel and tourism. ”  Id. at 9, ¶ 27.  \nDefendant contends that Plaintiff s’ second  claim re garding fraud by nondisclosure and \nthird claim regarding fraud and fraudulent inducement should each be dismissed for failure to \n“plead facts with requisite particularity to establish their claims as required by Rule  9(b). ”3  Def. \nBr. in Supp. of Mot. to Dismiss Pl.

Case 3:20-cv-03268-L   Document 20   Filed 09/30/21    Page 4 of 12   PageID <pageID> \nMemorandum Opinion and Order - Page 5 \n \n they failed to plead facts to support each element of their fraud claims.  Def. Reply Br. in Supp. of \nMot. 2, 5.  \nII. Rule 12(b)(6) - Failure to State a Claim  \n To defeat a motion to dismiss filed pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil \nProcedure, a plaintiff must plead “enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on  its \nface.”  Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly , 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007); Reliable Consultants, Inc. v. \nEarle , 517 F.3d 738, 742 (5th Cir. 2008); Guidry v. American Pub. Life Ins. Co. , 512 F.3d 177, \n180 (5th Cir. 2007).  A claim meets the plausibility test “w hen the plaintiff pleads factual content \nthat allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct \nalleged.  The plausibility standard is not akin to a ‘probability requirement,’ but it asks for more \nthan a shee r possibility that a defendant has acted unlawfully.”  Ashcroft v. Iqbal , 556 U.S. 662, \n678 (2009) (internal citations omitted).  While a complaint need not contain detailed factual \nallegations, it must set forth “more than labels and conclusions, and a fo rmulaic recitation of the \nelements of a cause of action will not do.”  Twombly,  550 U.S. at 555 (citation omitted).  The \n“[f]actual allegations of [a complaint] must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative \nlevel . . . on the assumption t hat all the allegations in the complaint are true (even if doubtful in \nfact).”  Id.  (quotation marks, citations, and footnote omitted).  When the allegations of the pleading \ndo not allow the court to infer more than the mere possibility of wrongdoing, the y fall short of \nshowing that the pleader is entitled to relief.  Iqbal , 556 U.S. at 679.  \nIn reviewing a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, the court must accept all well -pleaded facts in the \ncomplaint as true and view them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.  Sonnier v. State Farm \nMut. Auto. Ins. Co., 509 F.3d 673, 675 (5th Cir. 2007); Martin K. Eby Constr. Co. v. Dallas Area \nRapid Transit , 369 F.3d 464, 467 (5th Cir. 2004); Baker v. Putnal , 75 F.3d 190, 196 (5th Cir. Case 3:20-cv-03268-L   Document 20   Filed 09/30/21    Page 5 of 12   PageID <pageID> \nMemorandum Opinion and Order - Page 6 \n \n 1996).  In ruling on such a motion, the court cannot look beyond the pleadings.  Id.; Spivey v. \nRobertson , 197 F.3d 772, 774 (5th C ir. 1999).  The pleadings include the complaint and any \ndocuments attached to it.  Collins v. Morgan Stanley Dean Witter , 224 F.3d 496, 498 -99 (5th Cir. \n2000).  Likewise, “‘[d]ocuments that a defendant attaches to a motion to dismiss are considered \npart of  the pleadings if they are referred to in the plaintiff’s complaint and are central to [the \nplaintiff’s] claims.’”  Id. (quoting Venture Assocs. Corp. v. Zenith Data Sys. Corp ., 987 F.2d 429, \n431 (7th Cir. 1993)).  In this regard, a document that is part o f the record but not referred to in a \nplaintiff’s complaint and not attached to a motion to dismiss may not be considered by the court \nin ruling on a 12(b)(6) motion.  Gines v. D.R. Horton, Inc. , 699 F.3d 812, 820 & n.9 (5th Cir. 2012) \n(citation omitted).  Further, it is well -established and ‘“clearly proper in deciding a 12(b)(6) motion \n[that a court may] take judicial notice of matters of public record.”’  Funk v. Stryker Corp. , 631 \nF.3d 777, 783 (5th Cir. 2011) (quoting Norris v. Hearst Trust , 500 F.3d 4 54, 461 n.9 (5th Cir. \n2007) (citing Cinel v. Connick , 15 F.3d 1338, 1343 n.6 (5th Cir. 1994)).  \n The ultimate question in a Rule 12(b)(6) motion is whether the complaint states a valid \nclaim when it is viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.  Great Plains Trust Co. v. \nMorgan Stanley Dean Witter , 313 F.3d 305, 312 (5th Cir. 2002).  While well -pleaded facts of a \ncomplaint are to be accepted as true, legal conclusions are not “entitled to the assumption of truth.”  \nIqbal , 556 U.S. at 679 (citation omitted).  Further, a court is not to strain to find inferences \nfavorable to the plaintiff and is not to accept conclusory allegations, unwarranted deductions, or \nlegal conclusions .  R2 Invs. LDC v. Phillips , 401 F.3d 638, 642 (5th Cir. 2005) (citations om itted).  \nThe court does not evaluate the plaintiff’s likelihood of success; instead, it only determines \nwhether the plaintiff has pleaded a legally cognizable claim.  United States ex rel. Riley v. St. \nLuke’s Episcopal Hosp. , 355 F.3d 370, 376 (5th Cir. 20 04).  Stated another way, when a court Case 3:20-cv-03268-L   Document 20   Filed 09/30/21    Page 6 of 12   PageID <pageID> \nMemorandum Opinion and Order - Page 7 \n \n deals with a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, its task is to test the sufficiency of the allegations contained in \nthe pleadings to determine whether they are adequate enough to state a claim upon which relief \ncan be granted.  Mann v. Adams Realty Co. , 556 F.2d 288, 293 (5th Cir. 1977); Doe v. Hillsboro \nIndep. Sch. Dist ., 81 F.3d 1395, 1401 (5th Cir. 1996), rev’d on other grounds , 113 F.3d 1412 (5th \nCir. 1997) (en banc).  Accordingly, denial of a 12(b)(6) motion has no bearing on whether a \nplaintiff ultimately establishes the necessary proof to prevail on a claim that withstands a 12(b)(6) \nchallenge.  Adams , 556 F.2d at 293.  \nIII. Rule 9(b) - Heightened Standard for Pleading Fraud  \n A dismissal for failure to plead fraud with particularity pursuant to Rule 9(b) is treated the \nsame as a Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal for failure to state a claim.  McCall v. Genentech, Inc.,  No. 3:10 -\nCV-1747 -B, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 65912, at *7, 2011 WL 23122 80, at *3 (N.D. Tex. June 9, \n2011) (citing Lovelace v. Software Spectrum Inc.,  78 F.3d 1015, 1017 (5th Cir. 1996)).  Rule 9(b) \ncontains a heightened pleading standard and requires a plaintiff to plead the circumstances \nconstituting fraud with particularity .  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(b); City of Clinton v. Pilgrim’s Pride \nCorp. , 632 F.3d 148, 153 (5th Cir. 2010).  “[A]rticulating the elements of fraud with particularity \nrequires a plaintiff to specify the statements contended to be fraudulent, identify the spea ker, state \nwhen and where the statements were made, and explain why the statements were fraudulent.”  \nWilliams v. WMX Techs. , 112 F.3d 175, 177 (5th Cir. 1997).  “Put simply, Rule 9(b) requires ‘the \nwho, what, when, where, and how’ to be laid out” with res pect to a fraud claim.  Benchmark Elecs., \nInc. v. J.M. Huber Corp. , 343 F.3d 719, 724 (5th Cir. 2003)  (quoting Williams , 112 F.3d at 179 ).

Introduction  \n“Fraud by non -disclosure is simply a subcategory of fraud because, whe[n] a party has a \nduty to disclose, the non -disclosure may be as misleading as a positive misrepresentation of facts.” \nSchlumberger Tech. Corp. v. Swanson , 959 S.W.2d 171, 181 (Tex. 1997 ). To state a claim for \nfraud by nondisclosure, plaintiff s must set forth allegations from which the court can reasonably \ninfer  that: \n(1) the defendant deliberately failed to disclose material facts; (2) the defendant had \na duty to disclose such facts to t he plaintiff; (3) the plaintiff was ignorant of the \nfacts and did not have an equal opportunity to discover them; (4) the defendant \nintended the plaintiff to act or refrain from acting based on the nondisclosure; and  \n(5) the plaintiff relied on the nondisclosure, which resulted in injury.  \nCBE Group, Inc. v. Lexington Law Firm , 993 F.3d 346, 353 (5th Cir. 2021)  (citing Bombardier \nAerospace Corp. v. SPEP Aircraft Holdings, LLC , 572 S.W.3d 213, 219 -20 (Tex. 2019) ).  Texas \nlaw recognizes “two types of co mmon -law fraud:  (1) simple fraud, also known as fraudulent \nmisrepresentation, and (2) fraudulent inducement .”  Bates Energy Oil & Gas v. Complete Oilfield \nServs. , 361 F. Supp. 3d 633, 660 (W.D. Tex. 2019) .  To state a claim of common  law fraud u nder \nTexas law, a plaintiff must set forth allegations from which the court can infer : “(1) a material \nmisrepresentation; (2) that is false; (3) made with knowledge of its falsity or recklessness as to its \ntruth; (4) made with the intention that it should be acted upon by another party; (5) relied upon by \nthe other party, and (6) causing injury. ”  Flaherty & Crumrine Preferred Income Fund, Inc. v. TXU \nCorp. , 565 F.3d 200, 212 (5th Cir. 2009)  (citing Jag Media Holdings Inc. v. A.G. Edwards & Sons \nInc., 387 F . Supp.  2d 691, 709 (S.D.  Tex. 2004); Ernst & Young, L.L.P. v. Pac. Mut. Life Ins. Co. , \n51 S.W.3d 573, 577 (Tex.  2001) ).  “Fraudulent inducement is a particular species of fraud that \narises only in the context of a contract and requires the existence of a contract as part of its proof .”  Case 3:20-cv-03268-L   Document 20   Filed 09/30/21    Page 8 of 12   PageID <pageID> \nMemorandum Opinion and Order - Page 9 \n \n Polyflow, L.L.C. v. Specialty RTP, L.L.C. , 993 F.3d 295, 304 (5th Cir. 2021)  (citation omitted); \nHaase v. Glazner , 62 S.W.3d 795, 798 (Tex. 2001) .  For the reasons that follow, the court \ndetermines  that Plaintiffs have met the heightened pleading standard  under  Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 9(b) but  failed to meet the pleading standard under Rule 12(b)(6) . \nB. Fraud by Nondisclosure  \nPlaintiff s allege that Defendant  OYO committed fraud by non -disclosur e when it made \npartial disclosures through the Agarwal Statements to their representative.  Pl. First Am. Compl. \n11, ¶ 37.  Shree Veer and Chief Hospitality also contend that OYO ’s deliberate silence and partial \ndisclosure created a false impression that “ their occupancy and revenues would significantly \nincrease based on  the use of Defendant’s purportedly world -class revenue management and \nbooking software .”  Id. at 11, ¶ 36; 12 ¶ 38.  According to Plainti ffs, this partial disclosure was \nnecessary to induce small businesses to quickly sign with Defendant, as part of its expansion \nstrategy.  Id. ¶ 39.  To survive Defendant OYO’s motion to dismiss  pursuant to Rule 9(b) , Plaintiffs \nmust allege adequate facts  with particularity  to support th eir allegation that Defendant committed \nfraud.  Defendant contends that Plaintiffs have failed to meet this burden.  See Def. Br. in Supp. \nof Mot. 23.  In accordance with Rule 9(b),  however, Plaintiffs have pleaded facts with particularity \nas to “ the who, what, when, where, and how ” of the alleged fraud.   See Williams , 112 F.3d at 179.  \nPlaintiffs allege that  OYO’s CEO, Mr. Agarwal (the “who”), made partial disclosures through the \nAgarwal Statements (the “what”) in June or  July of 2019 (the “when”) at a meeting attended by \nPlaintiffs’ representative in San Francisco, California  (the “where”), in “ an attempt to induce small \nor independent property owners  [including Plaintiffs]  to hand control over all bookings and \nrevenue management over to Defendant by entering into  contracts similar to those signed by \nPlaintiffs ” (the “how”).  Pl. First Am. Compl. 4 -5, ¶¶ 12 -14.  The court determines that Plaintiffs Case 3:20-cv-03268-L   Document 20   Filed 09/30/21    Page 9 of 12   PageID <pageID> \nMemorandum Opinion and Order - Page 10 \n \n have pleaded facts with particularity to satisfy  Rule 9(b).  Plai ntiffs , however,  must still satisfy \npleading requirements under Rule 12(b)(6).  \nTo survive OYO’s motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), Shree Veer and Chief \nHospitality must set forth sufficient  allegations  to support an inference that  (1) OYO  deliberately \nfailed to disclose material facts; (2) OYO  had a duty to disclose such facts to Plaintiffs and the \nPutative Class ; (3) they were  ignorant of the facts and did not have an equal opportunity to discover \nthem; (4) Defendant OYO  intended Plaintif fs and the Putative Class to act or refrain from acting \nbased on the nondisclosure; and (5) they relied on the nondisclosure, which resulted in injury.  See \nCBE Group, Inc. , 993 F.3d  at 353.  As Defendant OYO states, “ Plaintiffs have [] failed to  plead \nfacts to support each element of a fraud by nondisclosure claim. ”  Def. Br. in Supp. of Mot. 24.  \nThe court agrees for the reasons stated by Defendant OYO that Plaintiffs have not adequately \npleaded facts in accordance with Rule 12(b)(6) to support their claim that Defendant committed \nfraud by non -disclosure.   See id. at 24 -25; Def. Reply Br. in Supp. of Mot.  1-2.  Conclusory \nallegations  are not a sufficient basis for a court to draw inferences .  See Phillips , 401 F.3d at 642.  \nPlaintiffs must plead allegations with such specificity that the court can reasonably infer each \nelement of their fraud by nondisclosure claim.  Although Shree Veer and Chief Hospitality have \nmet their burden under Rule 9(b) , they must still set forth suff icient allegations from which the \ncourt can reasonably infer that  OYO committed fraud by nondisclosure . \nC. Fraud and Fraudulent Inducement  \nPlaintiff s contend  that the Agarwal Statements constitute “ Defendant’s fraudulent \nstatements and fraudulent inducements .”  Pl. First Am. Compl. 13 -14, ¶ 45.  They allege that \nDefendant knew these statements were false at the time Mr. Agarwal made them, OYO intended \nPlaintiffs to rely on the statements, and Plaintiffs did in fact rely  on the statements to their Case 3:20-cv-03268-L   Document 20   Filed 09/30/21    Page 10 of 12   PageID <pageID> \nMemorandum Opinion and Order - Page 11 \n \n detriment.  Id. ¶ 44.  Similarly, Shree Veer and Chief Hospitality also contend that OYO’s \nstatement in its March 27, 2021 letter that rooms at their hotels were “unavailable” due to the \nCOVID -19 pandemic was a “ fraudulent statement[] and fraudulent inducem ent[].”  Id. at 14, ¶ 45b.  \nFor the reasons stated above, Plaintiffs met their burden under Rule 9(b), but they must still plead \nadequate facts to survive Defendant’s motion to dismiss  pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6)  regarding  their \njoint fraud and fraudulent inducement claim.    \nTo survive this motion to dismiss, Shree Veer and Chief Hospitality must set forth \nsufficient facts to support an inference that  (1) OYO made a  material misrepresentation (2) that \nwas false , (3) OYO  made the misrepresentation with knowledge of its falsity or recklessness as to \nits truth , (4) it made the misrepresentation with the intention that it should be acted upon by \nPlaintiffs , and the Putat ive Class , (5) it was relied upon by them , and (6) caused them  injury.   See \nTXU Corp. , 565 F.3d at 212.  Plaintiffs have failed to  plead adequate facts from which the court \ncan draw an inference that support s each element of their common law fraud claim.   Again, \nconclusory allegations  are insufficient .  See Phillips , 401 F.3d at 642.  Plaintiffs must plead \nallegations with such specificity that the court can reasonably infer each element of their common \nlaw fraud claim.  The court, thus, agrees for the reasons stated by Defendant OYO that Plaintiffs \nhave not adequately pleaded facts in accordance with Rule 12(b)(6) to support their common law \nfraud claim.  See id.  at 17-23; Def. Reply Br. in Supp. of Mot. 3-8. \nV. Amendment of Pleadings   \nIn response to Defendant OYO’s  motion to dismiss, Plaintiffs did not  request to amen d \ntheir pleadings in the event the court determined that they failed to state a claim.  The provision of \nRule 15(a)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure that states “[t]he court should freely give \nleave when justice so requires” is no t without limitation.  The decision to allow amendment of a Case 3:20-cv-03268-L   Document 20   Filed 09/30/21    Page 11 of 12   PageID <pageID> \nMemorandum Opinion and Order - Page 12 \n \n \nparty’s pleadings is within the sound discretion of the district court.  Foman v. Davis , 371 U.S. \n178, 182 (1962);  Norman v. Apache Corp ., 19 F.3d 1017, 1021 (5th Cir. 1994) (citation omitted). \nIn determining whether to allow an amendment of the pleadings, a court considers the following: \n“undue delay, bad faith or dilatory motive on the part of the movant, repeated failure to cure \ndeficiencies by amendments previously allowed, undue prejudice to t he opposing party by virtue \nof allowance of the amendment, [and] futility of amendment.”  Foman , 371 U.S. at 182; Schiller \nv. Physicians Res. Grp. Inc ., 342 F.3d 563, 566 (5th Cir. 2003) (citation omitted) .  Prior to a ruling \nfrom the court, Plaintiffs previously filed an amended complaint in response to Defendant’s motion \nto dismiss their original petition.  The court determines that Defendant OYO will not suffer und ue \nprejudice  if Plaintiffs are permitted to  amend their pleadings.  Therefore, Plaintiff s will be \npermitted to amend their pleadings with respect to their fraud  claims against Defendant .  In \nrepleading any claim, Plaintiff s must plead sufficiently in accordance with standards set forth in \nsection s II and III  of this opinion.  \nVI. Conclusion  \n For the reasons herein stated,  the court  grants  Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss Plaintiffs’ \nFirst Amended  Complaint Pursuant to Rules 12( b)(6) and 9( b) (Doc. 14) , and allows Plaintiff s to \namend their First Amended Complaint by October 14, 2021 .  If the a mended pleading fail s to \ncure the deficienc ies noted by the court, Plaintiffs’ claims of fraud by nondisclosure and common \nlaw fraud will be  dismiss ed with prejudice  pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6).  \n It is so ordered this 30th day of  September , 2021. \n \n       _________________________________   \n       Sam A.

    "summary": "### 1. Summary\n\nThis court opinion pertains to a case where the plaintiffs allege that their due process rights were violated through the creation and implementation of the Michigan Integrated Data Automated System (MiDAS), an automated system used for unemployment claims processing. The opinion focuses on whether testimony from expert and non-retained witnesses regarding MiDAS should be admissible, evaluating procedural and substantive compliance with rules governing expert disclosures. The court ruled to exclude several testimonies that failed to comply with legal standards and allowed only factual testimony about the MiDAS system from certain witnesses.\n\n### 2. Key Legal Issue\n\nThe key legal issue in this case is whether the expert and non-retained expert disclosures by the defendants meet the requirements of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and the Federal Rules of Evidence, specifically concerning the admissibility of opinions related to MiDAS’s role in the alleged due process violations.\n\n### 3. Court's Holding\n\nThe court held that the majority of the testimony from non-retained experts could not be considered expert opinion testimony due to lack of compliance with procedural rules for expert disclosures. However, testimony related to factual descriptions of how MiDAS functioned and interacted with claims processing was deemed admissible. Specific expert opinions that amounted to legal conclusions were excluded, and CSG’s retained expert's testimony was limited.\n\n### 4. ELI5 Explanation\n\nImagine you're in a town where the local government uses a complicated machine to decide if people deserve tax refunds, but some residents believe this machine wrongfully labeled them as fraudsters, blocking their refunds. In a trial, the judge must decide who can explain how the machine works and whether it’s to blame. The judge says only the people who directly worked with this machine can describe what happened but can't give their opinions on whether it was fair unless they strictly follow the rules on who can share expert opinions.",

Honorable David M. Lawson  FAST ENTERPRISES LLC, CSG GOVERNMENT SOLUTIONS, STEPHEN GESKEY,  SHEMIN BLUNDELL, DORIS MITCHELL, DEBRA SINGLETON, and SHARON  MOFFET-MASSEY,     Defendants. __________________________________________/   \nOPINION AND ORDER GRANTING IN PART AND DENYING IN PART \nMOTIONS TO STRIKE EXPE RT WITNESS DISCLOSURES \nAND BAR EXPERT WITNESS TESTIMONY  \n \n The plaintiffs have filed two batches of mo tions challenging the admissibility of testimony \nfrom witnesses identified by the de fendants as experts.  One set of motions attacks the testimony \non procedural grounds under Federal Rules of Civ il Procedure 26(a)(2) and 37(c)(1).  The other \nset of motions question the substa nce of the testimony as  not measuring up to the strictures of \nEvidence Rule 702.  The defendants in turn have m oved to exclude the testimony of the plaintiffs’ \nrebuttal expert witness.  For reas ons explained below, the reports of  some of the defense witnesses \nare inadequate and those witnesses will not be pe rmitted to give opinion testimony.  One of the \nwitnesses intends to give expert  testimony amounting to legal opini ons, which is not permissible.  \nThe plaintiffs have not furnishe d a proper report for th eir putative rebuttal witness, but that is \nlargely inconsequential because th ere will be no allowable opinion testimony for him to rebut.  The Case 2:17-cv-10657-DML-RSW   ECF No. 533, PageID.<pageID>   Filed 03/18/21   Page 1 of 24-2- \n remaining witnesses targeted by the motions furnis hed reports describing in tended testimony that \nwill be admissible.  The motions will be granted in part and denied in part.   \nI. \n The identified witnesses all intend to give testimony on one or more aspects of the one \nremaining claim, which is that the plaintiffs’ right to due process of law was abridged by the \ncreation and implementation of the Michigan Integrated Data Automated System (MiDAS).  Many of the witnesses designated by the defendants are not  specially retained to give testimony in the \ncase.  They are employees of the Michigan Unemployment Insurance Agency (UIA) or the \nrespective corporate defendants, w ho will describe the activities of their employers and explain \nwhat they found when they examin ed the plaintiffs’ claim files.   The various defendants have \nfurnished differing levels of detail  in their reports under Rule 26(a)(2)(C), whic h requires that the \nparty (not the witness) disclose “the subject ma tter,” the facts,” and “t he opinions” to which the \nwitness is expected to testify.   \nA. \n All the defendants named four UIA employees  who examined the claim files for one or \nmore of the plain tiffs: Mandy Brickel (a  UIA claims examiner who re viewed plaintiff Hyon Pak’s \nclaim file); Jessica Hart (plain tiff Michelle Davison’s claim file); Katherine Potter (plaintiff \nKristen Mendyk’s claim file); a nd Kevin Smith (plaintif fs Patti Jo Cahoo’s and Khadija Cole’s \nclaim files).  Defendant CSG’s disclosure for witness Mandy Br ickel mimics the disclosures for \nthe other file examiner s.  It described the subject matt er of her testimony as follows: \nMs. Brickel will testify regarding the inte rpretation of UIA’s claimant file for \nMr. Hyon Pak and UIA’s processing, revi ew, investigation, determinations, \nactions, communications, involvement, or  collection effort s relating to any \nunemployment claims or communications, submittals, proceedings, appeals, or \nadjudications related thereto in any wa y involving or relating to Mr. Hyon Pak. Case 2:17-cv-10657-DML-RSW   ECF No. 533, PageID.<pageID>   Filed 03/18/21   Page 2 of 24-3- \n CSG combined the description of Brickel’s facts and opinions:  \nMs. Brickel will testify that Mr. Pak’s re levant claim was adjudicated in October \n2012, before UIA even began using MiDAS. Ms.  Brickel will furt her testify that \nhuman claims examiners — rather than automated business rules — used their \nindependent judgment to adjudicate Mr. Pak as committing fraud. She will \nfurther testify that Mr. Pak chose to  Go Green, frequently logged into his \nMiWAM account, and that Mr. Pak could not have avoided seeing the numerous \nnotices UIA sent to him. Ms. Brickel also  will testify that the UIA had exclusive \nauthority to set the policies and proce dures of the UIA th at were programmed \ninto the MiDAS system and that UIA neve r delegated that authority to CSG.  \nCSG declared that Brickel “may also render addi tional opinions identified in documents,” but did \nnot specify what they will be.    FAST Enterprises similarly disclosed the expected testimony of the file examiners \nemployed by the UIA.  Again, the disc losure for Mandy Brickel was typical: \nBrickel will testify that, based on her revi ew of the UIA claim file for Pak, it is \nclear that Pak committed fraud in obtaining the payments from UIA at issue in this case.  Brickel will testify regarding what is indicated in UIA’s file for Pak \nrelating to his unemployment claims, a nd what information regarding Pak’s \nclaims were initiated in the legacy system  that predated MiDAS.  She is expected \nto testify that factfinding regarding Pa k’s fraud claim began before MiDAS was \nin place.  Brickel will testify that UI A personnel were involved in adjudicating \nthe fraud claims against Pak, and that MiDAS did not auto-a djudicate the fraud  \ndeterminations against Pak that is at i ssue here. She will testify that Pak chose \nthe “Go Green” option and received correspondence from UIA electronically, \nthrough the MiWAM portal.  Sh e will testify that Pak’s cl aim file indicates that \nnotices were properly and timely placed  in Pak’s MiWAM account.  She will \ntestify that Pak logged onto his Mi WAM account, including logging on multiple \ntimes shortly after his fra ud determinations were adj udicated and notices thereof \ndelivered to him.  She will testify th at Pak received notices relating to \nwithholding of taxes and garnishment of wa ges.  She will testify that Pak’s fraud \ndeterminations were affirmed as part of the Zynda review.  She will testify \nregarding the email and physic al addresses that were in  UIA’s file that were \nprovided by Pak.  Brickel will testify regarding her review of Gott’s claim file and her conclusion that Gott’s fraud de termination was not auto-adjudicated. \nBrickel will also testify that MiDAS is not a form of artificial intelligence, but rather just automates certain UIA rules and procedures.  Bric kel may also render \nadditional opinions identified in docu ments — including the interpretation of \nPak’s and Gott’s UIA claim files in general — and testimony disclosed to \nPlaintiffs in the instant case. Case 2:17-cv-10657-DML-RSW   ECF No. 533, PageID.<pageID>   Filed 03/18/21   Page 3 of 24-4- \n  Finally, the state defendants also  served disclosures for the file  examiners, but those reports \nwere considerably more cursory.  The di sclosure for Mandy Brickell was typical: \nMandy Brickell Subject matter: Inform ation related to the policies and \nprocedures regarding claims adjudi cation and Plaintiffs’ claims for \nunemployment benefits. Facts: Please refer to Ms. Brickell’s deposition testimony. Ms. Brickell will testify as to  the facts and contents regarding Hyon \nPak’s Unemployment Insurance Agency cl aims file, including  the procedures \nfollowed regarding same. \nIt is not clear, however, that the state defenda nts intend to elicit opinion testimony from the file \nexaminers.  They explain that they more likely will be called as fact witnesses, and that they \nfurnished reports under Rule 26(a)(2)(C) “out of an abundance of caution” should the witnesses \nhappen to provide opinion testimony.    The plaintiffs argue that these disclosure s do not satisfy Rule 26(a)(2)’s requirements \nbecause they do not identify any opinions that thes e witnesses will offer.  Instead, the plaintiffs \nfear that the file examiners will be identified as experts but offer only fact testimony.   \n A party seeking to rely on non-retained expe rt testimony must provide  an expert witness \ndisclosure that summarizes (1) “the subject matter on which the witness is expected to present \nevidence under Federal Rule of Evidence 702, 703, or  705,” (2) “the facts” “to which the witness \nis expected to testify,” and (3) “the opinions to which the witness is expected to testify.” Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 26(a)(2)(C).  The disclosure  need not be signed by the witness; counsel’s signature will do.  \nAnd the disclosures for non-retained experts under Rule 26(a)(2)(C) are “considerably less \nextensive than the report required by Rule 26(a) (2)(B).”  Fed R. Civ. P. 26, Advisory Committee \nNotes on 2010 Am. to Rule 26(a)(2)(C).  Courts are cautioned “against requiring undue detail, \nkeeping in mind that these witnesse s have not been specially retain ed and may not be as responsive \nto counsel as those who have.”  Ibid.  But counsel still must touch all the bases listed in Rule Case 2:17-cv-10657-DML-RSW   ECF No. 533, PageID.<pageID>   Filed 03/18/21   Page 4 of 24-5- \n 26(a)(2)(C) to fulfill the purpose of the disclosure requirement, wh ich is to prevent “surprise[s] as \nto the scope of testimony.” Fielden v. CSX Transp., Inc ., 482 F.3d 866, 871 (6th Cir. 2007).   \n One of the requirements, a summary of the witness’s opinions, “mea ns a brief account of \nthe main opinions of the expert”; “the opinions must state a view or j udgment regarding a matter \nthat affects the outcome of the case.   A mere statement of the topics of the opini ons is insufficient.”  \nLittle Hocking Water Ass’n, Inc. v.  E.I. DuPont de Nemours and Co. , No. 09-1081, 2015 WL \n1105840, at *9 (S.D. Ohio Mar. 11, 2015).  Likewi se, a summary of the facts “means a brief \naccount of facts — only those on which the expert ac tually relied in for ming his or her opinions \n— that states the main points derived from a larg er body of information; me rely stating the topic \nmatters of facts relied  upon does not suffice.”  Ibid. \n Where an expert disclosure is itself not detailed, the opini ons and supporting facts of non-\nretained experts may be disclosed in other discovery responses .  See Owens-Hart v. Howard Univ. , \n317 F.R.D. 1, 4 (D.D.C. 2016) (123 pages of medical records produced in discovery helped satisfy \nRule 26(a)(2)(C)’s disclosure requirements rega rding treating physician’s facts and opinions).  \nHowever, the reference to other documents, or th e suggestion that the opponent read the witness’s \ndeposition, will not suffice.   \n Measured against this sta ndard, CSG’s disclosures pertai ning to the file examiners \nadequately describe the subject ma tter of the file examin ers’ testimony, and they  give some insight \ninto some opinions that they may offer.  Those opi nions appear to be that, based on the file reviews, \nhuman claims examiners — and not an au to-adjudication process — made the fraud \ndeterminations.  And those opini ons and their bases are describe d adequately e nough to satisfy \nRule 26(a)(2)(C).  But other opinions — that th e claimants could not have avoided seeing the \nemailed notices, and that the UIA never delegated the authority to  set policy to CSG — have no Case 2:17-cv-10657-DML-RSW   ECF No. 533, PageID.<pageID>   Filed 03/18/21   Page 5 of 24-6- \n factual underpinning, and the disclosures are not adequate.  CSG may elicit fact testimony from \nthese witnesses, but it may not elicit opinions beyond those that were described as derived from \nan examination of the re spective claim files.   \n FAST’s disclosures about the file examiners mainly recite fact testimony based on what \nthe examiners found when inspecting the respective claimants’ files.   The only opinion that can be \nderived from the disclosure is testimony that MiDAS is not a form  of artificial intelligence, but \nonly an automated application of the UIA’s rules and procedures.  But there is nothing that ties \nthat opinion to any of the facts recited in the disclosure, and ther e is no indication for the basis of \nthat opinion, or even th at the respective file exam iners are qualifie d to reach that conclusion.  FAST \nmay not elicit such an opini on from these witnesses.   \n The State defendants’ disclosures contain no opin ions at all.  They will be allowed to call \nthese witnesses to testify to what they found when  examining the claim file s, but they will not be \npermitted to offer opinion testimony within the meaning of Evidence Rule 702.    \nB. \n The other non-retained experts CSG named are Clayton Tierney, a UIA employee, and \nJohn Walsworth CSG’s chief executive  officer.  It disclosed that Tierney was expected to testify \n“about the roles and responsibilitie s of CSG as a project manager,  the implementation of MiDAS, \nhow that system functioned in the claims adjudication process,  and the review process under \nZynda .  The disclosure contains a “Facts and Opini ons” section that recites a fulsome list of the \ninformation Tierney is expected to impart, such as that “at no time did CSG ever establish the \npolicies or procedures of the UIA that were pr ogrammed into the MiDAS system”; and “that CSG \nnever had any responsibility at al l in determining the al gorithms or decision  trees that the UIA \nintended the MiDAS software to use in connection with potential claimant fraud.”  None of that Case 2:17-cv-10657-DML-RSW   ECF No. 533, PageID.<pageID>   Filed 03/18/21   Page 6 of 24-7- \n expected testimony, nor  the similar statements as cribed to Tierney, amount to opinions within the \nmeaning of Evidence Rule 702.  There is one statem ent, however, that may amount to an opinion: \nthat the responsibility to adjudicate or otherwis e deal with claims “was the exclusive statutory \nprovince of the UIA.”  That opi nion amounts to a legal conclusi on, which is not a proper subject \nfor expert testimony.  See Berry v. City of Detroit , 25 F.3d 1342, 1354 (6th Cir. 1994) (holding \nthat the Sixth Circuit “is in accord  with other circuits in requiri ng exclusion of expert testimony \nthat expresses a legal conclusion”) (citing Hygh v. Jacobs , 961 F.2d 359 (2d Cir. 1992)).  Beyond \nthat, the disclosure reveals no purported opinion te stimony.  As with the file examiners, Tierney \nmay testify as a fact witness only.    CSG stated that Walsworth “will testify re garding the function of a project management \noffice and its roles and responsibilities.”  Much  like the description of  Tierney’s anticipated \ntestimony, the disclosure identifies information that amounts to fact testimony.  One statement \nborders on opinion — that “a proj ect management office like CSG’ s project management office \nfor the UIA software implementation has no power to set government agency policy, establish any \nparticular algorithms in the soft ware that others are implementi ng, configure the software in any \nway, program the software in any way, or operate the software at any time (including after it goes \nlive)” — and likely requires some special knowl edge as a foundation.  In other motions, the \nplaintiffs do not challe nge Walsworth’s qualifications to give  such an opinion, a nd the disclosure \nsatisfies Rule 26(a)(2)(C)’s requirements.    FAST identified Tierney as a non-retained expe rt as well.  Its disclosure mirrored CSG’s, \nand most of Tierney’s expected  testimony will not encompass opi nion evidence.  However, one \ndisclosure, that in light of “the diffe rent rules and criteria employed in the Zynda  [settlement] \nprocess, Tierney will testify that it is incorrect to conclude that the process resulted in a reversal Case 2:17-cv-10657-DML-RSW   ECF No. 533, PageID.<pageID>   Filed 03/18/21   Page 7 of 24-8- \n rate of more than 90%; different rules and criteria were applied, so to refer to ‘reversal rate’ is \nmisleading and incorrect,” am ounts to an opinion that was disclosed adequately.   \n FAST also disclosed non-retain ed experts Jennifer T uvell and Jon Eads.  Tuvell is expected \nto “testify about the software produced and servi ces provided by FAST, as well as FAST’s role in \ncoding MiDAS for the UIA.”  The description of the substance of her testimony focuses on how \nMiDAS worked, which appears to be factual de scriptions with no opinions.  However, the \ninformation she intends to offe r no doubt requires special knowledge , and expert testimony is not \nlimited to opinions alone.  See Fed. R Evid. 702 (stating that a quali fied expert “may testify in the \nform of an opinion or otherwise ”) (emphasis added).  FAST acknow ledged in its disclosure that \n“Tuvell’s testimony will be primarily factual but may have some elements of expert testimony.”  \nAs so limited, the disclosure is adequate to prevent “surprise[s]  as to the scope of testimony.” \nFielden , 482 F.3d at 871.    \n FAST disclosed that the expected testimony of Jon Eads, another FAST employee, will be \n“about the software produced and services provid ed by FAST.”  It says that Eads “will explain \nhow users input data into MiDAS , how the system functions base d on the UIA’s ‘logic trees,’ and \nwhen, how, and where communications were sent to claimants or employe rs.”  Like Tuvell, \n“Eads’[s] testimony will pr imarily be factual but may have some  elements of expert testimony.”  \nAnd the description of that test imony follows along the same lines, with the same result here.  The \ndisclosure is adequate.     The state defendants identified Tierney a nd also Debra Patterson, another UIA employee \ndisclosing that they “will testify about the imple mentation and functionality of MiDAS.”   They \nidentified other UIA employees as well: Kristrina Kratz (a “UIA claims ex aminer who will testify \nabout the policies and procedures regarding cl aims adjudication and plaintiffs’ claims for Case 2:17-cv-10657-DML-RSW   ECF No. 533, PageID.<pageID>   Filed 03/18/21   Page 8 of 24-9- \n unemployment benefits”), Susan Easton (a “UIA employee who will testify about the policies and \nprocedures regarding claims adju dication and plaintiffs’ claims for unemployment benefits”), and \nTeresa Burns (another “UIA employee who will test ify about the federal requirements for claims \nadjudication, the state procedures enacted to meet  federal requirements, a nd audit and investigation \nresults”).  The disclosures as to those witne sses fail to do anything bu t vaguely identify the \noverarching subject matter of the expert testimony — they neither provide a summary of the facts \nnor the opinions sought to be elicited.  Not only did the defendants fail to provide “a brief account of facts . . . that states the ma in points derived from a larger body of inform ation” upon which they \nrelied, but some, like Tierney’s and Patterson’s, did not even “sta t[e] the topic matters of facts \nrelied upon” — they merely poi nted to the depositions of their respective witnesses.  Little Hocking \nWater , 2015 WL 1105840, at *9.  The testimony of these witnesses will be limited to their fact-\nbased statements.   \nIII. \n In separate motions, the plaintiffs also move to exclude the expert testimony of each of the \nproposed non-retained experts discussed above, and also challenge CSG’s retained expert, J. Todd \nTrivett.  Trivett is expected to testify about  CSG’s role in developing and managing MiDAS and \nthe functions, roles, and responsibilities of projec t management offices.  According to his report, \nTrivett holds an MBA from Duke University a nd serves as a professional consultant with \nDisputeSoft, an independent IT consulting firm in Maryland specializing in computer forensics \nand litigation support.  Over the past 14 years, he regularly serv ed as an expert witness for \nintellectual property, contract , business torts, and insura nce coverage issues.   Case 2:17-cv-10657-DML-RSW   ECF No. 533, PageID.<pageID>   Filed 03/18/21   Page 9 of 24-10- \n  Trivett’s report primarily focuses on the va rious forms of projec t management offices \n(supportive, controlling, and directive) as describe d by the Project Management Institute; it also \ndetails CSG’s involvement with MiDAS as a suppor tive project manager.   His opinion — that  \n“at no time did CSG have the responsibility or  authority to have committed the ‘wrongful \npractices’ alleged by the plaintiffs ” — is based on his “review and analysis  . . . of contract \ndocuments, testimony, and exhibits presented at the deposition of the State’s Project Manager, \nClayton Tierney.”  Trivett writes in his report: \nWith respect to system functionality, CSG’ s role was limited to the elicitation and \ndocumentation of the business rules, process flows, and decision trees dictated by \nthe State’s representatives.  In the li mited instances where CSG was asked to \nanalyze and investigate “best practices” and provide recommendations, the State \nhad the ultimate responsibility  and authority to heed - or choose not to heed - CSG’s \nrecommendations.  Furthermore, at no time did CSG recommend that the State \nadopt the “auto-adjudication”  procedures at the heart of the Plaintiffs’ Amended \nComplaint.  \n The plaintiffs argue that the defendants’ non-retained expert w itnesses should not be \nallowed to testify as experts because (1) the pr oposed testimony from those witnesses are improper \nsubjects of expert treatment be cause they concern factual matter s about which knowledgeable fact \nwitnesses may testify; and (2) the witnesses are unqualified to provide expert testimony.  The \nplaintiffs also argue that Todd Tr ivet should not be ab le to testify because  his testimony (1) is \nirrelevant; (2) mirrors the fact testimony of UIA employee Clayton Tier ney, and (3) contains \nimpermissible legal conclusions (CSG  lacked the responsibility or authority to have committed the \n“wrongful practices” allege d by the plaintiffs).   \nA. \n According to the disclosures discussed above, with few exceptions, the non-retained expert \nwitnesses are not expected to gi ve any opinion testimony that falls within th e ambit of Evidence Case 2:17-cv-10657-DML-RSW   ECF No. 533, PageID.<pageID>   Filed 03/18/21   Page 10 of 24-11- \n Rule 702.  Their testimony may touch on areas re quiring special knowledge, such as describing \nthe functionality of MiDAS and the claims proces sing protocols.  That special knowledge appears \nto be based on their experience, and by that measure the plaintiffs’ challenge to their qualifications \nfalls short.    “Rule 702 expressly contemplates that an expert may be qualified on the basis of \nexperience.”  Fed. R. Evid. 702, advisory commi ttee’s note, 2000 amend. The Sixth Circuit has \nexplained that the traditional Daubert  factors “cannot readily  be applied to meas ure the re liability \nof such testimony.”  Surles ex rel. Johnson v. Greyhound Lines, Inc ., 474 F.3d 288, 296 (6th Cir. \n2007).  Rather, experiential expert  testimony is appropriate wher e the expert “explain[s] how \nth[eir] experience leads to the conclusion reached, why that experience is a sufficient basis for the \nopinion, and how that ex perience is reliably ap plied to the facts.” Ibid. (quoting Fed. R. Evid. 702, \nadvisory committee’s note, 2000 amend.) .  “In certain fields , experience is the predominant, if not \nsole, basis for a great deal of reliable expert testimony.” Fed. R.  Evid. 702, adviso ry committee’s \nnote, 2000 amend.; see, e.g., Wood v. Wal-Mart Stores E., LP , 576 F. App’x. 470, 472 (6th Cir. \n2014) (holding that there was “ample  reason” to conclude  that a non-scientific  expert’s testimony \nwas reliable and would assist the jury where wi tness had professional experience dealing with \nbuilding codes as a commercial architect); Surles ex rel. Johnson , 474 F.3d at 296 (holding that \ndistrict court properly admitted testimony from expert regardi ng experience designing driver’s \nenclosures for tr ansit buses).   \n Insofar as these witnesses will describe how  MiDAS worked, and how it was used (or not) \nin the fraud adjudications of these plaintiffs, th eir testimony fits within the permissible bounds of \nRule 702.  United States v. Garner  provides a helpful guide.  In th at case, the Sixth Circuit found \nthat the particular forensic software used by an IRS special agent to determine whether the Case 2:17-cv-10657-DML-RSW   ECF No. 533, PageID.<pageID>   Filed 03/18/21   Page 11 of 24-12- \n defendant altered or destroyed documents exceeded the knowledge  of laypersons and upheld the \ndistrict court’s decision that the testimony could be offered under Rule 702.  468 F.3d 920, 923, \n926 (6th  Cir. 2006).  The Court conclude d that “[t]he average laypers on today may be able to \ninterpret the outputs of p opular software programs [like Micros oft Word and Outl ook] as easily as \nhe or she interprets everyday vernac ular, but the interpretation [the expert witness] needed to apply \nto make sense of the software reports is more similar  to the specialized knowledge police officers \nuse to interpret slang and code words used by drug dealers.”  Id. at 926 (citing United States v. \nGarcia , 72 F.3d 130 (6th Cir. Dec. 4, 1995) (unpublished) (affirming a decision to allow a police \nofficer to give expert te stimony as to the me aning of certain code words)).  \n MiDAS is a complicated software-based syst em, the explanation of which requires special \nknowledge beyond that of a layperson, as demonstr ated by the hundreds — if  not thousands — of \npages of deposition testimony on the matter.   Here, the UIA file examiners have been disclosed \nas expert witnesses to testify about how each of th e plaintiff’s claims was adjudicated and the role \nMiDAS played in the process.  No opinions of  these witnesses were disclosed, but they are \nqualified by experience to describe the UIA’s pro cessing, review, investiga tions, and adjudications \nof the five named plain tiffs in the case.  This  testimony may well “help the trier of fact to \nunderstand the evidence or to determine a fact in  issue.”  Fed. R. Evid. 702.   Although most of \nthe expected testimony amounts to factual descri ptions, the subject matte r that the defendants’ \nwitnesses will relate is relevant  to the plaintiffs’ allegations and are necessary topics that the \ndefendants must present to defend themselves.  The witnesses are presented as individuals with \nspecial knowledge, based on their experience with  the Agency’s claim adjudication process and \nMiDAS.  Although most of the test imony is factual, these witnesse s may need to rely on their \nspecial knowledge to devel op those facts, and to that extent it  will exceed the knowledge base of Case 2:17-cv-10657-DML-RSW   ECF No. 533, PageID.<pageID>   Filed 03/18/21   Page 12 of 24-13- \n the average juror and enter the realm of Rule 702.  Because the witnesses’ experience qualifies \nthem to give that evidence, Rule 702 erects no barrier to such testimony.  See Garcia , 72 F.3d 130.  \n Similarly, the other UIA employees Clayton Tierney and Debra Patterson will testify about \nthe implementation of MiDAS, how th at system functioned in the cl aims adjudication process, and \nthe review process under Zynda .  Susan Easton will testify about the policies and procedures \nregarding claims adjudication in general and the plaintiffs’ cla ims for unemployment benefits.  \nTeresa Burns will testify about the federal re quirements for claims adjudication, the state \nprocedures enacted to meet federa l requirements, and audit and inve stigation results.  And Kristina \nKratz may help define what some of the jargon in the claim files mean.  See, e.g., Kratz Dep., ECF \nNo. 399-28, PageID.17628 (explaining the stages of Mi DAS adjudication, clarifying how to read \nclaim files, and defining jargon, like “batch,” wh ich indicates that MiDAS changed the st atus of a \nfraud case automatically).    FAST’s and CSG’s employees identified as n on-retained experts similarly will testify \nabout the operational and management functions of their respective employers  as they interacted \nwith the State in the rollout of MiDAS.  As with the file examiner s, these witnesses will not offer \nopinions, but they may use their sp ecial knowledge to elucidate their explanations.  That sort of \ntestimony traditionally has been allowed, ev en when it does not include “opinions.”  See, e.g., \nUnited States v. Johnson , 488 F.3d 690, 698 (6th Cir. 2007) (“Th ere are innumerable trades and \npractices that employ their uni que devices, feints, and codes that may mean nothing to the \nuntrained observer but may speak volumes to a maven qualified by experience or training.”).   \n This testimony is allowable.     Case 2:17-cv-10657-DML-RSW   ECF No. 533, PageID.<pageID>   Filed 03/18/21   Page 13 of 24-14- \n B. \n As a retained expert, J. Todd Trivett stands on a slightly different f ooting.  He does intend \nto give opinion testimony, which fa lls fully within the scope of Ev idence Rule 702.  Therefore, his \ntestimony must be grounded in  the actual facts of the case, must be valid according to the discipline \nthat furnished the base of special knowledge, and mu st appropriately “fit” the facts of the case into \nthe theories and methods he espou ses.  Fed. R. Evid. 702(a)-(d); Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharm., \nInc., 509 U.S. 579, 591-93(1993).   \n The plaintiffs contend that Trivett’s testimony a bout the role of pr oject managers and \nCSG’s compliance with the State’s contract is irrelevant because it has nothing to do with “the \nconstitutional requirements at issue” in this case.  However, Trivett does not intend to opine on \nwhether CSG performed its contractual obligations  adequately or met industry standards; his \ntestimony addresses CSG’s role under  the contract and the services it provided to the State.   \n The testimony is relevant to the issue of causation and whether CSG can be considered a \nstate actor.  Both issues are front and center in  the parties’ pending cross-motions for summary \njudgment.  See Martin v. Warren Cnty., Kentucky , 799 F. App’x 329, 337 (6th Cir. 2020) (citing \nPowers v. Hamilton Cnty. Pub. Defender Comm’n , 501 F.3d 592, 608 (6th Ci r. 2007) (plaintiffs \nmust show that defendants’ condu ct was both a cause in fact and a proximate cause of the alleged \ndue process violation); Lugar v. Edmondson Oil Co ., 457 U.S. 922, 937 (1982) (for liability to \nattach under section 1983, “the party charged with th e deprivation must be a person who may fairly \nbe said to be a state actor.”).  Trivett’s report addresses those issues and will aid the factfinder in understanding what CSG did in its role as a proj ect manager; i.e., the extent of its technical \noversight, administration of the system, and de velopment of the polic ies and logic trees.  See \nTrivett Report, ECF No. 380-1, PageID.16677-83, ¶¶ 17-25.   Case 2:17-cv-10657-DML-RSW   ECF No. 533, PageID.<pageID>   Filed 03/18/21   Page 14 of 24-15- \n  The plaintiffs argue that th e Court should exclude portions of Trivett’s testimony that \nmerely mirror Tierney’s anticipa ted testimony, referencing parts of Trivett’s report where he \nquotes Tierney’s deposition testimony to support his position.  Trivett Report, ECF No. 380-1, \nPageID.16683-85, ¶¶ 26, 29 (quoting seven ques tions and seven answers).  Relying on United \nStates v. Whyte , the plaintiffs contend that “a district court may commit manifest error by admitting \nexpert testimony where the eviden ce impermissibly mirrors the test imony offered by fact witnesses \n. . . .”  795 F. A’ppx 353, 360 (6th Cir. 2019) (quotation marks omitted).   Whyte  does not support that argument.  In that  case, the court of appeals approved the \ndistrict court’s admission  of a police officer’s te stimony about the meaning of street language and \nrejected the argument th at the testimony impermissibly mirrore d that of fact witnesses.  Ibid.  The \ncourt emphasized that it generally  will “affirm the admiss ion of expert testim ony . . . so long as \nthe district court does not al low the expert law enforcement witness either to relay the \ngovernment’s theory of the case to the jury under th e guise of jargon interpre tation or to interpret \nplain English statemen ts that a reasonable juror could understand on their own.”  Ibid.  \n Here, it appears that Trivett will use Tierney’s testimony to substantiate his opinion based on his interpretation of the contract and knowle dge of project management standards.  For \nexample, in paragraph 25 of his report, Trivett op ines that CSG’s contract language did not grant \nCSG the authority to “determin[e] the State’s business requirements for MiDAS,” “the functionality of and workflows re lated to MiDAS,” nor the policie s “that drove those requirements \nand workflows.”  Trivett Report, ECF No. 380- 1, PageID.16683, ¶ 25.  In the following paragraph, \nTrivett cites Tierney’s deposition testimony, which affirmed that the “UIA was responsible to use \nits own independent judgment in making the decisi ons relating to which business rules, processes, \nand functionality was going to be required in  the system modernization project.”   Id. at Case 2:17-cv-10657-DML-RSW   ECF No. 533, PageID.<pageID>   Filed 03/18/21   Page 15 of 24-16- \n PageID.16684, ¶ 26.  That reference ve rified Trivett’s reliance on the underlying facts.  It did not \nparrot them.    Trivett also opined, based on CSG’s contract  language, that CSG’ s “Technical Writing” \nservices in developing the request for propos al (RFP) focused on “co mmunicating the State’s \nrequirements which reflect the Stat e’s policies,” not “creating thos e requirements or policies.”  Id. \n¶ 29.  For support, he cited Tierney’s testimony that  “the [S]tate relied on [the UIA] to further \nbusiness aspects of [the RFP], [i ncluding the] business rules or requirements” and that the UIA \nvetted all of the RFP documents.  Id. at PageID.16684-85, ¶ 29.  Trivett’s reliance on Tierney’s \ndeposition testimony to supplement his opinion s based on CSG’s contract language does not \n“impermissibly mirror[] the testimony offered by fact witnesses.”  Whyte , 795 F. A’ppx at 360.   \n The plaintiffs also argue that in the passages that cite Tierney’s testimony, “Trivett offers \nno opinion based on scientific, technical, or specializ ed knowledge.  Instead, he simply states that \nhe agrees with” Tierney’s testimony.  That is not entirely accurate.   In addition to interpreting \nCSG’s contract and referencing Tierney’s tes timony, Trivett relied on the project management \nindustry standards provided by the Project Management Institute fo r his categorizat ion of PMOs \ninto “supportive,” “controlling,” and “directive” pr oject management offices.  ECF No. 380-1, \nPageID.16676-77, 16679-80 ¶¶  17, 18, 22 (citing A Guide to the Project Mgmt. Body of \nKnowledge , Project Mgmt. Inst. § 1.4.4 (5th ed. 2013)).   \n Trivett’s testimony does not repeat impermis sibly Tierney’s testimony, and he will not be \npermitted to do simply th at at trial.  His reliance on that  testimony is not improper.     \n Finally, the plaintiffs argue that Trivett’s testimony amounts to a legal conclusion when he \nstates that “at no time did CS G have the responsibility or authority to have committed the \n‘wrongful practice’ allege d by the plaintiffs.”   Case 2:17-cv-10657-DML-RSW   ECF No. 533, PageID.<pageID>   Filed 03/18/21   Page 16 of 24-17- \n  The Federal Rules of Evidence make clear th at “[a]n opinion is not objectionable just \nbecause it embraces an ultimate issue.”  Fed. R. Evid. 704(a).  However, an expert witness may \nnot offer testimony “that expr esses a legal conclusion.”  Berry , 25 F.3d at 1354 (6th Cir. 1994).  \nThe court of appeals has explained that “there is a ‘subtle,’ but ‘nonetheless importa nt’ distinction \nbetween ‘opin[ing] on the ultimate question of lia bility’ (impermissible), a nd ‘stating opinions that \nsuggest the answer to the ultimate issue or that give the jury  all the informati on from which it can \ndraw inferences as to the ultimate issue’ (permissible).”  Babb v. Maryville Anesthesiologists P.C. , \n942 F.3d 308, 317 (6th Cir. 2019) (quoting Berry , 25 F.3d at 1353).  For ex ample, a court may not \n“‘allow a fingerprint expert in a criminal case to opine that the defendant was guilty (a legal \nconclusion)’” but can “‘allow him to opine that  the defendant’s fingerprint was the only one on \nthe murder wea pon (a fact).’” Ibid. (quoting Berry , 25 F.3d at 1353). \n Here, Trivett’s testimony that “CSG’s role was limited to the elicitation and documentation \nof the business rules, process flows, and decisi ons trees dictated by the State’s representatives” \nand that the “State had the ultima te responsibility and authority to  heed — or choose not to heed \n— CSG’s recommendations” is prop er, as it merely suggests the co nclusion that the fact finder \nshould reach.  But his opinion that “at no time did CSG have the respon sibility or authority to have \ncommitted the ‘wrongful practices’ alleged by the pl aintiffs” (i.e., due process violations) is an \nimpermissible legal conclusion, drawing not onl y on the contract documents but also an \ninterpretation of the parties’ ri ghts and responsibilities under the law of contract s.  Trivett will not \nbe allowed to give  that testimony.   \nIV. \n FAST and CSG move to bar the testimony if Christian Sandvig, a witn ess not identified by \nthe plaintiffs as a rebuttal witness because no  timely disclosure was given.  The plaintiffs Case 2:17-cv-10657-DML-RSW   ECF No. 533, PageID.<pageID>   Filed 03/18/21   Page 17 of 24-20- \n  Under  Rule 26, the report of a rebu ttal expert, that is, by one whose “evidence is intended \nsolely to contradict or rebut ev idence on the same subject matter identified by anot her party under \nRule 26(a)(2)(B) or (C),” must be disclosed within  30 days after the other party’s disclosure. Fed. \nR. Civ. P. 26(a)(2)(D)(ii).  By that measure, the disclosure, if incomplete, was nearly timely (one \nday late).  But generally, “rebuttal experts may not testify as to issues on which [the disclosing party] bears the burden of proof.”  UHS of Delaware, Inc. v. United Health Servs., Inc. , 2017 WL \n1945490, at *1 (M.D. Pa. May 10, 2017); see Taylor v. Brandon , 2018 WL 3581142, at *2 (W.D. \nKy. Jan. 30, 2018) (“‘[R]eal’ rebuttal appears to  be evidence or expert opinion offered by a \n[p]laintiff in response to  a defense theory or proof that ordi narily would not be offered by the \n[p]laintiff in its cas e-in-chief to establish an element of one  or more of its cau ses of action.”).  \nWhere a party attempts to introduce evidence establishing an  element of their claim through a \nrebuttal expert, preclusion of the testimony is th e proper remedy “absent a showing of substantial \njustification or harmlessness.”  Expeditors Int’l of Wash. v. Vastera, Inc. , No. 01-71000, 2004 WL \n6047123, at *2 (E.D. Mich. May 24, 2004) (citin g Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(c)(1)).    \n One of CSG’s and FAST’s main criticisms of the plaintiffs’ disclosu re of Sandvig is that \nthey believe it constitutes a backdoo r attempt at adding an expert to prove their case-in-chief.  The \ndisclosure also failed to include a report in the form required by Rule 26(a )(2)(B).  The plaintiffs \nrespond that the report requirement should be excu sed in this case because Sandvig had nothing to \nwork with due to the inadequate substance in th e defendants’ expert disclosures, which failed to \nsummarize any opinions.     The plaintiffs’ argument quite accurately describe s the state of the record in this case.  The \nnon-retained experts intend to  offer few, if any, opin ions.  The defendants will  rely on their special \nknowledge instead to allow them to explain the procedures and processes employed in applying Case 2:17-cv-10657-DML-RSW   ECF No. 533, PageID.<pageID>   Filed 03/18/21   Page 20 of 24-21- \n MiDAS to the fraud adjudications.  The plaintiffs’ primary complaint about those processes is that \nthey were deprived of notice, an opportunity to  be heard, and a fair he aring.  The non-retained \nexperts will offer no opinions on th ose points as such.  That subj ect matter, however, appears to \nbe Sandvig’s intended area of testimony.    The defendants made clear that they disclose d their non-retained expe rts in an abundance \nof caution, that they intend to use them primarily as fact witnesses, and that they only disclosed \nthem as non-retained experts if the Court were to  find that their testimony included expert opinions.  \nAs discussed above, the non-retained witnesses will not provide any expert opinions, with one or \ntwo minor exceptions, as they appear to only re lay the facts about which they had personal \nknowledge.  As discussed above, the only allowable opinions will come from the file examiners, \nwho will state that human claims examiners —not an auto-adjudication process — made the fraud \ndeterminations for the re spective plaintiffs.   However, Sandvig’s disclosure does not mention any \nof those proposed opinions.  Nor does Sandvig in tend to comment on anything J. Todd Trivett, \nCSG’s retained expert, intends to discuss.   \n It does not appear, therefore, that the plaintiffs intend to call Sandvig to rebut any opinions \nthat will be given by defense witnesses designate d as experts.  Instead, it appears that Sandvig \nintends to provide opinions that u ltimately support the plaintiffs’ ca se-in-chief.  For instance, he \nwill opine that MiDAS fails to incorporate impa rtial decision-making processes, that inherent \nbiases exist in MiDAS, MiDAS’s rules include predetermined outcomes,  and that MiDAS does \nnot weigh evidence.  Id. at PageiD.16605-06.  These generalized  opinions are not responsive to \nany offered opinions and improperl y bolster the plaintiffs’ argumen ts for which they carry the \nburden of proof, which is beyond the scope  of permissible re buttal testimony.   Case 2:17-cv-10657-DML-RSW   ECF No. 533, PageID.<pageID>   Filed 03/18/21   Page 21 of 24-22- \n  The only potentially responsiv e opinion Sandvig offers is th at MiDAS “adjudicates claims \nof potential claimant fr aud through its programming rules and l ogic.”  That testimony may rebut \nthe file examiners’ opinions that humans adjudicat ed the plaintiffs’ claims.  However, that opinion \nis not supported by the report re quired by Rule 26(a)(2)(B), wh ich must include the expert’s \nopinions, supporting facts and data, a nd other requirements.  The plai ntiffs argue that they were \nstymied by the defendants’ failure to describe their w itnesses’ intended op inion testimony in any \ndetail, but the opinions of those file examiners were described cl early enough in the disclosures.   \n When a party does not comply with the disclo sure requirements, the party “‘is not allowed \nto use’ the information or person that was not di sclosed ‘on a motion, at a hearing, or at a trial, \nunless the failure was substantiall y justified or is harmless.’”  Baker Hughes Inc.  v. S&S Chem., \nLLC, 836 F.3d 554, 567 (6th Cir. 2016) (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(c)(1 )).  According to the Sixth \nCircuit, “Rule 37(c)(1) mandates that a trial cour t sanction a party for di scovery violations in \nconnection with Rule 26(a) unless the violations were harmless or were substantially justified.”  \nSexton v. Uniroyal Chemi. Co. , 62 F. App’x 615, 616 n.1 (6th Cir. 2003).  “‘Rule 37 is written in \nmandatory terms and is designed to provide a st rong inducement for disclosure of Rule 26(a) \nmaterial.’”  Ibid. (quoting Ames v. Van Dyne , 100 F.3d 956, 1996 WL 662899, at *4 (6th Cir. Nov. \n13, 1996) (Table)).  The Sixth Circuit has identified five factors to consider when assessing whether a party's \nomitted or late disclosure is “substantially justified” or “harmless”: “‘(1) the surprise to the party \nagainst whom the evidence would be offered; (2) the ability of that party to  cure the surprise; (3) \nthe extent to which allowing the evidence woul d disrupt the trial; (4) the importance of the \nevidence; and (5) the nondisclosing party’s expl anation for its failure to disclose the \nevidence.’”  Howe v. City of Akron , 801 F.3d 718, 747-48 (6th Cir. 2015) (quoting Russell v. Abs. Case 2:17-cv-10657-DML-RSW   ECF No. 533, PageID.<pageID>   Filed 03/18/21   Page 22 of 24-23- \n Collection Servs., Inc. , 763 F.3d 385, 396-97 (4th Cir. 2014)).  None of those factors favor the \nplaintiffs.  The plaintiffs’ excuse for not furnis hing a report that rebuts the narrow scope of the \nopinion testimony disclosed by the defendants doe s not meet the substantial justification \nrequirement.  And the plaintiffs ha ve not shown how their decision to revive the participation of \ntheir expert after the defendants made  their disclosures is harmless.   \n Moreover, judging from the subj ect matter of the testimony th at Sandvig disclosed, he is \nnot a true rebuttal witness.  His testimony instead  would focus on one or more elements of the \nplaintiffs’ claims, more properly offered in their case-in-chief.  Taylor , 2018 WL 3581142, at *2.  \nThat makes the failure to serve a disclosure complete with a report more problematic.   \n “‘The exclusion of non-disclosed evid ence is automatic and mandatory under \nRule 37(c)(1) unless non-disclosure was justified or harmless.’”  Dickenson v. Cardiac & Thoracic \nSurgery of Eastern Tennessee , 388 F.3d 976, 983 (6th Cir. 2004) (quoting Musser v. Gentiva \nHealth Services , 356 F.3d 751, 758 (7th Cir. 2004)).  “The party requesting exclusion under \nRule 37(c)(1) need not s how prejudice, rather the non-moving pa rty must show that the exclusion \nwas ‘harmless’ or ‘substantially justified.’”  Saint Gobain Autover USA, Inc. v. Xinyi Glass N. Am., \nInc., 666 F. Supp. 2d 820, 826 (N.D. Ohio 2009); see also  Roberts ex rel. Johnson v. Galen of \nVirginia, Inc. , 325 F.3d 776, 782 (6th Cir. 2003) (quoting Vance v. United States , No. 98-5488, \n1999 WL 455435, at *3 (6th Cir. June 25, 1999)).  The plaintiffs will not be pe rmitted to call Christian Sandvig as an expert witness.   \nV. \n FAST urges the Court to sanction the plainti ffs because they filed two sets of motions \nchallenging the expert testimony.  However, the motions serve different purposes, one set Case 2:17-cv-10657-DML-RSW   ECF No. 533, PageID.<pageID>   Filed 03/18/21   Page 23 of 24-24- \n addressing procedural issues and the other cha llenging the substance of the proposed expert \ntestimony.  Sanctions are not appropriate.   \n The defendants’ disclosures for the non-reta ined experts do not id entify any admissible \nopinion testimony except CSG’s disclo sures that the file examiners will opine that human claims \nexaminers, not an auto-adjudica tion process, made the fraud dete rminations.  Beyond that, the non-\nretained experts will not be perm itted to give opinion testimony.  They will be able to describe \ntheir interaction with MiDAS and how it was invol ved in the determination of the plaintiffs’ \nclaims, and the interaction of FA ST and CSG with the State in the development and application of \nMiDAS.  CSG’s retained expert may testify to hi s opinions except that which amounts to a legal \nconclusion.  Accordingly, it is ORDERED  that the plaintiffs’ motions to strike expert witness \ndisclosures (ECF No 345, 346, 348), a nd their motions to bar expert  witness testimony (ECF No. \n380, 381, 382) are GRANTED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART.   \n It is further ORDERED  that the motion by CSG and FAST  to preclude the plaintiffs’ \nexpert witness testimony (ECF No. 378) is GRANTED .   \n        s / D a v i d  M .

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: This court case involves a derivative lawsuit filed by shareholders of Stem, Inc., a company utilizing AI-driven clean energy solutions, against its board members and executives for alleged securities violations and breaches of fiduciary duty related to a merger and subsequent company operations. The court adopted a Magistrate Judge's report recommending dismissal of the federal securities claim and related state law claims without prejudice, primarily due to plaintiffs’ failure to adequately plead their case under heightened standards. However, the case highlights the involvement of AI as part of Stem's business operations, relevant to discussions of corporate governance and investor communications.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the plaintiffs adequately pleaded claims under Section 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act and related state law claims, involving alleged misstatements or omissions in merger communications, sufficiently to survive a motion to dismiss.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court overruled the plaintiffs' objections and adopted the Magistrate's recommendation, dismissing the federal securities claim (Section 14(a)) without prejudice, for failure to meet heightened pleading standards. The related state law claims were dismissed without prejudice due to lack of supplemental jurisdiction.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine a group of people who own shares in a company are upset because they think that the company's leaders lied about some important facts when they decided to join up with another company. These people took their concerns to court. However, the court said that they didn’t clearly show why the leaders' statements were lies or why it matters. Because of this, the court didn’t go ahead with the case but told the shareholders they could try again if they present their argument more clearly.",

The parties have not objected to any of those sections of \nthe Report and the Court finds  no clear error in them on the face of the record .  The Court therefore \nadopts those sections and incorporates them here:  \nA. The Parties  \nStem is a Delaware corporation headquartered in San \nFrancisco, California. (D.I. 34 at ¶ 44) It offers artificial intelligence (“AI”) -driven clean energy storage systems (e.g., batteries and \nrelated software and hardware) to its customers, which include commercial and indust rial enterprises, independent power \nproducers, renewable project developers and energy grid operators. (Id. at ¶ 2) Stem was formerly known as Star Peak Energy Transition \nCorp. (“Star Peak”); it is a successor by merger to legacy Stem, Inc. (“Legacy Stem”) . (Id. at ¶¶ 1, 3, 8) Star Peak was a special purpose Case 1:23-cv-01011-MN     Document 76     Filed 03/24/25     Page 2 of 13 PageID #:\n<pageID>2 acquisition company, “a publicly traded corporation with a two- year \nlife span formed with the sole purpose of effecting a merger . . . with \na privately held business to enable it to go public.” (Id. at ¶ 3)  \n Plaintiffs are current shareholders of Stem Common Stock. \n(D.I. 1 at ¶¶ 26, 27; D.I. 34 at ¶ 43) Hanna facially alleges that she has held Stem common stock continuously and at all relevant times (i.e., from December 4, 2020 through April 3, 2023). (D.I. 34 at ¶ \n43; see id . at ¶ 1) Gera has continuously held Stem common stock \nsince purchasing it on February 23, 2021. (D.I. 1 at ¶ 26) Bhavsar has held Stem common stock continuously since purchasing it on January 29, 2021. ( Id. at ¶ 27) The suit is filed deriv atively on behalf \nof Stem. (D.I. 34 at ¶ 1) Individual Defendant Sponsor is a Delaware \nlimited liability company that sponsored Star Peak. ( Id. at ¶ 3) The \nremaining Individual Defendants are current and former members of Stem/Star Peak’s Board of Directors and/or executives at Stem/Star Peak. (Id . at ¶¶ 45- 98)[.]  \n \nB. Factual Background  \nOn December 4, 2020, Star Peak filed a Form 8- K with \nexhibits with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), announcing it had entered an agreement to merge with Legacy Stem. ( Id. at ¶ 8) The post -Merger entity was \nexpected to be worth $1.35 billion and have $608 million in gross proceeds. ( Id. at ¶¶ 8, 142) Thereafter, Star Peak “filed a registration \nstatement in connection with the proposed Merger on December 17, 2020, on Form S -4 with the SEC (the ‘Registration Statement’), \nfollowed by a joint prospectus and proxy statement on Form 424B3 (the ‘Merger Proxy,’ and together with the Registration Statement, the ‘Offering Documents’).” (Id . at ¶ 8) The Boards of Star Peak and \nLegacy Stem filed the Merger Proxy on March 30, 2021, seeking shareholder approval for the Merger and certain charter proposals, among other things. ( Id. at ¶ 23) With shareholder approval, the \ncompanies merged on April 28, 2021 (the “Merger”). ( Id. at ¶¶ 8, \n154) Legacy Stem survived as a wholly owned subsidiary of Star  \nPeak, and Star Peak renamed itself “Stem, Inc.” ( Id. at ¶ 154) Stem \nthen undertook the business operations of Legacy Stem. ( Id.) \nAdditional facts relevant to resolution of the instant Motions \nwill be discussed in Section III.  \n \nC. Procedural Background  \nPlaintiffs’ allegations in this case relate in part to allegations \nin a related securities case: In re Stem, Inc. Sec. Litig., Civil Action No. 3:23- cv-2329- MMC (N.D. Cal. May 12, 2023) (the “Securities \nAction”). The Securities Action is a class action lawsuit, which was Case 1:23-cv-01011-MN     Document 76     Filed 03/24/25     Page 3 of 13 PageID #:\n<pageID>3 initiated in the  United States District Court for the Northern District \nof California (“Northern District of California”) on May 12, 2023 \nagainst Stem, Star Peak and a group of the Individual Defendants. In re Stem, Inc. Sec. Litig., Civil Action No. 3:23- cv-2329- MMC, \nD.I. 1 (N.D. Cal. May 12, 2023). The claims in the Securities Action include alleged violations of Section 14(a) (“Section 14(a)”) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) and Rule 14a-9, violations of Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act, violations of \nSection 10(b) (“Section 10(b)”) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5, and violations of the Exchange Act for Insider Selling. Id., D.I. \n87 at ¶¶ 378- 420 (N.D. Cal. Oct. 17, 2023). The defendants moved \nto di smiss all claims in the Securities Action, and the Northern \nDistrict of California granted the defendants’ motion in its entirety. Petersen v. Stem, Inc., Case No. 23- cv-02329 -MMC, 2024 WL \n4602710 (N.D. Cal. Aug. 30, 2024). Thereafter, the plaintiffs filed a first amended consolidated complaint. In re Stem, Inc. Sec. Litig ., \nCivil Action No. 3:23- cv-2329- MMC, D.I. 127 (N.D. Cal. Nov. 8, \n2024). The defendants have moved to dismiss all claims within the first amended consolidated complaint, and the Securities  Action \nremains pending. Id ., D.I. 128 (N.D. Cal. Dec. 20, 2024). \n Plaintiffs Gera and Bhavsar began the instant lawsuit on \nAugust 26, 2023, via the filing of a complaint in the Northern District of California, brought on behalf of Stem and against certain of the Defendants. (D.I. 1) Pursuant to the parties’ stipulation, the \ncase was transferred to this Court on September 15, 2023. (D.I. \n20)[.]  \n \nOn December 15, 2023, Plaintiff Hanna filed another \nderivative action in this Court on behalf of Stem against all Defendants (the “Hanna Action”). (Civil Action No. 23- 1436- MN, \nD.I. 1)  Pursuant to all parties’ stipulation, the two actions were \nconsolidated into the instant action, and the Complaint in the Hanna Action was designated the operative Complaint in this case. (D.I. 32)[.] \n The operative Complaint, which was then re -filed, (D.I. 34), \nasserts nine claims:  \n ● First Claim: Violation of Section 14(a) of the Exchange \nAct, 15 U.S.C. § 78n(a)(1), and Rule 14a -9, 17 C.F.R. § 240.14a -9, \nAgainst Scheyer, Morgan, Wilds, Daley, Litowitz, Rogers and Shaper, ( id. at ¶¶ 456 -64); \n ● Second Claim: Breach of Fiduciary Duties Against \nIndividual Defendants, ( id. at ¶¶ 465 -77); Case 1:23-cv-01011-MN     Document 76     Filed 03/24/25     Page 4 of 13 PageID #:\n<pageID>4 ● Third Claim: Unjust Enrichment Against Individual \nDefendants, ( id. at ¶¶ 478 -82); \n \n● Fourth Claim: Abuse of Control Against Individual \nDefendants, ( id. at ¶¶ 483 -86); \n ● Fifth Claim: Gross Mismanagement Against Individual \nDefendants, ( id. at ¶¶ 487 -91); \n ● Sixth Claim: Waste of Corporate Assets Against \nIndividual Defendants, ( id. at ¶¶ 492 -97); \n ● Seventh Claim: Contribution Under Section 10(b) of the \nExchange Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 78j(b), and Section 21D (“Section 21D”) of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act (“PSLRA”),2 15 U.S.C. § 78u- 4(f), Against Carrington, Bush, Scheyer, Wilds, \nMorgan, Daley, Litowitz, Rogers, Johnson, Patel, Russo, Ho and \nShaper, ( id. at ¶¶ 498 -502);  \n ● Eighth Claim: Contribution Under Section 21D of the \nPSLRA, 15 U.S.C. § 78u- 4(f), and Section 11(f) (“Section 11(f)”) \nof the Securities Act of 1933 (the “Securities Act”), 15 U.S.C. §  \n77k(f)(1), Against Scheyer, Wilds, Morgan, Daley, Litowitz, Rogers and Shaper, ( id. at ¶¶ 503 -12); and  \n \n● Ninth Claim: Aiding and Abetting Breach of Fiduciary \nDuty  Against Carrington, Bush, Buzby and Tammineedi, ( id. at ¶¶ \n513-19). \n \nPrior to the filing of the Complaint, no demand was made on \nStem’s Board to institute the action. (D.I. 34 at ¶ 438) Plaintiffs assert that any such demand would have been futile. ( Id. at ¶¶ 437-\n55)[.]  \n \nOn April 1, 2024, Stem filed Stem’s Motion to Dismiss, (D.I. \n40); the Individual Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss was filed on the same day, (D.I. 42). Manetta filed the Motion to Intervene on June 20, 2024. (D.I. 48) All of the Motions were fully briefed as of August 2, 2024. (D.I. 64) The Motions were all referred to the Court for resolution by United States District Judge Maryellen Noreika on September 5, 2024. (D.I. 70)[.]  \n \n(Id. at 2 -9) (punctuation added).  \n Case 1:23-cv-01011-MN     Document 76     Filed 03/24/25     Page 5 of 13 PageID #:\n<pageID>5 Judge Burke issued the Report on January 31, 2025.  In Section III.A , he recommend ed \ndismissing the contribution claims with prejudice  as unripe .  (D.I. 73 at 8).  Section III.B \nrecommended dismissing the Section 14(a) claim without prejudice  for failure to state a claim.  \n(Id. at 17).  Section III.C recommended dismissing the related state law claims without prejudice  \nfor lack of subject matter jurisdiction .  (Id. at 18).  Finally , Section III.D recommended denying \nthe Motion to Intervene as moot.  ( Id. at 19).  The Plaintiffs filed their Objections on \nFebruary 14,  2025, objecting only to Sections III.B and III.C.  (D.I. 74 at 1).  On \nFebruary 28,  2025, the Defendants responded, asking the Court to adopt the Report.  (D.I. 75 at \n1).  The parties do not object to Sections III.A and III.D  of the Report, and the Court finds no clear \nerror  on the face of the record.  Accordingly, the Court will adopt those Sections  of the Report ; the \ncontribution claims are dismissed with prejudice and the motion to intervene is denied as moot .  \nThe Court now addresses the Objections  to Sections III.B and III.C . \nII. LEGAL STANDARD  \nTo withstand a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain “sufficient \nfactual matter, accepted as true, to ‘state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.’”  Iqbal , 556, \nU.S. at 678 (quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly , 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007)).  A claim is facially \nplausible where “the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable \ninference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.”  Iqbal , 556 U.S. at 678.  “A \npleading that offers ‘labe ls and conclusions’ or ‘a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause \nof action will not do.’”  Id . (internal citations omitted).  \nIn deciding a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, a court must consider only the complaint, exhibits \nattached to the complaint, matters of public record, as well as undisputed authentic documents if the complainant ’s claims are based upon these documents.”  Mayer v. Belichick, 605 F.3d 223, \n230 (3d Cir. 2010).  The Court is not obligated to accept as true “bald assertions” or “unsupported Case 1:23-cv-01011-MN     Document 76     Filed 03/24/25     Page 6 of 13 PageID #:\n<pageID>6 conclusions and unwarranted inferences.”  Morse v. Lower Merion Sch. Dist. , 132 F.3d 902, 906 \n(3d Cir. 1997).  Instead, “[t]he complaint must state enough facts to raise a reasonable expectation \nthat discovery will reveal evidence of [each] necessary element” of a plaintiff ’s claim. ”  Wilkerson \nv. New Media Tech. Charter Sch. Inc., 522 F.3d 315, 321 (3d Cir. 2008) (internal citations \nomitted).   \nIII. DISCUSSIO N \nPlaintiffs object to Sections III.B and III.C  of the Report’s findings: (1) that  Plaintiffs’  \nSection 14(a) claim should be dismissed as either indiscernible or not viable; and (2) that the \nremaining Delaware state law claims should  be dismissed for lack of supplemental jurisdiction.  \nThe Court will address each objection in turn.  \nA. The Section 14(a) Claim  \nThe Report found that heightened pleading standards applied to Plaintiffs ’ Section 14(a) \nclaim .  (D.I. 73 at 9).  The Report also found Plaintiffs’ Complaint was a “puzzle pleading”, and \nso failed both heightened and normal pleading standards, and the Report recommended dismissal \nwithout prejudice as a result.   (D.I. 73 at  15-16).  Plaintiffs challenge th at finding, asserting  their \nSection 14(a) claim is  not a puzzle pleading, that their claim meets both simple and heightened \npleading standards, and that Pl aintiffs should be given leave to amend, not see their 14(a) claim \ndismissed.   (D.I. 74 at 2 -6).  More specifically, Plaintiffs o bjects to the characterization of  their \noperative pleading a s “solely based in negligence ,” assert ing the Complaint accurately ple aded a \n14(a) claim sounding in negligence  or fraud.  (D.I. 74 at 2).  Regardless of the basis, Plaintiffs \nargue, the Report incorrectly applied the pleading standards of both Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 9(b) and the PSLRA in disposing of its 14(a) c laim, and in so doing, did not recognize \nthat the operative pleading satisfied the PLSRA’s pleading requirements.  (D.I. 74 at 3- 5).  But Case 1:23-cv-01011-MN     Document 76     Filed 03/24/25     Page 7 of 13 PageID #:\n<pageID>7 should the Court agree with the Report’s findings, the Plaintiffs argue, the right course of action \nis to permit Plaintiffs leave to amend, not dismissal.   (D.I. 74 at 6).  \n1. Whether Heightened Pleading Standards Apply  \nAlthough t he Third Circuit has not expressly “ determined whether the PSLRA ’s \nheightened pleading standard applies to Section 14(a) claims that sound in negligence ,” In re \nResolute Energy Corp. Sec. Litig., No. 21- 1412, 2022 WL 260059, at *2 n.4 (3d Cir.  Jan. 27, \n2022), the Report set forth a reasoned analysis supporting application of Rule 9(b)  and the \nPLSRA’s standards to a 14(a) claim:  \nThere is no question that since Plaintiffs allege that “the statements \ncontained in the Merger Proxy were materially false and misleading[,]” albeit negligently, (D.I. 34 at ¶ 460), Plaintiffs’ Section 14(a) claim is subject to  the PSLRA. In re Pattern Energy \nGrp. Inc. Sec. Litig., C.A. No. 20- 275-MN-JLH, 2021 WL 311257, \nat *9 (D. Del. Jan. 28, 2021), report and recommendation adopted, 2021 WL 765760 (D. Del. Feb. 26, 2021); see also Resnik v. Woertz , \n774 F. Supp. 2d 614, 630 (D. Del. 2011); In re Keryx Biopharms. , \n454 F. Supp. 3d at 412; Schaper v. LENSAR, Inc., C.A. No. 23 -692-\nJLH, 2024 WL 4817656, at *2 (D. Del. Nov. 18, 2024). And the text \nof Section 78u- 4(b)(1) of the PSLRA states that : \n  \nIn any private action arising under this chapter in which the \nplaintiff alleges that the defendant –  \n \n(A) made an untrue statement of a material fact; or  \n \n(B) omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances in which they were made, not misleading;  \n \nthe complaint shall specify each statement alleged to have been misleading, the reason or reasons why the statement is misleading, and, if an allegation regarding the statement or omission is made on information and belief, the complaint shall state with p articularity \nall facts on which that belief is formed. 15 U.S.C. § 78u- 4(b)(1). The \nstatute is unambiguous; the heightened pleading requirement “applies ‘[i]n any private action arising under’ the Exchange Act.” \nKooker ex rel. Hecla Mining Co. v. Baker , 497 F. Supp. 3d 1, 6 (D. \nDel. 2020) d[][.] Therefore, Section 78u- 4(b)(1) extends Rule 9(b)’s Case 1:23-cv-01011-MN     Document 76     Filed 03/24/25     Page 8 of 13 PageID #:\n<pageID>8 requirements to Section 14(a) claims, like this one, that relate to the \nmaking of misleading statements.  \n (D.I. 73, at 9 -10) (internal citations shortened).  \nThe Court agrees with the Report ’s reading of the plain language of the PSLRA that the \nheightened pleading standard applies in any action under the Exchange Act .  15 U.S.C. \n§ 78u04(b)(1) .  Thus, Pl aintiffs’ Section 14(a) claim will be held to the heightened pleading \nstandard.  In re Pattern Energy Group Inc. Sec. Litig., 22021 WL 311257, *9 (D. Del. 2021).  \n2. Whether Plaintiff’s Pleading  is a “Puzzle Pleading”  \nBecause the heightened pleading standard applies, the Court next turns to the scope of that \nfinding’s impact on Plaintiffs’ objection that their Complaint is not a puzzle pleading.  (D.I. 74 , at \n4).  In securities claims, a puzzle pleading is one that reproduces blocks of text from an allegedly \ndeceptive statement or filing, then offering only  standard reasons as to why such quoted text is \nfalse or misleading.  See In re Lottery.com, Inc. Sec. Litig., 715 F. Supp. 3d 506, 534 (S.D.N.Y. \n2024) .  Such pleadings generally “require the defendant and the court to match the statements up \nwith the reasons they are false or misleading [,]” and are insufficient for claims that invoke \nheightened pleading standards.  Vatidis v. Trimble, Inc., 2019 WL 3546693, *4 (D. Del. 2019) (internal quotations omitted).    \nAs before, Plaintiffs ’ argument  fails.  The Report carefully considered when a pleading \nconstitutes a puzzle pleading, which paragraphs in the Complaint may overcome  this deficiency , \nand any other possibilities  where  the allegations could reach the requisite level of particularity.   \n(D.I. 73 at 8 -17).  As part of its analysis, the Report reasoned : \n[N]owhere in these paragraphs, or in the paragraphs following them, \ndoes the Complaint explain why it has bolded and italicized any \nsuch content, or why it is that these bolded or italicized portions are said in some way to relate to any alleged misstatements or omissions \nat issue.   […]  Moreover, the various block quotes are often \nrepetitive. In a number of them, the same material is excerpted that Case 1:23-cv-01011-MN     Document 76     Filed 03/24/25     Page 9 of 13 PageID #:\n<pageID>9 had previously been excerpted in a prior paragraph, but now with \ndifferent portions of that material being highlighted for emphasis . \n(See, e.g., D.I. 34 at ¶¶ 227, 229, 231, 232, 237, 238) And this all \nhappens with no acknowledgement that such repetition is occurring, nor with any explanation as to what the pleader is trying to convey by doing this. Additionally, the Complaint makes no effort to pl ace \nany of the alleged false or misleading statements into understandable categories that might otherwise assis t the reader.  \n (D.I. 73 at 13- 14). \nYet in objecting, Plaintiffs  only reiterate arguments the Report already analyzed .  \n(See D.I. 74 at 4).  Plaintiffs suggest the Complaint “holistically identifies which specific \nstatements” created an actionabl y false or misleading impression of the value of the Merger and \nthe related entities .  (Id.).  T o illustrate that point, Plaintiffs direct the Court to several dozen \nparagraphs of the Complaint, ranging from paragraph s 12 to 145- 87 to 331 to 412, among others .  \n(D.I. 74 at 4, citing D.I. 34).  To follow that thread would require the Court to “match the statements \nup with the reasons they are false or misleading” much like matching up the pieces of a jigsaw  \npuzzle.   In re Wilmington Tr. Sec. Litig. , 852 F. Supp. 2d 477, 490 (D. Del. 2012) (“ While the \ncomplaint contains hundreds of quotations in over forty pages . . . nowhere does the complaint \nspecifically identify those statements upon which plaintiffs base their claims.”); see, e.g. , In re \nMetropolitan Securities Litigation , 532 F. Supp. 2d 1260, 1279 (E.D.Wa. 2007); Patel v. Parnes , \n253 F.R.D. 531, 552- 53 (C.D. Cal. 2008); Born v. Quad/Graphics, Inc., 521 F. Supp. 3d 469, 478-\n79 (S.D.N.Y. 2021) (“Plaintiffs’ ‘selective’ bolding does little to assist the Court in identifying the \nfalsity of Defendants’ statements [.]”).   \nEven if the Court begins to fit  those  pieces together, the allegations the Plaintiffs  cite – as \nthe Report addresses – fail to demonstrate , or even allege , why the statements are false or \nmisleading.  The Court finds the Report accurately contended with paragraph 239 of the \nComplaint, which alleged the Merger Proxy’s falsity : Case 1:23-cv-01011-MN     Document 76     Filed 03/24/25     Page 10 of 13 PageID #:\n<pageID>10 But in this paragraph, the Complaint never clearly explains what it \nis talking about. It does not specify what “business, operations and prospects” or “value of . . . investment and future post -Merger” or \n“business and competitive standing” or “strategic p artnerships and  \nrevenues” -type information it is speaking to. And to the extent the \npleading is asserting that portions of the previously- referenced block \nquotes give off one of the types of “false impression[s]” at issue, it never indicates which portions  it is referring to, or why that is so . \n (D.I. 73 at 14 -15). \n \nAs the Report correctly note d, the C omplaint fails to plainly address the basis for which it \nchallenges the many preceding Merger Proxy statements.  The failure is not in detailing the \npossibility of alleged misstatements, but in f ailing to, with the requisite particularity, detail how  \neach of the alleged misstatements caused “a false impression of Legacy Stem’s business, operations, and prospects.”  (D.I. 34 ¶ 239). \nThe Court adopts the Report’s recommendation to dismiss Plaintiff s’ Section 14(a) claim.  \nNonetheless, because this is Plaintiffs’ first pleading, the Court  will also adopt the Report’s \nrecommended course of action.  As the Report states, “the Court cannot say for sure that Plaintiffs \ncould not plead a viable Section 14(a) claim at this stage, and in light of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15’s admonition that leave to amend should be freely permitted ‘ when justice so \nrequires[,] ’ Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a)(2), ” (D.I. 73 at 17) , and so the Court will dismiss the claim \nwithout prejudice.  \nB. The State Law Claims  \nPlaintiffs next challenge the Report’s conclusion that , absent a pending Exchange Act \nclaim,  the Complaint’s related state law claims should be dismissed.  (D.I. 73 at 17-18; D.I. 74 at \n6-8).  Plaintiffs argue first that the Report is mistaken as to jurisdiction over the state law claims \nas jurisdiction exist s pursuant to the Section 14(a) claim.   (D.I. 74 at 6).   The y also assert  that \njurisdiction over the state law claims is proper, notwithstanding dismissal of the Exchange Act  Case 1:23-cv-01011-MN     Document 76     Filed 03/24/25     Page 11 of 13 PageID #:\n<pageID>11 claim, because their state law claims have  federal question jurisdiction based on underlying claims \nof violations of the Exchange Act .  (D.I. 74 at 7).  Should the Court disagree with their theory, \nPlaintiffs assert supplemental jurisdiction lingers until the Section 14(a) claim is dismissed with \nprejudice.   (Id.). \nPlaintiffs  misinterpret the extent of  supplemental jurisdiction.   Federal district courts “have \noriginal jurisdiction of all civil actions arising under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United \nStates,” 28 U.S.C. § 1331, as well as “supplemental jurisdiction over all other claims that are so related to claims in  the action within such original jurisdiction that they form part of the same case \nor controversy under  Article III of the United States Constitution.”   Id. § 1367(a).   \nA court may decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction when “the court has dismissed \nall claims over which it has original jurisdiction.”  Kooker ex rel. Hecla Mining Co. v. Baker, 497 F. Supp. 3d 1, 6 (D. Del. 2020); 28 U.S.C. § 1367(c)(3).  The Report properly identified \n§ 1367(c)(3) as its  basis for declining to exercise supplemental jurisdiction, and Plaintiffs’ \nObjections point to no proposition of law suggesting otherwise.  This makes sense given  Plaintiffs’ \nstate law claims are “pendent claims arising under state law that would not independently qualify for federal -court adjudication.”  Arbaugh v. Y&H Corp., 546 U.S. 500, 506 (2006).   As such , the \nReport was correct to recommend dismissal once it decided to recommend against exercising \nsupplemental jurisdiction.  \nIn the event a  federal court decides against exercising supplemental jurisdiction, “it should \ndo so without prejudice, as there has been no adjudication on the merits.”  Kach v. Hose , 589 F.3d \n626, 650 (3d Cir. 2009).  Therefore , if a  district court decline s to exercise supplemental \njurisdiction, its only course is to dismiss the related state law claims without prejudice, not retain such claims until the original federal claim is dismissed with prejudice, as Plaintiffs would have Case 1:23-cv-01011-MN     Document 76     Filed 03/24/25     Page 12 of 13 PageID #:\n<pageID>12 the Court do.  Id .  Consequently, the  Court finds that the  Report accurate ly evaluated  the Court’s \njurisdiction to hear the state law claims and adopts that reasoned analysis.  Therefore, the Court \nwill dismiss  the state law claims without prejudice.  \nIV. CONCLUSION \nFor the reasons stated above, Plaintiffs’ Objections to the Report are OVERRULED, the  \nReport is ADOPTED, the Defendants’ motions to dismiss are GRANTED, and potential intervenor \nEdward Manetta’s Motion to Intervene is DENIED as MOOT.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: This case involves a class action lawsuit against Google LLC, where plaintiffs allege copyright infringement through the unauthorized use of copyrighted works to build and train Google's generative AI models. The court grants Google's motion to strike the class allegations on the grounds that the class definition is a \"fail-safe\" class, meaning it requires the court to decide on the merits of each potential class member's claim to determine class membership. The plaintiffs are allowed to amend the class definition within a specified timeframe.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: The primary legal issue is the acceptability of a \"fail-safe\" class definition in a class action lawsuit, where class membership is contingent upon the success of the underlying legal claim, which in this case is the alleged copyright infringement by Google.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court holds that the current class definition is impermissible because it creates a \"fail-safe\" class, which is not allowed. Plaintiffs are granted leave to amend the class definition to a more objective criterion that doesn't require upfront resolution of liability.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine some authors think Google used their books without asking to teach Google's smart computer how to write new things. They want to join together to sue Google. But the rules they made for being in this group are tricky and basically say you can't be in the group unless you can already show Google did something wrong. The judge said, \"That's not fair; fix your rules so that anyone affected can join without proving the whole case first.\" So, the judge agreed with Google to make them change these joining rules, but they allowed the authors to try again with better rules.",

Having carefully reviewed the parties’ briefs, the Court \nfinds this matter suitable for disposi tion without oral argument.  See Civil L.R. 7 -1(b).  For the \nfollowing reasons, the Court GRANTS the motion to strike with leave to amend.  \nI. PROCEDURAL HISTORY1 \nThis consolidated action  originated as two separate putative class actions:  Leovy v. Google \nLLC, Case No. 23 -cv-03440, and Zhang v. Google LLC , Case No. 24 -cv-02531 .  After the cases \nwere reassigned to this Court, the Court granted the parties’ stipulation to consolidate the cases  for \nall trial and pretrial proceedings.  Joint Stip. & Order Consolidating Cases, ECF No.  73.  The \nCourt granted Plaintiffs leave to file a consolidated amended complaint and ordered the parties to \nmeet and confer regarding Plaintiffs’ anticipated amend ments.  See Order Re : Consolidation Plan \n \n1 The Court assumes the parties’ familiarity with the facts of the case.  This Order references only \nthose facts relevant to the Court’s ruling.

The purpose \nof the meet -and-confer process was to streamline further motion practice on the pleadings, and to \naccount for issues that Google had previously raised in its motions to dismiss the complaints in the \nLeovy  and Zhang  actions  prior to consolidation .  See id . (“In finalizing the consolidated amended \ncomplaint, Plaintiffs s hall make substantial good -faith efforts to address the issues Google raised \nat the conference and in prior motions to dismiss. ”). \nOn December 20, 2024, Plaintiffs filed the consolidated amended complaint.  Relevant \nhere, the complaint proposes  a new class definition  composed of :  \nAll persons or entities who:   (1) are domiciled in the United States; (2) own a  valid \ncopyright registration for one or more works under the Copyright Act;  (3) whose \nexclusive rights under 17 U.S.C. § 106 in their registered works  were infringed upon, \nunder 17 U.S.C. § 501, by Google without license or  authorization in order to train \nGoogle’s Generative AI Models during the  Class Period; and (4) held such copyright \nregistration prior to Google’s  unauthorized use.  \nCompl. ¶ 164.   This definition departs from the class definitions proposed in the operative Leovy  \nand Zhang  complaints  by adding several criteria for membership in the class .  The Leovy \ncomplaint proposed a class of “[a] ll persons in the United States who own a United States \ncopyright in any work that was used as training data for Defendant’s Products. ”  Second Am. \nCompl. ¶ 90, Leovy v. Google LLC , No. 23 -cv-03440 , ECF No. 47.  Similarly, the Zhang \ncomplaint proposed a class of “[a]ll persons or entities domiciled in the United States that own a  \nUnited States copyright in any work that Google used as a training image for the  Google -LAION \nModels during the Class Period.”   Compl. ¶ 63, Zhang v.  Google , No. 24 -cv-02531 , ECF No. 1.   \n On January 17, 2025, Google filed a motion  to strike the class allegations  and, in the \nalternative, to stay discovery “unrelated to class certification .”  See Mot.  at 25.   Google contends \nthat Plaintiffs failed to disclose the amendments to the class definition through the Court -ordered , \nmeet -and-confer process.  Id. at 4-5, 15 -16.  Google also contends that the new definition creates  \nan improper fail -safe class  – i.e., to determine who is a member of the proposed class, the Court \nwould need to determine u pfront who has a valid copyright infringement claim against Google .  \nId. at 9 -13.

See Mullens Decl. \nEx. A, ECF No. 106 -1.  Under this stipulation, the class definition would be amended to:  \n“All persons or entities domiciled in the United States who owned a United States  copyright in \nany work used by Google to train Google’s Generative AI Models during  the Class Period. ”  Id. at \n1.  Google rejected this stipulation.  Mullens Decl. ¶ 5, ECF No. 106.  On February 6, 2025, \nPlaintiffs offered another stipulation that proposed the same amended class definition, but did not \nrequire Google to withdraw its motion to strike.  Mullens Decl. Ex. B, ECF No. 106 -2.  Google \nrejected this stipulation as well.  Mullens Decl.  ¶ 8. \nII. LEGAL STANDARD  \nUnder Rule 12(f), a party may move to strike “an insufficient defense or any redundant, \nimmaterial, impertinent, or scandalous matter.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(f).  The purpose of a motion to \nstrike is to avoid wasteful litigation of “spurious issues.”  Whittlestone, Inc. v. Handi -Craft Co. , \n618 F.3d 970, 973 (9th Cir. 2010).   Therefore, a “motion to strike should only be granted if the \nmatter sought to be stricken clearly has no possible bearing on the subject matter of the litigation.”  \nBaton v. Ledger SAS , 740 F. Supp. 3d 847, 872  (N.D. Cal. 2024) . \nA decision to grant a motion to strike class allegations  at the pleading stage is the \n“functional equivalent of denying a motion to certify a case as a class action”  before discovery \ncommences.  Bates v. Bankers Life & Cas . Co., 848 F.3d 1236 , 1238  (9th Cir. 2017)  (per curiam) \n(quoting In re Bemis Co ., 279 F.3d 419, 421 (7th Cir. 2002) ).  The Ninth Circuit  has recognized \nthat “often the pleadings alone will not resolve the question of class certification and that some \ndiscovery will be warranted.”  Vinole v . Countrywide Home Loans, Inc. , 571 F.3d 935 , 942  \n(9th Cir. 2009) .  Thus, in general, “the better and more advisable practice for a District Court to \nfollow is to afford the litigants an opportunity to present evidence as to whether a class action [i]s \nmaintainable.”  Id. (quoting Doninger v. Pac. Nw. Bell, Inc. , 564 F.2d 1304, 1313 (9th Cir. 1977) ).  \nBut when the problem with the class allegations is “facially evident, it makes sense to address the \nissue early on.”  Baton , 740 F. Supp. 3d at 883.  Case 5:23-cv-03440-EKL     Document 128     Filed 04/21/25     Page 3 of 9 \n4 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  III. DISCUSSION  \nA. Fail-Safe Class Definition  \nGoogle argues that Plaintiffs  have defined an improper “fail -safe” class.  See Mot. at 9-13.  \nA proper class is defined by objective criteria.  For example, in a false advertising case, the class \nmight be defined as all persons who purchased a certain product during a certain time period.  See \nBriseno v. ConAgra Foods, Inc ., 844 F.3d 1121, 1123 -24 (9th Cir. 2017).   By contrast, a fail -safe \nclass “is defined in a way that precludes membership unless the liability of the defendant is \nestablished.”  Kamar v. RadioShack Corp ., 375 F. App’x 734 , 736  (9th Cir. 2010) .  To continue \nwith the false advertis ing scenario , an example of a  fail-safe class would be all persons who \nbought a product that the defendant “falsely advertised.”  See Brazil v. Dell, Inc. , 585 F. Supp. 2d \n1158 , 1167  (N.D.  Cal. 2008) .  This example illustrates a fundamental problem with a fail -safe \nclass:   To determine class membership, “it would be necessary for the court to reach a legal \ndetermination that [the defendant]  had falsely advertised .”  Id.  This approach is unmanageable \nand improper because courts may not “engage in free -rangi ng merits inquiries at the certification \nstage.”  Amgen Inc. v. Conn. Ret. Plans & Tr. Funds , 568 U.S. 455, 466 (2013); see also Kamar , \n375 F. App’x at 736.   \nHere, Google  is correct that the class definition is fail -safe because “Plaintiffs have tied \nclass membership to the prima facie elements of their [copyright] infringement claims .”  Mot. at \n11.  Specifically, the class is defined to include only those persons who  “own a valid copyright \nregistration” for one or more works that “were infringed upon” by Google “without license or \nauthorization.”  Compl. ¶ 164.  Therefore, the Court cannot determine who is a member of the \nclass without deciding  the merits of each potential  class member’s claim, including  whether  the \npotential class member has a valid copyright registration, whether Google infringed the class \nmember’s work(s), and whether Google has a valid defense based on fair use or license (among \nother possible defenses).  Plaintiffs do not meaningfull y dispute that they have proposed an \nimproper fail -safe class definition.  See Opp. at 10, ECF No. 105.  Indeed, Plaintiffs proposed \nstipulations to amend the class definition to cure these issues.  See Mullens Decl. Exs. A & B.  Case 5:23-cv-03440-EKL     Document 128     Filed 04/21/25     Page 4 of 9 \n5 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  Because Plaintiffs’  fail-safe class definition is  defective as a matter of law, it is appropriate \nto strike it at the pleading stage.  See Olean Wholesale Grocery Coop ., v. Bumble Bee Foods LLC , \n31 F.4th 651 , 669 n.14  (9th Cir. 2022)  (en banc) (holding  that a fail -safe class is impermissible).2  \nCourts frequently strike fail-safe class definitions.  See, e.g. , Salaiz v. eHealthInsurance Servs ., \nInc., No.  22-cv-04835 -BLF, 2023 WL 2622138 , at *2, *5  (N.D. Cal. Mar. 22, 2023) ; Dixon v. \nMontreal Fin . Servs ., Inc., No. 15-cv-03298 -MMC, 2016 WL 3456680 , at *4 -5 (N.D. Cal. June \n24, 2016) ; Winters v. Loan Depot LLC , No. CV-20-01290 -PHX -SPL, 2022 WL 22865378 , at *7 -8 \n(D. Ariz. Mar. 17, 2022) .   \nHowever, a class “may be redefined” to resolve the fail -safe issue.  Olney v. Job.com, Inc. , \nNo. 12-cv-01724 -LJO, 2013 WL 5476813 , at *11  (E.D. Cal. Sept. 30, 2013) .  Here, the issue can \nbe resolved  by adopting  the class definition that Plaintiffs proposed in their stipulations .  The new \nclass definition would  include:  “ All persons or entities domiciled in the United States who owned \na United States  copyright in any work used by Google to train Google’s Generative AI Models \nduring  the Class Period. ”  Redef ining the class in this manner is appropriate because  class \nmembership can be determined according to objective criteria – that is, ownership of a \ncopyright ed work that was used by Google to train its generative AI models .  Membership in \nPlaintiffs’ new class definition would  not require  an upfront determination by the Court that each  \npotential class member will prevail on the merits of an infringement claim.  See Kamar , 375 \nF. App’x  at 736.  \nGoogle does not dispute that Plaintiffs’ new class definition would cure the fail -safe issues \nthat it identified.  Instead, Google argues that the Court should not grant leave to amend because \nPlaintiffs  failed to  show good cause, and  because  the new class can not be certified as \n \n2 Plaintiffs cite Tinnin v. Sutter Medical Foundation  for the proposition that “the procedural \nmechanism of a motion to strike is not the appropriate means for addressing a fail -safe problem.”  \n647 F. Supp. 3d 864, 874 (E.D. Cal. 2022).  The court’s conclusion in Tinnin was based on the \npremise that “the Ninth Circuit has not expressly forbidden fail safe classes.”  Id.  However, the \nNinth Circuit recently clarified in an en banc opinion that fail -safe classes are improper.  Olean \nWholesale , 31 F.4th at 669 n.14.  Accordingly, the Court does not conclude that a motion to strike \nis a categorically improper mechanism for challenging a fail -safe class definition.  However, the \nCourt agrees with Tinnin ’s ultimate holding that fail -safe class definitions should be cured, where \npossible, by redefining the class.  See Tinnin , 647 F. Supp. 3d at 874 -75. Case 5:23-cv-03440-EKL     Document 128     Filed 04/21/25     Page 5 of 9 \n6 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  individualized issues will predominate over common ones.  See Reply at 6 -9.  The Court addresses \nthese arguments in turn.  \nAs to the timeliness of amendment, Google is correct that the deadline to amend the \ncomplaint was December 20, 2024 .  Case Mgmt. & Sched. Order at 2, ECF No. 88.  But Plaintiffs \nare not asking the Court to modify the case schedule.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 16(b)(4) (“A schedule \nmay be modified only for good cause and with the judge’s consent.”).  Rather, in response to a \nRule 12 motion, Plaintiffs are asking the Court not to strike their class allegations with prejudice \nbecause the fail -safe issues can be cured  by amendment.  Courts typically  grant leave to amend \nfail-safe class definitions if amendment could cure the fail -safe issue.  Indeed, in most of the cases \ncited by Google , courts  granted leave to  amend .3  See also Lopez v. Smith , 203 F.3d  at 1127 .  And, \nimportantly , this is not the type of amendment  that injects new issues, claims, or parties into the \nlitigation.   Instead, Plaintiffs are seeking to revert to a class definition that is substantially the \nsame as the ones in the prior Leovy  and Zhang  complaints, which Google did not challenge.  \nAs to Google’s argument that the new class could never be certified, this argument is \nraised prematurely.  Google argues that copyright “ claims are not suitable  for class -action \ntreatment because their individualized nature presents  ‘overwhelming problems  with commonality \nand predominance that in themselves bar certification .’”  Mot. at 15 (quoting Schneider v. \nYouTube, LLC , 674 F. Supp. 3d 704, 718 (N.D. Cal. 2023) ).  But the cases Google cites for this \nproposition are all class certification decisions  – and th ey do not hold that class certification is \nimpossible in a copyright case.  See Schneider , 674 F. Supp. 3d at 717 (“This is not to say that \ncertification of a copyright infringement class is per se impossible.”); see also Kihn v. Bill Graham \nArchives LLC , No. 20 -17397, 2022 WL 18935 , at *1  (9th Cir. Jan. 3, 2022)  (reversing class \ncertification order); Football Ass’n Premier League v.

May \n20, 2013)  (denying as premature  a motion to strike class allegations in  a copyright case).4  Google \ncan renew its arguments in opposition to Plaintiffs’ forthcoming motion for class certification.  \nAccordingly, the Court GRANTS Google’s motion to strike  the class definition with leave \nto amend consistent with the discussion above.  \nB. Bifurcation of Discovery  \nGoogle argues that, if the Court grants leave to amend the class definition, the Court \n“should stay discovery unrelated to class certification until that issue is decided, absent a showing \nof good cause.”  Mot. at 17.  In effect, Google is asking the Court to bifurcate discovery into class \nand merits stages.  “The decision to bifurcate discovery in putative class actions prior to \ncertification is committed to the discretion of the trial court.”  True Health Chiropractic Inc v. \nMcKesson Corp., No. 13 -cv-0221 9-JST, 2015 WL 273188, at *1 (N.D. Cal. Jan. 20, 2015)  (citing \nDel Campo v. Kennedy , 236 F.R.D. 454, 459 (N.D. Cal. 2006)) . \nGoogle’s request to stay non-class discovery is  based on its view that a class cannot be \ncertified in this action, a nd on  Plaintiffs’ alleged overreaching in discovery.  See Mot.  at 7, 17.  \nGoogle’s conviction that it will prevail at class certification is not a sound basis for the Court to \npartition or preemptively limit discovery.  However, the Court understands Google’s concern  \nregarding overbroad and aimless discovery.  In all cases, d iscovery is subject to reasonable \nlimitations, and this case is no different.  Google’s concer ns can be adequately resolved through \n \n4 Google argues that certain aspects of the named Plaintiffs’ claims reveal that individualized \nissues will predominate.  Mot. at 6 -7.  For example, Google argues that “[d]iscovery and summary \njudgment briefing will show” that all three of the copyrighted w orks asserted by Plaintiff Mike \nLemos were licensed by Google, thus barring his claims.  Id. at 6.  Google also argues that one of \nthe works asserted by Plaintiff Steve Almond was previously published, and that this issue and \nothers “will need to be investigated.”  Id. at 6 -7.  These arguments confirm  that discovery is \nneeded to probe whether individualized issues will predominate in this case , and that striking the \nclass allegations without leave to amend  would be premature .  Plaintiffs should account for \nGoogle’s arguments when preparing their class certification motion.   Case 5:23-cv-03440-EKL     Document 128     Filed 04/21/25     Page 7 of 9 \n8 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  the normal means for resolving discovery disputes.  T o the extent the parties disagree on discovery \nmatters, they shall engage in substantial, good  faith meet -and-confer efforts to resolve their \ndisputes without judicial intervention.  If these efforts fail, the parties shall promptly present their \ndisputes to Judge van Keulen, consistent with Judge van Keulen’s standing orders.  \nThe Court takes no position on the reasonableness of Plaintiffs’ discovery requests, but \nreminds the parties of the Court’s prior instructions regarding discovery.  At the case management \nconference, the Court instructed Plaintiffs to focus their initial discovery efforts on information \nthat is necessary for class certification.  12/18/24 Tr. 21:19 -21, ECF No. 93.  The Court set an \nAugust 8, 2025 deadline for Plaintif fs to move for class certification, reflecting a compromise \nbetween the approaches proposed  by the parties.  This deadline provides Plaintiffs  enough time for \ndiscovery to support their motion for class certification if discovery is focused and if the parties \nare diligent  and reasonable .  Given that Plaintiffs will have eight months for discovery prior to \nfiling their class certification motion,  and considering that the original complaint was filed 20 \nmonths ago, the Court will not extend the class certification deadlines  absent good cause.  The \nCourt will not find good cause for an extension if the record reflects Plaintiffs’  failure to prioritize \nand diligently advance discovery on issues relevant to class certification.    \nC. Admonishment  \nBased on the record before the Court, it appears that Plaintiffs did not fully comply with \nthe Court’s Order to “ disclose all . . . new allegations not included in either the Leovy  second \namended complaint or the Zhang  complaint ” prior to filing the consolidated amended complaint.  \nSee Order Re: Consolidation Plan at 2.  Google attests that Plaintiffs did not disclose “any \nintention to significantly alter their proposed class definition or to propose a fail -safe class ,” and \nthat Google  “had no idea that Pla intiffs were contemplating such changes. ”  Sampson Decl. \n¶¶ 6-7, ECF No. 112.  Plaintiffs attest that they informed Google “ that the class definition would \nbe amended to reflect consolidation of the Leovy  and Zhang  matters. ”  Mullens Decl. ¶ 3.  \nHowever, Plaintiffs’ counsel does not represent that any specific amendments were disclosed – \nand in any event, the problematic amendments to the class definition were not necessitated by \nconsolidation of the two actions.  Thus , it appears that P laintiffs’ insufficient disclosure Case 5:23-cv-03440-EKL     Document 128     Filed 04/21/25     Page 8 of 9 \n9 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  contributed in part to unnecessary motion practice.

However, Plaintiffs offered a reasonable stipulation to cure the fail -safe class \ndefinition.  Plaintiffs’ belated gesture does not excuse th eir inadequate disclosures during the \nmeet -and-confer process.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: The court case involves plaintiffs Ron and Doris Golan alleging that multiple defendants, including Veritas Entertainment and Michael Huckabee, violated the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA) by making unsolicited prerecorded telemarketing calls to promote the film \"Last Ounce of Courage.\" The court denied motions to dismiss from some defendants, finding sufficient allegations for potential vicarious liability but granted a dismissal for Huckabee, finding insufficient allegations against him for direct or vicarious liability.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the defendants can be held directly or vicariously liable under the TCPA for unsolicited prerecorded telemarketing calls made by a third-party telemarketer, ccAdvertising.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court denied motions to dismiss filed by Mission City Management and Courage 2012, as the allegations suggested sufficient involvement and potential vicarious liability. The motion by James Leininger, involved in editing and approving the telemarketing script, was also denied. However, Michael Huckabee's motion was granted as the court found insufficient allegations to hold him liable under the TCPA.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine you get a bunch of annoying phone calls trying to get you to see a movie, even though you never said it was okay. The people who made the movie used a fancy robot calling system to do it. You're mad and want to blame a few people, including someone famous who helped make the calls. The court decides some folks might be in trouble for letting or helping the calls happen, but the famous person didn't do enough to get in real trouble.",

Leininger’s Motion to Dismiss Second Amended Complaint [ECF No. 88] and \nDefendant Michael D. Huckabee’s Motion to Dismiss Second Amended Complaint [ECF No. \n90]. \nI. BACKGROUND  \n Plaintiffs Ron Golan and Doris Golan (“Plaintiffs”) initiated this lawsuit by filing a \npetition in the Circuit Court of St. Louis County on October 3, 2012.  On D ecember 4, 2013, \nPlaintiffs filed an amended class action petition claiming violations of the Missouri No Call List, \nMo. Rev. Statute § 407.1095 -407.1110, and the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (“TCPA”), \n47 U.S.C. § 227, et seq ., against Defendants Veri tas Entertainment, LLC, Veritas Marketing, \nLLC, Freeeats.com, Inc., AIC Communications, LLC, Joseph S. Gabriel, III, Mission City \nManagement, LLC, Courage 2012, LLC, James R. Leininger, Sixdi, Inc., Bob Brewer, and \nMichael Dale Huckabee.  On January 15, 20 14, Defendants removed the action to the United \nStates District Court for the  Eastern District of Missouri.  T he Court dismissed Plaintiffs’ Case: 4:14-cv-00069-ERW   Doc. #:  120   Filed: 03/08/16   Page: 1 of 13 PageID #:\n <pageID>2 \n Amended Class Action  Petition  for lack of Article III standing.  On June 8, 2015, the Eighth \nCircuit Court of Appea ls reversed this Court’s dismissal and remanded for further proceedings. \nOn August 6, 2015, Plaintiffs filed a Second Amended Class Action Complaint asserting only \nTCPA claims .  Defendants Mission City Management, Inc. (“M ission City ”), Courage 2012, \nLLC ( “Courage  2012 ”), James R. Leininger (“Leininger”), and Michael Dale Huckabee \n(“Huckabee”) filed the pending Motions to Dismiss for failure to allege facts to establish direct \nor vicarious liability under the TCPA.  For the purposes of these Motion s, the Court accepts as \ntrue the following facts alleged in Plaintiff’s complaint.  Great Rivers Habitat Alliance v. Fed. \nEmergency Mgmt. Agency , 615 F.3d 958, 988 (8th Cir. 2010).  \n “Last Ounce of Courage” is a movie that opened nationwide on September 14,  2012.  \nVeritas Entertainment, LLC (“Veritas Entertainment”) helped produce the movie which was \noriginally owned by Eastern Gate Films, LLC .  Veritas Entertainment provided capital in \nexchange for an equity interest in the movie.  Stephen Wayne Griffin (“G riffin”) is the \npresident/CEO of Veritas Entertainment and Veritas Marketing, LLC (“Veritas Marketing”).  \nGriffin and his associated entities came to own a 49 percent interest in the movie.  Mission City  \nalso made an investment of $10,000,000 to market the  movie.  In 2012, Courage  2012  was \nformed as a company and took ownership of the film along with M ission City  and Veritas \nEntertainment.  This movie was the only movie Veritas Marketing ever marketed.   \n Leininger  is a manager of M ission City  who introduced Griffin to Gabriel S. Joseph, III \n(Joseph), the sole officer and director of FreeEats.com, Inc. which does business as \nccAdvertising.  He is also the sole member of AIC Communications, LLC which does business \nas ccAdvertising as well.  Joseph made a P ower Point pitch to Griffin about how to promote the \nmovie effectively  which  included the use of telemarketing.  In emails to Griffin, Joseph carbon Case: 4:14-cv-00069-ERW   Doc. #:  120   Filed: 03/08/16   Page: 2 of 13 PageID #:\n <pageID>3 \n copied Leininger, and stated “Dr. Jim can engage as needed.”  Leininger also introduced Griffin \nto Huckabee , a radio talk show host and former governor of Arkansas.  In June or July 2012, \nGriffin and Leininger screened “Last Ounce of Courage ” at Huckabee’s home in Florida.   \n  The advertising campaign for the movie included approximately four million telephone \ncalls to residential telephone numbers throughout the United States and “Email to Text (ETT) \nMessages” to thirty million cell phones.  Defendants participated in this scheme with full \nknowledge the telephone calls were prerecorded an d would play when a recipient or their \nvoicemail picked up the phone.  Defendants actively participated in developing the idea the calls \nwould appear as surveys to recipients about traditional American values and told recipients if \nthey believed in freedom  and liberty, they would enjoy the movie.  Joseph referred to the phone \ncalls as “Artificial Intelligence Call s” or “AIC” calls.  The technology worked like a “logic tree,” \naccording to Joseph, where a recipient’s yes or no response would dictate the next p rerecorded \nquestion.  \n ccAdvertising prepared the initial script for the telephone calls. Joseph emailed the script \nto Griffin and asked for him to review it and get back with any comments as soon as possible.  \nHuckabee was given authority to review, edit, and make changes to the script.  On September 4, \n2012, Huckabee  recorded the script and made changes to it  by adding  large unscripted sections to \nthe prerecorded message.  At that time, he knew this recording would be played for \ntelemarketing purposes.   Huckabee  wanted the calls to be made so his radio show would be \nadvertised.  He helped and encouraged the phone calls to be made and did not object to them.  \nLeininger was given authority to, and did review and modify the contents of the  calls.  He \nwas also given au thority to determine when the four million calls would be made.  Leininger \nexercised this authority.  On September 6, 2012, Joseph sent Leininger a test call of the Case: 4:14-cv-00069-ERW   Doc. #:  120   Filed: 03/08/16   Page: 3 of 13 PageID #:\n <pageID>4 \n prerecorded message.  Leininger liked the call and script , but directed it to be shorter, to  skip the \nquestions between Segment 2 and Segment 5.  Leininger wanted to get people to the movie \npermission segment.  With these specific directions and changes, Leininger authorized the calls \nto be made.  Joseph implemented Leininger’s changes and the ca lls were placed.  Leininger \nwanted the calls to be made because he had invested in the movie through his companies.  \nIn a September 14, 2012, email concerning payment for the telemarketing campaign, \nJoseph threatened to shut down the marketing campaign stat ing “please let me know if I need to \nengage Dr. Jim in this to make sure he has provided you the monies you need to pay \nccAdvertising.”  \nSince 2010, Plaintiffs have been accountholders of the residential telephone number \n(636) 812 -2121.  This number has be en registered on the federal Do Not Call List since March 7, \n2012.  Plaintiffs did not consent to receive any phone calls from Defendants.  On September 10 \nand 12, 2012, ccAdvertising initiated calls to Plaintiffs’ residential phone number using \nHuckabee’s  pre-recorded voice to deliver a message encouraging Plaintiffs to see the movie.  \nPlaintiffs received two of these phone calls.  The phone number calling Plaintiffs was 202 -769-\n1087 which appeared as “2012FREERSRCH” on their caller ID.  Plaintiffs did not  state a desire \nto receive these calls.  \nPlaintiffs allege the named defendants violated section 227(b)(1)(B) of the TCPA, which, \nwith certain exceptions, prohibits  persons from initiating calls to residential telephone lines using \na prerecorded voice to deliver a message without the called party’s prior express consent.  \nDefendants, in their separate Motions to Dismiss, assert the Amended Complaint fails to state a \nclaim, pursuant to FRCP 12(b)(6), because it does not allege facts to establish direct or vicarious \nliability.  Case: 4:14-cv-00069-ERW   Doc. #:  120   Filed: 03/08/16   Page: 4 of 13 PageID #:\n <pageID>5 \n II.  STANDARD  \nUnder Federal Rule of Civil Procedure ( “FRCP ”) 12(b)(6), a party may move to dismiss \na claim for “failure to state a claim upon wh ich relief can be granted.”  The notice pleading \nstandard of FRCP 8(a)(2) requires a plaintiff to give “a short and plain statement showing that \nthe pleader is entitled to relief.”  To meet this standard and to survive a FRCP 12(b)(6) motion to \ndismiss, “a  complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to state a claim to \nrelief that is plausible on its face.”  Ashcroft v. Iqbal , 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) (internal \nquotations and citation omitted).  This requirement of facial plausibilit y means the factual \ncontent of the plaintiff’s allegations must “allow[] the court to draw the reasonable inference that \nthe defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.”  Cole v. Homier Distrib. Co. , 599 F.3d 856, \n861 (8th Cir. 2010) (quoting  Iqbal , 556 U.S. at 678).  The Court must grant all reasonable \ninferences in favor of the nonmoving party.  Lustgraaf v. Behrens , 619 F.3d 867, 872 -73 (8th \nCir. 2010).  Ordinarily, only the facts alleged in the complaint are considered for purposes of a \nmotion to di smiss; however, materials attached to the complaint may also be considered in \nconstruing its sufficiency.  Reynolds v. Dormire , 636 F.3d 976, 979 (8th Cir. 2011).  \nWhen ruling on a motion to dismiss, a court Amust liberally construe a complaint in favor \nof the plaintiff[.] @  Huggins v. FedEx Ground Package Sys., Inc. , 592 F.3d 853, 862 (8th Cir. \n2010).  However, if a claim fails to allege one of the elements necessary to recovery on a legal \ntheory, that claim must be dismissed for failure to state a claim up on which relief can be granted.  \nCrest Constr. II, Inc. v. Doe , 660 F.3d 346, 355 (8th Cir. 2011).  AThreadbare recitals of a cause \nof action, supported by mere conclusory statements, do not suffice. @   Iqbal , 556 U.S. at 678;  Bell \nAtlantic v. Twombly , 550  U.S. 544, 555 (2007).  Although courts must accept all factual \nallegations as true, they are not bound to take as true Aa legal conclusion couched as a factual Case: 4:14-cv-00069-ERW   Doc. #:  120   Filed: 03/08/16   Page: 5 of 13 PageID #:\n <pageID>6 \n allegation. @ Twombly , 550 U.S. at 555 (internal quotations and citation omitted); Iqbal , 556 U.S. \nat 677 -78.    \nIII.  DISCUSSION  \n The moving Defendants contend Plaintiffs fail to allege sufficient facts showing \nDefendants  either initiated the calls, or are vicariously liable for ccAdvertising’s calls.  They \ncontend the Amended Complaint fails to p lead sufficient facts to support Plaintiffs’  apparent \nauthority agency, ratification , and impermissible delegation of duty  theories, and more \nspecifically, they argue the Complaint fails to sufficiently plead they controlled the manner and \nmeans of the cal ls.  Defendants claim editing a scri pt and investing in a movie do  not create \nvicarious liability.  \n In their responses in opposition to the Motions to Dismiss, Plaintiffs claim the moving \ndefendants invested in the project, directed what the advertisement  would say and when it was to \nbe played, controlled the finances of the project, encouraged the advertisement of the movie \nthrough the telemarketing, encouraged Huckabee to participate, and reviewed and edited the \nscript for the telephone calls.  Plaintiff s also assert Defendants ratified ccAdvertising’s conduct.  \n The TCPA prohibits the initiation of a telephone call to a residential telephone line which \nuses a prerecorded voice without prior consent from the call receiver, with some exceptions.  47 \nU.S.C. § 227(b)(1)(B).  The Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) is the agency \ngranted law -making, law -enforcing, and interpretative authority over the TCPA.  See Chevron, \nUSA, Inc. v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc. , 467 U.S. 837, 843 -44 (1984); 47 U.S.C. § § \n227(b)(2), 227(c)(1), 227(c)(2), 227(g)(3); 22 FCC Rcd. 19896 (Nov. 9, 2007); 20 FCC Rcd. \n18272 (Nov. 23, 2005).  On May 9, 2013, upon referral of a case by the Sixth Circuit, the FCC \nissued a Declaratory Ruling on the issue of “on behalf of ” liability under section 227(c) of the Case: 4:14-cv-00069-ERW   Doc. #:  120   Filed: 03/08/16   Page: 6 of 13 PageID #:\n <pageID>7 \n TCPA.  In the Matter of the Joint Petition filed by Dish Network, LLC, et al. , 28 F.C.C.R. 6574, \n2013 WL 1934349 (F.C.C. May 9, 2013).  In this ruling, the FCC also considered vicarious \nliability of sellers for violations of 47 U.S.C. § 227(b).  Id.  Thus, this Court is able to consider \nthe pending motions with the benefit of the FCC’s guidance.   The statute is silent on many of the \nterms and conclusions made in the FCC ’s guidance and the Court believes the FCC guidance \nvastly expan ds the wording of 47 U.S.C. § 227.    \n “[A] seller does not generally ‘initiate’ calls made through a third -party telemarketer \nwithin the meaning of the TCPA[.]” In the Ma tter of the Joint Petition filed by Dish Network, \nLLC, et al. , 28 F.C.C.R. at 6574.  Therefore, a seller is not directly liable for a TCPA violation \nunless it initiates  the call.  Id. at 6582.  Nor is an action taken for the benefit of a seller by a third -\nparty, without more, sufficient to trigger the liability of a seller under section 227(b).  Id. at 6593.  \nIn addition to the TCPA’s provision making it unlawful, absent prior express consent by the call \nrecipient, for a person to initiate telephone calls to re sidential telephone lines using artificial or \nprerecorded voices to deliver messages, the FCC’s do -not-call rules also make it unlawful for \nany person or entity to initiate telephone solicitations to residential telephone subscribers who \nhave registered th eir telephone numbers with the national do -not-call registry.  Id. at 6582 -83.   \n Nevertheless, a seller that is not directly liable may be held vicariously liable under \nfederal common law principles of agency for violations of section 227(b) by a third -party \ntelemarketer.  Id.  A formal agency relationship is not required to establish a seller’s vicarious \nliability for the illegal acts of a third -party telemarketer; plaintiffs can also employ principles of \nratification and apparent authority in pursuing TC PA claims.  Id. at 6586 -87.  Federal common \nlaw is in accordance with the Restatement of Agency.  Opp v. Wheaton Van Lines, Inc. , 231 F.3d \n1060, 1064 (7th Cir. 2000).   Case: 4:14-cv-00069-ERW   Doc. #:  120   Filed: 03/08/16   Page: 7 of 13 PageID #:\n <pageID>8 \n  “[A]pparent authority to do an act is created as to a third person by written or spoke n \nwords or any other conduct of the principal which, reasonably interpreted, causes the third \nperson to believe that the principal consents to have the act done on his behalf by the person \npurporting to act for him.”  Pinkham v. Sara Lee Corp ., 983 F.2d 82 4, 830 (8th Cir. 1992) \n(quoting Restatement (Second) of Agency § 27 (1957)); see also Restatement (Third) Agency § \n2.03 (apparent authority is the power held by agent or other actor to affect principal’s legal \nrelations with third parties when third party reasonably believes actor has authority to act on \nprincipal’s behalf and belief is traceable to principal’s manifestations); Restatement (Third) \nAgency § 1.03 (person manifests assent or intention through written or spoken words or other \nconduct).   \n In its Declaratory Ruling, the FCC provided illustrative examples of evidence that could \ndemonstrate a telemarketer is a “seller’s authorized representative with apparent authority to \nmake the seller vicariously liable for the telemarketer’s section 227(b) viol ations.”  In the Matter \nof the Joint Petition filed by Dish Network, LLC, et al. , 28 F.C.C.R. at 6592.  The examples \nincluded evidence showing: 1) the seller allows the telemarketer access to information and \nsystems that normally would be within the seller ’s exclusive control; 2) the ability by the \ntelemarketer to enter consumer information into the seller’s sales or customer systems; 3) the \nauthority by the telemarketer to use the seller’s trade name, trademark, and service mark; and 4) \nthe seller approved , wrote, or reviewed the telemarketing scripts.  Id.  The FCC also opined:  \na seller would be responsible under the TCPA for the unauthorized conduct of a \nthird -party telemarketer that is otherwise authorized to market on the seller’s \nbehalf if the seller knew (or reasonably should have known) that the telemarketer \nwas violating the TCPA on the seller’s behalf and the seller failed to take \neffective steps within its power to force the telemarketer to cease that conduct.  Case: 4:14-cv-00069-ERW   Doc. #:  120   Filed: 03/08/16   Page: 8 of 13 PageID #:\n <pageID>9 \n Id.  The FCC concluded, “At a minimum , evidence of these kinds of relationships . . . should be \nsufficient to place upon the seller the burden of demonstrating that a reasonable consumer would \nnot sensibly assume that the telemarketer was acting as the seller’s authorized agent.”  \n Ratificatio n is “the affirmance by a person of a prior act that did not bind him but which \nwas d one or professedly done on his account, whereby the act, as to some or all persons, is given \neffect as if originally authorized by him.”  BE&K Const. Co. v. N.L.R.B. , 23 F .3d 1459, 1466 \n(8th Cir. 1994) (quoting Serv. Emp. Union, Local 87 (W. Bay Maint.) , 291 NLRB 83, 1988 WL \n214072 (1988)).  Affirmance is either: “(a) a manifestation of an election by one on whose \naccount an unauthorized act has been done to treat the act a s authorized, or (b) conduct by him \njustifiable only if there were such an election.”  BE&K Const. , 23 F.3d at 1466 (citing section 83 \nof the Restatement (Second) of Agency).  “An affirmance of an unauthorized transaction can be \ninferred from a failure to repudiate it.”  Id. (quoting § 94 of the Restatement).  The Restatement \n(Third) of Agency defines ratification as “the affirmance of a prior act done by another, whereby \nthe act is given effect as if done by an agent acting with actual authority” Restateme nt (Third) of \nAgency § 4.01(1).  “A person ratifies an act by (a) manifesting assent that the act shall affect the \nperson’s legal relations, or (b) conduct that justifies a reasonable assumption that the person so \nconsents.”  Res tatement (Third) of Agency § 4.01(2).  \n A.  Mission City and Courage 2012  \n Mission City and Courage 2012 assert Plaintiffs’ claims must be dismissed because their \nallegations do not establish direct or vicarious liability.  I n their Amended Complaint, Plaintiffs \nallege defendant ccAd vertising, operated by defendant Joseph, “obtained the telephone numbers \ncalled” and initiated the calls.  Plaintiffs do not allege Mission City or Courage 2012 initiated the Case: 4:14-cv-00069-ERW   Doc. #:  120   Filed: 03/08/16   Page: 9 of 13 PageID #:\n <pageID>10 \n calls.  Therefore, they cannot be directly liable for the TCPA violation.  The Court will consider \nwhether the facts support  a theory of vicarious liability against M ission City and Courage 2012 .   \n  To succeed against the mo ving defendants on their vicarious liability theory, Plaintiffs \nmust demonstrate the initiator of the telemarketing campaign, ccAdvertising , acted as  an agent  of \nMission City or Courage 2012.  Plaintiff ’s Amended Complaint must allege facts showing \nccAdvertising acted in a fashion so a third party could reasonably believe ccAdver tising ’s \nactions would be traceable to Miss ion City, Courage 2012, and Leininger.   See Thomas v. Taco \nBell Corp. , 879 F.Supp.2d 1079, 1084 -85 (S.D. Cal. June 25, 2012).   \n Plaintiffs allege the following in their Amended Complaint in regards to Courage 2012 \nand Mission City.  Courage 2012 is a Texas limited liability company formed in 2012, Mission \nCity is a Texas corporation, and Leininger is a manager of Mission City.  Missio n City made an \ninvestment of $10,000,000 to market “Last Ounce of Courage”; and Mission City, Courage 2012 \nand Veritas Entertainment became owners of the film in 2012.  Leininger introduced  Griffin to \nJoseph and Huckabee,  and was present at the screening o f “Last Ounce of Courage” at \nHuckabee’s home.  Joseph copied Leininger on an email communication  and Joseph sent \nLeininger a test call of the prerecorded call to review .  Leininger suggested the script be shorter \nand go direc tly from Segment 2 to Segment 5  and after the changes were made, Leininger \nauthorized the calls to be made.   \n Based on these allegations, the Court finds the Amended Complaint contains sufficient \nallegations to avoid dismissal at this st age of the case. Leininger ’s review, editing and approval \nof telemarketing scripts is persuasive evidence for Plaintiffs.  See In the Matter of the Joint \nPetition filed by Dish Network, LLC, et al. , 28 F.C.C .R. at 6592.   \n Case: 4:14-cv-00069-ERW   Doc. #:  120   Filed: 03/08/16   Page: 10 of 13 PageID #:\n <pageID>11 \n  B. James Leininger   \n Leininger asserts the Amended Complaint must be dismissed as to claims asserted against \nhim because it does not allege facts to establish his individual liability for a corporation’s acts.  \nFurther, he argues there is no a gency relationship between him and the telemarketers.   \nNumerous district courts have held corporate actors m ay be individually liable for a TCPA \nviolation where they “had direct, personal participation in or personally authorized the conduct \nfound to have violated the statute.”   Ott v. Mortg. Inv’rs Corp. of Ohio, Inc. , 65 F.Supp.3d 1046, \n1060 (D. Ore. 2014) (qu oting Sandusky Wellness Center, LLC v. Wagner Wellness, Inc. , No. \n3:12-CV-2257, 2014 WL 1333472 at *3 (N.D. Ohio Mar. 28, 2014)) (listing district courts \naround the country who have held an individual must have direct, personal participation or \nauthorizati on to be liable.).  Here, Plaintiffs have alleged Leininger  authorized the calls to be \nmade .  Leininger was a prime participant in arranging for the script  to be written, he traveled \nextensively to assure the script was  produced and he solicited Michael Huckabee to contribute  \nthe voice addition.  Defendant  Leininger ’s motion to dismiss will be denied.  \n C. Michael Huckabee  \nHuckabee also moves for dismissal, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), \ncontending the Amended Complaint fails to state a claim agains t him for violation of the TCPA .  \nHuckabee contends the Amended Complaint only alleges he recorded the call script, “using his \nown voice,”  and made edits to the script.  He  argues that merely serving as the “celebrity voice” \nof the prerecorded message, wit hout more, is insufficient to impute liability to him.  Huckabee \nalso asserts there is no agency relationship between him and ccAdvertising.  \n Plaintiffs argue Huckabee changed the script, inserted advertisements for his radio show, \nand made the recording which was used to make the telemarking calls. They assert Huckabee Case: 4:14-cv-00069-ERW   Doc. #:  120   Filed: 03/08/16   Page: 11 of 13 PageID #:\n <pageID>12 \n started as an agent and became a principal when he changed the script and inserted his \nadvertisement for his radio show.  Further, Plaintiffs contend Huckabee is liable under a theory \nof ratification because he knew the material facts of the telemarketing campaign, wanted it to \noccur for his own benefit, and his radio show benefited.    \n The Amended Complaint alleges the following pertinent facts as to Huckabee.  Leininger \nintroduced Griffin  to radio talk show host and former Arkansas governor, Huckabee, and in June \nor July 2012, Griffin went to Huckabee’s Florida home to screen “Last Ounce of Courage.”  \nHuckabee recorded the script for the calls on September 4, 2012, using his own voice.  Huckabee \nadded to and changed the message by adding large unscripted sections to the recording and \nadvertisements of his radio show which personally benefitted him.  Huckabee knew the \nrecording would be played for telemarketing purposes during telephone call s to consumers.   He \nwanted the calls to be made so his radio show would be advertised.    \nThe Court agrees Huckabee’s service as the “celebrity voice” of the prerecorded message  \nand his additions to the script , without more, are insuff icient to impute liability to him.  \nPlaintiffs’ argument Huckabee’s invitation for the call recipient to listen to his radio talk show \nprovided a personal benefit to him and thus constituted an act of ratification is unpersuasive, as \nthe FCC has determined  telephone messages inviting the recipient to listen to specific broadcasts \nare not unsolicited advertisements, and are exempt from the TCPA’s restrictions.  See Leyse v. \nClear Channel Broadcasting, Inc. , 545 Fed. App’x 444, 448 -451 (6th Cir. 2013).  The C ourt \nfinds the Amended Complaint does not allege facts that, accepted as true, would make Huckabee \nvicariously liable for the alleged vi olations of the TCPA .  The Court finds  the Amended \nComplaint fails to allege sufficient facts showing ccAdvertising  acted as an agent for Huckabee Case: 4:14-cv-00069-ERW   Doc. #:  120   Filed: 03/08/16   Page: 12 of 13 PageID #:\n <pageID>13 \n \nunder any of Plaintiffs’ theories of liability, including apparent authority or ratification.1  \nHuckabee did not make any of the calls, and he did not have the authority to control th e manner \nor means of the calls.  Therefore, the Court will dismiss the claims against Huckabee.   \n Accordingly,  \nIT IS HEREBY ORDERED  that Defendants Mission City Management, Inc. and \nCourage 2012, LLC’s Motion to Dismiss Second Amended Complaint [ECF No. 86] is \nDENIED . \n  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED  that Defendant James R. Leininger’s Motion to Dismiss \nSecond Amended Complaint [ECF No. 88] is DENIED . \n IT IS FURTHER ORDERED  that Defendant Michael D.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: The court denied American Medical Response, Inc.'s (AMR) motion to strike evidence provided by plaintiff Michael Mendell in a class action concerning unauthorized phone recordings. Mendell alleged that AMR breached the California Invasion of Privacy Act (CIPA) by recording conversations without consent. The court allowed AMR to file a sur-reply on class identification to address Mendell's proposed use of AI technology, IBM Watson, to transcribe and analyze call recordings for class action suitability.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether AMR unlawfully recorded conversations without consent, violating the California Invasion of Privacy Act, and if Mendell's proposed class identification method involving AI is reliable and permissible.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court denied AMR's motion to strike Mendell's evidence and allowed a sur-reply limited to addressing the proposed class identification method. This decision reflects a need to fairly consider new methodologies reliant on AI technologies in determining class action feasibility.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine getting a call from a company, and they record it without telling you. Mendell is saying this isn't okay under certain laws and wants to gather everyone this happened to into a group lawsuit. The tool he wants to use to find those people uses artificial intelligence to go through phone records faster. The company tried to block this tool by saying it wasn't introduced early enough in the case, but the judge says, \"Hold on, let's let them explain a little more about how this tool works.\"",

BACKGROUND  \nA. Mendell’s Motion to Certify Class and Hansen Declaration I  \n On June 5, 2020, Mendell moved to certify class.   (Mot. to Cert. Class, ECF No. 49.)   \nMendell proposed the following class definitions:  \nThe HIPAA Confidential Communication Class \nAll persons in California, that never called Defendant, whose first call from \nDefendant was recorded without their consent by Defendant and/or its agent/s \nfrom July 1, 2018 through July 31, 2019 (the date when AMR modified its \npractice to notify callers of recording at the outset of the call.)  \n \nThe Cellular Phone Communication Sub -Class \nAll persons in California, that never called Defendant, whose first call from \nDefendant to their cellular phone was recorded without their c onsent by \nDefendant and/or its agent/s from July 1, 2018 through July 31, 2019 (the date \nwhen AMR modified its practice to notify callers of recording at the outset of \nthe call.)  \n \n(Mot. to Cert. Class at 2:14 –25.)   \nMendell attached to his motion a declaration of his expert witness, Jeffrey A. \nHansen, dated June 4, 2020.  (Hansen Decl., “Hansen Decl. I,” ECF No. 49- 18.)  Hansen \nwas retained to analyze AMR’s phone call records to (1) identify and manage the class and \n(2) advise Plainti ff’s counsel on the capabilities of the software system used by AMR’s \nthird-party vendor, LiveVox, Inc., who managed the phone call records for AMR.  (Hansen \nDecl. I ¶ 7.)  Specifically, Hansen was retained to advise “ what types of   information and \nreports  regarding the makeup and identity of the class can be gleaned from the data \nmaintained by the LiveVox system.”  ( Id.)  Hansen stated that he was “extremely familiar \nwith the LiveVox system” and thus was qualified to advise Mendell about the system .1 \n \n1 Hansen stated in full:  \nI am extremely familiar with the LiveVox system and can provide advice and consultation \nregarding how the call detail records may be utilized to (1) identify the date of the call; (2) \nidentify the length of the call; (3) identify the phone number called; (4) identify whether \nthe phone number called is a cellular phone or landline phone; (5) identify if the area code \nfor the person called is a California area code; (6) identify wheth er the call was inbound or \noutbound; (7) identify whether outbound calls resulted in leaving a message or speaking Case 3:19-cv-01227-BAS-KSC   Document 74   Filed 02/02/21   PageID.<pageID>   Page 2 of 10 \n- 3 - \n19cv1227  1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 Hansen  proposed a  methodology to identify the class.  (Hansen Decl. I ¶¶ 14 –32.)  \nAt that time, LiveVox had not produced the call records  in response to Mendell’s subpoena .  \n(Id. ¶ 17.)   Hansen relied on his knowledge of the LiveVox system to state that the system \ncan generate a report with different fields that would allow him to identify “which of the \nCall Records were first time outbound calls, to patients that never called AMR, and identify \nthe subset of such first- time outbound calls to wireless numbers.”  (Id. ¶ 18.)  In addition,  \nHansen stated that he could supplement the class identification process by transcrib ing the \naudio recordings of the phone calls at issue,  using a tool  called IBM Watson .2 \n \nB. AMR’s Deposition of Hansen  \n On July 3, 2020 , AMR deposed Hansen.  (Ex. 20 to Def.’s Resp. in Opp., ECF No. \n60-1at 43–126.3)  AMR questioned  Hansen about his experience  in using IBM Watson.  \n \nwith a person; (8) identify whether a person to person conversation was a first time or \nsubsequent conversation. \n(Hansen Decl. I, ¶ 8.)  \n2 Hansen stated in full:  \nAt the same time, I will take all the mp3 audio files produced and have them electronically \ntranscribed through the use of an artificial intelligence engine, specifically employing IBM \nWatson. This will create a full transcription of all the call recordings. The transcriptions \nwill be loaded into a database and analyzed by automated searching for specific text such \nas “patient business services” or “customer care” or “recorded” etc. I can search all the \nrecordings for any term requested in a matter of seconds. I can group recordings by the \nname of the person called or the script that was used etc. Using the LiveVox report \ncontaining the original mp3 file name, the date, time, number called etc, I will link each \noutbound call transcript to the corresponding calls/entries on the report. Automated queries \ncan easily identify a list of calls which were the first call placed to a California area code \nand that list of calls can be analyzed systematically. Each identified call can be categorized \nby which script was used, if the recording warning was given and when. Calls that went to \nan answering machine or disconnected number for example can systematically be \nexcluded. Once this is complete, a full and accurate list of all class members will be \nidentified. A further analysis can be conducted, as described below, to separate calls to \nlandlines versus to cell phones. \n(Hansen Decl. I  ¶ 19.)  \n33 Defendant’s exhibits filed in support of its response in opposition are marked by multiple \npaginations. (ECF No. 60- 1.) All citations follow the page numbers that immediately follow the marker, \n“COMPENDIUM OF EVIDENCE REDACTED PAGE .” Case 3:19-cv-01227-BAS-KSC   Document 74   Filed 02/02/21   PageID.<pageID>   Page 3 of 10 \n- 4 - \n19cv1227  1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 (Id. at 67–71, 110– 16.)  AMR then asked Hansen about class identification, to which \nHansen testified, in releva nt part:  \n[T]he analysis is extremely simple.  Okay.   And that is that it has a date  and a \ntime. So I could create a query that says basically to identify all of those people \nthat received an outbound call where the word record never showed up within \nthe tr anscript and they never called, in [sic] they got on and made a recording \non an inbound call.  \n \n(Id. at 83.)  \n \nC. AMR’s Opposition to the Motion to Certify Class  \n On August 4, 2020, AMR filed  its response in opposition to Mendell’s motion to \ncertify class.  ( Def.’s Opp., ECF No. 60.)   \n \n1.   AMR’s Arguments  on C lass Identification  \nAMR argued  that the Court should deny Mendell’s motion for class certification \nbecause , among other reasons , Mendell had not set forth a feasible methodology to identify \nthe class.  AMR pointed out that three different versions of the standard opening script \nwere used by call representatives  during the relevant class period— July 1, 2018,  through \nJuly 31, 2019 —and that  more than one transcript was used during certain periods  within \nthe class period.  ( Def.’s Opp.,  at 5–6.)  The  first transcript (“PBS 1”) was used between \nJuly 1, 2018, and July 31, 2019; the second  (“PBS 2”) between July 15, 2018, and July 31, \n2018; and the third (“CC”) after April 2019.   (Id. at 5:13– 6:13.)    \nIn addition, AMR argued that “ short of deposing every class member, or engaging \nin additional burdensome discovery (including for non-party collection agencies), neither \nPlaintiff nor AMR can determine who is a member of the putative class. ”  (Opp.  at 32:22 –\n24.)  As a part of that argument, AMR pointed out that IBM Watson was not compliant \nwith the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act  (HIPAA) and thus could not \nbe utilized as proposed by Hansen.  ( Id. at 33:4– 9.)  AMR also pointed out that IBM Watson Case 3:19-cv-01227-BAS-KSC   Document 74   Filed 02/02/21   PageID.<pageID>   Page 4 of 10 \n- 5 - \n19cv1227  1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 was not a reliable tool to transcribe  the phone recordings due to the known  error rate and \nthat Hansen did not explain how such errors could be mitigated.  ( Id. at 33:10 –15.)  \n \n2. AMR’s Arguments on Adequac y of Class Representative  \n AMR argued that Mendell is not an adequate class representative because, among \nother reasons,  he has a pending state court action against AMR filed in July 2019 that arises \nfrom the same set of operative facts in the federal acti on.  (Opp. at 8:20 n.4, 31:11 –14.) \nBecause of the pending state court action between the same parties, AMR argued that \nMendell has a conflict of interest  and cannot be entrusted to litigate the putative class action \nin federal court as a class representative .   \n \nD. Mendell’s Reply  \n Mendell filed a reply in support of his motion to certify class.  ( Pl.’s Reply, \nECF No. 67.)   \n \n1. Mendell’s Arguments on Class Identification and Hansen \nDeclaration II  \n Mendell argued in his Reply that narrowing the class period can address any \nconcerns about the alleged overlap of the periods when the three transcripts  were used  \nbecause only PBS 2 was used between August 1, 2018, through March 31, 2019.  (Reply  \nat 3–4.)   Mendell also argued that it is feasible to identify the class members that fit the \ndefinition of the narrowed class and sub-class , relying on  a supplemental declaration of \nHansen, dated September 13, 2020.  ( Hansen Decl., “Hansen Decl. II, ” ECF No. 67- 5.)  By \nthat time, LiveVox had produced the call records data,  and Hansen’s supplemental \ndeclaration discussed how the class members can be identified using the LiveVox data.  \n// \n// \n//   Case 3:19-cv-01227-BAS-KSC   Document 74   Filed 02/02/21   PageID.<pageID>   Page 5 of 10 \n- 6 - \n19cv1227  1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 (Id. ¶¶ 6–42.)  Hansen set forth t he following  ten-step identification process:  \n[1]. Identify patient phone numbers associated with all AMR calls.  \n[2]. Identify the numbers with California area codes.  \n[3]. Identify dates of the calls.  \n[4]. Identify which calls were inbound and outbound.  \n[5]. Identify entries where the first call was an outbound call from AMR.  \n[6]. Remov e calls prior to August 1, 2018.  \n[7]. Remove calls after March 31, 2019.  \n[8]. Remove calls to a wrong numbers  [sic], third parties, calls that did not \nconnect, calls to answering machines or voicemail, to busy numbers, etc.  \n[9]. Identify which calls were to cell phones or land lines.  \n[10]. Identify which calls have recordings that were produced by AMR . \n \n(Id. ¶ 8). \n \n2. Mendell’s Arguments on Adequacy and the Shay Declaration  \n As to AMR’s argument that Mendell’s pending state court action create d a conflict \nof interest, Mendell argued that he had demonstrated his fidelity to the class by refusing \nAMR’s settlement offer that would have required him  to enter a “broad general release”  of \nthe class claims.   (Reply at 11 –19.)  Mendell attached the declaration of his counsel, Daniel \nShay, who stated the following as to AMR’ alleged actions in state court:  \n3. In addition to this class action, Plaintiff is pursuing an individual case in \nState Court against American Medical Response, Inc. (“Defendant”) for \nviolations of The Rosenthal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act Cal. Civ. Code \n§ 1788 et seq “(RFDCPA”) [sic].  \n4. On February 12, 2020, Plaintiff’s counsel served an Offer to Compromise \nPursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure § 998 in that State case . \n5. The offer was $1,000 statutory damages paid to Plaintiff plus fees and costs.  \n6. Defendant rejected that offer and insisted on a “broad general release” \nreleasing the claims in this class action as well.  \n7. To me, it seemed as though Defendant was attempting to force Plaintiff to \n“throw the class under the bus” so to speak by making him drop the putative \nclass action and release all his claims which would have meant the class would \nnot receive any benefit.  \n8. I think Defendant attempted to create and t ake advantage of a “conflict” \nand tried to trap Plaintiff so it could portray him as an inadequate class \nrepresentative.  Case 3:19-cv-01227-BAS-KSC   Document 74   Filed 02/02/21   PageID.<pageID>   Page 6 of 10 \n- 7 - \n19cv1227  1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 9. Defendant pressured Plaintiff to breach his fiduciary obligations to the class \nand solicited him to do so.  \n10. To this date, Plaintiff continues to rebuke Defendant’s coercion and has \nacted exactly as he should as a representative of a putative class.  \n \n (Shay Decl. ¶¶ 3– 10, ECF No. 67 -4.) \n \nE. AMR’s Motion to Strike Mendell’s Reply \n On October 1, 2020, AMR filed the present motion to strike Mendell’s evidence \nsubmitted on Reply, arguing that the supplemental declaration of Hansen should be stricken \nas untimely and that the Shay Declaration should be stricken as untimely and prejudicial.  \n(Mot. to Strike, ECF No. 70.)  Mendell filed a res ponse in opposition to the motion to strike \n(ECF No. 72) and AMR  filed a reply.  (ECF No. 73.)  The Court finds this motion suitable \nfor determination on the papers submitted and without oral argument.   See Civ. L.R. \n7.1(d)(1).   AMR’s motion to strike is r ipe for decision.   \n \nII. ANALYSIS  \nA. Hansen Supplemental Declaration  \nAMR argues that Mendell’s reply to the class certification motion “relies on a new \nand novel opinion” raised in the supplemental declaration of Hansen, in which “Hansen \n. . . opine [d] for the first time that class membership can purportedly be determined by a \nnew ‘ten (10) step process’ search from the LiveVox data produced.”  (Mot. to Strike at \n7:11–14.)  Under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure , “[a]ny affidavit supporting a motion \nmust be served with the motion.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 6(c)(2).  In addition, a  party’s reply brief \nfiled in support of the motion should be limited to matters raised in the opposition papers \nor unforeseen when the party f iled the original motion.  Townsend v. Monster Beverage \nCorp. , 303 F. Supp. 3d 1010, 1027 (C.D. Cal. 2018).    “‘New evidence submitted as part \nof a reply is improper’ because it does not allow the defendant an adequate opportunity to \nrespond.”  Id.  (citi ng Morris v. Guetta, No. LA CV12 -00684 JAK, 2013 WL 440127, at Case 3:19-cv-01227-BAS-KSC   Document 74   Filed 02/02/21   PageID.<pageID>   Page 7 of 10 \n- 8 - \n19cv1227  1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 *8 (C.D. Cal. Feb. 4, 2013)).  “ [T]he district court may decline to consider new evidence \nor arguments raised in reply, and generally ‘should not consider the new evidence without \ngiving the non -movant an opportunity to respond.’”  Id. (citing Provenz v. Miller, 102 F.3d \n1478, 1483 (9th Cir. 1996) ); see also Beaird v. Seagate Tech. , Inc. (10th Cir. 1998) 145 \nF3d 1159, 1164 –1165 (holding that “ when a moving party advances in a reply new reasons \nand evidence in support of its motion . . . , the nonmoving party should be granted an \nopportunity to respond ”).   \nHere,  Hansen’s initial declaration (Hansen Decl. I)  already stated that the phone \nrecords produced by LiveVox could be used to generate a repo rt with different fields to \nidentify “which of the Call Records were first time outbound calls, to patients that never \ncalled AMR, and identify the subset of such first-time outbound calls to wireless numbers.”  \n(Hansen Decl.  I ¶ 18.)  AMR had the opportun ity to depose Hansen about how he would \nuse the LiveVox phone records.  To the extent that the ten- step process t hat Hansen \narticulated in the supplemental declaration was presented to AMR for the first time , it was \nin response to AMR’s argument that Plain tiff’s proposed class identification procedure is \nnot feasible . “Evidence submitted in direct response to evidence raised in the opposition, . \n. ., is not ‘new.’”  In re ConAgra Foods, Inc. , 90 F.

App’x 654 (9th Cir. 2017).   \nFurther, because Mendell did not have access to the LiveVox call records at the time \nof his filing of the motion, Mendell did not exceed the permissible scope of the reply brief \nby attaching Hansen’s supplemental declaration discussing the details of the data that was \nmade available to Hansen.  See Townsend , 303 F. Supp. 3d at 1027 (holding that a party \ncould include in the reply brief matters that were unforeseen when the party filed the \noriginal motion).  Therefore, the Court denies AMR’s request to strike the supplemental \ndeclaration of Hansen.  \n// \n// Case 3:19-cv-01227-BAS-KSC   Document 74   Filed 02/02/21   PageID.<pageID>   Page 8 of 10 \n- 9 - \n19cv1227  1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 B. Shay Declaration  \nAMR argues that the Shay Declaration should be stricken because it is impermissible \nnew evidence and violates several evidentiary rules .  As an initial matter, the allegations \nraised in the Shay Declaration are not new because they respond to AMR’s allegation that \nMendell has a conflict of interest due to the pending state court action.  See In re ConAgra \nFoods , 90 F. Supp. 3d at 955 (holding that evidence submitted in direct response to \nevidence raised in the opposition is not new).  The Court thus declines to strike the Shay \ndeclaration on that basis.  \nThe Court next turns to AMR’s evidentiary objections raised against the Shay \nDeclaration.   Because class certification is a preliminary procedure , it “is not accompanied \nby the traditional ru les and procedures applicable to civil trials.”   See Eisen v. Carlisle & \nJacquelin, 417 U.S. 156, 178 (1974).  For this reason, a t the class certification stage, the \nCourt may consider evidence not admissible at trial.  See Keilholtz v. Lennox Hearth Prod.  \nInc., 268 F.R.D. 330, 337 n.3 (N.D. Cal. 2010).  Therefore, the Court overrules AMR’s \nevidentiary objections.  \nThe Court denies AMR’s motion to strike Shay’s declaration.  \n \nC. Sur-Reply   \nA decision to grant or deny leave to file a sur -reply  is generally com mitted to the \n“sound discretion” of the court.  See Brady v. Grendene USA, Inc. , No. 3:12 -cv-0604 -GPC -\nKSC, 2015 WL 6828400, at *3 (S.D. Cal. Nov. 6, 2015); United States v. Venture One \nMortg. Corp. , No: 13-CV -1872 W (JLB), 2015 WL 12532139, at *2 (S.D. Cal. Feb. 26, \n2015). Such discretion “should be exercised in favor of allowing a sur-reply  only where a \nvalid reason for such additional briefing exists.”  Hill v. England , No.  CVF 05869\nRECTAG, 2005 WL 3031136, at *1 (E.D. Cal. Nov. 8, 2005).    A court may permit a sur -\nreply  “in the interest of fairness” even where the “reply brief [is] largely responsive to \nissues raised by [the opposing part y] in its opposition” brief.  Sherman v. Yahoo! Inc. , No. \n13CV0041 -GPC -WVG, 2015 WL 5604400, at *3 (S.D. Cal. Sept. 23, 2015) . Case 3:19-cv-01227-BAS-KSC   Document 74   Filed 02/02/21   PageID.<pageID>   Page 9 of 10 \n- 10 - \n19cv1227  1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 Here, the Court finds that it would be in the interest of fairness to allow AMR to \nrespond to the final class identification method set forth in Mendell’s Reply and in \nHansen’s supplemental declaration.  AMR  has raised an unopposed allegation that \nMendell’s own delay in serving LiveVox with a subpoena caused the delay in LiveVox’s \nproduction of the phone records .  (Mot. to Strike at 4.)  Under these circumstances, the \nCourt finds that AMR should be given an opportunity to brief the merits of the final class \nidentification procedure proposed by Mendell.   Although AMR asks for another \nopportunity to depose Hanse n, the court find s that a nother  deposition is neither merited nor \nnecessary.   \n \nIII. CONCLUSION  \n Defendant’s motion to strike (ECF No. 70) is DENIED.  \n In the interest of fairness, the Court will provide Defen dant an opportunity to \nrespond to Plaintiff’s Reply only as to the proposed class identification procedure.  \nDefendant may move to file a  sur-reply on or before Wednesday , February 1 0, 2021 .  \nDefendant must attach a proposed sur -reply, not to exceed five pages , to its motion to file \na sur -reply.  \n \nIT IS SO ORDERED.  \n \nDATED: February 2, 2021  \nCase 3:19-cv-01227-BAS-KSC   Document 74   Filed 02/02/21   PageID.<pageID>   Page 10 of\n10",

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: The court in this case rejected a motion for class certification and a motion for dismissal concerning a lawsuit against Sega of America, Inc. and Gearbox Software over the video game \"Aliens: Colonial Marines.\" The plaintiffs alleged that the defendants engaged in false advertising by showcasing a superior version of the game with advanced artificial intelligence and graphics that did not reflect the retail product. However, the court found issues with class certification due to a lack of ascertainable class members and individualized reliance questions.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: The primary legal issue is whether the class action can be certified given the allegations of false advertising under California’s Consumer Legal Remedies Act (CLRA), Unfair Competition Law (UCL), and False Advertising Law (FAL), alongside breach of warranties and fraud claims.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court denied class certification due to problems with defining an ascertainable class, as potential class members could not be reliably identified by whether they were exposed to the misleading advertising. Gearbox's motion to dismiss based on an arbitration clause and class action waiver was also denied as the case did not involve online features governed by the EULA.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine you bought a game after seeing a really cool advertisement, but when you actually played it, it wasn't anything like the ad. You and many others want to hold the game makers accountable through a big group lawsuit (class action). However, the judge says you can't do this because there's no easy way to prove who actually saw the ad and was tricked by it. Also, the game makers tried to avoid the lawsuit by pointing to a rule saying complaints had to be handled individually (arbitration), but the judge found that rule didn't apply to the case because it wasn't about the game's online parts.",

Nos. 95,  130 \n \nIn this  consumer class action, p laintiff John Locke has moved for class certification  and \ndefendant Gearbox has moved for dismiss al or judgment on the pleadings.   Dkt. No s. 95, 130.1  \nThe Court denies both motions.  \nBACKGROUND  \nThe product at issue in this case is the video game  “Aliens: Colonial Marines ” (“ACM”).   \nDkt. No.  26 ¶ 1.  The game , developed by Gearbox Software, L.L.C. (“Gearbox”) and produced \nby Sega of America, Inc. (“Sega”),  was “held out as the canon sequel to Ja mes Cameron’s 1986 \nfilm ‘Aliens.’”   Id. ¶ 19.  Named plaintiff John Locke is an “avid fan of the series” who pre -\npurchased a copy prior to its release.  Id. ¶¶ 75, 76.  Damion Perrine, the other named plaintiff, is \n                                                 \n1 The identity of the named pl aintiffs has been a moving target in this ac tion.  The  first amende d \nclass action c omplaint  was filed on behalf of two plaintiffs, Da mion Perrine and John Locke.   Dkt. \nNo. 26.  Plaintiffs ’ counsel subsequently filed a Notice of Written Consent to File Second \nAmended Class Action Complaint (Dkt. No. 61) and contemporaneously filed a Second Amended \nClass Action Complaint (Dkt. No. 62).  Plaintiffs ’ counsel eventually acknowledged to th e Court, \nhowever,  that he had not in fact obtained authorization to sign the consent on behalf of his client, \nDamion Perrine, who  the second amended class action complaint drops from this case.   Counsel ’s \nconduct  caused the Court considerable concern, and the Court consequently struck both the Notice \nand the Second Amended Class Action Complaint.  Dkt. No.  63.  As a result, the f irst amended \nclass action co mplaint remains the operative complaint  and both Messrs.  Perrine and Lo cke are \nnamed plainti ffs, but only Mr.  Locke moves for class certification and seeks appointment as a \nclass representative.   Dkt. No.  95.  \n Case 3:13-cv-01962-JD   Document 163   Filed 05/12/15   Page 1 of 8 \n2 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  also a “fan o f the Aliens franchise,” and purchased a copy of the game on its release  date, \nFebruary 13, 2013.  Id. ¶¶ 85, 94.2   \nThe complaint alleges a “classic bait -and-switch.”  Id. ¶ 1.  Plaintiffs allege that d efendants \ndeveloped a “non -retail but technically superior version” of the game tha t featured, among other \nthings, “advanced artificial intelligence programming, certain gameplay sequences drawn from the \nAliens movie,” and “a highly advanced graphics engine (the ‘Demo Engine’),” and presented this \nversion and described it to the public a s “actual gameplay.”  Id. ¶¶ 23-24.  The retail version that \nwas ultimately sold, however,  allegedly  “utilized different programming altogether and a different \n-- and much less advanced -- graphics engine (the ‘Retail Engine’).”  Id. ¶ 26.  The complaint \nalleges that because of these differences, videogame industry critics expressed “disappointment \nand surprise” following the public release of the game, and that even Randy Pitchford, President \nof Gearbox,  “acknowledged the discrepancy b etween the Aliens: Colonial Marines hands -off \ndemo and the final game.”  Id. ¶¶ 62, 68.  On this basis, the complaint asserts six claims for relief:  \n(1) violation of the Consumer Legal Remedies Act, Cal. Civil Code § 1750 (“CLRA”); \n(2) violation of the Un fair Competition Law, Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code § 17200 (“UCL”); \n(3) violation of the False Advertising Law, Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code § 17500 (“FAL”); (4)  breach of \nexpress warranties; (5)  fraud in the inducement; and (6)  negligent misrepresentation.    \nIn his p ending motion, Mr. Locke seeks certific ation of the following class against \ndefendant Gearbox only:3  “All persons in the United States who paid for a copy of the Aliens: \nColonial Marines video game either on or before February 12, 2013.”  Dkt. No.  95 at 1 3; see also \nDkt. No.  26 ¶ 101.  Plaintiff alternatively proposed the certification of a more narrowed class at \nthe hearing,  which the Court will address .  \n                                                 \n2 Mr. Perrine has filed a motion to dismiss claims and withdraw as class representative, Dkt. \nNo. 69, but the Court has deferred ruling on that motion for reasons previously discussed with the \nparties.   See also  n.1, supra . \n \n3 Mr. Locke says the other defendant “Sega has agreed t o settle the claims against it, and there is a \npending motion to certify a class for settlement purposes with respect to Sega. (Dkt. 78.).”  Dkt. \nNo. 95 at 13 n.13.  Case 3:13-cv-01962-JD   Document 163   Filed 05/12/15   Page 2 of 8 \n3 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  At the class certification hearing,  plaintiff s’ counsel also sought the application of \nCalifornia law  to a nationwide class under Gearbox’s End Us er License Agreement (“EULA”).  \nThis stimulated Gearbox to file a motion to dismiss or, in the alternative, for judgment on the \npleadings  based on the arbitration clause and class action waiver contained in  the EULA .  Dkt. \nNo. 130.   \nDISCUSSION  \nI. CLASS CERTIFICATION  \nFederal Rule of C ivil Procedure 23  governs plaintiff’s motion for class certification .  \nUnder that rule,  a party seeking class certification bears the burden of showing that each of the \nfour requirements of Rule 23(a) and at least one of the requirements of Rule 23(b) are met.  \nHanlon v. Chrysler Corp. , 150 F.3d 1011, 1022 (9th Cir. 1998).  Although not yet expressly \nrecognized by the Ninth Circuit in a published opinion, the Court also regards as well -established \nand uncontroversial that “[i]n addition to the explicit requirements of Rule 23, an implied \nprerequisite to class certification is that the class must  be sufficiently definite; the party seeking \ncertification must demonstrate that an identifiable and ascertainable class exists.”  Xavier v. Philip \nMorris USA Inc. , 787 F.Supp.2d 1075, 1089 (N.D. Cal. 2011); see also Martin v. Pacific Parking \nSys. Inc. , 583 Fed. Appx. 803 (9th Cir. 2014) (memorandum disposition affirming district court’s \norder denying class certification “in part, because the proposed class was not ascertainable”).  \nAs an initial matter, the proposed class as framed by the complaint -- “all persons in the \nUnited States who paid for a copy of the Aliens: Colonial Marines video game either on or before \nFebruary 12, 2013”  -- is not certifiable.  Of the three avenues offered by Rule 23(b), plaintiff  seeks \nto satisfy  Rule 23(b)(3).  Dkt. No.  95 at  18.  But at a minimum, common questions of fact would \nnot predominate in the class as defined by the complaint; rather, individualized questions of \nreliance would.  Plaintiff acknowledges this problem in his motion.  See id . at 19 (recognizing \n“possible i ndividual issue here [of] reliance”).  And while it is true that “class members do not \nneed to demonstrate individualized reliance” for plaintiff’s  claims under the UCL and FAL , even \nfor those claims,  a presumption of reliance “does not arise when class me mbers ‘were exposed to \nquite disparate information from various representatives of the defendant.’”  Mazza v. American Case 3:13-cv-01962-JD   Document 163   Filed 05/12/15   Page 3 of 8 \n4 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  Honda Motor Co., Inc. , 666 F.3d 581, 596 (9th Cir. 2012).  For the presumption to apply, \neveryone in the class must  have been “exposed ,” meaning that  “it is necessary for everyone in the \nclass to have viewed the allegedly misleading advertising.”  Id.  Plaintiff’s original definition \nmakes no  attempt to limit the class to those who were “exposed ” to the allegedly misleadin g \nadvertising here , and consequently  it is overbroad  and not certifiable . \nThe obviousness of the se principles is underscored by the fact that  plaintiff rapidly  \nretreated at the hearing to “limit the class to people who viewed an advertisement.”  Dkt. No.129 \nat 15:24 -16:2.  Plaintiff proposed to do this  “by affidavit and claim form.”  Id. at 16:4 -5.  The \nCourt  directed the parties to submit supplemental briefs on this issue, namely  “whether the Court \ncan and should certify a class allowing class membership to be established b y assertion of the \nclass members by way of, e.g., affidavits swearing that a consumer viewed a certain video or \ntrailer prior to placing a pre -order for the game at issue. ”  Dkt. No.  127.   \nThe parties responded, Dkt. Nos.  133, 136 , and the Court now concl udes that the answer to \nits question is no.   The problem with plaintiff’s suggestion is that the revised class lacks \nascertainability.  Ascertainability is  an important requirement because it “is needed for properly \nenforcing the preclusive effect of final  judgment.  The class definition must be clear in its \napplicability so that it will be clear later on whose rights are merged into the judgment, that is, \nwho gets the benefit of any relief and who gets the burden of any loss.”  Xavier , 787 F. Supp. 2d at \n1089. \nThe factual record in the case show s why ascertainability is a pipe  dream here.  As the \ncomplaint acknowledges, this is not a case about  a single misrepresentation.  Rather, the non -retail \nversion of the ACM game is alleged to have been presented to t he public “through a series  of \n‘actual gameplay’ demonstrations.”  Dkt. No.  26 ¶ 27 (emphasis added).  The first demonstration \nis alleged to have occurred “at the annual  ‘E3’ conference in earl y June 2011.”  Id. ¶ 30.  At the \nhearing, plaintiff explained that the ad campaign at issue “started at the E3 2011 conference and \nconcluded . . . right before the release date [of the game in] February of 2013.”  Dkt. No.  129 at \n27:23 -25.   Case 3:13-cv-01962-JD   Document 163   Filed 05/12/15   Page 4 of 8 \n5 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  It is undisputed in the record that many trailers and comme rcials were relea sed during that  \ntime peri od, primarily via the Internet but also through  television .  It is further undisputed that \n“several videos for ACM shown before the game’s release contain footage from only the final \nretail version,” rather than from the alleged “n on-retail version.”  D kt. No.  109 at 5.  When pressed \nat the hearing to identify which specific videos or trailers included the allegedly problematic E3 \n2011 vid eo or portions of it, plaintiff’s counsel answered that he could not “say with certainty  \nwhich ones” and that he “just [didn’t] have the information.”  Dkt. No.  129 at 34:13 -17.  Counsel \nadded, ineffect ually,  that it does not “matter that each and every video didn’t have a specific scene \nfrom the 2011 reenactment,” because the E3 2011  video “was accessible through this time period” \nand remains so today.  Id. at 35:5 -16.  And Mr. Locke, the only na med plaintiff moving for class \ncertification and seeking appointment as a class representative, compounded the ascertainability \nproblem by te stifying in deposition that he could not “answer . . . with any degree of certainty”  a \nquestion regarding which videos he saw before he preordered his copy of the game.  Dkt. No.  133-\n3 at 67:5 -10. \nThese facts distinguish this case from others  in which self -identification through affidavits \nwas found to be permissible , and places it in the camp of cases where such a proposal failed for \nlack of ascertainability.  As was the case in Xavier , there is “no good way to identify ” individuals \nwho “have been exposed to Defendants’ at -issue advertising before February 12, 2003 -- the day \nthat all ACM preorders were made ‘final.’”  Dkt. No.  136 at 4.  Putting aside the fact that plaintiff \nhas failed to carry his burden of identify ing which videos and trailers actually comprise  \ndefendants’ “at -issue advertising” here, there is no good way to identify which purchasers viewed \nwhich videos prior to purchasing the game .  Certainly, defendants have no records  of who viewed \nwhat when , and plaintiff ha s not identified any docume nt-based  method of identifying this \ninformation.  Instead, plaintiff’s suggestion is to permit class members to self -identify  through the \nsubmission of affidavits, but those  affidavits would be highly unreliable and likely to embody the \n“subjective memory problem” that was found to exist in Xavier .  As Judge Alsup noted in that \ncase, “[s]wearing ‘I smoked 146,000 Marlboro cigarettes’ is categorically different from swearing \n‘I have been to Paris, France,’ or ‘I am Jewish,’ or even ‘I was within ten miles of the toxic Case 3:13-cv-01962-JD   Document 163   Filed 05/12/15   Page 5 of 8 \n6 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  explosion on the day it happened,” and the “memory problem is compounded by incentives \nindividuals would have to associate with a successful class or dissociate from an un successful \none.”  787 F. Supp. 2d at 1090.   \nThe re ality of this memory problem is beyond meaningful dispute.  One of the two named \nplaintiffs here has already admitted under oath that he cannot identify “with any degree of \ncertainty” which videos he saw before he placed his pre -order of the game at issue.   The other \nnamed plaintiff, who no longer seeks to be a class representative but whose testimony is relevant \nnevertheless, also testified  under oath that he could “not with certainty” remember all the videos \nhe saw f or Aliens: Colonial Marines.  He furthe r affirmed that there were “no records or no way \nfor you to be able to recreate all of the different videos or demonstrations you may have seen for \nthe game.”  Dkt. No.  133-4 at 84:11 -19. \nOn this record, the Court finds  that “persons who viewed an advertis ement for ACM \nincorporating the Demoed Version, ” see Dkt. No.  116 at 7, cannot be i dentified through any \nreliable and manageable means, and that the proposed class lacks ascertainability.  See Xavier , 787 \nF. Supp. 2d at 1091; see also Astiana v. Ben  & Jerry’s Homemade, Inc. , Case No.  C 10 -4387 PJH, \n2014 WL 60097, at *3 (N.D. Cal. Jan. 7, 2014) (finding class insufficiently ascertainable where \nplaintiff “has provided no evidence as to which ice cream contained the allegedly ‘synthetic \ningredient’” and  “has not shown that a means exists for identifying the alkali in every class \nmember’s ice cream purchases”).   The Court also finds that  plaintiff has failed to “satisfy through \nevidentiary proof” at least one of the three subsections of Rule 23(b).  Comca st Corp. v. Behrend , \n133 S.Ct. 1426, 1432 (2013).   \nThe Court consequently denies plaintiff’s motion for class certification on that basis, and \nfinds it unnecessary to reach the  questions of whether plaintiff has satisfied the other requirements \nof Rule 23 . \nII. GEARBOX’S MOTION TO DISMISS OR FOR JUDGM ENT ON THE PLEADINGS  \nOne additional factor that bears mention is the requirement under Rule 23(b)(3), which \nplaintiff has invoked, that common questions of law predominate over individual ones.  This Case 3:13-cv-01962-JD   Document 163   Filed 05/12/15   Page 6 of 8 \n7 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  requirement, a nd plaintiff’s efforts to meet it, set the stage for Gearbox’s motion to dismiss or for \njudgment  on the pleadings.  Dkt. No.  130. \nIn its class certification opposition, Gearbox argued that no class could be certified \nbecause , pursuant to  Mazza , 666 F.3d at  594, “each class member’s consumer protection claim \nshould be governed by the consumer protection laws of the jurisdiction in which the transaction \ntook place,” and individualized legal questions would consequentl y predominate.  Dkt. No.  109 at \n17.  I n reply, plaintiff asserted that California law could be applied to all class members’ claims on \na nationwi de basis under a California choice -of-law provision in “ACM’s End User License \nAgreement.”  Dkt. N o. 116 at 11.  More specificall y, plaintiff stated  that he was standing on the \nchoice -of-law clause in Seg a’s EULA, which he asserted is incorporated by reference  by \nGearbox’s EULA , which he said governs his claim .  Id. at 11 n.10.  \nGearbox  then brought the present motion under Federal Rules of Civil Pro cedure 12(b)(1) \nand 12(c) “on the grounds that the Gearbox’s End Use License Agreement, which plaintiffs \nstipulated . . . governs the disposition of this case, bars plaintiffs from proceeding with a civil \naction against Gearbox and precludes the maintenanc e of a class action against Gearbox.”  Dk t. \nNo. 130.  Gearbox stakes its argument on the “mandatory arbitration provision and class action \nwaiver” found in Gearbox’s EULA.  Id. \nThe Court finds, however, that this action does not fall under the scope of the binding \narbitration and class action waive r provisions of the Gearbox EULA .  As used in the EULA, \n“dispute” is defined to mean “any dispute, claim, demand, action, proceeding, or other controversy \nbetween you and Gearbox concerning the Licensed Works . . . .”  Dkt. No.  130-3 § 9.  Critically, \nthe preamble of the EULA shows “Licensed Works” to be  a defined term that refers to “the online \nfeatures of Gearbox games and products.”  Id. (“In addition to the existing EULA terms applicable \nto the product and/or game, w hich are incorporated herein by reference, those who utilize the \nonline features of Gearbox games and products (the ‘Licensed Works’) , including the online \nservice known as ‘Shift,’ also acknowledge and accept the following terms of use”)  (emphasis \nadded) .

See Dkt. No.  2.  The EULA show why .  Under Section 1, License, “Gearbox \nmay limit or prohibit access to the Licensed Works in its discretion.”  Dkt. No.  130-3.  This  makes \nsense only if “Licensed Wo rks” means the online features, which Gearbox could presumably \ncontrol access to via  log-in credentials, IP addresses, and the like.  It makes no sense at all if it \nrefers to Gearbox games an d products already purchased and  in the living rooms of  consumers.   \nGearbox definitely  does not have the right to go into consumers’ homes and remove their co pies \nof ACM.    \nThe Court finds “Licensed Works” to mean the “online features of Gearbox games and \nproducts.”  This case is not about thos e online features, and ther efore the action does not fall \nwithin the scope of the binding arbitration provision or the class action waive r in the Gearbox \nEULA, both of which apply only to disputes  “concerning the Licensed Works .”  Defendant \nGearbox’s motion for dismissal or for judgment on the pleadings is consequently denied.  \nCONCLUSION  \nThe Court denies plaintiff’s motion for class certification  (Dkt.

    "summary": "1. **Summary:** This court case involves plaintiffs Ron and Dorit Golan who filed a class action lawsuit against Veritas Entertainment and others, alleging violations of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA) and Missouri's Do Not Call Law due to unsolicited pre-recorded calls promoting a movie campaign. The court dismissed the case, concluding that the plaintiffs lacked Article III standing as they did not suffer a concrete, particularized injury because the calls merely left non-commercial messages on their answering machine without promoting any specific product or solicitation.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue:** The primary legal issue is whether the plaintiffs have standing under Article III of the U.S. Constitution to bring claims under the TCPA and Missouri's Do Not Call Law when they did not actually hear a commercial message in the unsolicited calls left on their answering machine.\n\n3. **Court's Holding:** The court held that the plaintiffs lacked Article III standing because the calls they received did not contain any telemarketing message or advertisement that invaded their privacy as contemplated by the TCPA or Missouri's Do Not Call Law. As the plaintiffs did not experience a concrete and particularized injury, they could not proceed with their claims.\n\n4. **ELI5 explanation:** Imagine you get a phone call, but your voicemail just records a generic message saying, \"We might call back.\" Some people tried to sue because these calls were annoying, claiming they were illegal advertisements. The court decided they couldn't sue because these calls weren't like the pushy sales calls the laws were meant to stop; instead, they were generic, without trying to sell anything directly. Since the calls didn't really bother the people in a way the law was concerned with, the case got dismissed.",

Leininger’s Motion to Dismiss” [ECF\nNo. 32]; and “Michael Dale Huckabee’s Motion to Dismiss” [ECF No. 36]. \nI. BACKGROUND\nOn October 3, 2012, Plaintiffs James Armbruster, Ron Golan, and Dorit Golan, on behalf\nof themselves and as representatives of a defined class, filed a putative class action petition in the\nTwenty-First Judicial Circuit, St. Louis County, Missouri, styled James Armbruster, Ron Golan\nand Dorit Golan v. Veritas Entertainment, LLC and Veritas Marketing Group, LLC , Cause No.\n12SL-CC03771 [ECF Nos. 1, 1-5 at 205].  The plaintiffs alleged the named defendants violated\nthe Telephone Consumer Protection Act (“TCPA”), 47 U.S.C. §§ 227 et seq., and 47 C.F.R. §\n64.1200(a), by making unsolicited pre-recorded calls to residential telephone lines.  \nPlaintiffs Ron Golan and Dorit Golan (collectively referred to as “Plaintiffs” or “Golans”)\nfiled an Amended Class Action Petition (“Amended Complaint”) in the state court on December\n4, 2013, styled Ron Golan and Dorit Golan v.

Joseph, III; Stephen Wayne Griffin; Mission City Management, Inc.;\nCourage 2012, LLC; James R. Leininger; Sixdi, Inc., d/b/a Sixdi; Bob Brewer; and Michael Dale\nHuckabee, a/k/a Mike Huckabee  [ECF Nos. 1, 1-3, 4], asserting the named defendants violated\nSection 227(b)(1)(B) of the TCPA, and Missouri’s Do Not Call Law, Missouri Revised Statutes\n§ 407.1095-407.1110.  On January 15, 2014, Defendant Mission City Management, Inc.\n(“Mission City”) filed a Notice of Removal to this Court, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331, 1332,\n1441, 1446 and 1453, alleging this Court has original jurisdiction over claims arising under the\nTCPA, and under the Class Action Fairness Act of 2005, 28 U.S.C. § 1332(d)(2), and (5),\nbecause the putative class contains at least 100 members, at least one member of the putative\nclass is a citizen of a state different from any defendant, and the amount in controversy exceeds\n$5,000,000, exclusive of interest and costs [ECF No. 1].  The proposed class consists of:  \nAll persons within the United States to whom Defendants (or some person on\nDefendants’ behalf), within four years of October 3, 2012, initiated one or more\ntelephone calls to such persons’ residential telephone lines using the recorded\nvoice of Mike Huckabee to deliver a message as part of the above-mentioned\ncampaign regarding the movie Last Ounce of Courage.\nWithin the proposed class is the following sub-class:\nAll Missouri residential subscribers registered on Missouri’s No Call List who\nreceived, within any twelve-month period after January 1, 2012, more than one\n“telephone solicitation” (as defined by Missouri Revised Statutes § 407.1095(3))\nby or on behalf of Defendants, using the recorded voice of Mike Huckabee as part\nof a campaign promoting Last Ounce of Courage. \n   \nDefendants Mission City and Courage 2012, LLC (“Courage 2012”) jointly filed a\nMotion to Dismiss on January 31, 2014, alleging Plaintiffs’ Amended Complaint failed to state a\nclaim against them, and asking the Court to dismiss, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure\n12 (b)(6), the claims as to them, with prejudice [ECF Nos. 21, 22].  On February 14, Defendants\nJames R. Leininger (“Leininger”) and Michael Dale Huckabee (“Huckabee”) filed separateCase: 4:14-cv-00069-ERW   Doc. #:  58   Filed: 05/20/14   Page: 2 of 25 PageID #: <pageID>3motions, also moving the Court to dismiss with prejudice, Plaintiffs’ claims against them, for\nfailure to state a claim [ECF Nos. 32, 33, 36, 37].  With leave of Court, Plaintiffs submitted their\ncombined Response to all three Motions to Dismiss on February 28 [ECF No. 42].  Defendants\nMission City, Courage 2012, Leininger, and Huckabee (collectively referred to as “Moving\nDefendants”) filed a combined Reply in support of their motions on March 14, 2014 [ECF No.\n43].  \nDefendants Veritas Entertainment, LLC; Veritas Marketing Group, LLC; Stephen Wayne\nGriffin; AIC Communications, LLC; FreeEats.com, Inc. (AIC Communications, LLC and\nFreeEats.com, Inc. collectively referred to as “ccAdvertising”); and Gabriel S. Joseph III filed\nAnswers to Plaintiffs’ Amended Complaint [ECF Nos. 23-25].  On April 1, 2014, Plaintiffs filed\na “Motion for Leave to File Second Amended Complaint” [ECF Nos. 45 through 45-3] and a\n“Motion to Certify Class as to Second Amended Complaint and to Stay Further Certification\nBriefing [ECF Nos. 46, 47].  \nOn April 4, 2014, the Court issued an Order, holding in abeyance Moving Defendants’\nMotions to Dismiss, pending additional briefing by the parties on certain issues the Court\nidentified as issues of concern, including the Golans’ standing to bring the action [ECF No. 49]. \nPlaintiffs and Moving Defendants filed their responsive briefs [ECF Nos. 51, 54 through 54-4]. \nOn May 5, 2014, Defendants Joseph and ccAdvertising filed “Defendants FreeEats.com, AIC\nCommunications, LLC, and Gabriel S. Joseph, III’s Response to Plaintiffs’ Brief on the Court’s\nApril 4, 2014 Order,” indicating their desire to join in, and incorporate by reference, the response\nfiled by Moving Defendants [ECF No. 53].  Defendants Joseph and ccAdvertising have also filed\n“Defendants FreeEats.com, AIC Communications, LLC, and Gabriel S.

LEGAL STANDARD\nA. MOTION TO DISMISS\nA party may move under Rule 12(b)(6) to dismiss a complaint for “fail[ing] to state a\nclaim upon which relief may be granted.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6).  The purpose of a motion to\ndismiss is to test “the sufficiency of a complaint[.]”  M.M. Silta, Inc. v. Cleveland Cliffs, Inc. ,\n616 F.3d 872, 876 (8th Cir. 2010).  \n“To survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter,\naccepted as true, to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.”  Ashcroft v. Iqbal , 556\nU.S. 662, 678 (2009) (internal quotations and citation omitted).   “A claim has facial plausibility\nwhen the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference\nthat the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.”  Id.  Ordinarily, only the facts alleged in\nthe complaint are considered for purposes of a motion to dismiss; however, materials attached to\nthe complaint may also be considered in construing its sufficiency.  Reynolds v. Dormire , 636\nF.3d 976, 979 (8th Cir. 2011).  \nWhen ruling on a motion to dismiss, a court “must liberally construe a complaint in favor\nof the plaintiff[.]”  Huggins v. FedEx Ground Package Sys., Inc. , 592 F.3d 853, 862 (8th Cir.\n2010).  However, if a claim fails to allege one of the elements necessary to recovery on a legal\ntheory, that claim must be dismissed for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. \nCrest Constr. II, Inc. v. Doe , 660 F.3d 346, 355 (8th Cir. 2011).  “Threadbare recitals of a cause\nof action, supported by mere conclusory statements, do not suffice.”   Iqbal , 556 U.S. at 678;  Bell\nAtlantic v. Twombly , 550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007).  Although courts must accept all factualCase: 4:14-cv-00069-ERW   Doc. #:  58   Filed: 05/20/14   Page: 4 of 25 PageID #: <pageID>5allegations as true, they are not bound to take as true “a legal conclusion couched as a factual\nallegation.” Twombly , 550 U.S. at 555 (internal quotations and citation omitted); Iqbal , 556 U.S.\nat 677-78.   \nB. THE TCPA\nIn the TCPA of 1991, Congress found that the use of the telephone to market goods and\nservices to homes was “pervasive due to the increased use of cost-effective telemarketing\ntechniques.”  Pub. L. No. 102-243, 105 Stat 2394 at § 2 (1991).  Additionally, Congress found\nthat unrestricted telemarketing could constitute an intrusive invasion of privacy, and that many\nconsumers were outraged over the proliferation of intrusive, nuisance calls to their homes from\ntelemarketers.  Id.  Congress further found that individuals’ rights needed to be balanced in a way\nthat protected the privacy of individuals and permitted legitimate telemarketing practices.  Id. \nConsequently, Congress amended Title II of the Communications Act of 1934 by adding Section\n227 at the end of the Act, placing restrictions on the use of telephone equipment.  Pub. L. No.\n102-243, 105 Stat 2394 at § 3 (1991).  \nIn their Amended Complaint, Plaintiffs allege that the named defendants violated 47\nU.S.C. § 227(b)(1)(B).   Section 227(b)(1)(B) of the TCPA provides that it shall be unlawful for\nany person “to initiate any telephone call to any residential telephone line using an artificial or\nprerecorded voice to deliver a message without the prior express consent of the called party,\nunless the call is initiated for emergency purposes or is exempted by rule or order by the\nCommission under paragraph (2)(B).”  47 U.S.C. § 227 (b)(1)(B).  \nThe Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) is the agency granted law-making,\nlaw-enforcing, and interpretative authority over the TCPA.  See Chevron, USA, Inc. v. Natural\nRes. Def. Council, Inc. , 467 U.S. 837, 843-44 (1984); 47 U.S.C. §§ 227(b)(2), 227(c)(1),Case: 4:14-cv-00069-ERW   Doc. #:  58   Filed: 05/20/14   Page: 5 of 25 PageID #: <pageID>6227(c)(2), 227(g)(3); 20 FCC Rcd. 18272 (Nov. 23, 2005).  On May 9, 2013, upon referral of a\ncase by the Sixth Circuit, the FCC issued a Declaratory Ruling on the issue of “on behalf of ”\nliability under section 227(c) of the TCPA, which grants a private right of action to individuals\nreceiving “more than one telephone call within any 12-month period by or on behalf of the same\nentity in violation of the regulations prescribed under [subsection c].”  In the Matter of the Joint\nPetition filed by Dish Network, LLC, et al. , 28 F.C.C.R. 6574, 2013 WL 1934349 (F.C.C. May 9,\n2013); 47 U.S.C. § 227 (c)(5).  In this ruling, the FCC also considered vicarious liability of\nsellers for violations of 47 U.S.C. § 227(b).  In the Matter of the Joint Petition filed by Dish\nNetwork, LLC, et al. , 28 F.C.C.R. 6574.   Thus, this Court is able to consider the pending\nmotions with the benefit of the FCC’s guidance.   \n“[A] seller does not generally ‘initiate’ calls made through a third-party telemarketer\nwithin the meaning of the TCPA[.]” Id. at 6574.  Therefore, a seller is not directly liable for a\nTCPA violation unless it initiates call.  Id. at 6582.  Nor is an action taken for the benefit of a\nseller by a third-party, without more, sufficient to trigger the liability of a seller under section\n227(b).  Id. at 6593.  In addition to the TCPA’s provision making it unlawful, absent prior\nexpress consent by the call recipient, for a person to initiate telephone calls to residential\ntelephone lines using artificial or prerecorded voices to deliver messages, the FCC’s do-not-call\nrules also make it unlawful for any person or entity to initiate telephone solicitations to\nresidential telephone subscribers who have registered their telephone numbers with the national\ndo-not-call registry.  Id. at 6582-83.  The FCC has exempted certain categories of calls from its\ndelivery restrictions on calls using an artificial or prerecorded voice.  Among others, the FCC has\nexempted calls not made for a commercial purpose, and calls made for a commercial purpose,\nbut without an advertisement or telemarketing message.  See 47 C.F.R. § 64.1200.   Case: 4:14-cv-00069-ERW   Doc. #:  58   Filed: 05/20/14   Page: 6 of 25 PageID #: <pageID>7Nevertheless, a seller that is not directly liable may be held vicariously liable under\nfederal common law principles of agency for violations of section 227(b) by a third-party\ntelemarketer.  In the Matter of the Joint Petition filed by Dish Network, LLC, et al. ,  28 F.C.C.R.\nat 6582-83.  A formal agency relationship is not required to establish a seller’s vicarious liability\nfor the illegal acts of a third-party telemarketer; plaintiffs can also employ principles of\nratification and apparent authority in pursuing TCPA claims.  Id. at 6586-87.  Federal common\nlaw is in accordance with the Restatement of Agency.  Opp v. Wheaton Van Lines, Inc. , 231 F.3d\n1060, 1064 (7th Cir. 2000).  Missouri agency law likewise mirrors the Restatement’s definition. \nSee State ex rel. Ford Motor Co. v. Bacon , 63 S.W.3d 641, 642 (Mo. 2002).  \na. Apparent Authority\n“[A]pparent authority to do an act is created as to a third person by written or spoken\nwords or any other conduct of the principal which, reasonably interpreted, causes the third person\nto believe that the principal consents to have the act done on his behalf by the person purporting\nto act for him.”  Pinkham v. Sara Lee Corp ., 983 F.2d 824, 830 (8th Cir. 1992) (quoting\nRestatement (Second) of Agency § 27 (1957)); see also Restatement (Third) Agency § 2.03\n(apparent authority is the power held by agent or other actor to affect principal’s legal relations\nwith third parties, when third party reasonably believes actor has authority to act on principal’s\nbehalf and belief is traceable to principal’s manifestations); Restatement (Third) Agency § 1.03\n(person manifests assent or intention through written or spoken words or other conduct).  \nIn its Declaratory Ruling, the FCC provided illustrative examples of evidence that could\ndemonstrate a telemarketer is a “seller’s authorized representative with apparent authority to\nmake the seller vicariously liable for the telemarketer’s section 227(b) violations.”  In the Matter\nof the Joint Petition filed by Dish Network, LLC, et al. , 28 F.C.C.R. at 6592.  The examplesCase: 4:14-cv-00069-ERW   Doc. #:  58   Filed: 05/20/14   Page: 7 of 25 PageID #: <pageID>8included evidence showing: 1) the seller allows the telemarketer access to information and\nsystems that normally would be within the seller’s exclusive control; 2) the ability by the\ntelemarketer to enter consumer information into the seller’s sales or customer systems; 3) the\nauthority by the telemarketer to use the seller’s trade name, trademark, and service mark; and 4)\nthe seller approved, wrote, or reviewed the telemarketing scripts.  Id.  The FCC also opined:\na seller would be responsible under the TCPA for the unauthorized conduct of a\nthird-party telemarketer that is otherwise authorized to market on the seller’s\nbehalf if the seller knew (or reasonably should have known) that the telemarketer\nwas violating the TCPA on the seller’s behalf and the seller failed to take effective\nsteps within its power to force the telemarketer to cease that conduct.\nId.  The FCC concluded, “At a minimum, evidence of these kinds of relationships . . . should be\nsufficient to place upon the seller the burden of demonstrating that a reasonable consumer would\nnot sensibly assume that the telemarketer was acting as the seller’s authorized agent.”  Id. at\n6592-93.\nb. Ratification\nRatification is “the affirmance by a person of a prior act that did not bind him but which\nwas done or professedly done on his  account, whereby the act, as to some or all persons, is given\neffect as if originally authorized by him.”  BE&K Const. Co. v. N.L.R.B. , 23 F.3d 1459, 1466 (8th\nCir. 1994) (quoting Serv. Emp. Union, Local 87 (W. Bay Maint.) , 291 NLRB 82, 1988 WL\n214072 (1988)).  Affirmance is either: “(a) a manifestation of an election by one on whose\naccount an unauthorized act has been done to treat the act as authorized, or (b) conduct by him\njustifiable only if there were such an election.”  BE&K Const. Co. , 23 F.3d at 1466 (citing § 83 of\nthe Restatement (Second) of Agency).  “An affirmance of an unauthorized transaction can be\ninferred from a failure to repudiate it.”  Id. (quoting § 94 of the Restatement).  The Restatement\n(Third) of Agency defines ratification as “the affirmance of a prior act done by another, wherebyCase: 4:14-cv-00069-ERW   Doc. #:  58   Filed: 05/20/14   Page: 8 of 25 PageID #: <pageID>9the act is given effect as if done by an agent acting with actual authority.”  Restatement (Third) of\nAgency § 4.01(1).  “A person ratifies an act by (a) manifesting assent that the act shall affect the\nperson’s legal relations, or (b) conduct that justifies a reasonable assumption that the person so\nconsents.”  Restatement (Third) of Agency § 4.01(2).  \nC. MISSOURI’S DO NOT CALL LAW\nThese defendants further argue the Amended Complaint’s allegations are insufficient as a\nmatter of law to assert Missouri Do-Not-Call claims against them.  Missouri’s Telemarketing\nNo-Call List statute provides:  \nNo person or entity shall make or cause to be made any telephone solicitation to\nany residential subscriber in this state who has given notice to the attorney\ngeneral, in accordance with rules promulgated pursuant to section 407.1101 of\nsuch subscriber’s objection to receiving telephone solicitations.  \nMo. Rev. Stat. § 407.1098.\nIII. STATEMENT OF FACTS\nFor purposes of a Motion to Dismiss, the facts, as alleged in Plaintiffs’ Amended\nComplaint and contained in exhibits incorporated therein, are accepted as true.  Those legal\nconclusions “couched as a factual allegation” in a complaint, however, are not.  Defendants\ncorrectly assert the Amended Complaint lumps defendants together and contains conclusory\nstatements, such as “Defendants worked in concert to design and implement a telephone\nadvertising campaign . . ..”  The Court sets forth the following recitation of the pertinent facts,\naccepted as truly alleged in the Amended Complaint and its incorporated exhibits. \nPlaintiffs, filing this putative class action on behalf of themselves, and as representatives\nof the defined class, are the Golans.  The Golans are individuals who reside in St. Louis County. \nMission City is a Texas corporation, and Courage 2012 is a Texas limited liability company. Case: 4:14-cv-00069-ERW   Doc. #:  58   Filed: 05/20/14   Page: 9 of 25 PageID #: <pageID>10Leininger is a manager of Mission City.  Huckabee is a radio talk show host and a former\nArkansas governor.  \nSince prior to January 16, 2010, the Golans have been the account holders of the\nresidential telephone number (636) 812-XXXX.  The Golan’s residential telephone number has\nbeen registered on the Missouri No Call List since January 16, 2010, and on the federal Do Not\nCall List since March 7, 2012.  The Golans never expressly consented to receiving telephone\ncalls to (636) 812-XXXX from any of the defendants named in the Amended Complaint.\nDefendant Stephen Wayne Griffin (“Griffin”) is President and Chief Executive Officer of\nVeritas Marketing (“Veritas Marketing”) and Veritas Entertainment, LLC (“Veritas\nEntertainment”).  Veritas Entertainment helped produced “Last Ounce of Courage,” a movie that\nopened nationwide in at least 1,400 theatres on or about September 14, 2012, and played at the\nWehrenberg Chesterfield Galaxy 14 theatre in Chesterfield, Missouri.  “Last Ounce of Courage”\nwas initially owned by Eastern Gate Films, LLC (“Eastern Gate”), which started the movie, but\nEastern Gate later asked Veritas Entertainment to “come alongside and fix the film.”  Veritas\nEntertainment provided capital to fix the film in exchange for an equity interest in “Last Ounce\nof Courage.”  After investing money in the film, Griffin and his associated entities owned a forty-\nnine percent interest in “Last Ounce of Courage.”  Mission City made an investment of\n$10,000,000 to market the movie.   \nIn 2012, Courage 2012 was formed.  Thereafter, Courage 2012, Mission City, and Veritas\nEntertainment owned the film.  “Last Ounce of Courage” was the only movie Veritas ever\nmarketed.  \nIn 2012, Leininger introduced Griffin to Gabriel S.

Subsequently, Joseph made a PowerPoint “pitch”\nto Griffin, concerning how to promote the movie effectively, including the use of telemarketing. \nGriffin and Joseph then engaged in a series of discussions regarding a telemarketing campaign to\npromote “Last Ounce of Courage,” with Griffin acting on behalf of Veritas Entertainment and\nVeritas Marketing.  \nLeininger also introduced Griffin to Huckabee, and, in June or July 2012, Griffin went to\nFlorida to screen “Last Ounce of Courage” to Huckabee at Huckabee’s home.  Leininger was also \npresent at this meeting.  \nIn communicating by email to Griffin, Joseph once carbon-copied Leininger, noting,\n“[Leininger] can engage as needed.”  In email exchanges between Griffin and Joseph, Griffin\noften identified himself as the “President & CEO” of Veritas Entertainment, and used the email\naddress, sgriffin@veritashq.com .\nThe advertising campaign for “Last Ounce of Courage” included approximately 4 million\ntelephone calls to residential telephone numbers throughout many states in the United States and\n“Email to Text (ETT) Messages” to 30 million cell phones.  Defendants knew the telephone calls\nwould be recorded ahead of time and played when recipients, or their voice mail, picked up the\nphone.  Joseph referred to the telephone calls as “Artificial Intelligence Call[s]” or “AIC” calls. \nJoseph explained the technology functioned like a “logic tree,” in that the telephone call\nrecipient’s “yes” or “no” responses to questions would dictate the next prerecorded question.\nIn an August 31, 2012 email to Griffin, Joseph stated, “We need to start our ‘Artificial\nIntelligence Call’ (AIC) calls with or without a Celebrity Voice.”  Griffin initially was concerned\nwith the cost of a large-scale telephone-call campaign, informing Joseph in an August 31, 2012\nemail, “The money is just not there,” and “the only way I know how to pay for this is to go backCase: 4:14-cv-00069-ERW   Doc. #:  58   Filed: 05/20/14   Page: 11 of 25 PageID #:\n <pageID>12to [Leininger].”  In this email, Griffin also stated, “I want people to go to see the movie your (sic)\nright we only have two weeks.  Getting a lot of info about people with a call to see the movie\ndoes not help me at this point.”\nccAdvertising prepared the initial suggested script for the “Last Ounce of Courage” AIC\ncalls.  This script included, among others, the following segments:\n1. Hello[,] this is Governor Mike Huckabee with a 45-second survey.  Do\nyou believe in American freedom and liberty?\n2.

Huckabee recorded the script on September 4, 2012,\n“using his own voice.”  Huckabee knew the recording would be played for telemarketing\npurposes during telephone calls to consumers. \nAfter learning, on September 5, 2012, that Huckabee had recorded the script, Griffin sent\nJoseph an email, stating, “[I] need to review the call.”  That same day, Joseph sent Brewer an\nemail, requesting information for targeting cities and states where the most theatres would be\nshowing the movie.  Brewer, using the email address bob.brewer@sixdi.com , responded on\nSeptember 5, stating, “Let’s go.  The Huckabee AIC call is approved.”Case: 4:14-cv-00069-ERW   Doc. #:  58   Filed: 05/20/14   Page: 13 of 25 PageID #:\n <pageID>14On September 6, Joseph sent Leininger a test call of the Huckabee call for “Last Ounce of\nCourage.”  Leininger liked the call, but wanted the script to be shorter, progressing from Segment\n2 to Segment 5, and skipping the questions in between, because Leininger “was anxious to get\npeople to the movie permission segment.”  Joseph made Leininger’s suggested changes.\nccAdvertising sent an email to Griffin and Brewer on September 7, 2012, providing\nGriffin and Brewer a user login and password for a secure information data directory, so that they\ncould access summary reports regarding the Huckabee calls made, including (a) the percentage of\nhomes where the calls reached live respondents or answering devices; (b) client call status,\nshowing how each call was registered by major category; (c) client segment status, showing by\npercentage levels how each live respondent answered each question; and (d) client response rate,\nshowing composite percentages of how many “Yes” or “No” questions were answered and by\nhow many respondents.  Neither Griffin, nor anyone from Veritas Marketing, ever logged on to\nccAdvertising’s secure data directory.\nInitially, ccAdvertising invoiced SixDi for its work on the “Last Ounce of Courage”\ncampaign.  Later, ccAdvertising’s invoices, including Invoice #4065, were sent to Griffin’s\nattention, and listed “Veritas Entertainment” in the bill-to section.  Veritas Entertainment or\nVeritas Marketing paid ccAdvertising $248,500 for the 4 million AIC calls to residential\ntelephone numbers, and $30,000 for the 30 million ETT messages to cell phones.  ccAdvertising\nreceived by wire transfer, $100,000 on or about September 7, 2012; $100,000 on September 14,\n2012; and the final $78,500 during the first week of October 2012.\nIn a September 14, 2012 email to Griffin concerning payments, Joseph requested a reply\nindicating when he could expect the next $100,000 payment on the balance due.  He threatened\nto shut down the Huckabee AIC campaign if he did not hear from Griffin that morning, andCase: 4:14-cv-00069-ERW   Doc. #:  58   Filed: 05/20/14   Page: 14 of 25 PageID #:\n <pageID>15stated, “[P]lease let me know if I need to engage [Leininger] in this to make sure he has provided\nyou the monies you need to pay ccAdvertising.”\nOn September 10 and 12, 2012, ccAdvertising, via telephone number 202-769-1087,\ninitiated telephone calls to the Golans’ residential telephone line, using Huckabee’s pre-recorded\nvoice to deliver a message encouraging the Golans to go see “Last Ounce of Courage.”  The\nGolans received two of the Huckabee calls, which left messages consisting of language from\nSegment 15 of the script on their answering machine: “This was a public survey call.  We may\ncall back later.”  The name showing on the Golan’s caller ID, corresponding to 202-769-1087,\nwas “2012FREERSRCH.”  \nWhen “lastouncethe movie.com” was typed as a Uniform Resource Locator (“URL”), the\nURL redirected the user to http://www.standusa.com/last-ounce-of-courage/ , which contained a\n“BUY TICKETS” link, as well as an “ABOUT VERITAS” link, http://www.standusa.com/looc -\nabout-veritas/.\nAfter the Huckabee calls were made to 4 million homes, ccAdvertising created a “Survey\nQuestionnaire,” which identified the purpose for the “survey” was “to identify those respondents\nwho believe in American freedom and liberty and who are interested in hearing more information\nabout the movie ‘Last Ounce of Courage.’”  According to this Survey Questionnaire, “1,018,609\nlive responses were detected.”  Regardless of whether recipients of the calls answered “yes” or\n“no” to Questions 1 and 2 in the script, recipients who did not hang up were presented with\nQuestion 5, in which Huckabee recommended they see “Last Ounce of Courage.”  \nJoseph and ccAdvertising obtained the telephone numbers called during the campaign\nfrom a database purchased from Axion Corporation more than a decade earlier.  This database\nprovided White Pages data in digital format.  Other than named defendants, none of the personsCase: 4:14-cv-00069-ERW   Doc. #:  58   Filed: 05/20/14   Page: 15 of 25 PageID #:\n <pageID>16who were called had indicated to any defendant, or anyone else, a desire to receive telephone\ncalls promoting “Last Ounce of Courage.”\nIV. DISCUSSION\nPlaintiffs allege the named defendants violated section 227(b)(1) (B) of the TCPA, which,\nwith certain exceptions, prohibits  persons from initiating calls to residential telephone lines\nusing a prerecorded voice to deliver a message without the called party’s prior express consent. \nPlaintiffs also claim the moving defendants are liable under Missouri’s Do Not Call law, because\nthey made, or caused to be made, the telephone solicitation to Plaintiffs’ residential lines,\nworking together to “bring about” the prerecorded voice calls.  \nIn their Motion to Dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), Moving Defendants claim Plaintiffs\nfail to allege facts to support their claims that these defendants violated the TCPA and Missouri’s\nTelemarketing No-Call List Act.  Moving Defendants contend Plaintiffs have failed to allege\nfacts sufficient to show they made or “cause[d] to be made any telephone solicitation to any\nresidential subscriber in this state[,]” as required by the Missouri statute.  Mission City and\nCourage 2012 further contend the specific allegations regarding them, together with Plaintiffs’\nconclusory, general allegations concerning all the defendants, are insufficient as a matter of law\nto assert TCPA claims against Mission City and Courage 2012.  \nAs to Plaintiffs’ TCPA claim, Moving Defendants contend Plaintiffs fail to allege\nsufficient facts showing Moving Defendants either initiated the calls, or are vicariously liable for\nccAdvertising’s calls [ECF No. 22].  Moving Defendants argue Plaintiffs’ theories of ratification,\nand impermissible delegation of duty fail, claiming Plaintiffs did not raise them in their\nComplaint, and the Complaint’s allegations do not support either theory.  As well, MovingCase: 4:14-cv-00069-ERW   Doc. #:  58   Filed: 05/20/14   Page: 16 of 25 PageID #:\n <pageID>17Defendants contend Plaintiffs fail to allege sufficiently their other theories of liability, including\nallegations supporting the existence of a formal agency relationship.   \nMoving Defendants contend the Amended Complaint fails to plead sufficient facts to\nsupport Plaintiffs’ apparent authority agency and ratification theories, and they more specifically\nargue the Complaint fails to plead sufficiently that they controlled the manner and means of the\ncalls [ECF No. 43].  As to Plaintiffs’ claims against Courage 2012, Moving Defendants assert\nPlaintiffs, at most, have alleged the entity owned the film, and they contend ownership does not\nmake an owner liable, even assuming the owner financed the operations.  Moving Defendants\ncontend Plaintiffs’ claims against Mission City fail for the same reason, and they argue the TCPA\ndoes not impose liability upon one who merely invests in a product. \nIn their combined response in opposition to the Motions to Dismiss filed by Moving\nDefendants, Plaintiffs claim the moving defendants “were intimately involved in the creation of\nthe message and the timing of the calls” [ECF No. 42 at 2].  Plaintiffs contend “common sense,”\nand the Restatement (Third) of Agency, prevent parties from avoiding liability for torts they\norchestrate, but hire a third party to execute.  Plaintiffs assert Moving Defendants controlled the\nprocess and terms by which the violations occurred, and argue defendants’ actions developed a\nprincipal-agent relationship with ccAdvertising that subjected them to vicarious liability for the\nviolations.  Specifically, as to Mission City and Courage 2012, Plaintiffs contend in their\nopposition that these two entities, through their principal, Leininger, funded the calls, acquired\nHuckabee as the “celebrity voice” for the prerecorded calls, and hired ccAdvertising as the\nmarketer of the calls.  Plaintiffs contend Courage 2012, as owner of the film, is chargeable with\nits officers’ knowledge and participation in causing the calls to be made on its behalf.  They\nclaim Mission City, through its principal, Leininger, invested at least $10,000,000 to marketCase: 4:14-cv-00069-ERW   Doc. #:  58   Filed: 05/20/14   Page: 17 of 25 PageID #:\n <pageID>21this action in federal court, claim they have alleged facts conferring Article III standing, because\nthey have statutory standing under the TCPA and Missouri’s Do Not Call Law [ECF No. 51]. \nThey contend statutory damages are available to them without proof of an injury, and state “[t]his\nCourt should follow other courts to have considered the issue and hold that recipients of\nprerecorded telephone calls to their telephones, like the Golans, have Article III standing to\npursue TCPA claims.”  Plaintiffs’ statutory standing argument, however, goes to whether\nPlaintiffs can prevail on the merits of their claims, and thus is not applicable at this stage of the\nlitigation, where the “target” of the standing inquiry is Article III.  Huyer v. Wells Fargo & Co. ,\n295 F.R.D. 332, 340-41 (S.D. Iowa, Oct. 23, 2013) (citing Hall v. LHACO, Inc. , 140 F.3d 1190,\n1196 (8th Cir. 1998)).  Moreover, even when an injury exists solely due to violation of a\nstatutorily-created legal right, Article III’s jurisdictional requirement of injury in fact still must be\nsatisfied.  See Summers v. Earth Island Inst. , 555 U.S. 488, 497 (2009) (“[T]he requirement of\ninjury in fact is a hard floor of Article III jurisdiction that cannot be removed by statute.”).  \nPlaintiffs additionally state they have alleged facts showing their privacy was invaded,\nand the calls were those Congress sought to curb.  They contend these allegations show they\nsuffered damages sufficient to confer standing under the TCPA.  \nIn their joint response to Plaintiffs’ briefing, Moving Defendants assert Plaintiffs received\ntwo voice mail messages they admit did not mention any movie or other commercial product. \nMoving Defendants contend Plaintiffs consequently lack standing to bring this action, because\nthey did not see, know about, or otherwise become aware of an unsolicited advertisement. \nMoving Defendants claim Plaintiffs “had no inkling that the messages might eventually mention\na movie” until Plaintiffs’ counsel told them.  Moving Defendants filed several exhibits with theirCase: 4:14-cv-00069-ERW   Doc. #:  58   Filed: 05/20/14   Page: 21 of 25 PageID #:\n <pageID>22Response, including excerpts of Plaintiffs’ August 16, 2013 deposition testimony [ECF Nos. 54-\n1 through 54-4].  \nDuring their depositions, the Golans testified that the two recorded messages left on their\nanswering machine stated, in their entirety: “Liberty.  This is a public survey call.  We may call\nback later.” [ECF Nos. 54-2 at 4-7; 54-3 at 3-4].  The Golans also testified that, when they\nreceived the calls, they did not know who had made them; did not recognize the caller’s voice;\ndid not know the calls concerned the movie “Last Ounce of Courage”; and did not know the calls\ninvolved an advertisement for the movie [ECF Nos. 54-2 at 5; 54-3 at 4].  They further testified\nthey had no firsthand or independent knowledge that the calls involved an advertisement for the\nmovie “Last Ounce of Courage”; and stated the only basis they had, for understanding the calls\nwere part of a campaign to advertise the movie, consisted of information provided to them by\ntheir attorney when he approached them about the lawsuit [ECF Nos. 54-2 at 5-6; 54-3 at 4-5]. \nDorit Golan testified she had no intention to sue over the calls when she received them, and the\nintention to file suit did not arise until Plaintiffs’ attorney suggested they join the lawsuit [ECF\nNo. 54-3 at 5-6].  Ron Golan stated the idea to file the action came from  Plaintiffs’ attorney,\nwho asked Mr. Golan if he was willing to be part of the lawsuit [ECF No. 54-2 at 7]. \nArticle III standing is the threshold determination in every federal case, and the filing of\nsuit as a class action does not exempt it from meeting this jurisdictional requirement.  Huyer , 295\nF.R.D. at 341.                          \nTo establish standing sufficient to meet the requirements of Article III of the\nUnited States Constitution, a party must establish three elements: (1) the party\nmust have suffered an “injury in fact,” consisting of an “invasion of a legally\nprotected interest which is (a) concrete and particularized . . . and (b) actual and\nimminent”; (2) there must be a causal connection between the injury and the\nconduct complained of, where the injury is fairly traceable to the challenged\naction; and (3) “it must be ‘likely,’ as opposed to merely ‘speculative,’ that the\ninjury will be ‘redressed by a favorable decision.’”Case: 4:14-cv-00069-ERW   Doc. #:  58   Filed: 05/20/14   Page: 22 of 25 PageID #:\n <pageID>23Hall, 140 F.3d at 1195 (citation omitted).  The Court finds the Golans have not suffered an\ninjury in fact within the meaning of Article III.  \nCongress enacted the TCPA to address the nuisance and invasion of privacy resulting\nfrom an increased number of telemarketing calls.  Pub. L. No. 102-243, 105 Stat 2394 at § 2.\nPlaintiffs allege Moving Defendants violated § 227(b)(1)(B) of the Act, which prohibits the\ninitiation of calls to residential telephone lines using a prerecorded voice to deliver a telephone\nsolicitation; and Missouri’s Telemarketing No-Call List statute, Mo. Rev. Stat. 407.1098, which\nalso prohibits telephone solicitations made to certain residential telephone subscribers.  The\nFCC, however, has exempted certain categories of calls from its restrictions on calls using a\nprerecorded voice, including calls made for a commercial purpose, but without an advertisement\nor telemarketing message.  See 47 C.F.R. § 64.1200(a)(3).  Even accepting, for purposes of this\nMotion, that the calls were made for a commercial purpose, neither of the two messages received\nby the Golans’ answering machine contained an advertisement, telemarketing message, or\ntelephone solicitation.  The Amended Complaint’s allegations do not show the Golans’ privacy\nwas ever invaded as contemplated by either of the consumer protection statutes under which they\nbring their claims.  Consequently, Plaintiffs are not within the scope of individuals to whom a\nright of relief has been given, and they have not alleged a distinct and palpable injury to\nthemselves.  See Warth , 422 U.S. at 500-01.  “The proper analysis of standing focuses on\nwhether the plaintiff suffered an actual injury, not on whether a statute was violated.”  Doe v.\nNat’l Bd. of Medical Examiners , 199 F.3d 146, 153 (3rd Cir. 1999).   Nor does the Court find any\nalleged injury is “fairly traceable” to the challenged phone calls.  Plaintiffs had no independent or\nfirsthand knowledge of any advertisement, telemarketing message, or telephone solicitationCase: 4:14-cv-00069-ERW   Doc. #:  58   Filed: 05/20/14   Page: 23 of 25 PageID #:\n <pageID>24promoting “Last Ounce of Courage.”  The sum of their knowledge about their alleged injury was\nbased upon what someone else told them, after the fact.           \nAs to the Court’s query concerning the Golans’ qualification to act as class\nrepresentatives, Plaintiffs claim they are not disqualified from being class representatives “simply\nbecause the full script was not recorded on their answering machine.”  They argue that the\ncontent of the message the Golans heard is not determinative of their fitness to serve as class\nrepresentatives, because the TCPA is concerned with the initiation and purpose of prohibited\ncalls, not whether the recipient actually receives the full message.   \nMoving Defendants argue, even assuming Plaintiffs have standing and state claims\nagainst Moving Defendants, Plaintiffs are inadequate class representatives, because the Golans\ncannot show their claims are typical of the claims of the putative class, as they did not hear any\ncommercial message and had no knowledge of the message’s contents before initiating this\naction.  Moving Defendants further argue that a jury could easily find the Golans suffered no\ninjury because they heard nothing commercial in nature.  They contend the Golans are thus\nvulnerable to a unique defense -- they never heard any commercial message, or even a mention of\nthe movie -- which would jeopardize claims of class members who participated in a survey and\nheard a commercial message.  The Court agrees.  \nAs the named plaintiffs, the Golans must fairly and adequately protect the interests of the\nclass.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(4).  Among other things, they must share the same interest and incur\nthe same injury as the putative class members.  Sosna v. Iowa , 419 U.S. 393, 411-12 (1975) (. . .\n“if none of the named plaintiffs purporting to represent a class establishes the requisite of a case\nor controversy with the defendants, none may seek relief on behalf of himself or any other\nmember of the class.”(citation omitted)).  Plaintiffs whose claims are subject to a defense are notCase: 4:14-cv-00069-ERW   Doc. #:  58   Filed: 05/20/14   Page: 24 of 25 PageID #:\n <pageID>25\nqualified to act as class representatives, if other class members may not be subject to the same, or\nany, defense.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(3) (“Prerequisites to a Class Action.  One or more members\nof a class may sue or be sued as representative parties on behalf of all only if . . . the claims or\ndefenses of the representative parties are typical of the claims or defenses of the class[.]”).  The\nCourt finds the named plaintiffs are not qualified as adequate class representatives.  \n Plaintiffs’ Response did not address the Court’s expressed concern that the Amended\nComplaint’s factual allegations and incorporated exhibits did not appear to indicate any moving\ndefendant qualified as a “seller” for purposes of vicarious liability.  Moving Defendants did brief\nthe issue in their response; however, because the Court concludes Plaintiffs lack Article III\nstanding, it need not address whether the principles of vicarious liability mandate the dismissal of\nPlaintiffs’ claims against Moving Defendants.  \nAccordingly,\nIT IS HEREBY ORDERED  that “Mission City Management, Inc.’s and Courage 2012\nLLC’s Motion to Dismiss” [ECF No. 21] is GRANTED . \nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED  that “James R.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: In this case, Brandon Callier sues Freedom Forever Texas and others for violating the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA) by making unsolicited calls to his cell phone using an automatic telephone dialing system (ATDS). The court recommends denying Freedom Forever's motion to dismiss Callier’s complaint, as his allegations plausibly suggest the use of an ATDS, specifically through the technology used called Kixie. The case involves AI/automation as it concerns the use of technologies like Kixie for autodialing, indicating automated outreach through AI-powered communication platforms.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether Callier has sufficiently alleged that Freedom Forever violated the TCPA by using an ATDS to make unsolicited calls.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court recommends denying the motion to dismiss because the complaint plausibly alleges the use of an ATDS under the TCPA, based on the description of Kixie, the autodialing system, used in making unsolicited calls to the plaintiff.\n\n4. **ELI5**: Imagine you keep getting annoying phone calls from a company, even when you didn’t say they could call you. The person being called decides to sue the company, saying they used a fancy computer system to call lots of people’s phones automatically without permission.

Factual Background1 \n \nPlaintiff is a resident of El Paso, Texas , whose personal cell phone number ends in 4604 \nand begins with the local 915- area-code.  FAC  ¶¶ 1, 89; see also id. at 18 .  He  registered that \nnumber under his own name  and pays for it from his personal accounts.  He  uses his cell phone to \ncommunicate with his friends and family, to communicate via email and text messages, for \nnavigation purposes, and as a timer when cooking.  Id. ¶ 89.  In December 2007, Plaintiff registered \nhis cell phone in  the National Do -Not-Call Registr y.  Id.  ¶ 24. \nFreedom Forever is a Delaware limited liability company that offers solar panel services.   \nId. ¶ 2.  Between September 18 and 25, 2023, Plaintiff received at least thirteen unsolicited calls \nto his cell phone from  different  phone numbers  using the local  915- area-code.  Id. ¶¶ 32 –33, 37.  \nPlaintiff answered each of these calls  from Jorge Cardenas , a representative of Freedom Forever .  \nId. ¶¶ 37, 43, 58. \n During the twelfth call, Plaintiff asked  how Cardenas could dial from  local 915-area-code \nphone number s if Cardenas was in  Florida.  Id. ¶ 39.  Cardenas responded that the calls were \n“autodialed” and use d “spoof caller ID to make the calls appear local.”  Id.  Cardenas later sent \nPlaintiff a text message saying : “Apologize for the confusion of numbers.”  Id. ¶ 40.  Plaintiff then \nasked  Cardenas for the name of the spoofing technology, to which Cardenas responded : “Kixie.”  \nId. ¶¶ 41–42.  Cardenas also provided Plaintiff with Kixie’s website: http://www.kixie.com .  Id. \n¶¶ 35, 42.  In its website, Kixie advertises that it does “[a]utomated outreach for lighting fast speed-\n \n1 The well -pleaded facts below come from Plaintiff’s FAC and are, at this stage, taken as true and \nconstrued in Plaintiff’s favor.

Id. ¶¶ 85 –88. \nB. Procedural Background  \n \nOn October 4, 2023, Plaintiff started  this lawsuit by asserting a single  TCPA claim against \nFreedom Forever and  seeking statutory damages and a permanent injunction as relief .  See Compl. \nECF No. 3.  On November 3, 2023, Freedom Forever moved to dismiss Plaintiff’s single TCPA \nclaim  for failure to state a claim.  See ECF No. 7.  On November 27, 2023, the referring court  \ndenied Freedom Forever’s  motion as moot because Plaintiff filed an amended complaint  that day —\nthe FAC .  ECF Nos. 8 & 9.  In his FAC, Plaintiff asserts two TCPA claims against Defendants \nFreedom Forever, Empowered Solutions, Mitchell Fraker, and Aurora Solar, Inc., and seeks \nstatutory damages and a permanent injunction as relief.  See generally FAC.  \nOn December 22, 2023, Freedom Forever filed this Motion, seeking to partially dismiss \nPlaintiff’s  FAC .2  See generally Mot.  On January 19, 2024, Plaintiff filed his opposition brief .  \nSee Resp. in Opp’n, ECF No. 22.  On February 2, 2024, Freedom Forever replied in support of its \nMotion.  See Reply, ECF No. 29.  On February 16, 2024, the referring court  referred Freedom \n \n2 In its Motion, Freedom Forever  asks the C ourt to dismiss Plaintiff’s FAC but only addresses \nPlaintiff’s T CPA claim  under § 227(b) , not the other asserted under § 227(c).  See 47 U.S.C. § 227(c)(5)  \n(allowing private right of action for “[a] person who has received more than one telephone call within any \n12-month period by or on behalf of the same entity” in violation of the prescribed regulations ); see also 47 \nC.F.R. § 64.1200(d)(3)  (impos ing minimum procedures for maintaining a do- not-call list that apply to all \ncalls— live or automated —initiated for telemarketing purposes to residential telephone subscribers).  Thus,  \nthe Court  construes Freedom Forever’s Motion as a partial motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim.   \nSee Neutron Depot, LLC v. All Web Leads, Inc., No. AU -16-CA-00901- SS, 2017 WL 9538893, at *3 (W.D. \nTex. Nov. 30, 2017),  aff’d sub nom. Neutron Depot, L.L.C. v. Bankrate, Inc., 798 F. App’x 803 (5th Cir. \n2020).

STANDARD  \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) permits defendant s to move to dismiss claims for \nwhich  plaintiff s fail to plead  enough facts allowing the reasonable inference that defendant s are \nliable for the alleged misconduct.  See Ashcroft v. Iqbal , 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009); Bell Atl. Corp. \nv. Twombly , 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007).  “Threadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of action, \nsupported by mere conclusory statements, do not suffice”  to survive a motion to dismiss .  Iqbal , \n556 U.S. at 678.    \nWhen ruling on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, “[t]he court accepts all well -pleaded facts as true, \nviewing them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.”  In re Katrina Canal Breaches Litig., \n495 F.3d 191, 205 (5th Cir. 2007).  That is because courts must evaluate the adequacy of the \nallegations in a complaint rather than the merits of the case.   Jeanty v. Big Bubba’ s Bail Bonds , 72 \nF.4th 116, 119 (5th Cir. 2023) .  As such, c ourts limit such evaluation “to the complaint, any \ndocuments attached to the complaint, and any documents attached to the motion to dismiss that \nare central to the claim and referenced by the complaint.”  Ironshore Eur. DAC v . Schiff Hardin, \nL.L.P., 912 F.3d 759, 763 (5th Cir. 2019) .  \nCourts must liberally construe pleadings drafted by pro se parties, such a s Plaintiff here.  \nSee Jeanty v. Big Bubba's Bail Bonds , 72 F.4th 116, 119 (5th Cir. 2023) . \nIII. DISCUSSION  \nBy its Motion, Freedom Forever seeks to dismiss Plaintiff’s TCPA claim under § 227(b) \nand his request for a permanent injunction.  First, Freedom Forever argues that Plaintiff  fails to \nplausibly allege that it used either an ATDS or an “artificial or prerecorded voice” to state a claim Case 3:23-cv-00364-LS   Document 31   Filed 04/02/24   Page 4 of 10- 5 - \n under § 227(b) .  See Mot. at 7 –11.  An d second, Freedom Forever argues that Plaintiff fails to \nallege any imminent threat of future TCPA violations to support his request for a permanent \ninjunction.  Id.  at 11 –13.  T he Court disagrees . \nA. Plaintiff plausibly alleges a TCPA claim under § 227(b)  \n \nSection 227(b) m akes it unlawful for any individual  to make unsolicited calls (other than \nfor emergency purposes) using an ATDS or an artificial or prerecorded voice to a cell phone.  47 U.S.C. § 227(b)(1)(A)(iii).  The TCPA defines an ATDS  as equipment with the capacity “to store \nor produce telephone numbers to be called, using a random or sequential number generator” and “to dial such numbers.”   Id. § 227(a)(1).  So to state a TCPA claim  under § 227(b), Plaintiff must \nallege enough facts  allowing the reasonable inference that Freedom Forever  (1) made unsolicited \ncalls to his cell phone; and (2) by using either an ATDS or an artificial or prerecorded voice.  \nFreedom Forever argues that the FAC contains no plausible allegations about ATDS use, \nand it cites a case in which a court dismissed a similar claim against Freedom Forever on this basis.  \nSee Mot. at 8–9 (citing Naiman v. Freedom Forever, LLC , No. 19 -CV-00256- JSC, 2019 WL \n1790471, at *3 (N.D. Cal. Apr. 24, 2019) ).  Freedom Forever also argues that Plaintiff’s own \nallegations that he spoke to Cardenas  “[c]learly” indicate  that the unsolicited  calls “were targeted” \nand not random, undercutting any allegation of ATDS use .  Id.  at 10.  But the Court  disagrees  \nbecause i n his FAC , Plaintiff pleads enough facts to state his TCPA claim under § 227(b).   \nFirst, the FAC does allege that Freedom Forever used an ATDS to make unsolicited calls \nto Plaintiff.  See FAC ¶¶ 58, 92.  To be sure, these allegations, without more, would be “formulaic \nrecitations of the elements of a cause of action” that warrant dismissal.  See Iqbal , 556 U.S. at 678.  \nIndeed, it is on this  same basis that the court  dismissed a similar TCPA claim in the case that \nFreedom Forever  cites.  See Naiman, 2019 WL 1790471, at *3 (“Here, the complaint alleges that Case 3:23-cv-00364-LS   Document 31   Filed 04/02/24   Page 5 of 10- 6 - \n ‘Defendant used an [ATDS]  as defined by 47 U.S.C. § 227(a)(1) to place its call to Plaintiff seeking \nto solicit its services. ’ . . . The complaint contains no further, factual allegations regarding the \nalleged use of an ATDS. Such ‘ a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action ’ is \ninsufficient to survive dismissal. ” (cleaned up) ). \nBut unlike  the complaint in that cas e, the FAC here alleges additional facts that, when \nliberally construed in  Plaintiff ’s favor, allow for the  reasonable inference that Kixie  (the alleged \nsoftware used) is an ATDS  as defined in § 227(a)(1).  See, e.g., FAC ¶¶ 35–37, 39–42, 58.  For \nexample, the FAC includes a link to  Kixie’s website .  See id. ¶ 35; see also Tellabs, Inc. v. Makor \nIssues & Rts., Ltd., 551 U.S. 308, 322 (2007) (courts consider the entire complaint , including \ndocuments incorporated by reference) ; Atl. Recording Corp. v. Project Playlist, Inc., 603 F. Supp. \n2d 690, 694 n.3 (S.D.N.Y. 2009) (considering, on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, a website and drawing \n“facts . . . from the Court's own review of the Website” because “the Website is incorporated by reference into the Complaint” (citing cases where  courts likewise have considered such \nincorporated websites)).   That link describes Kixie as an “AI -Powered Communication Platform” \nthat provides  “[u]ltra reliable, easily automated, calling & texting.”  See Kixie, \nhttps://www.kixie.com / (last visited Mar. 18, 2024) .  The link also states that Kixie “can help” its \ncustomers through “[a]utomated outreach,” “multi -device simultaneous ring,” and by “plac[ing] a \ncall . . . with just a single click.”  Id.   While  these statements do not establish whether  Kixie is in \nfact an ATDS, nor do they preclude such inference —much less when  they are liberally construed \nin favor of a pro se plaintiff . \nWhat is m ore, Freedom Forever fails to explain  how the fact that  Plaintiff  spoke with \nCardenas undercuts his allegations of ATDS  use.  While it is apparent  why the  cases that Freedom \nForever cites in support concluded that  speaking to a live representative contradicts  allegations of  Case 3:23-cv-00364-LS   Document 31   Filed 04/02/24   Page 6 of 10- 7 - \n use of an artificial or prerecorded voice , the same is not true for allegations of ATDS use .3  Indeed, \nneither Freedom Forever nor the cases  it cites elaborate on  why speaking to a live representative \nnegates all  reasonable inferences that a defendant used an ATDS  to make unsolicited calls .  If \nanything, with today’s increasingly rapid advances in technology and artificial intelligence, \ntogether with the incorporated Kixie link, such a conclusion seems premature at this stage without \nthe benefit of discovery.  And as the referring c ourt has also explained, “it is impracticable to \nexpect plaintiffs to plead specific facts” about a defendant’s  technology in a TCPA case before \ndiscovery.  See Callier v. MultiPlan, Inc. , No. EP -20-CV-00318- FM, 2021 WL 8053527, at *17 \n(W.D. Tex. Aug. 26, 2021). \nAt best, Freedom Forever  seems to  argue th at Plaintiff  speaking to Cardenas undercuts his \nallegations of ATDS use because, after the first unsolicited call,  Plaintiff  provided Cardenas his \nconsent to receive calls , and so Cardenas’ subsequent phone calls were targeted and not random.  \nSee Mot. at 4, 10; Reply at 3 –4.  But e ven so, Freedom Forever seems to concede  that there was  at \nleast one unsolicited call—the first one —which is enough at this stage for Plaintiff ’s § 227(b) \nclaim to survive.  See 47 U.S.C. § 227 (b)(1) (“ any call” (emphasis added) ); Guadian v. United \nTax Def. LLC , No. EP -23-CV-00349- KC, 2024 WL 140249, at *6 (W.D. Tex. Jan. 12, 2024)  (“One \ncall can violate multiple subsections of the TCPA and thus be subject to multiple awards of damages.” (citing Lary v. Trinity Physician Fin. & Ins. Servs., 780 F.3d 1101, 1105–06 (11th Cir. 2015))) ; see also Skinner v. Switzer , 562 U.S. 521, 530 (2011) (“Rule 8(a)(2) . . . generally requires \nonly a plausible ‘short and plain’ statement of the plaintiff ’s claim, not an exposition of his legal \nargument.”) .  This is especially true , again, given that Freedom Forever  points to nothing in the \n \n3 See, e.g. , Nickson v. Advanced Mktg. & Processing, Inc. , No. CV DLB -22-2203, 2023 WL \n4932879, at *5 (D. Md. Aug. 2, 2023); Hampton v. Barclays Bank Delaware , No. 18-4071- DDC -ADM, \n2019 WL 4256371, at *6 (D. Kan. Sept. 9, 2019); Duran v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., 878 F. Supp. 2d 1312, \n1316 (S.D. Fla. 2012). Case 3:23-cv-00364-LS   Document 31   Filed 04/02/24   Page 7 of 10- 8 - \n FAC , or the incorporated Kixie  link, to negate all reasonable inferences that it used an ATDS to \nmake that one unsolicited call.4 \nLastly, Freedom Forever argues that  Plaintiff  fails to allege that it used an artificial or \nrecorded voice, and also mentions, without argument, that  Cardenas is not in fact its representative.  \nBut neither  contention ha s merit.  See Mot. at 3, 10–11.  First , Plaintiff  does not base his § 227(b) \nclaim on use of an artificial or prerecorded voice , but on ATDS use.  And second, the FAC alleges \nthat Cardenas is an authorized representative, employee, and/or agent  of Freedom Forever , FAC ¶ \n43, and whether Cardenas is in fact Freedom Forever’s representative is a question of fact  that is  \nnot appropriate at this stage .  See Stripling v. Jordan Prod. Co., 234 F.3d 863, 870 (5th Cir. 2000)  \n(whether an agency relationship exists is a question of fact ); Cunningham v. Foresters Fin. Servs., \nInc., 300 F. Supp. 3d 1004, 1016 (N.D. Ind. 2018)  (plaintiffs need only “generally allege” an \nagency relationship in a TCPA case because they cannot reasonably be expected to know the extent \nof the relationship between defendants and their alleged agents before discovery) ; see also Ramirez \nv. Escajeda , 921 F.3d 497, 501 (5th Cir. 2019) (“ Iqbal  does not allow us to question the credibility \nof the facts pleaded . . . .  Iqbal , instead, tells us to assume the veracity of well -pleaded factual \nallegations.”).  \n \n4 In its reply, Freedom Forever appears to quote some kind of transcript showing the first \nconversation between Plaintiff and Cardenas, in which Plaintiff purportedly confirms that he had an \nappointment.  See Reply at 3.  Freedom Forever argues that this interaction shows  that “[o]bviously, \nPlaintiff had consented to the call by scheduling an appointment” to purchase solar panels.  Id.  But  Freedom \nForever does not include a citation for this quote , and that quote is nowhere to be found within the FAC. \n \nAnd even if the Court were to consider this  quote, Freedom Forever fails to elaborate on  how it is \nobvious that Plaintiff consented to that first call by previously scheduling an appointment.  In fact, Freedom \nForever’s argument conflicts with  the fact that  during that same first call, Cardenas still had to ask  Plaintiff \nfor his consent to allow an expert to reach him back “[even] if [Plaintiff’s] number is listed on federal, state, \nor local do -not- call lists .”  See id. (quoting FAC ¶ 28).  Put another way, if, as Freedom Forever argues, \nPlaintiff had already consented to receive calls from Cardenas,  then why did Cardenas ask  Plaintiff for his \nconsent again  in such a way ? Case 3:23-cv-00364-LS   Document 31   Filed 04/02/24   Page 8 of 10- 9 - \n In sum , the Court concludes  that the FAC plausibly states a § 227(b) claim against Freedom \nForever  based on ATDS use  and therefore  RECOMMENDS that Freedom Forever’s Motion be \ndenied as to  such claim .  \nB. A permanent injunction is a form of relief, not a separate cause of action  \n \nFreedom Forever next asks the Court to dismiss Plaintiff’s request for a permanent \ninjunction in the FAC because he fails to allege an “imminent threat of repeated violations of the \nTCPA.”  Mot. at 13.  To obtain permanent injunctive relief, a plaintiff  must show that: (1) it has \nsuffered an irreparable injury; (2) the remedies available at law, such as monetary damages, are \ninadequate to compensate for that injury; (3)  the balance of hardships between the parties warrants \nan equitable remedy ; and (4) the permanent injunction would not disserve the public interest .  See \nITT Educ. Servs., Inc. v. Arce , 533 F.3d 342, 347 (5th Cir. 2008) .  But  courts apply this standard \nuntil after holding a full trial on the merits.  Id.  \nAnd a permanent injunction is  a form  of relief —not  a separate claim or cause of action .  \nSee, e.g., Johnson v. Wells Fargo Bank, NA , 999 F. Supp. 2d 919, 935 (N.D. Tex. 2014) ; Jensen \nv. Quality Loan Serv. Corp., 702 F. Supp. 2d 1183, 1201 (E.D. Cal. 2010) .  It follows then , that \ncourts will not dismiss a  complaint’s  request for a permanent injunction unless  they have also \ndismissed the  underlying claim requesting such relief.   See Tanglewood E. Homeowners v . \nCharles -Thomas, Inc., 849 F.2d 1568, 1576 (5th Cir. 1988) ( dismissal of claims based on their \nrequest for permanent injunct ion not proper subject of Rule 12(b)(6) motion) .  And this makes \nsense: a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) addresses the cause of action alleged and not the \nremedy sought.  See City of N.Y. v. A -1 Jewelry & Pawn, Inc. , 247 F.R.D. 296, 353 (E.D.N.Y. \n2007) . Case 3:23-cv-00364-LS   Document 31   Filed 04/02/24   Page 9 of 10- 10 - \n Because, as discussed above, Plaintiff’s TCPA claims  survive Freedom Forever’s \nchallenges under Rule 12(b)(6) , the Court RECOMMENDS that Freedom Forever’s Motion be \nDENIED  with respect to Plaintiff’s request for a permanent injunction . \nIV. RECOMMENDATION  \nAccordingly, the undersigned Magistrate Judge RECOMMENDS that Defendant \nFreedom Forever’s “Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff’s First Amended Complaint” be DENIED  (ECF \nNo. 17).  \n So ORDERED and SIGNED this   2nd  day of April  2024. \n \n  \n____________________________________ ANNE T.

    "summary": "1. **Summary:**\nThis case involved a securities fraud class action lawsuit against Quintus Corporation, which was accused of overstating its financial condition in its IPO registration and other financial statements. The class-action suit consolidated several lawsuits after Quintus filed for bankruptcy and its stock drastically fell in value. The court approved a $10.1 million settlement, finding it fair given the complexities and risks of further litigation. Though Quintus originally dealt with artificial intelligence software, the case does not involve claims directly related to AI.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue:**\nThe key legal issue was whether the proposed settlement agreement, following securities fraud allegations against Quintus for false financial statements, was fair, reasonable, and adequate for the class members.\n\n3. **Court's Holding:**\nThe court held that the settlement was fair and approved the class settlement and the plan of allocation. It also approved the application for attorney fees and reimbursement of expenses, concluding that the proposed settlement amount was appropriate given the circumstances.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation:**\nImagine a company that once made AI software, and later, it said it was more successful than it actually was. This caught the attention of people who bought the company's stock, expecting to make money. When the truth came out and the company went bankrupt, the stock price crashed, and the buyers lost a lot of money. Those buyers got together and sued the company. In the court's decision, it was like a teacher stepping in to say the company had to pay the students back some of what they lost. The teacher (judge) decided how to split the money and also covered the costs for the lawyers who helped get the money back.",

Quintus filed a registration statement inconnection with the Mustang acquisition on March 28, 2000.\nOn November 15, 2000, its first anniversary as a publicly\ntraded company, Quintus announced that it was reviewing previouslyfiled financial statements.  The price of Quintus shares fell from$6.00/share to $2.97/share before trading was halted by NASDAQshortly after noon, representing a one-day (or less) price drop ofjust over 50%.  On November 22, 2000, Quintus announced the resultsof a financial audit, which revealed that Quintus had overstatedrevenue on several occasions.  The truth regarding Quintus’sfinancial condition continued to emerge over the next few monthsand NASDAQ delisted Quintus stock on February 16, 2001.  After twodays of over-the-counter trading, the price of Quintus common stocksank to $0.14 on February 22, 2001, when Quintus filed for Chapter11 bankruptcy.\nA flurry of class actions alleging securities fraud wereCase 3:00-cv-04263-VRW   Document 281   Filed 12/05/06   Page 2 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n3filed in this court and ultimately consolidated.  Doc #71.  The\ncourt designated the law firm of Weiss & Yourman (now Weiss &Lurie) as lead counsel pursuant to a competitive selection process. See In re Quintus Sec Litig\n, 148 F Supp 2d 967 (ND Cal 2001). \nFollowing two rounds of motions to dismiss, the court designatedRoman Reznik as lead plaintiff.  Doc #201.  \nThe first amended consolidated class action complaint,\nDoc #215 (CAC), alleges that false and misleading statements ofmaterial fact appeared in the Quintus IPO registration statement,the Mustang registration statement and various periodic financialreports.  Accordingly, the CAC asserts claims under sections 11,12(a)(2) and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933 (the “1933 Act”) aswell as claims under sections 10(b), 14(a)(9) and 20(a) of theSecurities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “1934 Act”).  Id ¶¶291-357.\nThis litigation is only one current in Quintus’s wake. \nAs noted, Quintus initiated a Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceeding inthe United States District Court for the District of Delaware. Additionally, various shareholder actions were filed in Californiaand Texas state courts.  Thus, the proposed settlement presentlyunder consideration is part of a global settlement to beadministered by the Chapter 11 trustee.  \nOn July 7, 2006, the court preliminarily approved the\nproposed settlement and certified the class.  Doc #269.  The courtordered that notice of the pending settlement and final approvalhearing be mailed to potential class members on July 25, 2006.  Doc#273.  Over 20,000 notice letters were mailed to potentialsettlement class members and shareholders of record.  Doc #277 at¶5.

Id at ¶7-8.  Similarly, no objection was raised atthe final settlement approval hearing on December 5, 2006.\nII\nThe proposed settlement agreement provides that\ndefendants will pay $10.1 million in cash into a common fund to bedistributed to class members. \nThe question currently before the court is whether this\nsettlement should be approved.  “The court must approve anysettlement, voluntary dismissal, or compromise of the claims,issues, or defenses of a certified class.”  FRCP 23(e)(1)(A).  Thecourt bears in mind the Ninth Circuit’s “strong judicial policythat favors settlement, particularly where complex class actionlitigation is concerned.”  Class Plaintiffs v City of Seattle\n, 355\nF2d 1268, 1276 (9th Cir 1992).  While no class member has objected,the court must still review the proposed settlement.  Manual forComplex Litigation (Fourth) §21.635 (“Even if there are no or fewobjections or adverse appearances before or at the fairnesshearing, the judge must ensure that there is sufficient record asto the basis and justification for the settlement”).\nThe court may approve a settlement “only after a hearing\nand on finding that the settlement * * * is fair, reasonable andadequate.”  FRCP 23(e)(1)(C).  A final approval hearing was held onDecember 5, 2006.  The Ninth Circuit has set forth the followingfactors for courts considering approval of class actionsettlements: Case 3:00-cv-04263-VRW   Document 281   Filed 12/05/06   Page 4 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n5(1) the strength of the plaintiffs’ case; (2) the risk,\nexpense, complexity, and likely duration of furtherlitigation; (3) the risk of maintaining class actionstatus throughout the trial; (4) the amount offered insettlement; (5) the extent of discovery completed and thestate of the proceedings; (6) the experience and views ofcounsel; (7) the presence of a governmental participant;and (8) the reaction of the class members to the proposedsettlement. \nChurchill Village v General Electric\n, 361 F3d 566, 575 (9th Cir\n2004).  These factors overwhelmingly support approval of the classsettlement.  The court discusses the settlement evaluation factorsthat are relevant in this case.  Id at 576 n7.\nThis settlement follows six years of protracted\nlitigation, discovery and negotiation.  Further litigation wouldrequire plaintiffs to survive motions for summary judgment and, ifsuccessful, present their case to a jury.  The considerable riskand cost associated with further litigation is enhanced byQuintus’s pending bankruptcy litigation.  This court noted early inthese proceedings that “plaintiffs are going to have troublefinding deep pockets in this case.”  Doc #85 at 37.  This globalsettlement divides the limited resources of a bankrupt corporationamong the many litigants suing Quintus.  Doc #276 at ¶ 6.  Much ofthe remaining value to be apportioned among the litigants is fromQuintus’s directors and officers liability insurance policies.  Thesettlement class, however, is receiving the “lion’s share” of theinsurance coverage.  Doc #276 at ¶46.  Weighing the risks and costsof further litigation, the court concludes that this settlement isadvisable.\nThe settlement amount, $10.1 million, closely resembles\nthe $9,996,000 settlement predicted by the Haas Study\n referenced by\nthis court in its previous order.  Quintus , 148 F Supp 2d at 985. Case 3:00-cv-04263-VRW   Document 281   Filed 12/05/06   Page 5 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n6This proposed settlement’s settlement/potential investor loss (PIL)\nratio of 16.83% marginally exceeds the average class actionsecurities litigation settlement/PIL ratio of 16.66%.  MukeshBajaj, Sumon C Mazumdar & Atuya Sarin, Securities Class Action\nSettlements , 43 Santa Clara L Rev 101, 116 tbl 11 (2003). \nAchieving the average settlement/PIL ratio despite having tocompete with Quintus’s bankruptcy estate for remaining resourcesindicates the fairness of this settlement to class members.\nFollowing the hearing, plaintiffs’ counsel expressed\nconcern that courts’ use of studies to predict recovery at theoutset of litigation may tend to cap recovery at that level.  Whilethe court does not discount that concern, it warrants mention thatthe Haas study data reflect a range of litigation results.  Anyindividual case may differ and differ significantly from theaverage or median results.  In any event, the obstacles to agreater recovery in this case were substantial.  Given thosedifficulties, a recovery within the average range may wellrepresent an achievement that is greater than average.  \nFinally, the absence of any objections or requests for\nexclusion among a class of this size demonstrates the overallreasonableness of this settlement.  \nThe risk and cost of further litigation, the settlement\namount and the silence of class members provide powerful evidencethat the settlement is fair, reasonable and adequate.  Accordingly,plaintiffs’ motion for final approval of the class actionsettlement is GRANTED.////Case 3:00-cv-04263-VRW   Document 281   Filed 12/05/06   Page 6 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n7III\nPlaintiffs also seek final approval of the plan of\nallocation of the settlement fund.  Doc #274.  The plan ofallocation operates as follows: \nTo the extent there are sufficient funds in the Net\nSettlement Fund, each Authorized Claimant will receive anamount equal to the Authorized Claimant’s claim.  If,however, the amount in the Net Settlement Fund is notsufficient to permit payment of the total claim of eachAuthorized Claimant, then each Authorized Claimant shallbe paid the percentage that each Authorized Claimant’sclaim bears to the total of the claims of all AuthorizedClaimants.  A claim will be computed as follows: theclaim shall be equal to the amount paid for shares ofQuintus common stock purchased or acquired by SettlementClass members during the Settlement Class Period, less:(a) the amount realized from the sale of any such sharesduring the Settlement Class Period or through February22, 2001, or $0.14 per share, whichever is greater; or(b) the number of any such shares held at the close ofbusiness on February 22, 2001, multiplied by $0.14 (theclosing price of Quintus stock on February 22, 2001).\nDoc #277 Ex A at 10.  The plan of allocation was fully described innotice letters to potential class members and no objections weresubmitted to the court or raised at the hearing.\nThe court has discretion to approve a plan of allocation\nthat is fair and reasonable.  In re Heritage Bond Litigation\n, 2005\nUS Dist LEXIS 13555 at *38 (CD Cal 2005).  “A plan of allocationthat reimburses class members based on the extent of their injuriesis generally reasonable.”  Id (quoting In re Oracle Securities\nLitigation , 1994 US Dist LEXIS 21593 at *1 (ND Cal 1994)).  Because this plan provides proportional reimbursement and\nno class member objected, the court concludes the plan ofallocation is fair and reasonable.  Accordingly, the motion forfinal approval of the plan of allocation is GRANTED.Case 3:00-cv-04263-VRW   Document 281   Filed 12/05/06   Page 7 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n8IV\nLead plaintiff and his counsel seek an award of attorney\nfees and expenses totaling $1,141,978.40.  Doc #275 at 16.  Thisamount includes attorney fees of $817,500, expenses of $150,000,reimbursement of fees and expenses of bankruptcy counsel of$162,478.40 and reimbursement of $12,000 to the lead plaintiff. Id.  The fees and expenses sought amount to 11.3% of the totalsettlement amount.\nThe court preliminarily approved an award of attorney\nfees and expenses in its July 7, 2006, order.  Doc #269 at 21. This request differs by including $15,096.40 of additional fees andexpenses of bankruptcy counsel and $12,000 in reimbursement to leadplaintiff.  The court anticipated such an increase in the amountsought for bankruptcy counsel.  Id.  Lead plaintiff, however, seeksreimbursement for 80 hours of his time at a rate of $150/hour forthe first time.  Doc #276 Ex 5 at ¶¶2-3.  The court is authorizedto reimburse lead plaintiff for reasonable costs and expensesrelated to the representation of the class, including lost wages. 15 USC §78u-4(a)(4).  As a registered securities principal and theprincipal of RAMA Financial, lead plaintiff’s request forcompensation is reasonable.  Doc #276 Ex 5 at ¶3.\nThese minor increases in the amount requested do not\ndisturb the court’s prior conclusion that “the amount of attorneyfees (including those incurred by bankruptcy counsel) is relativelymodest in relation to the total class recovery.”  Doc #269 at 21. This court, however, “rejects reliance solely on a comparison ofthe percentage fee requested here with other percentage awards orwith a so-called benchmark percentage.”  In re HPL Technologies,Case 3:00-cv-04263-VRW   Document 281   Filed 12/05/06   Page 8 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n9Inc Sec Litig , 366 F Supp 2d 912, 914 (ND Cal 2005).  Instead, the\ncourt employs a lodestar cross-check to determine thereasonableness of the requested attorney fees.\n“Three figures are salient in a lodestar calculation: (1)\ncounsel’s reasonable hours, (2) counsel’s reasonable hourly rateand (3) a multiplier thought to compensate for various factors.” Id at 919.  In performing a cross-check, the court calculates theimplied multiplier to determine its reasonableness.  Lead counselhas spent more than 5,000 attorney hours in this matter, most ofthem by senior attorneys.  Doc #275 Ex 1.  Applying the Laffey\nmatrix hourly rates, as adjusted for Los Angeles and cost of livingincreases, lead counsel calculates its lodestar as $1,976,262.50. Id at 12 and Ex 1.  The requested attorney fees of $817,500, lessthan half the lodestar, provide an implied lodestar multiplier of0.414.  Id at 13.  This multiplier is indeed reasonable, indicatingclass members obtained a significant discount on market attorneyrates.  Notably, competitive selection of class counsel producedthis low loadstar ratio or negative multiplier.  Quintus\n, 148 F\nSupp 2d 967.  Despite any statutory limitation on use ofcompetitive selection, see In re Cavanaugh\n, 306 F3d 726 (9th Cir\n2002), this provides further evidence that courts may look to thecompetitive selection cases in determining a reasonable level offees and costs.  See In re Cabletron, Inc Securities Litigation\n,\n2006 US Dist LEXIS 75188 (D NH 2006).\nThe requested attorney fees and expenses are reasonable\ncompensation for the value provided to the class.  This is furtherevidenced by the lack of class member objections to thepreliminarily approved attorney fees and expenses included in theCase 3:00-cv-04263-VRW   Document 281   Filed 12/05/06   Page 9 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n10\nclass notice.\nAccordingly, the application for award of attorney fees\nand reimbursement of expenses is GRANTED.\nIT IS SO ORDERED.\n                                   \nVAUGHN R WALKERUnited States District Chief JudgeCase 3:00-cv-04263-VRW   Document 281   Filed 12/05/06   Page 10 of 10",

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: This court opinion pertains to a consolidated securities fraud class action involving Quintus Corporation. The lawsuit, which claimed securities fraud due to misleading financial statements during a specific period, concluded with a settlement amount of $10.1 million to be distributed among affected shareholders. The court approved the settlement as fair, reasonable, and adequate, considering the challenges of further litigation and Quintus's bankruptcy status. The case involved Quintus's use of \"e-Customer Relationship Management\" (eCRM) solutions powered by artificial intelligence.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the proposed settlement agreement for the securities fraud class action lawsuit against Quintus Corporation should be approved as fair, reasonable, and adequate.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court held that the proposed settlement was fair, reasonable, and adequate. It granted final approval of the settlement agreement, the plan of allocation, and the application for attorney fees, expenses, and reimbursement.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine a company called Quintus that used smart technology to manage customer relationships. They sold pieces of their company (stocks) saying they were doing really well. But later on, people found out they weren't telling the truth about how much money they were making. Those who bought stocks got upset and went to court. The court decided that instead of a long fight, everyone agreed the company should pay $10.1 million to the stock buyers who lost money because of these false promises. The judge made sure this was a fair deal for everyone involved.",

Lead plaintiff, however, seeksreimbursement for 80 hours of his time at a rate of $150/hour forthe first time.  Doc #276 Ex 5 at ¶¶2-3.  The court is authorizedto reimburse lead plaintiff for reasonable costs and expensesrelated to the representation of the class, including lost wages. 15 USC §78u-4(a)(4).  As a registered securities principal and theprincipal of RAMA Financial, lead plaintiff’s request forcompensation is reasonable.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: This case involves a consolidated securities fraud class action against Quintus Corporation, focusing on misleading financial statements during its IPO and various financial reports. The court approved a $10.1 million settlement to be distributed among class members due to the overstated revenues and the subsequent financial downfall of Quintus, leading to bankruptcy. Despite the involvement of artificial intelligence in Quintus's business operations, the case revolves around securities fraud, not directly implicating AI or automated systems.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the proposed class action settlement of $10.1 million is fair, reasonable, and appropriate given the allegations of securities fraud related to misleading financial statements by Quintus Corporation.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The United States District Court for the Northern District of California approved the settlement, finding it fair, reasonable, and adequate considering the high risk and cost of continued litigation, the limited resources from Quintus's bankruptcy estate, and the absence of objections from class members.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine you invested in a company because they said they were doing really well, but then you found out they weren't honest about their finances, which made their stock price crash. Lots of people were upset and decided to sue the company. In the end, the company agreed to pay a big amount of money to all the people who lost money from buying their stocks. The judge checked to make sure this payout was fair, and nobody argued against it, so he said it was okay to go ahead with the plan.",

During the class period, Quintusprovided “e-Customer Relationship Management” or “eCRM” solutions,primarily through its “eContact” software.  Quintus grew through aseries of acquisitions in 1997 through 1999.  \nAs part of an initial public offering completed November\n15, 1999, Quintus sold 5.175 million shares of Quintus common stockat $18/share.  Consistent with those heady times, the stock pricesoon reached $55/share. On February 28, 2000, Quintus announcedits intent to acquire Mustang.com, which developed corporate e-mailmanagement software.  Quintus filed a registration statement inconnection with the Mustang acquisition on March 28, 2000.\nOn November 15, 2000, its first anniversary as a publicly\ntraded company, Quintus announced that it was reviewing previouslyfiled financial statements.  The price of Quintus shares fell from$6.00/share to $2.97/share before trading was halted by NASDAQshortly after noon, representing a one-day (or less) price drop ofjust over 50%.  On November 22, 2000, Quintus announced the resultsof a financial audit, which revealed that Quintus had overstatedrevenue on several occasions.  The truth regarding Quintus’sfinancial condition continued to emerge over the next few monthsand NASDAQ delisted Quintus stock on February 16, 2001.  After twodays of over-the-counter trading, the price of Quintus common stocksank to $0.14 on February 22, 2001, when Quintus filed for Chapter11 bankruptcy.\nA flurry of class actions alleging securities fraud wereCase 3:00-cv-04346-VRW   Document 13   Filed 12/05/06   Page 2 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n3filed in this court and ultimately consolidated.  Doc #71.  The\ncourt designated the law firm of Weiss & Yourman (now Weiss &Lurie) as lead counsel pursuant to a competitive selection process. See In re Quintus Sec Litig\n, 148 F Supp 2d 967 (ND Cal 2001). \nFollowing two rounds of motions to dismiss, the court designatedRoman Reznik as lead plaintiff.  Doc #201.  \nThe first amended consolidated class action complaint,\nDoc #215 (CAC), alleges that false and misleading statements ofmaterial fact appeared in the Quintus IPO registration statement,the Mustang registration statement and various periodic financialreports.  Accordingly, the CAC asserts claims under sections 11,12(a)(2) and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933 (the “1933 Act”) aswell as claims under sections 10(b), 14(a)(9) and 20(a) of theSecurities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “1934 Act”).  Id ¶¶291-357.\nThis litigation is only one current in Quintus’s wake. \nAs noted, Quintus initiated a Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceeding inthe United States District Court for the District of Delaware. Additionally, various shareholder actions were filed in Californiaand Texas state courts.  Thus, the proposed settlement presentlyunder consideration is part of a global settlement to beadministered by the Chapter 11 trustee.  \nOn July 7, 2006, the court preliminarily approved the\nproposed settlement and certified the class.  Doc #269.  The courtordered that notice of the pending settlement and final approvalhearing be mailed to potential class members on July 25, 2006.  Doc#273.  Over 20,000 notice letters were mailed to potentialsettlement class members and shareholders of record.  Doc #277 at¶5.  Not a single class member objected to the settlement orCase 3:00-cv-04346-VRW   Document 13   Filed 12/05/06   Page 3 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n4requested exclusion from the class settlement in response to the\nnotice letter.  Id at ¶7-8.  Similarly, no objection was raised atthe final settlement approval hearing on December 5, 2006.\nII\nThe proposed settlement agreement provides that\ndefendants will pay $10.1 million in cash into a common fund to bedistributed to class members. \nThe question currently before the court is whether this\nsettlement should be approved.  “The court must approve anysettlement, voluntary dismissal, or compromise of the claims,issues, or defenses of a certified class.”  FRCP 23(e)(1)(A).  Thecourt bears in mind the Ninth Circuit’s “strong judicial policythat favors settlement, particularly where complex class actionlitigation is concerned.”  Class Plaintiffs v City of Seattle\n, 355\nF2d 1268, 1276 (9th Cir 1992).  While no class member has objected,the court must still review the proposed settlement.  Manual forComplex Litigation (Fourth) §21.635 (“Even if there are no or fewobjections or adverse appearances before or at the fairnesshearing, the judge must ensure that there is sufficient record asto the basis and justification for the settlement”).\nThe court may approve a settlement “only after a hearing\nand on finding that the settlement * * * is fair, reasonable andadequate.”  FRCP 23(e)(1)(C).  A final approval hearing was held onDecember 5, 2006.  The Ninth Circuit has set forth the followingfactors for courts considering approval of class actionsettlements: Case 3:00-cv-04346-VRW   Document 13   Filed 12/05/06   Page 4 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n5(1) the strength of the plaintiffs’ case; (2) the risk,\nexpense, complexity, and likely duration of furtherlitigation; (3) the risk of maintaining class actionstatus throughout the trial; (4) the amount offered insettlement; (5) the extent of discovery completed and thestate of the proceedings; (6) the experience and views ofcounsel; (7) the presence of a governmental participant;and (8) the reaction of the class members to the proposedsettlement. \nChurchill Village v General Electric\n, 361 F3d 566, 575 (9th Cir\n2004).  These factors overwhelmingly support approval of the classsettlement.  The court discusses the settlement evaluation factorsthat are relevant in this case.  Id at 576 n7.\nThis settlement follows six years of protracted\nlitigation, discovery and negotiation.  Further litigation wouldrequire plaintiffs to survive motions for summary judgment and, ifsuccessful, present their case to a jury.  The considerable riskand cost associated with further litigation is enhanced byQuintus’s pending bankruptcy litigation.  This court noted early inthese proceedings that “plaintiffs are going to have troublefinding deep pockets in this case.”  Doc #85 at 37.  This globalsettlement divides the limited resources of a bankrupt corporationamong the many litigants suing Quintus.  Doc #276 at ¶ 6.  Much ofthe remaining value to be apportioned among the litigants is fromQuintus’s directors and officers liability insurance policies.  Thesettlement class, however, is receiving the “lion’s share” of theinsurance coverage.  Doc #276 at ¶46.  Weighing the risks and costsof further litigation, the court concludes that this settlement isadvisable.\nThe settlement amount, $10.1 million, closely resembles\nthe $9,996,000 settlement predicted by the Haas Study\n referenced by\nthis court in its previous order.  Quintus , 148 F Supp 2d at 985.

MukeshBajaj, Sumon C Mazumdar & Atuya Sarin, Securities Class Action\nSettlements , 43 Santa Clara L Rev 101, 116 tbl 11 (2003). \nAchieving the average settlement/PIL ratio despite having tocompete with Quintus’s bankruptcy estate for remaining resourcesindicates the fairness of this settlement to class members.\nFollowing the hearing, plaintiffs’ counsel expressed\nconcern that courts’ use of studies to predict recovery at theoutset of litigation may tend to cap recovery at that level.  Whilethe court does not discount that concern, it warrants mention thatthe Haas study data reflect a range of litigation results.  Anyindividual case may differ and differ significantly from theaverage or median results.  In any event, the obstacles to agreater recovery in this case were substantial.  Given thosedifficulties, a recovery within the average range may wellrepresent an achievement that is greater than average.  \nFinally, the absence of any objections or requests for\nexclusion among a class of this size demonstrates the overallreasonableness of this settlement.  \nThe risk and cost of further litigation, the settlement\namount and the silence of class members provide powerful evidencethat the settlement is fair, reasonable and adequate.  Accordingly,plaintiffs’ motion for final approval of the class actionsettlement is GRANTED.////Case 3:00-cv-04346-VRW   Document 13   Filed 12/05/06   Page 6 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n7III\nPlaintiffs also seek final approval of the plan of\nallocation of the settlement fund.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: This court opinion details the approval of a $10.1 million settlement in a securities fraud class action lawsuit against Quintus Corporation, which provided eCRM solutions through AI software during 1999-2000. The case centers on the company's overstated financial statements, resulting in a class action lawsuit after Quintus’s stock value plummeted and the company went bankrupt. The court granted final approval of the settlement, including attorney fees, because the settlement terms were deemed fair and reasonable.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the proposed class settlement and the plan of allocation in a securities fraud lawsuit against Quintus Corporation were fair, reasonable, and adequate under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(e).\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court held that the proposed settlement and plan of allocation were fair, reasonable, and adequate.

But then it was revealed that Quintus had not been truthful about its finances. The company's stock price dropped dramatically, and it went bankrupt, which upset a lot of people who had bought its stock. They went to court, and after years of legal tussle, the court decided on a fair way to divide the limited money left. It also made sure the lawyers didn’t charge too much for their work. In the end, the court said the plan they came up with was good, so everyone could move on.",

Doc #201.  \nThe first amended consolidated class action complaint,\nDoc #215 (CAC), alleges that false and misleading statements ofmaterial fact appeared in the Quintus IPO registration statement,the Mustang registration statement and various periodic financialreports.

Thecourt bears in mind the Ninth Circuit’s “strong judicial policythat favors settlement, particularly where complex class actionlitigation is concerned.”  Class Plaintiffs v City of Seattle\n, 355\nF2d 1268, 1276 (9th Cir 1992).  While no class member has objected,the court must still review the proposed settlement.  Manual forComplex Litigation (Fourth) §21.635 (“Even if there are no or fewobjections or adverse appearances before or at the fairnesshearing, the judge must ensure that there is sufficient record asto the basis and justification for the settlement”).\nThe court may approve a settlement “only after a hearing\nand on finding that the settlement * * * is fair, reasonable andadequate.”  FRCP 23(e)(1)(C).  A final approval hearing was held onDecember 5, 2006.  The Ninth Circuit has set forth the followingfactors for courts considering approval of class actionsettlements: Case 3:00-cv-04528-VRW   Document 14   Filed 12/05/06   Page 4 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n5(1) the strength of the plaintiffs’ case; (2) the risk,\nexpense, complexity, and likely duration of furtherlitigation; (3) the risk of maintaining class actionstatus throughout the trial; (4) the amount offered insettlement; (5) the extent of discovery completed and thestate of the proceedings; (6) the experience and views ofcounsel; (7) the presence of a governmental participant;and (8) the reaction of the class members to the proposedsettlement. \nChurchill Village v General Electric\n, 361 F3d 566, 575 (9th Cir\n2004).  These factors overwhelmingly support approval of the classsettlement.  The court discusses the settlement evaluation factorsthat are relevant in this case.  Id at 576 n7.\nThis settlement follows six years of protracted\nlitigation, discovery and negotiation.  Further litigation wouldrequire plaintiffs to survive motions for summary judgment and, ifsuccessful, present their case to a jury.  The considerable riskand cost associated with further litigation is enhanced byQuintus’s pending bankruptcy litigation.  This court noted early inthese proceedings that “plaintiffs are going to have troublefinding deep pockets in this case.”  Doc #85 at 37.  This globalsettlement divides the limited resources of a bankrupt corporationamong the many litigants suing Quintus.  Doc #276 at ¶ 6.  Much ofthe remaining value to be apportioned among the litigants is fromQuintus’s directors and officers liability insurance policies.  Thesettlement class, however, is receiving the “lion’s share” of theinsurance coverage.  Doc #276 at ¶46.  Weighing the risks and costsof further litigation, the court concludes that this settlement isadvisable.\nThe settlement amount, $10.1 million, closely resembles\nthe $9,996,000 settlement predicted by the Haas Study\n referenced by\nthis court in its previous order.  Quintus , 148 F Supp 2d at 985. Case 3:00-cv-04528-VRW   Document 14   Filed 12/05/06   Page 5 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n6This proposed settlement’s settlement/potential investor loss (PIL)\nratio of 16.83% marginally exceeds the average class actionsecurities litigation settlement/PIL ratio of 16.66%.  MukeshBajaj, Sumon C Mazumdar & Atuya Sarin, Securities Class Action\nSettlements , 43 Santa Clara L Rev 101, 116 tbl 11 (2003). \nAchieving the average settlement/PIL ratio despite having tocompete with Quintus’s bankruptcy estate for remaining resourcesindicates the fairness of this settlement to class members.\nFollowing the hearing, plaintiffs’ counsel expressed\nconcern that courts’ use of studies to predict recovery at theoutset of litigation may tend to cap recovery at that level.  Whilethe court does not discount that concern, it warrants mention thatthe Haas study data reflect a range of litigation results.  Anyindividual case may differ and differ significantly from theaverage or median results.  In any event, the obstacles to agreater recovery in this case were substantial.  Given thosedifficulties, a recovery within the average range may wellrepresent an achievement that is greater than average.  \nFinally, the absence of any objections or requests for\nexclusion among a class of this size demonstrates the overallreasonableness of this settlement.  \nThe risk and cost of further litigation, the settlement\namount and the silence of class members provide powerful evidencethat the settlement is fair, reasonable and adequate.  Accordingly,plaintiffs’ motion for final approval of the class actionsettlement is GRANTED.////Case 3:00-cv-04528-VRW   Document 14   Filed 12/05/06   Page 6 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n7III\nPlaintiffs also seek final approval of the plan of\nallocation of the settlement fund.  Doc #274.  The plan ofallocation operates as follows: \nTo the extent there are sufficient funds in the Net\nSettlement Fund, each Authorized Claimant will receive anamount equal to the Authorized Claimant’s claim.  If,however, the amount in the Net Settlement Fund is notsufficient to permit payment of the total claim of eachAuthorized Claimant, then each Authorized Claimant shallbe paid the percentage that each Authorized Claimant’sclaim bears to the total of the claims of all AuthorizedClaimants.  A claim will be computed as follows: theclaim shall be equal to the amount paid for shares ofQuintus common stock purchased or acquired by SettlementClass members during the Settlement Class Period, less:(a) the amount realized from the sale of any such sharesduring the Settlement Class Period or through February22, 2001, or $0.14 per share, whichever is greater; or(b) the number of any such shares held at the close ofbusiness on February 22, 2001, multiplied by $0.14 (theclosing price of Quintus stock on February 22, 2001).\nDoc #277 Ex A at 10.  The plan of allocation was fully described innotice letters to potential class members and no objections weresubmitted to the court or raised at the hearing.\nThe court has discretion to approve a plan of allocation\nthat is fair and reasonable.  In re Heritage Bond Litigation\n, 2005\nUS Dist LEXIS 13555 at *38 (CD Cal 2005).  “A plan of allocationthat reimburses class members based on the extent of their injuriesis generally reasonable.”  Id (quoting In re Oracle Securities\nLitigation , 1994 US Dist LEXIS 21593 at *1 (ND Cal 1994)).  Because this plan provides proportional reimbursement and\nno class member objected, the court concludes the plan ofallocation is fair and reasonable.  Accordingly, the motion forfinal approval of the plan of allocation is GRANTED.Case 3:00-cv-04528-VRW   Document 14   Filed 12/05/06   Page 7 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n8IV\nLead plaintiff and his counsel seek an award of attorney\nfees and expenses totaling $1,141,978.40.  Doc #275 at 16.  Thisamount includes attorney fees of $817,500, expenses of $150,000,reimbursement of fees and expenses of bankruptcy counsel of$162,478.40 and reimbursement of $12,000 to the lead plaintiff. Id.  The fees and expenses sought amount to 11.3% of the totalsettlement amount.\nThe court preliminarily approved an award of attorney\nfees and expenses in its July 7, 2006, order.  Doc #269 at 21. This request differs by including $15,096.40 of additional fees andexpenses of bankruptcy counsel and $12,000 in reimbursement to leadplaintiff.  The court anticipated such an increase in the amountsought for bankruptcy counsel.  Id.  Lead plaintiff, however, seeksreimbursement for 80 hours of his time at a rate of $150/hour forthe first time.  Doc #276 Ex 5 at ¶¶2-3.  The court is authorizedto reimburse lead plaintiff for reasonable costs and expensesrelated to the representation of the class, including lost wages. 15 USC §78u-4(a)(4).  As a registered securities principal and theprincipal of RAMA Financial, lead plaintiff’s request forcompensation is reasonable.  Doc #276 Ex 5 at ¶3.\nThese minor increases in the amount requested do not\ndisturb the court’s prior conclusion that “the amount of attorneyfees (including those incurred by bankruptcy counsel) is relativelymodest in relation to the total class recovery.”  Doc #269 at 21. This court, however, “rejects reliance solely on a comparison ofthe percentage fee requested here with other percentage awards orwith a so-called benchmark percentage.”  In re HPL Technologies,Case 3:00-cv-04528-VRW   Document 14   Filed 12/05/06   Page 8 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n9Inc Sec Litig , 366 F Supp 2d 912, 914 (ND Cal 2005).  Instead, the\ncourt employs a lodestar cross-check to determine thereasonableness of the requested attorney fees.\n“Three figures are salient in a lodestar calculation: (1)\ncounsel’s reasonable hours, (2) counsel’s reasonable hourly rateand (3) a multiplier thought to compensate for various factors.” Id at 919.  In performing a cross-check, the court calculates theimplied multiplier to determine its reasonableness.  Lead counselhas spent more than 5,000 attorney hours in this matter, most ofthem by senior attorneys.  Doc #275 Ex 1.  Applying the Laffey\nmatrix hourly rates, as adjusted for Los Angeles and cost of livingincreases, lead counsel calculates its lodestar as $1,976,262.50. Id at 12 and Ex 1.  The requested attorney fees of $817,500, lessthan half the lodestar, provide an implied lodestar multiplier of0.414.  Id at 13.  This multiplier is indeed reasonable, indicatingclass members obtained a significant discount on market attorneyrates.  Notably, competitive selection of class counsel producedthis low loadstar ratio or negative multiplier.  Quintus\n, 148 F\nSupp 2d 967.  Despite any statutory limitation on use ofcompetitive selection, see In re Cavanaugh\n, 306 F3d 726 (9th Cir\n2002), this provides further evidence that courts may look to thecompetitive selection cases in determining a reasonable level offees and costs.  See In re Cabletron, Inc Securities Litigation\n,\n2006 US Dist LEXIS 75188 (D NH 2006).\nThe requested attorney fees and expenses are reasonable\ncompensation for the value provided to the class.  This is furtherevidenced by the lack of class member objections to thepreliminarily approved attorney fees and expenses included in theCase 3:00-cv-04528-VRW   Document 14   Filed 12/05/06   Page 9 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n10\nclass notice.\nAccordingly, the application for award of attorney fees\nand reimbursement of expenses is GRANTED.\nIT IS SO ORDERED.\n                                   \nVAUGHN R WALKERUnited States District Chief JudgeCase 3:00-cv-04528-VRW   Document 14   Filed 12/05/06   Page 10 of 10",

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: This case is a consolidated securities fraud class action involving Quintus Corporation, a company primarily dealing with e-Customer Relationship Management software. Plaintiffs alleged that Quintus made false and misleading statements in its financial documents and securities offerings. The court approved a $10.1 million settlement for the plaintiffs and authorized the reimbursement of attorney fees and expenses. The case indirectly involves artificial intelligence through Quintus’s primary business in AI software.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the proposed settlement agreement and plan of allocation of the settlement fund in this securities fraud class action are fair, reasonable, and adequate under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court granted final approval of the class settlement, concluding it to be fair, reasonable, and adequate. It also approved the plan of allocation and the application for the award of attorney fees and expenses, finding them reasonable in light of the litigation circumstances.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine Quintus is a company that uses technology to help other businesses manage their customer interactions. They told people their business was doing better than it really was. When the truth came out, people who invested in the company lost a lot of money. These investors sued Quintus to get some of their money back. The court decided that the company should pay the investors $10.1 million to settle the issue, and everyone involved agreed that this was a good solution. The judge also made sure the lawyers got paid for their work in helping the investors get their money.",

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: This case is a securities fraud class action involving Quintus Corporation, which during the class period provided e-Customer Relationship Management (eCRM) solutions via its eContact software. After Quintus revealed overstated revenues and subsequently filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, its share price collapsed, triggering a series of securities fraud lawsuits. The court approved a $10.1 million settlement agreement for the class members and granted attorney fees and expenses.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the court should approve the proposed settlement and plan of allocation, as well as the application for attorney fees and reimbursement of expenses, in the context of a securities fraud class action against Quintus Corporation.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court granted final approval of the settlement and plan of allocation, finding them to be fair, reasonable, and adequate based on factors such as the litigation's risk and cost, the settlement amount, and the absence of objections from class members. The court also approved the application for attorney fees and reimbursement of expenses as reasonable.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine a company promised they made a lot more money than they actually did, and when people found out, the company's stock value crashed. Those who lost money from buying the stock got together to sue the company. The court decided on a plan that gives these people some money back, and the court made sure the plan was fair before giving it the green light. Similarly, the lawyers who worked hard on the case asked to be paid, and the court checked to make sure their payment was fair too.",

During the class period, Quintusprovided “e-Customer Relationship Management” or “eCRM” solutions,primarily through its “eContact” software.  Quintus grew through aseries of acquisitions in 1997 through 1999.  \nAs part of an initial public offering completed November\n15, 1999, Quintus sold 5.175 million shares of Quintus common stockat $18/share.  Consistent with those heady times, the stock pricesoon reached $55/share. On February 28, 2000, Quintus announcedits intent to acquire Mustang.com, which developed corporate e-mailmanagement software.  Quintus filed a registration statement inconnection with the Mustang acquisition on March 28, 2000.\nOn November 15, 2000, its first anniversary as a publicly\ntraded company, Quintus announced that it was reviewing previouslyfiled financial statements.  The price of Quintus shares fell from$6.00/share to $2.97/share before trading was halted by NASDAQshortly after noon, representing a one-day (or less) price drop ofjust over 50%.  On November 22, 2000, Quintus announced the resultsof a financial audit, which revealed that Quintus had overstatedrevenue on several occasions.  The truth regarding Quintus’sfinancial condition continued to emerge over the next few monthsand NASDAQ delisted Quintus stock on February 16, 2001.  After twodays of over-the-counter trading, the price of Quintus common stocksank to $0.14 on February 22, 2001, when Quintus filed for Chapter11 bankruptcy.\nA flurry of class actions alleging securities fraud wereCase 3:01-cv-00096-VRW   Document 17   Filed 12/05/06   Page 2 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n3filed in this court and ultimately consolidated.  Doc #71.  The\ncourt designated the law firm of Weiss & Yourman (now Weiss &Lurie) as lead counsel pursuant to a competitive selection process. See In re Quintus Sec Litig\n, 148 F Supp 2d 967 (ND Cal 2001). \nFollowing two rounds of motions to dismiss, the court designatedRoman Reznik as lead plaintiff.  Doc #201.  \nThe first amended consolidated class action complaint,\nDoc #215 (CAC), alleges that false and misleading statements ofmaterial fact appeared in the Quintus IPO registration statement,the Mustang registration statement and various periodic financialreports.  Accordingly, the CAC asserts claims under sections 11,12(a)(2) and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933 (the “1933 Act”) aswell as claims under sections 10(b), 14(a)(9) and 20(a) of theSecurities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “1934 Act”).  Id ¶¶291-357.\nThis litigation is only one current in Quintus’s wake. \nAs noted, Quintus initiated a Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceeding inthe United States District Court for the District of Delaware. Additionally, various shareholder actions were filed in Californiaand Texas state courts.  Thus, the proposed settlement presentlyunder consideration is part of a global settlement to beadministered by the Chapter 11 trustee.  \nOn July 7, 2006, the court preliminarily approved the\nproposed settlement and certified the class.  Doc #269.  The courtordered that notice of the pending settlement and final approvalhearing be mailed to potential class members on July 25, 2006.  Doc#273.  Over 20,000 notice letters were mailed to potentialsettlement class members and shareholders of record.  Doc #277 at¶5.  Not a single class member objected to the settlement orCase 3:01-cv-00096-VRW   Document 17   Filed 12/05/06   Page 3 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n4requested exclusion from the class settlement in response to the\nnotice letter.  Id at ¶7-8.  Similarly, no objection was raised atthe final settlement approval hearing on December 5, 2006.\nII\nThe proposed settlement agreement provides that\ndefendants will pay $10.1 million in cash into a common fund to bedistributed to class members. \nThe question currently before the court is whether this\nsettlement should be approved.  “The court must approve anysettlement, voluntary dismissal, or compromise of the claims,issues, or defenses of a certified class.”  FRCP 23(e)(1)(A).  Thecourt bears in mind the Ninth Circuit’s “strong judicial policythat favors settlement, particularly where complex class actionlitigation is concerned.”  Class Plaintiffs v City of Seattle\n, 355\nF2d 1268, 1276 (9th Cir 1992).  While no class member has objected,the court must still review the proposed settlement.  Manual forComplex Litigation (Fourth) §21.635 (“Even if there are no or fewobjections or adverse appearances before or at the fairnesshearing, the judge must ensure that there is sufficient record asto the basis and justification for the settlement”).\nThe court may approve a settlement “only after a hearing\nand on finding that the settlement * * * is fair, reasonable andadequate.”  FRCP 23(e)(1)(C).  A final approval hearing was held onDecember 5, 2006.  The Ninth Circuit has set forth the followingfactors for courts considering approval of class actionsettlements: Case 3:01-cv-00096-VRW   Document 17   Filed 12/05/06   Page 4 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n5(1) the strength of the plaintiffs’ case; (2) the risk,\nexpense, complexity, and likely duration of furtherlitigation; (3) the risk of maintaining class actionstatus throughout the trial; (4) the amount offered insettlement; (5) the extent of discovery completed and thestate of the proceedings; (6) the experience and views ofcounsel; (7) the presence of a governmental participant;and (8) the reaction of the class members to the proposedsettlement. \nChurchill Village v General Electric\n, 361 F3d 566, 575 (9th Cir\n2004).  These factors overwhelmingly support approval of the classsettlement.  The court discusses the settlement evaluation factorsthat are relevant in this case.  Id at 576 n7.\nThis settlement follows six years of protracted\nlitigation, discovery and negotiation.  Further litigation wouldrequire plaintiffs to survive motions for summary judgment and, ifsuccessful, present their case to a jury.  The considerable riskand cost associated with further litigation is enhanced byQuintus’s pending bankruptcy litigation.  This court noted early inthese proceedings that “plaintiffs are going to have troublefinding deep pockets in this case.”  Doc #85 at 37.  This globalsettlement divides the limited resources of a bankrupt corporationamong the many litigants suing Quintus.  Doc #276 at ¶ 6.  Much ofthe remaining value to be apportioned among the litigants is fromQuintus’s directors and officers liability insurance policies.  Thesettlement class, however, is receiving the “lion’s share” of theinsurance coverage.  Doc #276 at ¶46.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: The court case concerns a consolidated class action lawsuit involving securities fraud claims against Quintus Corporation. During the class period, Quintus was engaged in providing \"e-Customer Relationship Management\" solutions through their AI-based \"eContact\" software, and the company allegedly made false and misleading statements in their financial reports, leading to inflated stock prices. The court approved a settlement of $10.1 million to be distributed among investors who suffered losses due to the company's fraudulent activities, including a fair allocation plan and attorney fees.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: The key legal issue in this case was whether the class action settlement regarding claims of securities fraud against Quintus Corporation was fair, reasonable, and adequate for the affected investors.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court held that the proposed class action settlement was fair, reasonable, and adequate. It granted final approval of the settlement, the allocation plan for the settlement fund, and the application for attorney fees and expenses.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine if a company made grand promises about its finances to make its stock more appealing, but those promises weren't true. People bought stock thinking they were making a good investment. Later, when the truth came out, the stock's value collapsed, causing those investors to lose their money. The investors grouped together to sue the company for misleading them. The court thing is basically a big meeting where they agreed that the company should pay back $10 million to those who've lost money, ensuring everybody gets their fair share, and paid lawyers for their work on the case.",

Doc #71.  The\ncourt designated the law firm of Weiss & Yourman (now Weiss &Lurie) as lead counsel pursuant to a competitive selection process. See In re Quintus Sec Litig\n, 148 F Supp 2d 967 (ND Cal 2001). \nFollowing two rounds of motions to dismiss, the court designatedRoman Reznik as lead plaintiff.  Doc #201.  \nThe first amended consolidated class action complaint,\nDoc #215 (CAC), alleges that false and misleading statements ofmaterial fact appeared in the Quintus IPO registration statement,the Mustang registration statement and various periodic financialreports.  Accordingly, the CAC asserts claims under sections 11,12(a)(2) and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933 (the “1933 Act”) aswell as claims under sections 10(b), 14(a)(9) and 20(a) of theSecurities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “1934 Act”).

Id at ¶7-8.  Similarly, no objection was raised atthe final settlement approval hearing on December 5, 2006.\nII\nThe proposed settlement agreement provides that\ndefendants will pay $10.1 million in cash into a common fund to bedistributed to class members. \nThe question currently before the court is whether this\nsettlement should be approved.  “The court must approve anysettlement, voluntary dismissal, or compromise of the claims,issues, or defenses of a certified class.”  FRCP 23(e)(1)(A).  Thecourt bears in mind the Ninth Circuit’s “strong judicial policythat favors settlement, particularly where complex class actionlitigation is concerned.”  Class Plaintiffs v City of Seattle\n, 355\nF2d 1268, 1276 (9th Cir 1992).  While no class member has objected,the court must still review the proposed settlement.  Manual forComplex Litigation (Fourth) §21.635 (“Even if there are no or fewobjections or adverse appearances before or at the fairnesshearing, the judge must ensure that there is sufficient record asto the basis and justification for the settlement”).\nThe court may approve a settlement “only after a hearing\nand on finding that the settlement * * * is fair, reasonable andadequate.”  FRCP 23(e)(1)(C).  A final approval hearing was held onDecember 5, 2006.  The Ninth Circuit has set forth the followingfactors for courts considering approval of class actionsettlements: Case 3:01-cv-00270-VRW   Document 16   Filed 12/05/06   Page 4 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n5(1) the strength of the plaintiffs’ case; (2) the risk,\nexpense, complexity, and likely duration of furtherlitigation; (3) the risk of maintaining class actionstatus throughout the trial; (4) the amount offered insettlement; (5) the extent of discovery completed and thestate of the proceedings; (6) the experience and views ofcounsel; (7) the presence of a governmental participant;and (8) the reaction of the class members to the proposedsettlement. \nChurchill Village v General Electric\n, 361 F3d 566, 575 (9th Cir\n2004).  These factors overwhelmingly support approval of the classsettlement.  The court discusses the settlement evaluation factorsthat are relevant in this case.  Id at 576 n7.\nThis settlement follows six years of protracted\nlitigation, discovery and negotiation.  Further litigation wouldrequire plaintiffs to survive motions for summary judgment and, ifsuccessful, present their case to a jury.  The considerable riskand cost associated with further litigation is enhanced byQuintus’s pending bankruptcy litigation.  This court noted early inthese proceedings that “plaintiffs are going to have troublefinding deep pockets in this case.”  Doc #85 at 37.  This globalsettlement divides the limited resources of a bankrupt corporationamong the many litigants suing Quintus.  Doc #276 at ¶ 6.  Much ofthe remaining value to be apportioned among the litigants is fromQuintus’s directors and officers liability insurance policies.  Thesettlement class, however, is receiving the “lion’s share” of theinsurance coverage.  Doc #276 at ¶46.  Weighing the risks and costsof further litigation, the court concludes that this settlement isadvisable.\nThe settlement amount, $10.1 million, closely resembles\nthe $9,996,000 settlement predicted by the Haas Study\n referenced by\nthis court in its previous order.  Quintus , 148 F Supp 2d at 985. Case 3:01-cv-00270-VRW   Document 16   Filed 12/05/06   Page 5 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n6This proposed settlement’s settlement/potential investor loss (PIL)\nratio of 16.83% marginally exceeds the average class actionsecurities litigation settlement/PIL ratio of 16.66%.  MukeshBajaj, Sumon C Mazumdar & Atuya Sarin, Securities Class Action\nSettlements , 43 Santa Clara L Rev 101, 116 tbl 11 (2003). \nAchieving the average settlement/PIL ratio despite having tocompete with Quintus’s bankruptcy estate for remaining resourcesindicates the fairness of this settlement to class members.\nFollowing the hearing, plaintiffs’ counsel expressed\nconcern that courts’ use of studies to predict recovery at theoutset of litigation may tend to cap recovery at that level.  Whilethe court does not discount that concern, it warrants mention thatthe Haas study data reflect a range of litigation results.  Anyindividual case may differ and differ significantly from theaverage or median results.  In any event, the obstacles to agreater recovery in this case were substantial.  Given thosedifficulties, a recovery within the average range may wellrepresent an achievement that is greater than average.  \nFinally, the absence of any objections or requests for\nexclusion among a class of this size demonstrates the overallreasonableness of this settlement.  \nThe risk and cost of further litigation, the settlement\namount and the silence of class members provide powerful evidencethat the settlement is fair, reasonable and adequate.  Accordingly,plaintiffs’ motion for final approval of the class actionsettlement is GRANTED.////Case 3:01-cv-00270-VRW   Document 16   Filed 12/05/06   Page 6 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n7III\nPlaintiffs also seek final approval of the plan of\nallocation of the settlement fund.  Doc #274.  The plan ofallocation operates as follows: \nTo the extent there are sufficient funds in the Net\nSettlement Fund, each Authorized Claimant will receive anamount equal to the Authorized Claimant’s claim.  If,however, the amount in the Net Settlement Fund is notsufficient to permit payment of the total claim of eachAuthorized Claimant, then each Authorized Claimant shallbe paid the percentage that each Authorized Claimant’sclaim bears to the total of the claims of all AuthorizedClaimants.  A claim will be computed as follows: theclaim shall be equal to the amount paid for shares ofQuintus common stock purchased or acquired by SettlementClass members during the Settlement Class Period, less:(a) the amount realized from the sale of any such sharesduring the Settlement Class Period or through February22, 2001, or $0.14 per share, whichever is greater; or(b) the number of any such shares held at the close ofbusiness on February 22, 2001, multiplied by $0.14 (theclosing price of Quintus stock on February 22, 2001).\nDoc #277 Ex A at 10.  The plan of allocation was fully described innotice letters to potential class members and no objections weresubmitted to the court or raised at the hearing.\nThe court has discretion to approve a plan of allocation\nthat is fair and reasonable.  In re Heritage Bond Litigation\n, 2005\nUS Dist LEXIS 13555 at *38 (CD Cal 2005).  “A plan of allocationthat reimburses class members based on the extent of their injuriesis generally reasonable.”  Id (quoting In re Oracle Securities\nLitigation , 1994 US Dist LEXIS 21593 at *1 (ND Cal 1994)).  Because this plan provides proportional reimbursement and\nno class member objected, the court concludes the plan ofallocation is fair and reasonable.  Accordingly, the motion forfinal approval of the plan of allocation is GRANTED.Case 3:01-cv-00270-VRW   Document 16   Filed 12/05/06   Page 7 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n8IV\nLead plaintiff and his counsel seek an award of attorney\nfees and expenses totaling $1,141,978.40.  Doc #275 at 16.  Thisamount includes attorney fees of $817,500, expenses of $150,000,reimbursement of fees and expenses of bankruptcy counsel of$162,478.40 and reimbursement of $12,000 to the lead plaintiff. Id.  The fees and expenses sought amount to 11.3% of the totalsettlement amount.\nThe court preliminarily approved an award of attorney\nfees and expenses in its July 7, 2006, order.  Doc #269 at 21. This request differs by including $15,096.40 of additional fees andexpenses of bankruptcy counsel and $12,000 in reimbursement to leadplaintiff.  The court anticipated such an increase in the amountsought for bankruptcy counsel.  Id.  Lead plaintiff, however, seeksreimbursement for 80 hours of his time at a rate of $150/hour forthe first time.  Doc #276 Ex 5 at ¶¶2-3.  The court is authorizedto reimburse lead plaintiff for reasonable costs and expensesrelated to the representation of the class, including lost wages. 15 USC §78u-4(a)(4).  As a registered securities principal and theprincipal of RAMA Financial, lead plaintiff’s request forcompensation is reasonable.  Doc #276 Ex 5 at ¶3.\nThese minor increases in the amount requested do not\ndisturb the court’s prior conclusion that “the amount of attorneyfees (including those incurred by bankruptcy counsel) is relativelymodest in relation to the total class recovery.”  Doc #269 at 21. This court, however, “rejects reliance solely on a comparison ofthe percentage fee requested here with other percentage awards orwith a so-called benchmark percentage.”  In re HPL Technologies,Case 3:01-cv-00270-VRW   Document 16   Filed 12/05/06   Page 8 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n9Inc Sec Litig , 366 F Supp 2d 912, 914 (ND Cal 2005).  Instead, the\ncourt employs a lodestar cross-check to determine thereasonableness of the requested attorney fees.\n“Three figures are salient in a lodestar calculation: (1)\ncounsel’s reasonable hours, (2) counsel’s reasonable hourly rateand (3) a multiplier thought to compensate for various factors.” Id at 919.  In performing a cross-check, the court calculates theimplied multiplier to determine its reasonableness.  Lead counselhas spent more than 5,000 attorney hours in this matter, most ofthem by senior attorneys.  Doc #275 Ex 1.  Applying the Laffey\nmatrix hourly rates, as adjusted for Los Angeles and cost of livingincreases, lead counsel calculates its lodestar as $1,976,262.50. Id at 12 and Ex 1.  The requested attorney fees of $817,500, lessthan half the lodestar, provide an implied lodestar multiplier of0.414.  Id at 13.  This multiplier is indeed reasonable, indicatingclass members obtained a significant discount on market attorneyrates.  Notably, competitive selection of class counsel producedthis low loadstar ratio or negative multiplier.  Quintus\n, 148 F\nSupp 2d 967.  Despite any statutory limitation on use ofcompetitive selection, see In re Cavanaugh\n, 306 F3d 726 (9th Cir\n2002), this provides further evidence that courts may look to thecompetitive selection cases in determining a reasonable level offees and costs.  See In re Cabletron, Inc Securities Litigation\n,\n2006 US Dist LEXIS 75188 (D NH 2006).\nThe requested attorney fees and expenses are reasonable\ncompensation for the value provided to the class.  This is furtherevidenced by the lack of class member objections to thepreliminarily approved attorney fees and expenses included in theCase 3:01-cv-00270-VRW   Document 16   Filed 12/05/06   Page 9 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n10\nclass notice.\nAccordingly, the application for award of attorney fees\nand reimbursement of expenses is GRANTED.\nIT IS SO ORDERED.\n                                   \nVAUGHN R WALKERUnited States District Chief JudgeCase 3:01-cv-00270-VRW   Document 16   Filed 12/05/06   Page 10 of 10",

These factors overwhelmingly support approval of the classsettlement.  The court discusses the settlement evaluation factorsthat are relevant in this case.  Id at 576 n7.\nThis settlement follows six years of protracted\nlitigation, discovery and negotiation.  Further litigation wouldrequire plaintiffs to survive motions for summary judgment and, ifsuccessful, present their case to a jury.  The considerable riskand cost associated with further litigation is enhanced byQuintus’s pending bankruptcy litigation.  This court noted early inthese proceedings that “plaintiffs are going to have troublefinding deep pockets in this case.”  Doc #85 at 37.  This globalsettlement divides the limited resources of a bankrupt corporationamong the many litigants suing Quintus.  Doc #276 at ¶ 6.

If,however, the amount in the Net Settlement Fund is notsufficient to permit payment of the total claim of eachAuthorized Claimant, then each Authorized Claimant shallbe paid the percentage that each Authorized Claimant’sclaim bears to the total of the claims of all AuthorizedClaimants.  A claim will be computed as follows: theclaim shall be equal to the amount paid for shares ofQuintus common stock purchased or acquired by SettlementClass members during the Settlement Class Period, less:(a) the amount realized from the sale of any such sharesduring the Settlement Class Period or through February22, 2001, or $0.14 per share, whichever is greater; or(b) the number of any such shares held at the close ofbusiness on February 22, 2001, multiplied by $0.14 (theclosing price of Quintus stock on February 22, 2001).\nDoc #277 Ex A at 10.  The plan of allocation was fully described innotice letters to potential class members and no objections weresubmitted to the court or raised at the hearing.\nThe court has discretion to approve a plan of allocation\nthat is fair and reasonable.

Because this plan provides proportional reimbursement and\nno class member objected, the court concludes the plan ofallocation is fair and reasonable.  Accordingly, the motion forfinal approval of the plan of allocation is GRANTED.Case 3:00-cv-04308-VRW   Document 18   Filed 12/05/06   Page 7 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n8IV\nLead plaintiff and his counsel seek an award of attorney\nfees and expenses totaling $1,141,978.40.  Doc #275 at 16.  Thisamount includes attorney fees of $817,500, expenses of $150,000,reimbursement of fees and expenses of bankruptcy counsel of$162,478.40 and reimbursement of $12,000 to the lead plaintiff. Id.  The fees and expenses sought amount to 11.3% of the totalsettlement amount.\nThe court preliminarily approved an award of attorney\nfees and expenses in its July 7, 2006, order.  Doc #269 at 21. This request differs by including $15,096.40 of additional fees andexpenses of bankruptcy counsel and $12,000 in reimbursement to leadplaintiff.  The court anticipated such an increase in the amountsought for bankruptcy counsel.  Id.  Lead plaintiff, however, seeksreimbursement for 80 hours of his time at a rate of $150/hour forthe first time.  Doc #276 Ex 5 at ¶¶2-3.  The court is authorizedto reimburse lead plaintiff for reasonable costs and expensesrelated to the representation of the class, including lost wages. 15 USC §78u-4(a)(4).  As a registered securities principal and theprincipal of RAMA Financial, lead plaintiff’s request forcompensation is reasonable.  Doc #276 Ex 5 at ¶3.\nThese minor increases in the amount requested do not\ndisturb the court’s prior conclusion that “the amount of attorneyfees (including those incurred by bankruptcy counsel) is relativelymodest in relation to the total class recovery.”  Doc #269 at 21. This court, however, “rejects reliance solely on a comparison ofthe percentage fee requested here with other percentage awards orwith a so-called benchmark percentage.”  In re HPL Technologies,Case 3:00-cv-04308-VRW   Document 18   Filed 12/05/06   Page 8 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n9Inc Sec Litig , 366 F Supp 2d 912, 914 (ND Cal 2005).  Instead, the\ncourt employs a lodestar cross-check to determine thereasonableness of the requested attorney fees.\n“Three figures are salient in a lodestar calculation: (1)\ncounsel’s reasonable hours, (2) counsel’s reasonable hourly rateand (3) a multiplier thought to compensate for various factors.” Id at 919.  In performing a cross-check, the court calculates theimplied multiplier to determine its reasonableness.  Lead counselhas spent more than 5,000 attorney hours in this matter, most ofthem by senior attorneys.  Doc #275 Ex 1.  Applying the Laffey\nmatrix hourly rates, as adjusted for Los Angeles and cost of livingincreases, lead counsel calculates its lodestar as $1,976,262.50. Id at 12 and Ex 1.  The requested attorney fees of $817,500, lessthan half the lodestar, provide an implied lodestar multiplier of0.414.  Id at 13.  This multiplier is indeed reasonable, indicatingclass members obtained a significant discount on market attorneyrates.  Notably, competitive selection of class counsel producedthis low loadstar ratio or negative multiplier.  Quintus\n, 148 F\nSupp 2d 967.  Despite any statutory limitation on use ofcompetitive selection, see In re Cavanaugh\n, 306 F3d 726 (9th Cir\n2002), this provides further evidence that courts may look to thecompetitive selection cases in determining a reasonable level offees and costs.  See In re Cabletron, Inc Securities Litigation\n,\n2006 US Dist LEXIS 75188 (D NH 2006).\nThe requested attorney fees and expenses are reasonable\ncompensation for the value provided to the class.  This is furtherevidenced by the lack of class member objections to thepreliminarily approved attorney fees and expenses included in theCase 3:00-cv-04308-VRW   Document 18   Filed 12/05/06   Page 9 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n10\nclass notice.\nAccordingly, the application for award of attorney fees\nand reimbursement of expenses is GRANTED.\nIT IS SO ORDERED.\n                                   \nVAUGHN R WALKERUnited States District Chief JudgeCase 3:00-cv-04308-VRW   Document 18   Filed 12/05/06   Page 10 of 10",

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: This case involves a securities fraud class action filed against Quintus Corporation, where plaintiffs alleged that false and misleading statements were made regarding the company's financial status during its initial public offering and other financial filings. The court approved a $10.1 million settlement to be distributed among class members who bought Quintus stock during the class period. The involvement of artificial intelligence in the case is evident as Quintus was engaged in developing AI software for e-Customer Relationship Management, which was central to the company's business operations and possibly relevant to the claims of misrepresentation of company value.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the proposed class settlement and plan for allocating settlement funds were fair, reasonable, and adequate under the terms of class action litigation rules and whether the claims of securities fraud under the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 were appropriately addressed.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court granted final approval of both the proposed class action settlement and the plan of allocation of funds. Additionally, the application for attorneys’ fees and reimbursement of expenses was approved as reasonable given the settlement in this complex class action case.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Think of Quintus as a company that had promised its shoes were the best in town, selling lots and making big money based on those claims. But it turned out that their shoes weren't as great as advertised, and people who invested lost money. The company and its investors came to an agreement to pay back $10.1 million to those who lost money, and the judge approved this decision because it was fair given the circumstances, like trying to share your allowance with your friends to make up for not telling them last week's secret. The fact that no one among the investors objected to the settlement showed that people were okay with how the money was being split.",

During the class period, Quintusprovided “e-Customer Relationship Management” or “eCRM” solutions,primarily through its “eContact” software.  Quintus grew through aseries of acquisitions in 1997 through 1999.  \nAs part of an initial public offering completed November\n15, 1999, Quintus sold 5.175 million shares of Quintus common stockat $18/share.  Consistent with those heady times, the stock pricesoon reached $55/share. On February 28, 2000, Quintus announcedits intent to acquire Mustang.com, which developed corporate e-mailmanagement software.  Quintus filed a registration statement inconnection with the Mustang acquisition on March 28, 2000.\nOn November 15, 2000, its first anniversary as a publicly\ntraded company, Quintus announced that it was reviewing previouslyfiled financial statements.  The price of Quintus shares fell from$6.00/share to $2.97/share before trading was halted by NASDAQshortly after noon, representing a one-day (or less) price drop ofjust over 50%.  On November 22, 2000, Quintus announced the resultsof a financial audit, which revealed that Quintus had overstatedrevenue on several occasions.  The truth regarding Quintus’sfinancial condition continued to emerge over the next few monthsand NASDAQ delisted Quintus stock on February 16, 2001.  After twodays of over-the-counter trading, the price of Quintus common stocksank to $0.14 on February 22, 2001, when Quintus filed for Chapter11 bankruptcy.\nA flurry of class actions alleging securities fraud wereCase 3:00-cv-04313-VRW   Document 13   Filed 12/05/06   Page 2 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n3filed in this court and ultimately consolidated.

See In re Quintus Sec Litig\n, 148 F Supp 2d 967 (ND Cal 2001). \nFollowing two rounds of motions to dismiss, the court designatedRoman Reznik as lead plaintiff.  Doc #201.  \nThe first amended consolidated class action complaint,\nDoc #215 (CAC), alleges that false and misleading statements ofmaterial fact appeared in the Quintus IPO registration statement,the Mustang registration statement and various periodic financialreports.  Accordingly, the CAC asserts claims under sections 11,12(a)(2) and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933 (the “1933 Act”) aswell as claims under sections 10(b), 14(a)(9) and 20(a) of theSecurities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “1934 Act”).  Id ¶¶291-357.\nThis litigation is only one current in Quintus’s wake. \nAs noted, Quintus initiated a Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceeding inthe United States District Court for the District of Delaware. Additionally, various shareholder actions were filed in Californiaand Texas state courts.  Thus, the proposed settlement presentlyunder consideration is part of a global settlement to beadministered by the Chapter 11 trustee.  \nOn July 7, 2006, the court preliminarily approved the\nproposed settlement and certified the class.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: This court opinion pertains to a securities fraud class action against Quintus Corporation, involving false and misleading financial statements during its IPO and other financial documentation. Quintus, originally an artificial intelligence software business, overstated its revenues, leading to a significant drop in stock prices and ultimately bankruptcy. The court grants final approval of a $10.1 million settlement, concluding that it is fair and reasonable given Quintus's financial condition and the absence of objections from class members.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the proposed class action settlement of securities fraud claims against Quintus Corporation is fair, reasonable, and adequate under the circumstances.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court approved the settlement agreeing it was fair, reasonable, and adequate given the risk of further litigation, the financial condition of Quintus, the comprehensive settlement among various litigants, and due to no objections from class members.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: This is like realizing a company that made a big promise about its money situation was actually fibbing, and because of their lies, people who bought their stock lost a lot of money. So, a group of these people decided to sue the company and got some money back without going through a tough trial. The judge agreed that this resolution was fair, considering that no one in the group complained about the settlement.",

During the class period, Quintusprovided “e-Customer Relationship Management” or “eCRM” solutions,primarily through its “eContact” software.  Quintus grew through aseries of acquisitions in 1997 through 1999.  \nAs part of an initial public offering completed November\n15, 1999, Quintus sold 5.175 million shares of Quintus common stockat $18/share.  Consistent with those heady times, the stock pricesoon reached $55/share. On February 28, 2000, Quintus announcedits intent to acquire Mustang.com, which developed corporate e-mailmanagement software.  Quintus filed a registration statement inconnection with the Mustang acquisition on March 28, 2000.\nOn November 15, 2000, its first anniversary as a publicly\ntraded company, Quintus announced that it was reviewing previouslyfiled financial statements.  The price of Quintus shares fell from$6.00/share to $2.97/share before trading was halted by NASDAQshortly after noon, representing a one-day (or less) price drop ofjust over 50%.  On November 22, 2000, Quintus announced the resultsof a financial audit, which revealed that Quintus had overstatedrevenue on several occasions.  The truth regarding Quintus’sfinancial condition continued to emerge over the next few monthsand NASDAQ delisted Quintus stock on February 16, 2001.  After twodays of over-the-counter trading, the price of Quintus common stocksank to $0.14 on February 22, 2001, when Quintus filed for Chapter11 bankruptcy.\nA flurry of class actions alleging securities fraud wereCase 3:00-cv-04392-VRW   Document 16   Filed 12/05/06   Page 2 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n3filed in this court and ultimately consolidated.  Doc #71.  The\ncourt designated the law firm of Weiss & Yourman (now Weiss &Lurie) as lead counsel pursuant to a competitive selection process. See In re Quintus Sec Litig\n, 148 F Supp 2d 967 (ND Cal 2001). \nFollowing two rounds of motions to dismiss, the court designatedRoman Reznik as lead plaintiff.  Doc #201.  \nThe first amended consolidated class action complaint,\nDoc #215 (CAC), alleges that false and misleading statements ofmaterial fact appeared in the Quintus IPO registration statement,the Mustang registration statement and various periodic financialreports.  Accordingly, the CAC asserts claims under sections 11,12(a)(2) and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933 (the “1933 Act”) aswell as claims under sections 10(b), 14(a)(9) and 20(a) of theSecurities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “1934 Act”).  Id ¶¶291-357.\nThis litigation is only one current in Quintus’s wake. \nAs noted, Quintus initiated a Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceeding inthe United States District Court for the District of Delaware. Additionally, various shareholder actions were filed in Californiaand Texas state courts.  Thus, the proposed settlement presentlyunder consideration is part of a global settlement to beadministered by the Chapter 11 trustee.  \nOn July 7, 2006, the court preliminarily approved the\nproposed settlement and certified the class.  Doc #269.  The courtordered that notice of the pending settlement and final approvalhearing be mailed to potential class members on July 25, 2006.  Doc#273.  Over 20,000 notice letters were mailed to potentialsettlement class members and shareholders of record.  Doc #277 at¶5.  Not a single class member objected to the settlement orCase 3:00-cv-04392-VRW   Document 16   Filed 12/05/06   Page 3 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n4requested exclusion from the class settlement in response to the\nnotice letter.  Id at ¶7-8.  Similarly, no objection was raised atthe final settlement approval hearing on December 5, 2006.\nII\nThe proposed settlement agreement provides that\ndefendants will pay $10.1 million in cash into a common fund to bedistributed to class members. \nThe question currently before the court is whether this\nsettlement should be approved.  “The court must approve anysettlement, voluntary dismissal, or compromise of the claims,issues, or defenses of a certified class.”  FRCP 23(e)(1)(A).  Thecourt bears in mind the Ninth Circuit’s “strong judicial policythat favors settlement, particularly where complex class actionlitigation is concerned.”  Class Plaintiffs v City of Seattle\n, 355\nF2d 1268, 1276 (9th Cir 1992).  While no class member has objected,the court must still review the proposed settlement.  Manual forComplex Litigation (Fourth) §21.635 (“Even if there are no or fewobjections or adverse appearances before or at the fairnesshearing, the judge must ensure that there is sufficient record asto the basis and justification for the settlement”).\nThe court may approve a settlement “only after a hearing\nand on finding that the settlement * * * is fair, reasonable andadequate.”  FRCP 23(e)(1)(C).  A final approval hearing was held onDecember 5, 2006.  The Ninth Circuit has set forth the followingfactors for courts considering approval of class actionsettlements: Case 3:00-cv-04392-VRW   Document 16   Filed 12/05/06   Page 4 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n5(1) the strength of the plaintiffs’ case; (2) the risk,\nexpense, complexity, and likely duration of furtherlitigation; (3) the risk of maintaining class actionstatus throughout the trial; (4) the amount offered insettlement; (5) the extent of discovery completed and thestate of the proceedings; (6) the experience and views ofcounsel; (7) the presence of a governmental participant;and (8) the reaction of the class members to the proposedsettlement. \nChurchill Village v General Electric\n, 361 F3d 566, 575 (9th Cir\n2004).  These factors overwhelmingly support approval of the classsettlement.  The court discusses the settlement evaluation factorsthat are relevant in this case.  Id at 576 n7.\nThis settlement follows six years of protracted\nlitigation, discovery and negotiation.  Further litigation wouldrequire plaintiffs to survive motions for summary judgment and, ifsuccessful, present their case to a jury.  The considerable riskand cost associated with further litigation is enhanced byQuintus’s pending bankruptcy litigation.  This court noted early inthese proceedings that “plaintiffs are going to have troublefinding deep pockets in this case.”  Doc #85 at 37.  This globalsettlement divides the limited resources of a bankrupt corporationamong the many litigants suing Quintus.  Doc #276 at ¶ 6.  Much ofthe remaining value to be apportioned among the litigants is fromQuintus’s directors and officers liability insurance policies.  Thesettlement class, however, is receiving the “lion’s share” of theinsurance coverage.  Doc #276 at ¶46.  Weighing the risks and costsof further litigation, the court concludes that this settlement isadvisable.\nThe settlement amount, $10.1 million, closely resembles\nthe $9,996,000 settlement predicted by the Haas Study\n referenced by\nthis court in its previous order.  Quintus , 148 F Supp 2d at 985. Case 3:00-cv-04392-VRW   Document 16   Filed 12/05/06   Page 5 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n6This proposed settlement’s settlement/potential investor loss (PIL)\nratio of 16.83% marginally exceeds the average class actionsecurities litigation settlement/PIL ratio of 16.66%.  MukeshBajaj, Sumon C Mazumdar & Atuya Sarin, Securities Class Action\nSettlements , 43 Santa Clara L Rev 101, 116 tbl 11 (2003). \nAchieving the average settlement/PIL ratio despite having tocompete with Quintus’s bankruptcy estate for remaining resourcesindicates the fairness of this settlement to class members.\nFollowing the hearing, plaintiffs’ counsel expressed\nconcern that courts’ use of studies to predict recovery at theoutset of litigation may tend to cap recovery at that level.  Whilethe court does not discount that concern, it warrants mention thatthe Haas study data reflect a range of litigation results.  Anyindividual case may differ and differ significantly from theaverage or median results.  In any event, the obstacles to agreater recovery in this case were substantial.  Given thosedifficulties, a recovery within the average range may wellrepresent an achievement that is greater than average.  \nFinally, the absence of any objections or requests for\nexclusion among a class of this size demonstrates the overallreasonableness of this settlement.  \nThe risk and cost of further litigation, the settlement\namount and the silence of class members provide powerful evidencethat the settlement is fair, reasonable and adequate.  Accordingly,plaintiffs’ motion for final approval of the class actionsettlement is GRANTED.////Case 3:00-cv-04392-VRW   Document 16   Filed 12/05/06   Page 6 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n7III\nPlaintiffs also seek final approval of the plan of\nallocation of the settlement fund.  Doc #274.  The plan ofallocation operates as follows: \nTo the extent there are sufficient funds in the Net\nSettlement Fund, each Authorized Claimant will receive anamount equal to the Authorized Claimant’s claim.  If,however, the amount in the Net Settlement Fund is notsufficient to permit payment of the total claim of eachAuthorized Claimant, then each Authorized Claimant shallbe paid the percentage that each Authorized Claimant’sclaim bears to the total of the claims of all AuthorizedClaimants.  A claim will be computed as follows: theclaim shall be equal to the amount paid for shares ofQuintus common stock purchased or acquired by SettlementClass members during the Settlement Class Period, less:(a) the amount realized from the sale of any such sharesduring the Settlement Class Period or through February22, 2001, or $0.14 per share, whichever is greater; or(b) the number of any such shares held at the close ofbusiness on February 22, 2001, multiplied by $0.14 (theclosing price of Quintus stock on February 22, 2001).\nDoc #277 Ex A at 10.  The plan of allocation was fully described innotice letters to potential class members and no objections weresubmitted to the court or raised at the hearing.\nThe court has discretion to approve a plan of allocation\nthat is fair and reasonable.  In re Heritage Bond Litigation\n, 2005\nUS Dist LEXIS 13555 at *38 (CD Cal 2005).  “A plan of allocationthat reimburses class members based on the extent of their injuriesis generally reasonable.”  Id (quoting In re Oracle Securities\nLitigation , 1994 US Dist LEXIS 21593 at *1 (ND Cal 1994)).  Because this plan provides proportional reimbursement and\nno class member objected, the court concludes the plan ofallocation is fair and reasonable.  Accordingly, the motion forfinal approval of the plan of allocation is GRANTED.Case 3:00-cv-04392-VRW   Document 16   Filed 12/05/06   Page 7 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n8IV\nLead plaintiff and his counsel seek an award of attorney\nfees and expenses totaling $1,141,978.40.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: This case involves a legal dispute between Wired Informatics, LLC and OmniMD, Inc. regarding an alleged breach of contract when OmniMD failed to pay for licenses under a Master Software License and Services Agreement. Wired moved for partial summary judgment on claims of contract breach and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, which was denied due to unresolved factual questions. The case involves artificial intelligence, as OmniMD argued that the AI software, Invenio Program, did not function as promised, despite assertions of its capabilities in natural language processing.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether Wired Informatics fulfilled its contractual obligations, including the provision of technical support, and whether OmniMD breached the contract by not paying the agreed license fees.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court denied Wired's motion for partial summary judgment due to existing genuine issues of material fact related to Wired's performance under the contract and the specifics of the technical support required. Thus, the court could not conclude that OmniMD breached the contract or the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine you and your friend agreed that you'd let them use a special program you made if they paid you monthly. You both agreed on what would happen if things went wrong, like if the program didn't work perfectly. Your friend stopped paying because they thought the program wasn't doing what you promised. You went to a grown-up (the judge) to say, \"Hey, they're not paying as we agreed!\" But the grown-up said, \"I can't decide yet because I'm not sure if you did everything you were supposed to. We need to figure out exactly what each of you promised to do and if you helped your friend when they had trouble with the program.\"",

Case 1:19-cv-10019-ADB   Document 28   Filed 03/03/22   Page 2 of 103 OmniMD  failed to comply with Local Rule 56.1 when it filed an opposition to Wired’s  \nmotion for partial summary judgment, [ECF No. 26 ], but did not file a counterstatement of \nmaterial facts in ac cordance with Local Rule 56.1 or otherwise assist the Court in determining \nwhich facts are genuinely in dispute.  Consequently, the portions of Wired’s  statement of \nundisputed material facts that are not specifically controverted with support in the record are \ndeemed admitted.   \nB. Factual Background  \nUnless otherwise noted, the following facts are undisputed.1  \nIn September 2017, the parties entered into a Master Software License and Services \nAgreement (“MSL”).  [ ECF No. 23 at 2 ¶ 1; ECF No. 26- 1 ¶ 5 ; ECF No . 23-2 (copy of the \nMSL) ].  Pursuant to Section 23(g) of the MSL, it s “construction, interpretation and performance” \nis governed by New York law.  [ECF No. 23 -2 at 18].   \nThrough the MSL, the  customer, OmniMD, would be able to purchase licenses for \nWired’s programs or services.  [ECF No. 23 -2 at 4].  The MSL provides  that “[OmniMD] shall \npurchase licenses for Programs (and included Technical Support) by entering into an Ordering \nDocument.”  [ECF No. 23 at 2 ¶ 2;  ECF No. 23- 2 at 4].  Section 4 of the MSL expl ains that \n“upon execution of an Ordering Document, [Wired] hereby grants to [OmniMD] with regard to the Programs and quantity of licenses referenced on such Ordering Document, a non- exclusive, \nnon-transferable, worldwide, fully paid up, limited license. . . .”   [ECF No. 23- 2 at 4].  Section \n9(c) of the MSL is a “Limitations” provision that states  \nEXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY STATED HEREIN, [WIRED]  DOES NOT \nGUARANTEE THAT THE PROGRAMS WILL PERFORM ERROR- FREE \nOR UNINTERRUPTED OR THAT [WIRED]  CAN CORRECT EACH AND \n \n1 The Court draws the facts from Wired’s statement of material facts, [ECF No. 23 at 2 –4], \nOmniMD’s statement of material facts, [ECF No. 26 at 2 –5], and the documents cited therein.    Case 1:19-cv-10019-ADB   Document 28   Filed 03/03/22   Page 3 of 104 EVERY ERROR.  THE WARRANTIES IN THIS SECTION 9 ARE GIVEN \nIN LIEU OF ALL OTHER WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS.  THERE \nARE NO OTHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR \nCONDITIONS, INCLUDING THE IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  \n \n[ECF No. 23- 2 at 12].  The MSL does not provide for any termination rights by OmniMD.  [ECF \nNo. 23 at 3  ¶ 6].  The MSL also required Wired to provide OmniMD with technical support, \nwhich OmniMD asserts  required Wired to assist with adapting, training, and im plementing its \nprograms for use in OmniMD’s software.  [ECF No. 26- 1 ¶ 7; ECF No. 23- 2 at 26–28 (MSL’s \n“technical support” addendum)]. \n In March 2018, OmniMD and Wired entered into an Ordering Document related to \nWired’s Invenio Program.  [ECF No. 23 at 4 ¶¶ 8 –9; ECF No. 23- 3 (copy of Ordering \nDocument)].  The Ordering Document expressly incorporated the terms of the MSL, and ultimately  provided OmniMD with a license to use the I nvenio Program.  [ECF No. 23 at 4 ¶  10; \nECF No. 23- 3 at 1 ].  OmniMD maintains that Wired represented that the Invenio P rogram “was a \nworking artificial intelligence engine capable of parsing natural language” that could be used \nwithin OmniMD’s software product with “ only minimal fine tuning and testing ,” and that  \nOmniMD agreed to order the  Invenio Program  licenses  based on those representations .  [ECF \nNo. 26- 1 ¶¶ 4, 17–18 ].  According to OmniMD , the Invenio Program did not work as Wired had \nclaimed it would, even after OmniMD had “numerous communications with Wired”  about its \nproblems.  [ECF No. 26- 1 ¶ 10].  \nThe Ordering Document set out a payment schedule whereby OmniMD agreed to pay \nWired $2,500 per month from October 1, 2017 to June 30, 2018 and $9,000 per month from July \n1, 2018 until June 30, 2019, for a total payment of $130,500.  [ECF No. 23- 3 at 1; ECF No. 23 at Case 1:19-cv-10019-ADB   Document 28   Filed 03/03/22   Page 4 of 105 4 ¶ 1 1].  OmniMD failed to pay the monthly invoices from June 1, 2018 to July 1, 2019, \nresulting in a total outstanding payment of $113,000.  [ECF No. 23 at 4 ¶ 12].   \nC. Procedural History  \nWired  filed its  three -count complaint on November 19, 2018 in Suffolk Superior Court, \nasserting (1) breach of contract (Count I), [Compl. ¶¶ 20–25], (2) breach of the implied covenant \nof good faith and fair dealing (Count II), [ id. ¶¶ 26 –30], and (3) violation of Chapter 93A (Count \nIII), [id. ¶¶ 31 –36].  Omni MD removed the case to this Court on January 3, 2019, [ECF No. 1], \nand later  asserted counterclaims  against Wired  for fraud, breach of the implied warranty of \nfitness, breach of the implied warranty of merch antability, and breach of contract.  [ECF No. 4 at \n10 ¶¶ 23 –36].  On July 30, 2019, the Court dismissed OmniMD’s counterclaims, but granted it \nleave to amend its counterclaims for fraud and breach of contract.  See  [ECF No. 11 at 5, 10].  \nOn August 30, 2019, OmniMD filed its amended counterclaim for breach of contract, [ECF No. \n12], which the Court dismiss ed due in part to OmniMD ’s failure  to identify any specific \nprovision of the MSL breached by Wired.  [ECF No. 16 at 5].  \nWired  filed its  motion for partia l summary judgment on Counts I and II  on March 12, \n2021.  [ECF No. 22].  OmniMD  opposed the motion on April 16, 2021.  [ECF No. 26] .  \nII. LEGAL STANDARD  \nSummary judgment is appropriate where the moving party can show that “there is no \ngenuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a).  “[A]n issue is ‘genuine’ if it ‘may reasonably be  resolved in favor \nof either party.’”  Robinson v. Cook, 863 F. Supp. 2d 49, 60 (D. Mass. 2012) (alteration in \noriginal) (quoting Vineberg v. Bissonnette , 548 F.3d 50, 56 (1st Cir. 2008)).  “A fact is material \nif its resolution might affect the outcome of the case under the controlling law.”  Cochran v. Case 1:19-cv-10019-ADB   Document 28   Filed 03/03/22   Page 5 of 106 Quest Software, Inc. , 328 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 2003) (citation omitted).  Thus, “[a] genuine issue \nexists as to such a fact if there is evidence from which a reasonable trier could decide the fact \neither way. ”  Id. (citation omitted).  By invoking summary judgment, “the moving party in effect \ndeclares that the evidence is insufficient to support the nonmoving party’s case.”  United States \nv. Plat 20, Lot 17, Great Harbor Neck, New Shoreham, R.I., 960 F.2d 200, 204 (1st Cir. 1992) \n(citing Celotex Corp. v. Catrett , 477 U.S. 317, 325 (1986)).  \n“To succeed in showing that there is no genuine dispute of material fact,” the moving \nparty must “‘affirmatively produce evidence that negates an essential element of the no n-moving \nparty’s claim,’ or, using ‘evidentiary materials already on file . . . demonstrate that the non-moving party will be unable to carry its burden of persuasion at trial.’”  Ocasio -Hernández \nv. Fortuño- Burset , 777 F.3d 1, 4–5 (1st Cir. 2015) (quoting Carmona v. Toledo, 215 F.3d 124, \n132 (1st Cir. 2000)).  Conversely, “[t]o defeat a properly supported motion for summary judgment, the nonmoving party must establish a trial -worthy issue by presenting enough \ncompetent evidence to enable a finding favorabl e to the nonmoving party.”  ATC Realty, LLC v. \nTown of Kingston, N.H., 303 F.3d 91, 94 (1st Cir. 2002) (internal quotation marks and citation \nomitted).  That is, the nonmoving party must set forth specific, material evidence showing that there is “a genuin e disagreement as to some material fact.”  Plat  20, Lot  17, Great  Harbor  Neck , \n960 F.2d at 204 (citing Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 247 –48 (1986)).  \nIn reviewing the record, the Court “must take the evidence in the light most flattering t o \nthe party opposing summary judgment, indulging all reasonable inferences in that party’s favor.” Cochran , 328 F.3d at 6 (citation omitted).  The First Circuit has noted that this review “is \nfavorable to the nonmoving party, but it does not give him a fre e pass to trial.”  Hannon v. Beard, \n645 F.3d 45, 48 (1st Cir. 2011).  “The factual conflicts upon which he relies must be both Case 1:19-cv-10019-ADB   Document 28   Filed 03/03/22   Page 6 of 107 genuine and material[,]” Gomez v. Stop & Shop Supermarket Co., 670 F.3d 395, 397 (1st Cir. \n2012), and the Court may discount “conclusory allegations, improbable inferences, and \nunsupported speculation.”  Cochran , 328 F.3d at 6 (quoting Medina -Munoz v. R.J. Reynolds \nTobacco Co., 896 F.2d 5, 8 (1st Cir. 1990)). \nIII. DISCUSSION  \nA. Count I: Breach of Contract  \nUnder New York law, “ the elements of a breach  of contract  claim are a contract, the \nplaintiff ’s performance under the contract , the defendant ’s breach , and damages resulting from \nthe breach. ”  Sunoco, Inc. (R & M) v. 175- 33 Horace Harding Realty Corp. , 969 F. Supp. 2d \n297, 305 (E.D.N.Y. 2013), aff ’d sub nom. Sunoco, Inc. (R&M) v. 175- 33 Horace Harding Realty \nCorp., 697 F. App’ x 38 (2d Cir. 2017) (citing Elisa Dreier Reporting Corp. v. Global Naps \nNetworks, Inc ., 921 N.Y.S.2d 329, 333 ( N.Y. App. Div. 2011)).2   \nWired asserts that there is no dispute that : (1) there was a contract  between the parties , \n(2) Wired performed under the contract, (3) Omni MD breached the MSL  when it failed to pay \nthe license fees , and (4) Wired suffered damages as a result.  [ECF No. 23 at 6].  Omni MD \ncounters that  Wired cannot prove the elements of the claim because the Invenio Program  did not \n \n2 The MSL contains a choice of law provision, [ECF No. 23- 2 at 18], which neither party has \nargued is invalid or inapplicable here.  Relying on the choice of law provision, t he Court \npreviously found that New York  law governed the MSL .  [ECF No. 11 at 6 n.3; ECF No. 16 at \n4–5].  Despite this, OmniMD  continues to apply Massachusetts law to the claim s and offers no \nexplanation for this course of action.  [ECF No. 26 at 9].  Absent any convincing reason to \ndeviate from its prior finding on this issue , the Court will app ly New York law here.   \n Case 1:19-cv-10019-ADB   Document 28   Filed 03/03/22   Page 7 of 108 work and Wired failed to provide  sufficient  technical support  and resources to remedy the \nproblem .3  [ECF No. 26 at 9–10]. \nHere, genuine issues of material fact exist regarding the MSL and Wired’s required \nperformance.  Wired appears to assert that its only obligation under the MSL  was to provide the \nInvenio Program license, [ECF No. 23 at 6], but Omni MD counters that Wired failed to provide \nthe required technical support  when the product did not work as Wired had allegedly \nrepresented , [ECF No. 26 at 10] .  Although Omni MD does not dispute that the license was \nprovided and  fails to  point to a specific provision of the MSL where Wired represented  that the \nInvenio Program would work in a certain way, 4 it is also clear that the MSL does contain a \ntechnical support provision, which is laid out in a separate addendum to the contract .  [ECF No. \n23-2 at 26].  N either party has provided sufficient evidence to allow the Court to interpret \nWired’s obligations  beyond providing a  license, and Wired, as the moving party, has not put \nforth any evidence to demonstrate that those additional obliga tions , whatever they may be, were \nsatisfied .  Thus, without an adequate understanding of the  scope of the technical support that \nshould have been provided and what support was actually provided, the Court cannot determine \nwhether  Wired performed as require d under the MSL .  Therefore, because there exists a genuine \n \n3 Although neither party addresses the  issue  of whether the MSL is a contract  for goods or \nservices, which the Court raised in its  orders on the  motions to dismiss, [ECF No. 11 at 9–10; \nECF No. 16 at 4], both parties proceed as th ough it is a contract for services governed by \ncommon law rather than for goods governed by the Uniform Commercial Code .  For the \npurposes of this O rder, the Court assumes without deciding that the MSL is a services contract .    \n \n4 In fact, and as noted in the Court’s motion to dismiss orders, the MSL explicitly disclaims that \nthe program would “perform error -free or uninterrupted.”  [ECF No. 16 at 6].  Further, to the \nextent that OmniMD is attempting to argue that Wired is itself liable for breach of contract, [ECF \nNo. 26 at 6–8], the Court has already twice dismissed OmniMD’s attempts to assert that counterclaim, [ECF Nos. 11, 16], and OmniMD  has offered no basis for the Court to reconsider \nthose rulings.   Case 1:19-cv-10019-ADB   Document 28   Filed 03/03/22   Page 8 of 109 issue of material fact as to Wired’s performance , its motion for summary judgment on Count I is \nDENIED .  \nB. Count II: Breach of the Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing  \nWired also argues t hat there is no dispute that OmniMD breached the covenant of good \nfaith and fair dealing.  [ECF No. 23 at 7].  New York law implies a covenant  of good faith  and \nfair dealing in all contracts.  Sec. Plans, Inc. v. CUNA Mut. Ins. Soc., 769 F.3d 807, 817 (2d Cir. \n2014) .  “Specifically, implied in every contract is a promise that ‘neither party shall do anything \nwhich will have the effect of destroying or injuring the right of the other party to receive the \nfruits of the contract.’”  19 Recordings Ltd. v. S ony Music Ent., 165 F. Supp. 3d 156, 161 \n(S.D.N.Y. 2016) (quoting Dalton v. Educ. Testing Serv., 87 N.Y.2d 384, 389 (1995)).  A  claim \nfor breach of the covenant , however, “will be dismissed as redundant where the conduct \nallegedly violating  the implied cov enant is a predicate also for a claim for breach of an express \nprovision of the contract.”  Nat ’l Westminster Bank PLC  v. Grant Prideco, Inc., 261 F. Supp. 2d \n265, 274–75 (S.D.N.Y. 2003).  \nWired makes the conclusory assertion that OmniMD acted in “ bad faith ” when it failed to \npay the license fees , [ECF No. 23 at 7], but it has put  forth no evidence to support this statement  \nor to demonstrate that the conduct it relies on ( i.e., OmniMD’s fail ure to pay the license fee) \ndiffers from  the predicate conduct for the  breach of contract claim.  Wired’s failure to produce \nany evidence that would “demonstrate that [OmniMD]  will be unable to carry its burden of \npersuasion at trial” precludes summary judgment .  Ocasio -Hernández, 777 F.3d at  4–5 (internal \nquotation marks and citation omitted).  Therefore, Wired’s motion for summary judgment on \nCount II is DENIED .  \n Case 1:19-cv-10019-ADB   Document 28   Filed 03/03/22   Page 9 of 1010 IV. CONCLUSION \nAccordingly, Wired’s motion for partial summary judgment , [ECF No. 22], is DENIED .  \nThe parties shall appear for a status conference before the C ourt on March 23 , 2022 at 10 a.m.   \nSO ORDERED.         \n             \nMarch 3, 2022  /s/ Allison D.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: This case involves the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing a civil enforcement action against Mina Tadrus and Tadrus Capital LLC for allegedly operating a Ponzi scheme. The court denied the defendants' motion to access frozen funds for living expenses and attorney’s fees because they failed to prove that the funds were untainted by their alleged fraud, and there were insufficient assets to satisfy potential disgorgement liabilities. The case involves AI as the defendants claimed to use \"artificial intelligence-based high-frequency trading models\" to attract investors.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the defendants are entitled to access frozen funds to pay for living expenses and attorney's fees when those assets are allegedly tainted by fraud and insufficient to cover potential disgorgement liabilities.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court denied the defendants' motion to unfreeze funds, determining that they failed to demonstrate that the funds were untainted by fraud and that there were sufficient assets to satisfy any potential disgorgement.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine you and others gave a person money promising they'd invest it wisely using AI tools. Instead, they used your money to pay off others and themselves, sort of like a scam. Now, the police (here, the SEC) caught on and locked their bank accounts to try and give back as much money to everyone who got tricked. The person wants some of that money to live on and pay lawyers, but the judge said no because they couldn't prove the money wasn't from crooked activities and there might not be enough left to pay back everyone they tricked in the first place.",

BACKGROUND \nTadrus is the founder and chief executive officer (“CEO”) of Tadrus Capital, \na purported hedge fund.  Tadrus raised over $5 million from 31 investors \npredominantly from the Egyptian Coptic Christian community, of which Tadrus is \nalso a member.  Compl. ¶¶ 2, 17.  He represented to investors that their funds \nwould be invested in “the world’s first private high-yielding and fixed-income \nquantitative hedge fund” using “artificial intelligence-based high-frequency trading \nmodels,” which would yield “investors 1.5% or 2.5%, paid on the first of each \nmonth, for an annual return on investment of 18% or 30% a year.”  Id. at ¶ 3.   \nAfter serving a subpoena on Tadrus Capital in June 2023,1 the SEC \ncommenced this civil action in July 2023, alleging that Defendants engaged in a \n“multimillion-dollar Ponzi scheme” and misappropriated investors’ funds that \nviolated several provisions of the relevant securities laws.  Specifically, the SEC \nalleges that Tadrus did not invest the vast majority of investors’ funds and instead \ndiverted the money to himself and to his personal credit card bills.  And to make \nthe monthly guaranteed monthly return on “investment” payments, Defendants \npaid investors using other investor funds.  In connection with the same course of \n \n1 At various points in their papers, Defendants protest the SEC’s decision to file a \ncivil complaint before Defendants fully responded to the SEC subpoena.  However, \nthe Court is unaware of — nor do Defendants provide — any authority precluding \nthe SEC from filing a lawsuit without warning Defendants about its intention to do \nso or before Defendants could fully respond to the subpoena.   Case 1:23-cv-05708-FB-LKE     Document 32     Filed 11/02/23     Page 2 of 13 PageID #:\n<pageID> 3conduct that gave rise to this civil action brought by the SEC, the United States \nAttorney’s Office charged Tadrus on a criminal complaint and unsealed the \nindictment in September 2023.  That case is also pending in the Eastern District, \nbefore Judge Gonzalez.  See United States v. Mina Tadrus , 23-cr-393 (HG).  On \nNovember 2, 2023, this Court granted the government’s unopposed motion to \nintervene and stay civil proceedings because of the pendency of the parallel \ncriminal case.2  \nIn August 2023, after the SEC filed its Temporary Restraining Order \n(“TRO”) papers, the Court entered the parties’ Consent Order Imposing \nPreliminary Injunction and Other Relief (“Consent Order”), which agreed, inter \nalia, that Defendants’ assets would be frozen until the Court issues a final \njudgment in the action.  \nThe Consent Order identified two issues on which the parties could not \nagree: (1) whether Tadrus could use investor funds for living expenses; and (2) \nwhether Defendants could use funds in two accounts controlled by Defendants to \npay attorney’s fees in connection with this action.  Accordingly, Defendants now \nmove for Court authorization of: (1) $29,186.56 of funds from what was a joint \nbank account held by Tadrus and his wife so as to cover approximately 3 months \n \n2 The government did not object to the Court deciding Defendants’ instant motion \neither prior to or after deciding its motion to intervene and stay proceedings.

In their papers, \nDefendants deny all allegations of wrongdoing but claim they cannot adequately \ndefend themselves against the SEC’s civil complaint unless they have the resources \nto pay for living expenses and mount a successful defense, which, they claim, \nrequires access to assets that are currently frozen.  And Defendants also highlight \nTadrus’s family circumstances, including his need to provide for his wife, two-year \nold daughter, and newborn son.

DISCUSSION \nFor both living expenses and attorney’s fees,3 a defendant must “establish \n[1] that the funds he seeks to release are untainted and [2] that there are sufficient \nfunds to satisfy any disgorgement remedy that might be ordered in the event a \nviolation is established at trial.”  See S.E.C. v.

Apr. 30, 2009) (declining defendant’s motion to \nunfreeze assets to pay for attorney’s fees and living expenses in alleged Ponzi \nscheme case); see also S.E.C. v. Santillo , No. 18-CV-5491 (JGK), 2018 WL \n3392881, at *4-5 (S.D.N.Y. July 11, 2018) (stating and applying standard to deny \ndefendant’s request to unfreeze assets to pay for legal expenses in SEC civil \nenforcement action).  The touchstone for this inquiry is “equity,” and Defendants \ncarry the burden.  See Stein, 2009 WL 1181061, at *1 (stating that “defendant has \nnot met his burden”).  \n \n3 Because of Sixth Amendment right-to-counsel considerations, the caselaw has \ndistinguished two different standards in assessing whether to unfreeze funds for \nattorney’s fees.  In civil cases, including an SEC civil enforcement action like this \none, the applicable standard is “whether or not the funds are tainted by fraud”; by \ncontrast, in a criminal action, the SEC is “required to demonstrate that the frozen \nfunds are traceable to fraud.”  See S.E.C. v. FTC Cap. Mkts., Inc. , No. 09 CIV. \n4755 (PGG), 2010 WL 2652405, at *7 (S.D.N.Y. June 30, 2010) (citing S.E.C. v. \nCoates, No. 94 CIV. 5361 (KMW), 1994 WL 455558, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 23, \n1994)).  While Tadrus faces a separate criminal action in the Eastern District \nbefore Judge Gonzalez, in the civil action before this Court, Defendants do not \nclaim that they need funds for mounting a criminal defense.  Accordingly, the \nCourt uses the applicable standard in the civil context, whether the funds are \nuntainted by the SEC’s allegations of fraud.   Case 1:23-cv-05708-FB-LKE     Document 32     Filed 11/02/23     Page 5 of 13 PageID #:\n<pageID> 6A. Whether the funds are untainted by the SEC’s allegations \nDefendants must first establish that the funds they seek to release are \n“untainted by the [SEC’s] allegations” of fraud.  See Stein, 2009 WL 1181061, at \n*1; see also S.E.C. v. FTC Cap. Mkts., Inc. , No. 09 CIV. 4755 (PGG), 2010 WL \n2652405, at *7 (S.D.N.Y. June 30, 2010) (collecting cases regarding the proper \nstandard in civil suits).  As the Second Circuit recently stated, “[i]t is well-settled \nthat a defendant has no right to use tainted assets for his legal defense” in criminal \ncases, let alone civil ones.  S.E.C. v. Ahmed , 72 F.4th 379, 395 (2d Cir. 2023).  \nThe Court first notes that the SEC has made a substantial showing that \nDefendants defrauded investors through a Ponzi scheme.  While the SEC’s claims \nhave not yet been “authoritatively resolved,” the SEC need not conclusively \ndemonstrate that the frozen funds are traceable to fraud at this early juncture to \npreclude Defendants’ use of frozen assets in a civil case.  Compare Stein , 2009 WL \n1181061, at *1 (in civil case, “defendant must establish” that the funds he seeks to \nrelease are untainted, even just weeks after the SEC had instigated current action) \nwith FTC Cap. Mkts., Inc. , 2010 WL 2652405, at *7 (in a criminal action, because \nof Sixth Amendment concerns, the SEC is “required to demonstrate that the frozen \nfunds are traceable to fraud” when defendant is seeking to unfreeze funds for \nattorney’s fees).  Instead, Defendants must establish that the assets in question are \nuntainted by their alleged fraud.   Case 1:23-cv-05708-FB-LKE     Document 32     Filed 11/02/23     Page 6 of 13 PageID #:\n<pageID> 7Defendants seek funds from two accounts identified in the Consent Order: \n(1) a personal bank account held in Tadrus’s own name and (2) accounts held in \nTadrus Capital’s name at two financial institutions.  In the Consent Order, \nDefendants concede that the funds in Tadrus’s personal bank account, currently \nheld in escrow by his counsel, are “investor funds,” see Consent Prelim. Inj. at 2 \n(“the parties have not come to an agreement as to . . . whether Tadrus can use the \ninvestor funds  in the accounts listed in Schedule C for his living expenses”) \n(emphasis added), and the SEC claims to have traced all the funds in the Tadrus \nCapital accounts to investors.  \nDefendants do not explicitly contend that the funds are untainted.  Rather, \nthey argue that the matter is “still at an early state” in the litigation and that finding \nthat all of the funds were tainted would necessarily imply that the Court already \nagrees with the SEC that Defendants are guilty, which would “raise[] serious due \nprocess concerns.”  Finally, Defendants contend that because 90% of the funds are \naccounted for, the “fact that such a high level of funds appears accounted for \nshould give anyone pause as to whether Defendants truly had the intent to defraud \ninvestors and whether the entirety of funds should be considered ‘tainted funds’ at \nthis stage of the proceeding.”  The SEC counters that neither it nor the Defendants \nhave been unable to identify any untainted funds in Defendants’ possession.   Case 1:23-cv-05708-FB-LKE     Document 32     Filed 11/02/23     Page 7 of 13 PageID #:\n<pageID> 8Defendants have failed to meet their burden of establishing that the funds are \nuntainted by the alleged fraud.  Indeed, they fail to argue that either account \ncontains funds other than from investors, instead using the “fact that such a high \nlevel of funds appears accounted for” to cast doubt on whether Defendants “truly \nhad the intent to defraud investors.”  But casting doubt on the ultimate merits of \nthe SEC’s allegations is insufficient to meet their burden.  See Stein, 2009 WL \n1181061, at *1 (“Stein’s efforts to identify assets untainted by the Commission’s \nallegations are woefully inadequate.”). \nDefendants protest that a finding that the funds are tainted would necessarily \nimply that the Court agrees with the SEC that the Defendants are guilty of the \npurported misconduct.  Here, however, Defendants not only mischaracterize the \napplicable standard — Defendants have the burden of showing that the funds are \nuntainted by the SEC’s allegations , which is worlds apart from the Court \nexpressing an opinion on the ultimate merit thereof — but also, more \nfundamentally, misunderstand the purpose of freezing assets.  In freezing \nDefendants’ assets, the Court is not reaching a judgment on the merits but is \ninstead merely acting “to preserve the status quo . . .[and] to protect the public \ninterest” by maintaining funds for a possible equitable remedy of disgorgement.  \nS.E.C. v. Schiffer , No. 97 CIV. 5853 (RO), 1998 WL 901684, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. June \n25, 1998) (quoting S.E.C. v. Manor Nursing Centers, Inc. , 458 F.2d 1082, 1106 (2d Case 1:23-cv-05708-FB-LKE     Document 32     Filed 11/02/23     Page 8 of 13 PageID #:\n<pageID> 9Cir. 1972)).  Stated differently, the objective of temporarily freezing assets is to \nprotect investors’ interests so that, if the SEC ultimately prevails , funds are \navailable for disgorgement.  The freeze order does not, however, presume that the \nSEC will ultimately prove its case,4 and the Court’s refusal to release temporarily \nfrozen funds does not implicate due process.5    \nB. Whether the frozen funds can meet potential disgorgement liability \nDefendants must also establish that there are sufficient funds to satisfy any \ndisgorgement remedy that might be ordered in the event a violation is established \nat trial.  Here, courts have held that “assets should remain frozen when the \ndefendant has not demonstrated that there are sufficient frozen assets to pay \ndisgorgement.”  Santillo, 2018 WL 3392881, at *4.  This issue alone can be \ndispositive, regardless of whether the funds are traceable to a defendant’s \nfraudulent conduct.  See, e.g., S.E.C. v. Callahan , No. 12CV1065ADSAYS, 2015 \nWL 10853927, at *2 (E.D.N.Y. Dec. 24, 2015) (“The fact that the Schwab account \nmay not contain funds tainted by Callahan’s fraud is of no moment” for denying \n \n4 For this reason, the caselaw on which Defendants rely is plainly inapposite.  \nUnited States v. Priv. Sanitation Indus. Ass’n of Nassau/Suffolk, Inc. , 793 F. Supp. \n1114, 1151 (E.D.N.Y. 1992), concerns the permissible breadth of disgorgement as \na civil remedy in a RICO case, not a temporary  freeze order of assets.  Id. \n5 To the extent Defendants have concerns that they are “facing the prospect of not \neven being able to put forth a proper defense that would present their legal and \nfactual position,” presumably because of their inability to access investor funds to \npay attorney’s fees, the Court reminds them that they have “no constitutional right \nto counsel in this civil enforcement action.”  See Ahmed , 72 F.4th at 395.  Case 1:23-cv-05708-FB-LKE     Document 32     Filed 11/02/23     Page 9 of 13 PageID #:\n<pageID> 10request to partially lift the asset freeze to obtain funds from his Schwab account to \npay his legal expenses.);  S.E.C. v. Forte , 598 F. Supp. 2d 689, 693 (E.D. Pa. 2009) \n(“[B]ecause it appears likely that the investor losses dwarf Defendant’s remaining \nassets, even if Defendant could show that some of the frozen funds are from \n‘untainted’ sources, I would not release those funds.”).   \nOnce again, Defendants have failed to meet their burden.  In fact, both \nparties appear to agree that investors cannot be made whole from the assets frozen \nin this matter.  Defendants state that “almost 90% of the total amount of investor \nfunds are accounted for,” implying at least a 10% gap, or at least several hundred \nthousand dollars, between the total investor funds and the amount accounted for.  \nSimilarly, the SEC estimates that the likely disgorgement figure liability6 totals \n$4,070,350, far greater than the $3,361,775.25 currently frozen and thus ultimately \navailable to investors.   \nAccordingly, because Defendants fail to show, let alone argue, that there are \nsufficient frozen funds for potential disgorgement liability, they have failed to meet \ntheir burden.  See Ahmed , 72 F.4th at 394 (2d Cir. 2023) (“The district court did \nnot abuse its discretion by declining to unfreeze assets for Ahmed to hire counsel. . \n \n6 Citing relevant caselaw, see S.E.C. v. Arias , No. 12CV2937MKBSIL, 2021 WL \n7908041, at *5 (E.D.N.Y. Nov. 11, 2021), report and recommendation adopted , \nNo. 12CV2937RPKSIL, 2023 WL 1861641 (E.D.N.Y. Feb. 9, 2023), the SEC \ncalculates disgorgement liability by subtracting the amount of money returned to \ninvestors from the total amount fraudulently raised from investors. Case 1:23-cv-05708-FB-LKE     Document 32     Filed 11/02/23     Page 10 of 13 PageID #:\n<pageID> 11. . [T]he district court properly calculated disgorgement, so it did not abuse its \ndiscretion by concluding that there were no frozen funds available for Ahmed to \nhire counsel.”).  Indeed, a Southern District court barred defendants from utilizing \nfrozen assets to pay legal fees associated with representation in a civil action even \nwhen it was unclear “whether the frozen assets exceed the SEC’s request for \ndamages or disgorgement.”  See S.E.C. v. Bremont , 954 F. Supp. 726, 733 \n(S.D.N.Y. 1997) (denying defendants’ request to use funds they allegedly \nimproperly attainted from investors for attorney’s fees).   Here, where Defendants \nall but concede that the frozen assets do not exceed the SEC’s disgorgement \nestimate, Defendants’ motion must fail.   \nAnd while Defendants attempt to hang their hat on the claim that “almost \n90% of the total investor funds are accounted for,” a gap between potential \ndisgorgement liability and available funds is a gap nonetheless, and any \n“contextualization of the numbers,” as Defendants urge, would be cold comfort to \nallegedly defrauded investors.  Cf. S.E.C. v. Current Fin. Servs. , 62 F. Supp. 2d 66, \n68 (D.D.C. 1999) (frozen assets of $44,000 “clearly do not exceed plaintiff’s \napproximation of liability” of $156,997.28, “and thus, the Court will continue the \nfreeze order”).  As the frozen assets fall short of the likely potential disgorgement \nsum, Defendants’ arguments must fail.   Case 1:23-cv-05708-FB-LKE     Document 32     Filed 11/02/23     Page 11 of 13 PageID #:\n<pageID> 12Although Defendants’ failure to meet their burden on either of these two \nissues — whether the funds are untainted and whether there are sufficient assets to \ncover potential disgorgement — is alone dispositive, see Stein, 2009 WL 1181061, \nat *1 (“To persuade a court to unfreeze assets, the defendant must establish that the \nfunds he seeks to release are untainted and that there are sufficient funds to satisfy \nany disgorgement remedy that might be ordered in the event a violation is \nestablished at trial”) (emphasis added), the Court notes that other factors would \nalso weigh against unfreezing the funds.  See Santillo , 2018 WL 3392881, at *2 \n(“A defendant may seek a modification of an asset freeze if the modification is in \nthe interest of the defrauded investors.”).  Because of the gulf between the \nestimated disgorgement liability and the current frozen assets, unfreezing assets \nwould not be in the best interest of defrauded investors.  And unlike in cases where \ncourts determine that unfreezing the assets of business not alleged to be part of the \nPonzi scheme is in the best interest of investors because maintaining such assets \ncould help repay defrauded investors, unfreezing allegedly tainted assets here \nwould only further deplete the available total for disgorgement.  Cf. id. \n(“Importantly, Santillo does not request to unfreeze any assets gained through his \nalleged fraud.”).  Additionally, while the Court need not consider these other \nfactors because Defendants have been unable to establish (1) that the money is \nuntainted by allegations of fraud and (2) that sufficient funds exist to meet Case 1:23-cv-05708-FB-LKE     Document 32     Filed 11/02/23     Page 12 of 13 PageID #:\n<pageID> 13potential disgorgement obligations, see Stein, 2009 WL 1181061, at *2 (finding it \nnecessary to address only these two issues), it notes that even if it did balance the \ninterests and consider the expenses Defendants seek to pay, it would reach the \nsame outcome. \nIII. CONCLUSION \nWhile the Court empathizes with the situation of Tadrus’s family, there is no \nlegal basis for unfreezing allegedly tainted assets, especially where the currently \nfrozen assets cannot cover likely disgorgement liability.  For the foregoing reasons, \nDefendants’ motion to access frozen funds for living expenses and attorney’s fees \nis DENIED. \nSO ORDERED.    \n       _/S/ Frederic Block___________  \n       FREDERIC BLOCK \n       Senior United States District Judge \nBrooklyn, New York \nNovember 2, 2023    Case 1:23-cv-05708-FB-LKE     Document 32     Filed 11/02/23     Page 13 of 13 PageID #:\n<pageID>",

    "summary": "1. Summary: This opinion pertains to a securities class action lawsuit involving Innodata Inc., a company accused of issuing false or misleading statements regarding its AI technology. The court reviewed competing motions to appoint a lead plaintiff and counsel, ultimately selecting Francis Grondin over Curtis Gardner, based on his larger financial losses and compliance with legal procedural requirements.\n\n2. Key Legal Issue: The key legal issue is the appointment of the lead plaintiff in a securities class action under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act (PSLRA). The court needed to determine which plaintiff was most capable of representing the class's interests.\n\n3. Court's Holding: The court held that Francis Grondin has the largest financial interest and satisfies the relevant legal requirements under Rule 23, making him the presumptive lead plaintiff. The court appointed Grondin as lead plaintiff and approved his choice of lead and local counsel.\n\n4. ELI5 explanation: This court case is about deciding who should lead a group lawsuit involving a company that allegedly lied about its artificial intelligence technology. The court chose Francis Grondin to be in charge since he lost more money than the other candidate and followed all the rules to qualify. Think of it as picking a team captain for a group trying to get their money back from a company that wasn't honest.",

(ECF 4; ECF 6.) Both Grondin and Gardner filed opposition briefs. (ECF 10, \n“Grondin Opp.” and ECF 11, “Gardner Opp.”) Both Grondin and Gardner filed reply briefs. (ECF \n14, “Gardner Reply” and ECF 15 , “Grondin Reply.”) The Court considered the parties’ \nsubmissions and decided the motions without oral argument pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 78(b) and Local Civil Rule 78.1(b). For the reasons stated herein, Grondin’s motion for \nappointment as lead plaintiff and approval of counsel (ECF 4) is GRANTED, and Gardner’s  \nmotion for appointment as lead plaintiff and approval of counsel (ECF 6) is DENIED.  I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND  \n This is a  putative federal securities class action brought on behalf of all those who \npurchased or otherwise acquired Innodata Inc. common stock during the period from May 9, 2019 \nthrough February 14, 2024, inclusive (the “Class Period”), who were damaged thereby (the Case 2:24-cv-00971-JKS-JSA     Document 32     Filed 10/30/24     Page 1 of 10 PageID:\n<pageID>2 \n “Class”). (ECF 1, Compl. ¶ 1.)  This action is brought on behalf of the Class for violations of \nSections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. ( Id.)  \nDefendant Innodata is a global data engineering company that purports to be “delivering \nthe promise of  [artificial intelligence, referred to as]  AI[,] to many of the world’s most prestigious \ncompanies.” ( Id. ¶ 2.) Innodata states that it provides AI -enabled software platforms and managed \nservices for AI data collection/annotation, AI digital transformation, and industry- specific business \nprocesses. ( Id.) Plaintiffs allege that Defendants Innodata, Jack Abuhoff, Mark Spelker, and \nMarissa Espineli  made false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material \nfacts regarding, among other things, Innodata’s AI technology and use of AI. ( Id. ¶ 3.)  \n On February 21, 2024, Plaintiff David D’Agostino filed the Complaint individually and on \nbehalf of all others similarly situated. (ECF 1.) On April 22, 2024, both Plaintiff Francis Grondin \nand Plaintiff Curtis Gardner  filed a motion to appoint lead plaintiff and lead  counsel . (ECF 4; ECF \n6.) The Court now considers both motions.  \nII. APPOINTMENT OF LEAD PLAINTIFF  \nThe Private Securities Litigation Reform Act (“PSLRA”) directs the Court to appoint as \nlead plaintiff “the member or members of the purported plaintiff class that the court determines to be [the] most capable of adequately representing the interests of class members[.]” 15 U.S.C. § 78u-4(a)(3)(B)(i). As relevant here,  \nI. In general. . . . the court shall adopt a presumption that the most adequate \nplaintiff in any private action arising under this title is the person or group of \npersons that –  \n(aa) has either filed the complaint or made a motion in response to a  \nnotice under subparagraph (A)(i);  \n(bb) in the determination of the court, has the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class; and  Case 2:24-cv-00971-JKS-JSA     Document 32     Filed 10/30/24     Page 2 of 10 PageID:\n<pageID>3 \n (cc) otherwise satisfies the requirements of Rule 23 of the Federal \nRules of Civil Procedure.   \nII. Rebuttal evidence. The presumption described in subclause (I) may be rebutted only upon proof by a member of the purported plaintiff class that the presumptively most adequate plaintiff —  \n(aa) will not fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class; or  \n(bb) is subject to unique defenses that render such plaintiff incapable of adequately representing the class.  \n \n15 U.S.C. § 78u- 4(a)(3)(B)(iii).  \nAs stated in subsection (a)(3)(I)(cc), the “most adequate plaintiff” must also satisfy the \nrequirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23:  \nOne or more members of a class may sue  or be sued as representative parties \non behalf of all members only if:  \n(1) the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable;  \n(2) there are questions of law or fact common to the class;  \n(3) the claims or defenses of the representative parties are typical of the claims or defenses of the class; and  \n(4) the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.  \n \nFed. R. Civ. P. 23(a).  \nA.   Largest Financial Interest  \nThe Third Circuit has been clear that “[i]n appointing a lead plaintiff, the court’s first duty \nis to identify the movant that is presumptively entitled to that status. The process begins with the \nidentification of the movant with ‘the largest financial in terest in the relief sought by the class.’”  \nIn re Cendant Corp. Litig., 264 F.3d 201, 262 (3d Cir. 2001) (quoting 15 U.S.C. § 78u-4(a)(3)(B)(iii)(I)(bb)). In doing so, “[c]ourts  have discretion to appoint an investor with the largest \nstake in the litigation.” Roby v. Ocean Power Techs., Inc., No. 14- 3799, 2015 WL 1334320, at *5 \n(D.N.J. Mar. 17, 2015) (citing In re Cendant Corp. Litig., 264 F.3d at 262). “The Third Circuit has concluded that ‘largest financial interest’ means the largest loss.” Roby , 2015 WL 1334320, at *5 Case 2:24-cv-00971-JKS-JSA     Document 32     Filed 10/30/24     Page 3 of 10 PageID:\n<pageID>4 \n (citing In re Cendant Corp. Litig., 264 F.3d at 223); see also In re Able Labs. Sec. Litig., 425 F. \nSupp. 2d. 562, 567 (D.N.J. 2006) (same). In making this determination, “courts should consider, \namong other things: (1) the number of shares that the movant purchased during the putative class period; (2) the total net funds expended by the plaint iffs during the class period; and (3) the \napproximate losses suffered by the plaintiffs.” In re Cendant Corp. Litig., 264 F.3d at 262.  To that \nend, district courts w ithin the Third Circuit “have accorded the third element, the largest financial \nloss, the greatest weight.” Roby , 2015 WL 1334320, at *5 (collecting cases). \nHere, Grondin suffered $27,798.69 in losses. ( See ECF 4.) Gardner suffered $24,426.00 in \nlosses.  (See ECF 6.) Although Grondin suffered a greater loss than Gardner, Gardner argues that \nhe should be appointed lead plaintiff because he purchased and retained more shares than Grondin \nand expended greater funds. (Gardner Opp. at 3.) However, courts within the Third Circuit consider the approximate loss suffered to be the most important factor when assessing the l argest \nfinancial interest. Stires v. Eco Sci. Sols., Inc., No. 17- 3707, 2018 WL 5784817, at *4 (D.N.J. Feb. \n14, 2018)  (citing Roby , 2015 WL 1334320, at *5, *14) . The parties agree that Grondin sustained \n$27,798.69 in losses  and Gardner sustained $24,426.00 in losses . (Gardner Opp. at 3; Grondin \nReply at 2.) Accordingly, Grondin has the “largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class” and will be the presumptive most adequate plaintiff if he  “otherwise satisfies” the typicality \nand adequacy requirements of Rule 23. \nB.  Rule 23 Requirements  \n“Once the court has identified the movant with ‘the largest financial interest in the relief \nsought by the class,’ it should then turn to the question whether that movant ‘otherwise satisfies the requirements of Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure,’ and is thus the presumptively most adequate plaintiff.” In re Cendant Corp. Litig., 264 F.3d at 263- 64 (quoting 15 U.S.C. § 78u-Case 2:24-cv-00971-JKS-JSA     Document 32     Filed 10/30/24     Page 4 of 10 PageID:\n<pageID>5 \n 4(a)(3)(B)(iii)(I) (cc)). This “inquiry . . . should be confined to determining whether the movant \nhas made a prima facie showing of typicality and adequacy.” In re Cendant Corp. Litig., 264 F.3d at 263. This assessment “should be a product of the court’s independent judgment,” but “need not be extensive.” Id. at 263- 64. “In conducting the initial inquiry as to whether the movant with the \nlargest losses satisfies the typicality and adequacy requirements, the court may and should consider the pleadings that have been filed, the movant’s application, and any other information that the court requires to be submitted.” Id.  at 264. “When making these determinations, courts should \napply traditional Rule 23 principles.” Id.  at 264 -65.  \nSpecifically,  \nin inquiring whether the movant has preliminarily satisfied the \ntypicality requirement, they should consider whether the circumstances of the movant with the largest losses “are markedly different or the legal theory upon which the claims [of that movant] are based differ[] from that upon which the claims of other class members will perforce be based.”  \n \nIn assessing whether the movant satisfies Rule 23’s adequacy requirement, courts should consider whether it “has the ability and incentive to represent the claims of the class vigorously, [whether it] has obtained adequate counsel, and [whether] there is [ a] conflict \nbetween [the movant’s] claims and those asserted on behalf of the class.”  \n \nId. at 265 (alterations in original) (quoting Hassine v. Jeffes , 846 F.2d 167, 177, 179 (3d Cir. 1988)). \n“In making the initial adequacy assessment in this context, courts should also . . . inquire whether \nthe movant has demonstrated a willingness and ability to select competent class counsel and to negotiate a reason able retainer agreement with that counsel.” In re Cendant Corp. Litig., 264 F.3d \nat 265.   First, the typicality requirement is satisfied when the named plaintiff has (1) suffered the \nsame injuries as the absent class members, (2) as a result of the same course of conduct by Case 2:24-cv-00971-JKS-JSA     Document 32     Filed 10/30/24     Page 5 of 10 PageID:\n<pageID>6 \n defendants, and (3) their claims are based on the same legal issues. Blake Partners, Inc. v. \nOrbcomm, Inc., No. 07- 4590, 2008 WL 2277117, at *6 (D.N.J. June 2, 2008) (citing Weiss v. York \nHosp., 745 F.2d 786, 809 & n.36 (3d Cir. 1984)). Here, Grondin’s  claims are based on the same \nlegal theory and arise from the same events and course of conduct as the claims of the class. ( See, \ne.g., Grondin Reply at 5- 7 (“Grondin alleges, ‘as do all putative class members, that Defendants \nviolated federal securities laws during the Class Period by making false or misleading statements of material facts, or omitting to state material facts, ’ and that he purchased or otherwise acquired \nInnodata securities during the Class Period at prices artificially inflated by Defendants’ wrongful conduct and suffered damages as a result thereof. ”).) At this stage of appointing lead plaintiff \npursuant to the PSLRA, the Court finds that Grondin satisfies Rule 23’s  typicality requirement.  \nSecond, the adequacy requirement is satisfied if “both the class representative and its \nattorneys are capable of satisfying their obligations, and neither has interests conflicting with those of other class members.” Lifestyle Investments, LLC v. Amicus Therapeutics , No. 15- 7448, 2016 \nWL 3032684, at *7 (internal quotations omitted) (quoting Smith v. Suprema Specialties , 206 F. \nSupp. 2d 627, 633 (D.N.J. 2002)); see also In re Cendant Corp. Litig., 264 F.3d at 265 (“In assessing whether the movant satisfies R ule 23’s adequacy requirement, courts should consider \nwhether [the movant] ‘has the ability and incentive to represent the claims of the class vigorously, [whether the movant] has obtained adequate counsel, and [whether] there is [a] conflict between [the movant’s] claims and those asserted on behalf of the class.’” (quoting Hassine , 846 F.2d at \n179)). Here, Grondin, like the other members of the proposed class, seeks to recover the losses he  \nincurred as a result of Defendants’  alleged unlawful conduct. Additionally, given his  financial \nlosses, Grondin appears interested in vigorously pursuing the asserted claims and has retained \ncompetent and experienced counsel to that end. Furthermore, there does not appear to be a conflict Case 2:24-cv-00971-JKS-JSA     Document 32     Filed 10/30/24     Page 6 of 10 PageID:\n<pageID>7 \n between Grondin’s  claims and those of the purported class. At this stage of appointing lead plaintiff \npursuant to the PSLRA, the Court finds Grondin satisfies Rule 23’s  adequacy requirement.  \nC.   Timeliness of Motion  \nIn determining whether a potential lead plaintiff has “either filed the complaint or made a \nmotion in response to a notice,” 15 U.S.C. § 78u- 4(a)(3)(B)(iii)(I)(aa), the PSLRA explains that  \nNot later than 20 days after the date on which the complaint is filed, \nthe plaintiff or plaintiffs shall cause to be published, in a widely circulated national business -oriented publication or wire service, a \nnotice advising members of the purported plaint iff class — \n \n(I) of the pendency of the action, the claims asserted therein, and the purported class period; and  \n(II) that, not later than 60 days after the date on which the notice is published, any member of the purported class may move the court to serve as lead plaintiff of the purported class.  \n If more than one action on behalf of a class asserting substantially the same claim or claims arising under this chapter is filed, only the plaintiff or plaintiffs in the first filed action shall be required to cause \nnotice to be published[.]  \n \n15 U.S.C. § 78u- 4(a)(3)(A)(i)- (ii). Accordingly, a movant must have either (1) “filed the \ncomplaint” or (2) made a motion in response to the notice associated with the first -filed complaint \n“not later than 60 days after the date on which the notice is publ ished.” See 15 U.S.C. § 78u-\n4(a)(3)(B)(iii)(I)(aa). Here, Grondin did not file the Complaint. Therefore, Grondin must have \nmade a motion in response to the notice associated with the C omplaint in accordance with Section \n78u-4(a)(3)(B)(iii)(I)(aa). On Febru ary 21, 2024, notice was published in connection with the  \nComplaint . (ECF 4- 4.) Accordingly, Grondin had sixty days to move in response to the notice . The \nnotice stated that motion s to appoint lead plaintiff  had to be filed by Monday, April 22, 2024.\n1 (See \n \n1 See Fed. R. Civ. P. 6(a)(1)(C) (“ The following rules apply in computing any time period . . . [w]hen the \nperiod is stated in days . . . include the last day of the period, but if the last day is a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, \nthe period continues to run until the end of the next day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday. ”). Case 2:24-cv-00971-JKS-JSA     Document 32     Filed 10/30/24     Page 7 of 10 PageID:\n<pageID>8 \n ECF 4 -4, Ex. A.) Grondin so moved. (ECF 4.) Therefore, Grondin timely filed a motion for \nappointment as lead plaintiff in compliance with the PSLRA.2 15 U.S.C. § 78u-\n4(a)(3)(B)(iii)(I)(aa).  \nD.  Presumption of Lead Plaintiff  \n“Once a presumptive lead plaintiff is located, the court should then turn to the question \nwhether the presumption has been rebutted.” In re Cendant Corp. Litig., 264 F.3d at 268. However, \n“[i]f no class member succeeds in rebutting the presumption, then the district court should appoint \nthe presumptive lead plaintiff as the lead plaintiff.”  Id. Presently, there is no compelling challenge \nto the appointment of Grondin as lead plaintiff. Accordingly, the presumption of adequacy stands. \nSee, e.g., Arbitrage Fund v. Toronto- Dominion Bank , No. 23- 2763, 2023 WL 5550198, at *5 \n(D.N.J. Aug. 29, 2023) (finding presumption of adequacy must stand where no challenges were made); In re Party City Sec. Litig. , 189 F.R.D. 91, 112 (D.N.J. 1999) (“Absent such a challenge, \nthe presumption of adequacy will generally survive.”); Zuckerman v. Foxmeyer Health Corp., No. \n96-2258, 1997 WL 314422, at *2 (N.D. Tex. Mar. 26, 1997) (“No purported class member has \npresented evidence to rebut this presumption. Therefore, the Court will appoint the movants as \nlead plaintiffs.”).  \nGrondin appears to have the largest financial interest, satisfied the Rule 23 requirements, \nand filed a timely motion. The presumption that Grondin is the most adequate plaintiff has not \nbeen rebutted. For these reasons, the Court will appoint Grondin as lead plaintiff, and his  motion \n(ECF 4) is GRANTED.  \n \n \n2 In re Sequans Communs. S.A. Sec. Litig. , 289 F. Supp. 3d 416, 420 (E.D.N.Y . 2018) (citing Fed. R. Civ. P. \n6(a)(1)(C) and noting that 60 -day period ended on October 10, 2017 when notice was filed on August 9, 2017 because \nOctober 9, 2017 was a federal holiday).  Case 2:24-cv-00971-JKS-JSA     Document 32     Filed 10/30/24     Page 8 of 10 PageID:\n<pageID>9 \n III. APPOINTMENT OF LEAD COUNSEL  \n15 U.S.C. § 78u- 4(a)(3)(B)(v) provides that “[t]he most adequate plaintiff shall, subject to \nthe approval of the court, select and retain counsel to represent the class.” Because the Court finds Grondin to be the most ade quate plaintiff, this task falls to him . Grondin moved for approval of \nBlock & Leviton LLP a s Lead Counsel, and Carella, Byrne, Cecchi, Brody & Agnello, P.C. as \nLocal Counsel . (ECF 4.)   \nThere is “a strong presumption in favor of approving a properly- selected lead plaintiff's \ndecisions as to counsel selection and counsel retention.” In re Cendant Corp. Litig., 264 F.3d at 276. “When a properly- appointed lead plaintiff asks the court to approve its choice of lead counsel \nand of a retainer agreement, the question is not whether the court believes that the lead plaintiff could have made a better choice or gotten a better deal.” Id.  Rather, “the court’s inquiry is \nappropriately limited to whether the lead plaintiff’s selection and agreement with counsel are reasonable on their own terms.” Id.  The Third Circuit considers the following factors in deciding \nwhether the selection of lead plaintiff’s counsel is appropriate: (1) the quantum of legal experience and sophistication possessed by the lead plaintiff; (2) the manner in which the lead plaintiff chose what law firms to consider; (3) the process by which the lead plaintiff selected its final choice; (4) the qualifications and experience of counsel selected by the lead plaintiff; and (5) the evidence that the retainer agreement negotiated by the lead plaintiff was (or was not) the product of serious negotiations between the lead plaintiff and the prospective lea d counsel. Id. at 27. \nGrondin’s  chosen law firms have prosecuted numerous securities fraud class actions on \nbehalf of investors. ( See ECF 4- 8, Ex. E ; ECF 4 -9, Ex. F .) After reviewing the firms’ resumes, the \nCourt finds that both firms have substantial experience litigating securities fraud class actions and are thus “competent to fulfill the duties of lead counsel and liaison counsel.” Lewis v. Lipocine Case 2:24-cv-00971-JKS-JSA     Document 32     Filed 10/30/24     Page 9 of 10 PageID:\n<pageID>10 \n Inc., No. 16- 4009, 2016 WL 7042075, at *5 (D.N.J. Dec. 2, 2016).  As a result, Grondin’s motion \nto appoint lead counsel is GRANTED.  \nIV. CONCLUSION  For the reasons stated above, Grondin’s motion for appointment as lead plaintiff and \napproval of counsel (ECF 4) is GRANTED, and Gardner’s  motion for appointment as lead \nplaintiff and approval of counsel (ECF 6) is DENIED.  \n An appropriate order follows. \n/s/ Jamel K.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: Robin Black is suing First Impression Interactive, Inc., and its officers, Jeffrey Giles and Dale Brown, for making autodialed, prerecorded telemarketing calls to individuals on the National Do-Not-Call Registry, which she claims violates the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA). The defendants sought to dismiss the case, arguing that Black's allegations lack factual support, but the court denied their motion, allowing the case to proceed. The case involves automated systems, including autodialers and soundboard technology that help make pre-recorded telemarketing calls, which play a central role in the plaintiff's claims.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the defendants are personally liable under the TCPA for participating in or authorizing autodialed and prerecorded telemarketing calls without consent, thereby invading privacy.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court denied the defendants' motion to dismiss, finding that Black had adequately alleged facts to support the claim that the defendants personally participated in or authorized calls in violation of the TCPA. The court also found that soundboard technology, which can play prerecorded messages under live operator control, could potentially violate the TCPA if proven true.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine you're getting tons of annoying robotic calls on your phone that you never asked for, and you're on a \"do not call\" list. Robin Black says she's in the same boat and blames a company and its leaders for making those calls. The big question is, did they break the law by allowing these calls to happen? The court says we can't just toss out Robin's complaint—it seems like she has enough evidence to say it's worth looking into. So, the case moves forward to see if the company bosses are really responsible for those calls that bugged her.",

Durkin  \n \nMEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER  \n Robin Black alleges that Defendants made autodialed, prerecorded \ntelemarketing calls to individuals on the National Do -Not-Call Registry in violation \nof the Telephone Consumer Protection Act. Defendants have moved to dismiss for \nfailure to state a claim pu rsuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). R. 13; R. \n24. That motion is denied.  \nLegal Standard  \n A Rule 12(b)(6) motion challenges the “ sufficiency of the complaint .” Berger v. \nNat. Collegiate Athletic Assoc. , 843 F.3d 285, 289 (7th Cir. 2016).  A complaint must \nprovide “a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled \nto relief,” Fed.  R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2), sufficient to provide defendant with “fair notice” of \nthe claim and the basis for it. Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly , 550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007). \nThis standard “demands more than an unadorned, the -defendant -unlawfully -\nharmed- me accusation.”  Ashcroft v. Iqbal , 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009). While “detailed Case: 1:21-cv-03745 Document #: 34 Filed: 01/19/22 Page 1 of 12 PageID #:<pageID>2 \n factual allegations” are not required, “labels and conclusions, and a formulaic \nrecitation of the elements of a cause of action will not do.” Twombly , 550 U.S. at 555. \nThe complaint must “contain sufficie nt factual matter, accepted as true, to ‘state a \nclaim to relief t hat is plausible on its face.’”  Iqbal , 556 U.S. at 678 (quoting Twombly , \n550 U.S. at 570). “ ‘A claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual \ncontent that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is \nliable  for the misconduct alleged.’” Boucher v. Fin. Sys. of Green Bay, Inc. , 880 F.3d \n362, 366 (7th Cir. 2018) (quoting Iqbal , 556 U.S. at 678).  In applying this standard, \nthe Court accepts all well -pleaded facts as true and draws all reasonable inferences \nin favor of the non -moving party. Tobey v. Chibucos, 890 F.3d 634, 646 (7th Cir. 2018).  \nBackground  \n Defendants Jeffrey Giles and Dale Brown owned and operated defendant First \nImpression Interactive, I nc. Black alleges that Defendants  made autodialed, \nprerecorded telemarketing calls to her cell phone which is registered on the National \nDo-Not-Call Registry. Black alleges that she did not give prior written consent to \nreceive these calls.  \n First Impressi on was incorporated in 2007 and dissolved in 2021 , before this \ncomplaint was filed . Black alleges that Giles and Brown were “the only officers and \nemployees of First Impression,” and so “had direct, personal participation in, and \npersonally authorized” the  phone calls. R. 20 ¶ 20. More specifically, Black alleges \nthat Giles and Brown:  \n(a) participated in the selection of the phone numbers that \nwould be called; (b) designed and approved the calling Case: 1:21-cv-03745 Document #: 34 Filed: 01/19/22 Page 2 of 12 PageID #:<pageID>3 \n campaigns; (c) drafted, worked on, and approved the \nscriptin g that would be used on the calls; (d) selected, \ncontracted for, and programmed the dialing equipment \nused to make the calls; (e) selected, contracted for, and \nprogrammed the soundboard technology Defendants used \nto interact with callers during the calls; (f) determined to \nwhat entity callers would be connected based on the \ninformation obtained during the calls; and (g) entered into \ncontracts with, managed relationships with, and received \nmoney from lead buyers who purchased Defendants’ \nservices.  \n \nId. ¶ 21.  \n In addition to these allegations that Giles and Brown were directly responsible \nfor the phone calls, Black alleges  that Giles and Brown hired “callers” to place the \nphone calls. Id.  ¶ 24. Black alleges that Giles and Brown provided these callers with \nlists of phone numbers, scripts, and equipment. Id.  ¶ 25. Black alleges that First \nImpression’s phone calls use prerecorded messages, but a live operator chose what \nprerecorded messages were  played and sometimes spoke  to the call recipient directly. \nSee id.  ¶ 31 \nAnalysis  \nI.  Standing  \n To demonstrate an injury in fact required to establish standing, “a plaintiff \nmust show that he or she suffered an invasion of a  legally protected interest that is  \nconcrete and particularized and actual or imminent, not  conjectural or hypothetical.”  \nSpokeo,  Inc. v. Robins , 578 U.S. 330, 339 (2016) . Defendants argue that Black has \nfailed to meet this burden because she “ does not provide any factual su pport ” for her \nallegations that Defendants ’ phone calls caused her “lost time” and “nuisance ,” and Case: 1:21-cv-03745 Document #: 34 Filed: 01/19/22 Page 3 of 12 PageID #:<pageID>4 \n fails to “ explain how [any such harm]  related to the alleged calls she received .” R. 23 \nat 12.  \n This argument , however, ignores  Black’s allegation that the phone calls were \nan “invasion of privacy,” and the Seventh Circuit’s holding that “unwanted automated \ntext messages ” constitute a “concrete harm” sufficient to confirm standing. See \nGadelhak  v. AT&T  Servs.,  Inc., 950 F.3d 458, 4 63 (7th Cir. 2020),  cert. denied,  141 S. \nCt. 2552 (2021) ; see also  TransUnion  LLC v. Ramirez , 141 S. Ct. 2190, 2204 (2021)  \n(citing with approval Gadelhak’s affirmance of unwanted text messages as an \nactionable example of the “traditionally recognized” harm  of “intrusion upon \nseclusion”). Of course, Black complains about phone calls instead of text messages . \nBut the Court finds this difference immaterial to the “intrusion of seclusion” or “invasion of privacy” for which Black seeks relief. To the extent Defendants question \nwhether Black has plausibly alleged that this harm is “ related to the alleged calls ,” \nthe Court finds the allegation that unwanted phone calls are disruptive to be more than plausible. Thus, Black has established standing here.  \nII. Individual Liability  \n Because First Impression has dissolved, Black’s allegations focus on the \npersonal liability of Giles and Brown. Black claims three forms of personal liability: (1) vicarious liability ; (2) “relief defendants ”; and (3)  “personal participation. ” \n A. Vicarious Liability  \n Black asserts vicarious liability in her complaint but  does not address it in her \nbrief. That is likely because it does not serve to establish liability for Giles and Brown Case: 1:21-cv-03745 Document #: 34 Filed: 01/19/22 Page 4 of 12 PageID #:<pageID>5 \n in this case. “Vicarious liability” applies to t he “principal,” who is then held liable for \nthe actions of the “agent.” See Magnini v. Centegra Health  Sys., 34 N.E. 3d 1115, 1121 \n(Ill. App. Ct. 1st Dist. 2015). Corporations cannot act independently of human agents. \nSee Downtown  Disposal Services, Inc. v . City of Chicago , 979 N.E.2d 50, 54  (Ill. 2012). \nRather, a  corporation  is the principal for its officers and employees and other agents  \nwho act on behalf of the corporation . Neither Brown nor Giles can be “vicariously \nliable” for the actions of First  Impression because, by definition, First Impression \ncannot be an agent for its officers or  employees.  \n B. Relief Defendants  \n Black also argues that Giles and Brown are proper defendants here because a \nplaintiff with a claim against “ a dissolved corporation ” can also maintain claims \nagainst “i ts individual shareholders as codefendants where they were alleged to have \nreceived distributions from the corporation before  dissolution.” R. 28 at 10.  There is \nauthority that a plaintiff who obtains a judgment against  a defunc t corporation can \npursue  a supplemental proceeding  against the shareholders. See Matos v. Richard A. \nNellis, Inc. , 101 F.3d 1193 (7th Cir. 1996) . But other than a single district court case \nfrom 1997, which has been questioned by at least one subs equent court, Black has \ncited no authority that it is proper for shareholders to be defendants on the \nsubstantive claims  without a separate basis for personal liability . See R. 28 at 10 \n(citing  E.E.O.C. v. JRG Fox Valley, Inc., 976 F. Supp. 2d 1161 (N.D. Ill. 1997) , called  \ninto question by  In re Chicago Trading Group, Inc. , 2001 WL 40071, * 4 (Bankr. N.D. Case: 1:21-cv-03745 Document #: 34 Filed: 01/19/22 Page 5 of 12 PageID #:<pageID>6 \n Ill. Jan. 17, 2001) ). This is insufficient authority for the Court to maintain Giles and \nBrown as defendants in this case.  \n C. Personal Participation  \n Lastly,  Black  allege s that Giles and Brown “personally  participated”  in the \nalleged  phone  calls  and on that basis  claim s that they violated  the TCPA.  See R. 20 \n¶¶ 19-20. Defendants  argue  that allowing  this claim  would  improperly  deprive  them  \nof “the protection  of the corporate  form,”  R. 32 at 5, because  corporate  officers  \n“ordinarily  are not subject  to corporate  liabilities,”  R. 23 at 3 (quoting  Laborer’s \nPension Fund v. Lay -Com, Inc. , 580 F.3d 602, 610 (7th Cir.  2009) ). \n Defendants’ argument is correct as far as it goes. But the alleged statutory \nviolation alleged here is not a “ corporate liability. ” Black alleges that Giles and Brown \nviolated a statute and injured her. T he corporate form does not shield officers and \nemployees from liability for bad  acts they commit in the course of their employment. \nSee Schur  v. L.A. Weight  Loss Centers,  Inc., 577 F.3d 752, 765 (7th Cir. 2009)  (“A \nperson is not absolved of personal liability to a third person on account of his or her \nnegligence or other wrongful act merely because at the time such person was acting \nas an employee within the scope of the employment.”) . If Plaintiffs can plausibly \nallege that Defendants personally violated the TCPA, Defendants’ attempted reliance \non the corporate form as a defense is a non -starter.  \n Applying this “well -settled tort rule ,” the majority of district courts have \nfollowed a Texas district court decision from 2001 and imposed “personal -\nparticipation liability” under the TCPA. See Texas v. Am. Blastfax,  Inc., 164 F . Supp. Case: 1:21-cv-03745 Document #: 34 Filed: 01/19/22 Page 6 of 12 PageID #:<pageID>7 \n 2d 892, 898 (W.D. Tex. 2001) . These courts have found corporate officers personally \nliable if they had “ direct, personal participation in or personally authorized the \nconduct found to have violated the statute, and was not merely tangentially invol ved.” \nPhysicians Healthsource,  Inc. v. A-S Medication  Sols.  LLC, 324 F. Supp. 3d 973, 983 \n(N.D. Ill. 2018)  (citing  Blastfax , 164 F. Supp. 2d 892).  \n Defendants  point  out, however,  that the “ personal -participation standard has \nbeen criticized as resting on the challenged assumption that traditional forms of \ncommon -law personal liability remain available under federal statutes by default. ” \nArwa Chiropractic,  P.C. v. Med-Care Diabetic  & Med.  Supplies,  Inc., 961 F.3d 942, \n947 (7th Cir. 2020) . Courts that question this kind of liability rely on the Supreme \nCourt’s reject ion of  aiding and abetting liability under the Securities Act in Cent ral \nBank  of Denver,  N.A. v. First  Interstate Bank  of Denver,  N.A., 511 U.S. 164, 184 \n(1994) . In Central Bank of Denver, the  Court held that it would not impose aiding and \nabetting liability under the statute, “even assuming [there is] a deeply rooted \nbackground of aiding and abetting tort liability,” because such liability was not \nexpressly provided in the statute . Id. Following  Central Bank of Denver, and citing  a \nsubsequent Seventh Circuit decision, the Third Circuit  has surmised (in dicta) that \nthe TCPA does not provide “personal -participation liability” because “statutory \nsilence as to the continuing availability of common -law liability arguably means there \nis none.” City  Select  Auto  Sales Inc. v. David  Randall  Assocs.,  Inc., 885 F.3d 154, 161 \n(3d Cir. 2018) ( quoting Boim  v. Holy  Land  Found.  for Relief and Dev., 549 F.3d 685, \n689 (7th Cir. 2008) (en banc)).  More recently, the Seventh Circuit returned the favor Case: 1:21-cv-03745 Document #: 34 Filed: 01/19/22 Page 7 of 12 PageID #:<pageID>8 \n and cited the Third Circuit’s reasoning in City Select  (also in dicta) and  question ed \nwhether the TCPA imposes personal -participation liability . See Arwa Chiropractic, \n961 F.3d at 947. Despite the fact that neither the Third nor Seventh Circuits actually \nissued holdings on this issue (and apparently no other circuit court has either), \nDefendants argue that the Seventh Circuit’s discussion in Arwa Chiropractic \nindicates approval of the Th ird Circuit’s suggested rejection of personal -participation \nliability under the TCPA, and this Court should take the hint and dismiss Plaintiffs’ \nclaims.  \n However, unlike the aiding and abetting liability at issue in Central Bank of \nDenver, personal -participation liability does not necessarily extend liability beyond \nthe terms of the TCPA. The TCPA imposes liability on “person s” who “make any call” \nthat violates the terms of the statute. See 47 U.S.C. § 227(b)(1)(A)(iii). On its most \nbasic level, personal -participation liability simply acknowledges that corporate \nofficers or employees who actually make the offending calls can be personally liable \nfor violation of the TCPA. To the extent Plaintiffs have plausibly alleged t hat the two \ndefendants actually made the alleged phone calls, liability for such conduct is well \nwithin the statutory terms and does not run afoul of the concerns identified by the \nSupreme Court in Central Bank of Denver.  \n But beyond this uncontroversial a pplication of the statute, personal -\nparticipation liability also purports to impose liability on corporate officers who \n“authorize” the offending calls, or  are the so -called “guiding spirit ” to their \ncommission by other employees. See Arwa  Chiropractic,  P.C. v. Med-Care Diabetic & Case: 1:21-cv-03745 Document #: 34 Filed: 01/19/22 Page 8 of 12 PageID #:<pageID>9 \n Med.  Supplies,  Inc., 2019 WL 527497, at *6 (N.D. Ill. Feb. 11, 2019) (quoting Blastfax , \n164 F. Supp. 2d at 898). While this kind of liability is more analogous  to aiding and \nabetting liability, it still requires greater  direct action because the officer is exercising \ntheir corporate and supervisory authority to cause an action to occur. An officer that \n“authorizes” a phone call  does not merely aid and abet that phone call but rather is \nthe “person” who actually decides that the phone call should be made . Indeed, the \nofficer’s decision that the call should be made  is effectively the act of making  it. \nBecause if one employee were to refuse the order or fail to carry it out, the officer \nwould simply find another employee willing to comply  and make the call . Just \nbecause the officer does not use his own hands to make the call does not change the \nfact that the officer decided that the call should be made  and caused it to happen.  \n Perhaps discovery will show that Giles and Brown were not so intimately \ninvolved in the making of the alleged phone call s in this case . But Black has alleged \nthat they provided the call lists, scripts, and equipment necessary to make the calls  \nand directed that the calls be made . This is  sufficient to plausibly allege their  liability \nunder the TCPA.  \nIII. Prerecorded or Autodialed Calls  \n The TCPA prohibits phone calls made “ using any automatic telephone dialing \nsystem or an artificial or prerecorded voice .” 47 U.S.C. § 227(b)(1)(A). Defendants \nargue that Black has not plausibly alleged the use of an “automatic telephone dialing \nsystem” bec ause she does not address the facts necessary to allege that such \ntechnology was used.  See R. 23 at 10; see also  Facebook,  Inc. v. Duguid, 141 S. Ct. Case: 1:21-cv-03745 Document #: 34 Filed: 01/19/22 Page 9 of 12 PageID #:<pageID>10 \n 1163, 1167 (2021)  (“To qualify as an ‘ automatic telephone dialing system, ’ a device \nmust have the capacity either to store a telephone number using a random or \nsequential generator or to produce a telephone number using a random or sequential \nnumber generator. ”). Black does not respond to this argument, apparently conceding  \nshe has not plausibly pled the use of an automatic telephone dialing system.  \n But even if this allegation is insufficient, the statute also prohibits phone calls \nmade using “an artificial or prerecorded voice.” See Marshall  v. Grubhub  Inc., 2021 \nWL 4401496, at *5 (N.D. Ill. Sept. 27, 2021)  (“Use of an [automatic telephone dialing \nsystem]  is an alternative basis for liability, not a necessary element . . . . [T]he use of \na prerecorded or automated voice suffices to bring the calls within the ambit of the \nTCPA ’s robocall prohibition .”). While Black alleges that she perceived the calls as \nbeing a recorded  voice, Defendants argue that her  other allegations undermine her  \nalleged perception. Defendants point out that Black alleges that the caller responded \nsubstantively to Black’s  statemen ts, such as stating that “the call would only take 2 -\n3 minutes” after Black protested that she could not take the call because “she was at \ndinner.” R. 20 ¶¶ 52 -53. Defendants argue that this indicates the call was not \nrecorded.   \n According to Black, howeve r, Defendants use “soundboard technology,” which \npermits “a live operator or . . . artificial intelligence” to select prerecorded responses \n“to interact with the called party during the call.” R. 20 ¶ 31.  Defendants do not \nquestion the plausibility of this  allegation. And at the motion to dismiss stage, the \nCourt must accept all well -pleaded facts as true. The Court is unfamiliar with Case: 1:21-cv-03745 Document #: 34 Filed: 01/19/22 Page 10 of 12 PageID #:<pageID>11 \n “soundboard technology,” but at least two  court s have granted summary judgment to \nplaintiff s for TCPA claims based on the defendant’s use of soundboard technology , \nincluding a court in this district . See Bakov  v. Consol.  World  Travel,  Inc., 2019 WL \n6699188, at *4 (N.D. Ill. Dec. 9, 2019) ; see also  Braver v. NorthStar Alarm  Servs.,  \nLLC, 2019 WL 3208651, at *1 (W.D. Okla. July 16, 2019) . That is a sufficient basis \nfor this Court to find that Black has plausibly alleged she received phone calls from \nDefendants using a record voice in violation of the TCPA.  \nIV. Consent  \n Lastly, Defendants argue that Black’s claims should be dismissed because she \nconsented to receive the calls and consent is a defense under the TCPA. See R. 23 at \n12; see also  47 U.S.C. § 227(b)(1)(A) (exempting calls “made with the prior express \nconsent of the called party”) . Defendants’ argument relies on a declaration from \ndefendant Giles purporting to explain how he knows  that Black consented to receive \nphone calls from First Impression. See R. 23 at 13- 14; R. 14- 1. Black, however, has \npresented her own evidence to argue that Defendants have fabricated documents \nregarding her consent. See R. 28 at 19 (citing R. 28- 1).  \n Defendants argue that the Court should stay the case to permit summary \njudgment briefing on the issue of consent. But c learly, there is a factual dispute \nregarding consent . Summary judgment is not the vehicle to resolve a factual dispute. \nFurther, the parties have not had the opportunity to take formal discovery on this or \nany other issue in the case. For these reasons, th e court rejects Defendants ’ request \nfor a stay and targeted summary judgment briefing.  Case: 1:21-cv-03745 Document #: 34 Filed: 01/19/22 Page 11 of 12 PageID #:<pageID>12 \n \nConclusion  \n Therefore, Defendants’ motion to dismiss [13] [24] is denied. The parties should \nsubmit a joint status report by J anuary 25, 2022  proposing  a case management \nschedule  and stating whether the hearing set for January 27, 2022 continues to be \nnecessary.   \nENTERED : \n \n          \n        ______________________________ \n        Honorable Thomas M.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: This case involves a securities fraud class action against Quintus Corporation, relating to false financial statements following its 1999 initial public offering. Quintus, initially an artificial intelligence software company, provided eCRM solutions and faced financial restatements leading to dramatically falling stock prices and eventual bankruptcy. The court granted final approval of a $10.1 million settlement to be distributed to affected class members, deeming it fair and reasonable given Quintus’s limited financial resources stemming from ongoing bankruptcy proceedings.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: The key legal issue is whether the settlement agreement in the securities fraud class action involving overstated revenue and misleading financial statements is fair, reasonable, and adequate to compensate the affected investors.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court held that the proposed class action settlement of $10.1 million is fair, reasonable, and adequate, granting final approval for the settlement, the plan of allocation, and the application for attorney fees and expenses.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine if a toy company sold shares to people saying it was making more money than it actually was. People bought those shares thinking the company was doing well, but later found out it wasn’t. The company asked all those who bought shares to agree to settle their claims for a shared amount of money because the company went bankrupt. The judge said, \"The deal is fair, so you all split the settlement money based on how much you lost.\" In this case, the company also worked with AI software, which was part of its business before things went wrong.",

During the class period, Quintusprovided “e-Customer Relationship Management” or “eCRM” solutions,primarily through its “eContact” software.  Quintus grew through aseries of acquisitions in 1997 through 1999.  \nAs part of an initial public offering completed November\n15, 1999, Quintus sold 5.175 million shares of Quintus common stockat $18/share.  Consistent with those heady times, the stock pricesoon reached $55/share. On February 28, 2000, Quintus announcedits intent to acquire Mustang.com, which developed corporate e-mailmanagement software.  Quintus filed a registration statement inconnection with the Mustang acquisition on March 28, 2000.\nOn November 15, 2000, its first anniversary as a publicly\ntraded company, Quintus announced that it was reviewing previouslyfiled financial statements.  The price of Quintus shares fell from$6.00/share to $2.97/share before trading was halted by NASDAQshortly after noon, representing a one-day (or less) price drop ofjust over 50%.  On November 22, 2000, Quintus announced the resultsof a financial audit, which revealed that Quintus had overstatedrevenue on several occasions.  The truth regarding Quintus’sfinancial condition continued to emerge over the next few monthsand NASDAQ delisted Quintus stock on February 16, 2001.  After twodays of over-the-counter trading, the price of Quintus common stocksank to $0.14 on February 22, 2001, when Quintus filed for Chapter11 bankruptcy.\nA flurry of class actions alleging securities fraud wereCase 3:00-cv-04276-VRW   Document 21   Filed 12/05/06   Page 2 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n3filed in this court and ultimately consolidated.  Doc #71.  The\ncourt designated the law firm of Weiss & Yourman (now Weiss &Lurie) as lead counsel pursuant to a competitive selection process. See In re Quintus Sec Litig\n, 148 F Supp 2d 967 (ND Cal 2001). \nFollowing two rounds of motions to dismiss, the court designatedRoman Reznik as lead plaintiff.  Doc #201.  \nThe first amended consolidated class action complaint,\nDoc #215 (CAC), alleges that false and misleading statements ofmaterial fact appeared in the Quintus IPO registration statement,the Mustang registration statement and various periodic financialreports.  Accordingly, the CAC asserts claims under sections 11,12(a)(2) and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933 (the “1933 Act”) aswell as claims under sections 10(b), 14(a)(9) and 20(a) of theSecurities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “1934 Act”).  Id ¶¶291-357.\nThis litigation is only one current in Quintus’s wake. \nAs noted, Quintus initiated a Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceeding inthe United States District Court for the District of Delaware. Additionally, various shareholder actions were filed in Californiaand Texas state courts.  Thus, the proposed settlement presentlyunder consideration is part of a global settlement to beadministered by the Chapter 11 trustee.  \nOn July 7, 2006, the court preliminarily approved the\nproposed settlement and certified the class.  Doc #269.  The courtordered that notice of the pending settlement and final approvalhearing be mailed to potential class members on July 25, 2006.  Doc#273.  Over 20,000 notice letters were mailed to potentialsettlement class members and shareholders of record.  Doc #277 at¶5.  Not a single class member objected to the settlement orCase 3:00-cv-04276-VRW   Document 21   Filed 12/05/06   Page 3 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n4requested exclusion from the class settlement in response to the\nnotice letter.  Id at ¶7-8.  Similarly, no objection was raised atthe final settlement approval hearing on December 5, 2006.\nII\nThe proposed settlement agreement provides that\ndefendants will pay $10.1 million in cash into a common fund to bedistributed to class members. \nThe question currently before the court is whether this\nsettlement should be approved.  “The court must approve anysettlement, voluntary dismissal, or compromise of the claims,issues, or defenses of a certified class.”  FRCP 23(e)(1)(A).  Thecourt bears in mind the Ninth Circuit’s “strong judicial policythat favors settlement, particularly where complex class actionlitigation is concerned.”  Class Plaintiffs v City of Seattle\n, 355\nF2d 1268, 1276 (9th Cir 1992).  While no class member has objected,the court must still review the proposed settlement.  Manual forComplex Litigation (Fourth) §21.635 (“Even if there are no or fewobjections or adverse appearances before or at the fairnesshearing, the judge must ensure that there is sufficient record asto the basis and justification for the settlement”).\nThe court may approve a settlement “only after a hearing\nand on finding that the settlement * * * is fair, reasonable andadequate.”  FRCP 23(e)(1)(C).  A final approval hearing was held onDecember 5, 2006.  The Ninth Circuit has set forth the followingfactors for courts considering approval of class actionsettlements: Case 3:00-cv-04276-VRW   Document 21   Filed 12/05/06   Page 4 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n5(1) the strength of the plaintiffs’ case; (2) the risk,\nexpense, complexity, and likely duration of furtherlitigation; (3) the risk of maintaining class actionstatus throughout the trial; (4) the amount offered insettlement; (5) the extent of discovery completed and thestate of the proceedings; (6) the experience and views ofcounsel; (7) the presence of a governmental participant;and (8) the reaction of the class members to the proposedsettlement. \nChurchill Village v General Electric\n, 361 F3d 566, 575 (9th Cir\n2004).  These factors overwhelmingly support approval of the classsettlement.  The court discusses the settlement evaluation factorsthat are relevant in this case.  Id at 576 n7.\nThis settlement follows six years of protracted\nlitigation, discovery and negotiation.  Further litigation wouldrequire plaintiffs to survive motions for summary judgment and, ifsuccessful, present their case to a jury.  The considerable riskand cost associated with further litigation is enhanced byQuintus’s pending bankruptcy litigation.  This court noted early inthese proceedings that “plaintiffs are going to have troublefinding deep pockets in this case.”  Doc #85 at 37.  This globalsettlement divides the limited resources of a bankrupt corporationamong the many litigants suing Quintus.  Doc #276 at ¶ 6.  Much ofthe remaining value to be apportioned among the litigants is fromQuintus’s directors and officers liability insurance policies.  Thesettlement class, however, is receiving the “lion’s share” of theinsurance coverage.  Doc #276 at ¶46.  Weighing the risks and costsof further litigation, the court concludes that this settlement isadvisable.\nThe settlement amount, $10.1 million, closely resembles\nthe $9,996,000 settlement predicted by the Haas Study\n referenced by\nthis court in its previous order.  Quintus , 148 F Supp 2d at 985. Case 3:00-cv-04276-VRW   Document 21   Filed 12/05/06   Page 5 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n6This proposed settlement’s settlement/potential investor loss (PIL)\nratio of 16.83% marginally exceeds the average class actionsecurities litigation settlement/PIL ratio of 16.66%.  MukeshBajaj, Sumon C Mazumdar & Atuya Sarin, Securities Class Action\nSettlements , 43 Santa Clara L Rev 101, 116 tbl 11 (2003). \nAchieving the average settlement/PIL ratio despite having tocompete with Quintus’s bankruptcy estate for remaining resourcesindicates the fairness of this settlement to class members.\nFollowing the hearing, plaintiffs’ counsel expressed\nconcern that courts’ use of studies to predict recovery at theoutset of litigation may tend to cap recovery at that level.  Whilethe court does not discount that concern, it warrants mention thatthe Haas study data reflect a range of litigation results.  Anyindividual case may differ and differ significantly from theaverage or median results.  In any event, the obstacles to agreater recovery in this case were substantial.  Given thosedifficulties, a recovery within the average range may wellrepresent an achievement that is greater than average.  \nFinally, the absence of any objections or requests for\nexclusion among a class of this size demonstrates the overallreasonableness of this settlement.  \nThe risk and cost of further litigation, the settlement\namount and the silence of class members provide powerful evidencethat the settlement is fair, reasonable and adequate.  Accordingly,plaintiffs’ motion for final approval of the class actionsettlement is GRANTED.////Case 3:00-cv-04276-VRW   Document 21   Filed 12/05/06   Page 6 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n7III\nPlaintiffs also seek final approval of the plan of\nallocation of the settlement fund.  Doc #274.  The plan ofallocation operates as follows: \nTo the extent there are sufficient funds in the Net\nSettlement Fund, each Authorized Claimant will receive anamount equal to the Authorized Claimant’s claim.  If,however, the amount in the Net Settlement Fund is notsufficient to permit payment of the total claim of eachAuthorized Claimant, then each Authorized Claimant shallbe paid the percentage that each Authorized Claimant’sclaim bears to the total of the claims of all AuthorizedClaimants.  A claim will be computed as follows: theclaim shall be equal to the amount paid for shares ofQuintus common stock purchased or acquired by SettlementClass members during the Settlement Class Period, less:(a) the amount realized from the sale of any such sharesduring the Settlement Class Period or through February22, 2001, or $0.14 per share, whichever is greater; or(b) the number of any such shares held at the close ofbusiness on February 22, 2001, multiplied by $0.14 (theclosing price of Quintus stock on February 22, 2001).\nDoc #277 Ex A at 10.  The plan of allocation was fully described innotice letters to potential class members and no objections weresubmitted to the court or raised at the hearing.\nThe court has discretion to approve a plan of allocation\nthat is fair and reasonable.  In re Heritage Bond Litigation\n, 2005\nUS Dist LEXIS 13555 at *38 (CD Cal 2005).  “A plan of allocationthat reimburses class members based on the extent of their injuriesis generally reasonable.”  Id (quoting In re Oracle Securities\nLitigation , 1994 US Dist LEXIS 21593 at *1 (ND Cal 1994)).  Because this plan provides proportional reimbursement and\nno class member objected, the court concludes the plan ofallocation is fair and reasonable.  Accordingly, the motion forfinal approval of the plan of allocation is GRANTED.Case 3:00-cv-04276-VRW   Document 21   Filed 12/05/06   Page 7 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n8IV\nLead plaintiff and his counsel seek an award of attorney\nfees and expenses totaling $1,141,978.40.  Doc #275 at 16.  Thisamount includes attorney fees of $817,500, expenses of $150,000,reimbursement of fees and expenses of bankruptcy counsel of$162,478.40 and reimbursement of $12,000 to the lead plaintiff. Id.  The fees and expenses sought amount to 11.3% of the totalsettlement amount.\nThe court preliminarily approved an award of attorney\nfees and expenses in its July 7, 2006, order.  Doc #269 at 21. This request differs by including $15,096.40 of additional fees andexpenses of bankruptcy counsel and $12,000 in reimbursement to leadplaintiff.  The court anticipated such an increase in the amountsought for bankruptcy counsel.  Id.  Lead plaintiff, however, seeksreimbursement for 80 hours of his time at a rate of $150/hour forthe first time.  Doc #276 Ex 5 at ¶¶2-3.  The court is authorizedto reimburse lead plaintiff for reasonable costs and expensesrelated to the representation of the class, including lost wages. 15 USC §78u-4(a)(4).  As a registered securities principal and theprincipal of RAMA Financial, lead plaintiff’s request forcompensation is reasonable.  Doc #276 Ex 5 at ¶3.\nThese minor increases in the amount requested do not\ndisturb the court’s prior conclusion that “the amount of attorneyfees (including those incurred by bankruptcy counsel) is relativelymodest in relation to the total class recovery.”  Doc #269 at 21. This court, however, “rejects reliance solely on a comparison ofthe percentage fee requested here with other percentage awards orwith a so-called benchmark percentage.”  In re HPL Technologies,Case 3:00-cv-04276-VRW   Document 21   Filed 12/05/06   Page 8 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n9Inc Sec Litig , 366 F Supp 2d 912, 914 (ND Cal 2005).  Instead, the\ncourt employs a lodestar cross-check to determine thereasonableness of the requested attorney fees.\n“Three figures are salient in a lodestar calculation: (1)\ncounsel’s reasonable hours, (2) counsel’s reasonable hourly rateand (3) a multiplier thought to compensate for various factors.” Id at 919.  In performing a cross-check, the court calculates theimplied multiplier to determine its reasonableness.  Lead counselhas spent more than 5,000 attorney hours in this matter, most ofthem by senior attorneys.  Doc #275 Ex 1.  Applying the Laffey\nmatrix hourly rates, as adjusted for Los Angeles and cost of livingincreases, lead counsel calculates its lodestar as $1,976,262.50. Id at 12 and Ex 1.  The requested attorney fees of $817,500, lessthan half the lodestar, provide an implied lodestar multiplier of0.414.  Id at 13.  This multiplier is indeed reasonable, indicatingclass members obtained a significant discount on market attorneyrates.  Notably, competitive selection of class counsel producedthis low loadstar ratio or negative multiplier.  Quintus\n, 148 F\nSupp 2d 967.  Despite any statutory limitation on use ofcompetitive selection, see In re Cavanaugh\n, 306 F3d 726 (9th Cir\n2002), this provides further evidence that courts may look to thecompetitive selection cases in determining a reasonable level offees and costs.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: This court case involves a securities fraud class action lawsuit against Quintus Corporation, stemming from the allegation that the company overstated its revenues, leading to an artificially inflated stock price followed by a drastic loss. Quintus, originally focused on artificial intelligence software and later on eCRM solutions, particularly through its product \"eContact\", faced bankruptcy amidst these allegations. The court granted final approval to a $10.1 million settlement to be distributed among affected shareholders, along with attorney fees and expenses, concluding the proceedings.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the proposed class settlement for securities fraud allegations against Quintus Corporation was fair, reasonable, and adequate, warranting final court approval.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court approved the settlement agreement, noting that it was fair, reasonable, and adequate, particularly given the complexities and risks of further litigation, the company's bankruptcy status, and the absence of any objections from class members.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine a company got in trouble because they told investors they made more money than they actually did, making their stock look more valuable than it really was. When the truth came out, the stock's price crashed. People who lost money sued the company, and now the court has agreed on a deal where the company pays some money back to those investors. The judge thinks this deal is fair because it's hard to keep asking for money from a company that's also dealing with bankruptcy, and nobody seemed unhappy with this solution.",

Doc #71.  The\ncourt designated the law firm of Weiss & Yourman (now Weiss &Lurie) as lead counsel pursuant to a competitive selection process. See In re Quintus Sec Litig\n, 148 F Supp 2d 967 (ND Cal 2001). \nFollowing two rounds of motions to dismiss, the court designatedRoman Reznik as lead plaintiff.  Doc #201.  \nThe first amended consolidated class action complaint,\nDoc #215 (CAC), alleges that false and misleading statements ofmaterial fact appeared in the Quintus IPO registration statement,the Mustang registration statement and various periodic financialreports.  Accordingly, the CAC asserts claims under sections 11,12(a)(2) and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933 (the “1933 Act”) aswell as claims under sections 10(b), 14(a)(9) and 20(a) of theSecurities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “1934 Act”).

Id at ¶7-8.  Similarly, no objection was raised atthe final settlement approval hearing on December 5, 2006.\nII\nThe proposed settlement agreement provides that\ndefendants will pay $10.1 million in cash into a common fund to bedistributed to class members. \nThe question currently before the court is whether this\nsettlement should be approved.  “The court must approve anysettlement, voluntary dismissal, or compromise of the claims,issues, or defenses of a certified class.”  FRCP 23(e)(1)(A).  Thecourt bears in mind the Ninth Circuit’s “strong judicial policythat favors settlement, particularly where complex class actionlitigation is concerned.”  Class Plaintiffs v City of Seattle\n, 355\nF2d 1268, 1276 (9th Cir 1992).  While no class member has objected,the court must still review the proposed settlement.  Manual forComplex Litigation (Fourth) §21.635 (“Even if there are no or fewobjections or adverse appearances before or at the fairnesshearing, the judge must ensure that there is sufficient record asto the basis and justification for the settlement”).\nThe court may approve a settlement “only after a hearing\nand on finding that the settlement * * * is fair, reasonable andadequate.”  FRCP 23(e)(1)(C).  A final approval hearing was held onDecember 5, 2006.  The Ninth Circuit has set forth the followingfactors for courts considering approval of class actionsettlements: Case 3:00-cv-04504-VRW   Document 20   Filed 12/05/06   Page 4 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n5(1) the strength of the plaintiffs’ case; (2) the risk,\nexpense, complexity, and likely duration of furtherlitigation; (3) the risk of maintaining class actionstatus throughout the trial; (4) the amount offered insettlement; (5) the extent of discovery completed and thestate of the proceedings; (6) the experience and views ofcounsel; (7) the presence of a governmental participant;and (8) the reaction of the class members to the proposedsettlement. \nChurchill Village v General Electric\n, 361 F3d 566, 575 (9th Cir\n2004).  These factors overwhelmingly support approval of the classsettlement.  The court discusses the settlement evaluation factorsthat are relevant in this case.  Id at 576 n7.\nThis settlement follows six years of protracted\nlitigation, discovery and negotiation.  Further litigation wouldrequire plaintiffs to survive motions for summary judgment and, ifsuccessful, present their case to a jury.  The considerable riskand cost associated with further litigation is enhanced byQuintus’s pending bankruptcy litigation.  This court noted early inthese proceedings that “plaintiffs are going to have troublefinding deep pockets in this case.”  Doc #85 at 37.  This globalsettlement divides the limited resources of a bankrupt corporationamong the many litigants suing Quintus.  Doc #276 at ¶ 6.  Much ofthe remaining value to be apportioned among the litigants is fromQuintus’s directors and officers liability insurance policies.  Thesettlement class, however, is receiving the “lion’s share” of theinsurance coverage.  Doc #276 at ¶46.  Weighing the risks and costsof further litigation, the court concludes that this settlement isadvisable.\nThe settlement amount, $10.1 million, closely resembles\nthe $9,996,000 settlement predicted by the Haas Study\n referenced by\nthis court in its previous order.  Quintus , 148 F Supp 2d at 985. Case 3:00-cv-04504-VRW   Document 20   Filed 12/05/06   Page 5 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n6This proposed settlement’s settlement/potential investor loss (PIL)\nratio of 16.83% marginally exceeds the average class actionsecurities litigation settlement/PIL ratio of 16.66%.  MukeshBajaj, Sumon C Mazumdar & Atuya Sarin, Securities Class Action\nSettlements , 43 Santa Clara L Rev 101, 116 tbl 11 (2003). \nAchieving the average settlement/PIL ratio despite having tocompete with Quintus’s bankruptcy estate for remaining resourcesindicates the fairness of this settlement to class members.\nFollowing the hearing, plaintiffs’ counsel expressed\nconcern that courts’ use of studies to predict recovery at theoutset of litigation may tend to cap recovery at that level.  Whilethe court does not discount that concern, it warrants mention thatthe Haas study data reflect a range of litigation results.  Anyindividual case may differ and differ significantly from theaverage or median results.  In any event, the obstacles to agreater recovery in this case were substantial.  Given thosedifficulties, a recovery within the average range may wellrepresent an achievement that is greater than average.  \nFinally, the absence of any objections or requests for\nexclusion among a class of this size demonstrates the overallreasonableness of this settlement.  \nThe risk and cost of further litigation, the settlement\namount and the silence of class members provide powerful evidencethat the settlement is fair, reasonable and adequate.  Accordingly,plaintiffs’ motion for final approval of the class actionsettlement is GRANTED.////Case 3:00-cv-04504-VRW   Document 20   Filed 12/05/06   Page 6 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n7III\nPlaintiffs also seek final approval of the plan of\nallocation of the settlement fund.  Doc #274.  The plan ofallocation operates as follows: \nTo the extent there are sufficient funds in the Net\nSettlement Fund, each Authorized Claimant will receive anamount equal to the Authorized Claimant’s claim.  If,however, the amount in the Net Settlement Fund is notsufficient to permit payment of the total claim of eachAuthorized Claimant, then each Authorized Claimant shallbe paid the percentage that each Authorized Claimant’sclaim bears to the total of the claims of all AuthorizedClaimants.  A claim will be computed as follows: theclaim shall be equal to the amount paid for shares ofQuintus common stock purchased or acquired by SettlementClass members during the Settlement Class Period, less:(a) the amount realized from the sale of any such sharesduring the Settlement Class Period or through February22, 2001, or $0.14 per share, whichever is greater; or(b) the number of any such shares held at the close ofbusiness on February 22, 2001, multiplied by $0.14 (theclosing price of Quintus stock on February 22, 2001).\nDoc #277 Ex A at 10.  The plan of allocation was fully described innotice letters to potential class members and no objections weresubmitted to the court or raised at the hearing.\nThe court has discretion to approve a plan of allocation\nthat is fair and reasonable.  In re Heritage Bond Litigation\n, 2005\nUS Dist LEXIS 13555 at *38 (CD Cal 2005).  “A plan of allocationthat reimburses class members based on the extent of their injuriesis generally reasonable.”  Id (quoting In re Oracle Securities\nLitigation , 1994 US Dist LEXIS 21593 at *1 (ND Cal 1994)).  Because this plan provides proportional reimbursement and\nno class member objected, the court concludes the plan ofallocation is fair and reasonable.  Accordingly, the motion forfinal approval of the plan of allocation is GRANTED.Case 3:00-cv-04504-VRW   Document 20   Filed 12/05/06   Page 7 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n8IV\nLead plaintiff and his counsel seek an award of attorney\nfees and expenses totaling $1,141,978.40.  Doc #275 at 16.  Thisamount includes attorney fees of $817,500, expenses of $150,000,reimbursement of fees and expenses of bankruptcy counsel of$162,478.40 and reimbursement of $12,000 to the lead plaintiff. Id.  The fees and expenses sought amount to 11.3% of the totalsettlement amount.\nThe court preliminarily approved an award of attorney\nfees and expenses in its July 7, 2006, order.  Doc #269 at 21. This request differs by including $15,096.40 of additional fees andexpenses of bankruptcy counsel and $12,000 in reimbursement to leadplaintiff.  The court anticipated such an increase in the amountsought for bankruptcy counsel.  Id.  Lead plaintiff, however, seeksreimbursement for 80 hours of his time at a rate of $150/hour forthe first time.  Doc #276 Ex 5 at ¶¶2-3.  The court is authorizedto reimburse lead plaintiff for reasonable costs and expensesrelated to the representation of the class, including lost wages. 15 USC §78u-4(a)(4).  As a registered securities principal and theprincipal of RAMA Financial, lead plaintiff’s request forcompensation is reasonable.  Doc #276 Ex 5 at ¶3.\nThese minor increases in the amount requested do not\ndisturb the court’s prior conclusion that “the amount of attorneyfees (including those incurred by bankruptcy counsel) is relativelymodest in relation to the total class recovery.”  Doc #269 at 21. This court, however, “rejects reliance solely on a comparison ofthe percentage fee requested here with other percentage awards orwith a so-called benchmark percentage.”  In re HPL Technologies,Case 3:00-cv-04504-VRW   Document 20   Filed 12/05/06   Page 8 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n9Inc Sec Litig , 366 F Supp 2d 912, 914 (ND Cal 2005).  Instead, the\ncourt employs a lodestar cross-check to determine thereasonableness of the requested attorney fees.\n“Three figures are salient in a lodestar calculation: (1)\ncounsel’s reasonable hours, (2) counsel’s reasonable hourly rateand (3) a multiplier thought to compensate for various factors.” Id at 919.  In performing a cross-check, the court calculates theimplied multiplier to determine its reasonableness.  Lead counselhas spent more than 5,000 attorney hours in this matter, most ofthem by senior attorneys.  Doc #275 Ex 1.  Applying the Laffey\nmatrix hourly rates, as adjusted for Los Angeles and cost of livingincreases, lead counsel calculates its lodestar as $1,976,262.50. Id at 12 and Ex 1.  The requested attorney fees of $817,500, lessthan half the lodestar, provide an implied lodestar multiplier of0.414.  Id at 13.  This multiplier is indeed reasonable, indicatingclass members obtained a significant discount on market attorneyrates.  Notably, competitive selection of class counsel producedthis low loadstar ratio or negative multiplier.  Quintus\n, 148 F\nSupp 2d 967.  Despite any statutory limitation on use ofcompetitive selection, see In re Cavanaugh\n, 306 F3d 726 (9th Cir\n2002), this provides further evidence that courts may look to thecompetitive selection cases in determining a reasonable level offees and costs.  See In re Cabletron, Inc Securities Litigation\n,\n2006 US Dist LEXIS 75188 (D NH 2006).\nThe requested attorney fees and expenses are reasonable\ncompensation for the value provided to the class.  This is furtherevidenced by the lack of class member objections to thepreliminarily approved attorney fees and expenses included in theCase 3:00-cv-04504-VRW   Document 20   Filed 12/05/06   Page 9 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n10\nclass notice.\nAccordingly, the application for award of attorney fees\nand reimbursement of expenses is GRANTED.\nIT IS SO ORDERED.\n                                   \nVAUGHN R WALKERUnited States District Chief JudgeCase 3:00-cv-04504-VRW   Document 20   Filed 12/05/06   Page 10 of 10",

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: This case arises from a consolidated securities fraud class action involving Quintus Corporation, an AI software company that allegedly overstated its revenue, leading to significant financial discrepancies. The court granted final approval for a settlement of $10.1 million due to the inability to locate deeper financial resources from the bankrupt corporation, and also approved attorney fees and expenses amounting to $1,141,978.40. The AI aspect is highlighted through Quintus's business focus on artificial intelligence, particularly its \"eCRM\" solutions during the time in question.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the proposed settlement of $10.1 million for the securities fraud class action against Quintus Corporation is fair, reasonable, and adequate for the plaintiffs, given the circumstances of bankruptcy and overstated revenue by the company.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court held that the settlement was fair, reasonable, and adequate, granting final approval for both the settlement and the allocation plan. Additionally, the court approved the requested attorney fees and expenses, finding them reasonable in relation to the services provided.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine a technology company made people believe it was making more money than it actually was. When everyone found out, the company's stock price crashed. People who bought shares during that time felt cheated and took the company to court. The company was out of money, but it agreed to pay back some of the money to the people who lost out, totaling $10.1 million. The court said this was a fair deal, considering the company had declared bankruptcy, and allowed the lawyers to get paid for their work without any objections from the people involved.",

Similarly, no objection was raised atthe final settlement approval hearing on December 5, 2006.\nII\nThe proposed settlement agreement provides that\ndefendants will pay $10.1 million in cash into a common fund to bedistributed to class members. \nThe question currently before the court is whether this\nsettlement should be approved.  “The court must approve anysettlement, voluntary dismissal, or compromise of the claims,issues, or defenses of a certified class.”  FRCP 23(e)(1)(A).  Thecourt bears in mind the Ninth Circuit’s “strong judicial policythat favors settlement, particularly where complex class actionlitigation is concerned.”  Class Plaintiffs v City of Seattle\n, 355\nF2d 1268, 1276 (9th Cir 1992).  While no class member has objected,the court must still review the proposed settlement.  Manual forComplex Litigation (Fourth) §21.635 (“Even if there are no or fewobjections or adverse appearances before or at the fairnesshearing, the judge must ensure that there is sufficient record asto the basis and justification for the settlement”).\nThe court may approve a settlement “only after a hearing\nand on finding that the settlement * * * is fair, reasonable andadequate.”  FRCP 23(e)(1)(C).  A final approval hearing was held onDecember 5, 2006.  The Ninth Circuit has set forth the followingfactors for courts considering approval of class actionsettlements: Case 3:00-cv-04274-VRW   Document 18   Filed 12/05/06   Page 4 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n5(1) the strength of the plaintiffs’ case; (2) the risk,\nexpense, complexity, and likely duration of furtherlitigation; (3) the risk of maintaining class actionstatus throughout the trial; (4) the amount offered insettlement; (5) the extent of discovery completed and thestate of the proceedings; (6) the experience and views ofcounsel; (7) the presence of a governmental participant;and (8) the reaction of the class members to the proposedsettlement. \nChurchill Village v General Electric\n, 361 F3d 566, 575 (9th Cir\n2004).  These factors overwhelmingly support approval of the classsettlement.  The court discusses the settlement evaluation factorsthat are relevant in this case.  Id at 576 n7.\nThis settlement follows six years of protracted\nlitigation, discovery and negotiation.  Further litigation wouldrequire plaintiffs to survive motions for summary judgment and, ifsuccessful, present their case to a jury.  The considerable riskand cost associated with further litigation is enhanced byQuintus’s pending bankruptcy litigation.  This court noted early inthese proceedings that “plaintiffs are going to have troublefinding deep pockets in this case.”  Doc #85 at 37.  This globalsettlement divides the limited resources of a bankrupt corporationamong the many litigants suing Quintus.  Doc #276 at ¶ 6.  Much ofthe remaining value to be apportioned among the litigants is fromQuintus’s directors and officers liability insurance policies.  Thesettlement class, however, is receiving the “lion’s share” of theinsurance coverage.  Doc #276 at ¶46.  Weighing the risks and costsof further litigation, the court concludes that this settlement isadvisable.\nThe settlement amount, $10.1 million, closely resembles\nthe $9,996,000 settlement predicted by the Haas Study\n referenced by\nthis court in its previous order.  Quintus , 148 F Supp 2d at 985.

MukeshBajaj, Sumon C Mazumdar & Atuya Sarin, Securities Class Action\nSettlements , 43 Santa Clara L Rev 101, 116 tbl 11 (2003). \nAchieving the average settlement/PIL ratio despite having tocompete with Quintus’s bankruptcy estate for remaining resourcesindicates the fairness of this settlement to class members.\nFollowing the hearing, plaintiffs’ counsel expressed\nconcern that courts’ use of studies to predict recovery at theoutset of litigation may tend to cap recovery at that level.  Whilethe court does not discount that concern, it warrants mention thatthe Haas study data reflect a range of litigation results.  Anyindividual case may differ and differ significantly from theaverage or median results.  In any event, the obstacles to agreater recovery in this case were substantial.  Given thosedifficulties, a recovery within the average range may wellrepresent an achievement that is greater than average.  \nFinally, the absence of any objections or requests for\nexclusion among a class of this size demonstrates the overallreasonableness of this settlement.  \nThe risk and cost of further litigation, the settlement\namount and the silence of class members provide powerful evidencethat the settlement is fair, reasonable and adequate.  Accordingly,plaintiffs’ motion for final approval of the class actionsettlement is GRANTED.////Case 3:00-cv-04274-VRW   Document 18   Filed 12/05/06   Page 6 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n7III\nPlaintiffs also seek final approval of the plan of\nallocation of the settlement fund.  Doc #274.  The plan ofallocation operates as follows: \nTo the extent there are sufficient funds in the Net\nSettlement Fund, each Authorized Claimant will receive anamount equal to the Authorized Claimant’s claim.  If,however, the amount in the Net Settlement Fund is notsufficient to permit payment of the total claim of eachAuthorized Claimant, then each Authorized Claimant shallbe paid the percentage that each Authorized Claimant’sclaim bears to the total of the claims of all AuthorizedClaimants.  A claim will be computed as follows: theclaim shall be equal to the amount paid for shares ofQuintus common stock purchased or acquired by SettlementClass members during the Settlement Class Period, less:(a) the amount realized from the sale of any such sharesduring the Settlement Class Period or through February22, 2001, or $0.14 per share, whichever is greater; or(b) the number of any such shares held at the close ofbusiness on February 22, 2001, multiplied by $0.14 (theclosing price of Quintus stock on February 22, 2001).\nDoc #277 Ex A at 10.  The plan of allocation was fully described innotice letters to potential class members and no objections weresubmitted to the court or raised at the hearing.\nThe court has discretion to approve a plan of allocation\nthat is fair and reasonable.  In re Heritage Bond Litigation\n, 2005\nUS Dist LEXIS 13555 at *38 (CD Cal 2005).  “A plan of allocationthat reimburses class members based on the extent of their injuriesis generally reasonable.”  Id (quoting In re Oracle Securities\nLitigation , 1994 US Dist LEXIS 21593 at *1 (ND Cal 1994)).  Because this plan provides proportional reimbursement and\nno class member objected, the court concludes the plan ofallocation is fair and reasonable.  Accordingly, the motion forfinal approval of the plan of allocation is GRANTED.Case 3:00-cv-04274-VRW   Document 18   Filed 12/05/06   Page 7 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n8IV\nLead plaintiff and his counsel seek an award of attorney\nfees and expenses totaling $1,141,978.40.  Doc #275 at 16.  Thisamount includes attorney fees of $817,500, expenses of $150,000,reimbursement of fees and expenses of bankruptcy counsel of$162,478.40 and reimbursement of $12,000 to the lead plaintiff. Id.  The fees and expenses sought amount to 11.3% of the totalsettlement amount.\nThe court preliminarily approved an award of attorney\nfees and expenses in its July 7, 2006, order.  Doc #269 at 21. This request differs by including $15,096.40 of additional fees andexpenses of bankruptcy counsel and $12,000 in reimbursement to leadplaintiff.  The court anticipated such an increase in the amountsought for bankruptcy counsel.  Id.  Lead plaintiff, however, seeksreimbursement for 80 hours of his time at a rate of $150/hour forthe first time.  Doc #276 Ex 5 at ¶¶2-3.  The court is authorizedto reimburse lead plaintiff for reasonable costs and expensesrelated to the representation of the class, including lost wages. 15 USC §78u-4(a)(4).  As a registered securities principal and theprincipal of RAMA Financial, lead plaintiff’s request forcompensation is reasonable.  Doc #276 Ex 5 at ¶3.\nThese minor increases in the amount requested do not\ndisturb the court’s prior conclusion that “the amount of attorneyfees (including those incurred by bankruptcy counsel) is relativelymodest in relation to the total class recovery.”  Doc #269 at 21. This court, however, “rejects reliance solely on a comparison ofthe percentage fee requested here with other percentage awards orwith a so-called benchmark percentage.”  In re HPL Technologies,Case 3:00-cv-04274-VRW   Document 18   Filed 12/05/06   Page 8 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n9Inc Sec Litig , 366 F Supp 2d 912, 914 (ND Cal 2005).  Instead, the\ncourt employs a lodestar cross-check to determine thereasonableness of the requested attorney fees.\n“Three figures are salient in a lodestar calculation: (1)\ncounsel’s reasonable hours, (2) counsel’s reasonable hourly rateand (3) a multiplier thought to compensate for various factors.” Id at 919.  In performing a cross-check, the court calculates theimplied multiplier to determine its reasonableness.  Lead counselhas spent more than 5,000 attorney hours in this matter, most ofthem by senior attorneys.  Doc #275 Ex 1.  Applying the Laffey\nmatrix hourly rates, as adjusted for Los Angeles and cost of livingincreases, lead counsel calculates its lodestar as $1,976,262.50. Id at 12 and Ex 1.  The requested attorney fees of $817,500, lessthan half the lodestar, provide an implied lodestar multiplier of0.414.  Id at 13.  This multiplier is indeed reasonable, indicatingclass members obtained a significant discount on market attorneyrates.  Notably, competitive selection of class counsel producedthis low loadstar ratio or negative multiplier.  Quintus\n, 148 F\nSupp 2d 967.  Despite any statutory limitation on use ofcompetitive selection, see In re Cavanaugh\n, 306 F3d 726 (9th Cir\n2002), this provides further evidence that courts may look to thecompetitive selection cases in determining a reasonable level offees and costs.  See In re Cabletron, Inc Securities Litigation\n,\n2006 US Dist LEXIS 75188 (D NH 2006).\nThe requested attorney fees and expenses are reasonable\ncompensation for the value provided to the class.  This is furtherevidenced by the lack of class member objections to thepreliminarily approved attorney fees and expenses included in theCase 3:00-cv-04274-VRW   Document 18   Filed 12/05/06   Page 9 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n10\nclass notice.\nAccordingly, the application for award of attorney fees\nand reimbursement of expenses is GRANTED.\nIT IS SO ORDERED.\n                                   \nVAUGHN R WALKERUnited States District Chief JudgeCase 3:00-cv-04274-VRW   Document 18   Filed 12/05/06   Page 10 of 10",

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: This case involves a securities fraud class action against Quintus Corporation, which provided eCustomer Relationship Management solutions. After an audit revealed financial misstatements, the company's stock plummeted, leading to its bankruptcy and subsequent class-action lawsuits by investors. The case was settled with a $10.1 million fund for affected shareholders, and the plan of allocation and attorney fees were approved by the court. Notably, Quintus initially focused on artificial intelligence software before transitioning to CRM solutions, but the fraud case itself does not hinge on AI technologies.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the proposed settlement for the securities fraud class action against Quintus Corporation is fair, reasonable, and adequate, and whether the plan of allocation and attorney fees and expenses should be approved.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court granted final approval of the proposed class action settlement, plan of allocation, and the application for attorney fees and reimbursement of expenses, finding them fair, reasonable, and adequate in light of the complex litigation and Quintus's bankruptcy.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine you bought a toy and the company said it was super cool and safe, but then it broke very easily and wasn't safe at all. A bunch of people who also got the toy got together to say, \"Hey, you tricked us!\" They all went to court, and eventually, the toy company said, \"Okay, we'll pay you some money to make up for it.\" The judge checked if what the company was offering was good enough and fair to everyone who got tricked. The judge decided it was fair and said, \"Yep, let's go with this plan to give back money to the people who bought the toy.\"",

During the class period, Quintusprovided “e-Customer Relationship Management” or “eCRM” solutions,primarily through its “eContact” software.  Quintus grew through aseries of acquisitions in 1997 through 1999.  \nAs part of an initial public offering completed November\n15, 1999, Quintus sold 5.175 million shares of Quintus common stockat $18/share.  Consistent with those heady times, the stock pricesoon reached $55/share. On February 28, 2000, Quintus announcedits intent to acquire Mustang.com, which developed corporate e-mailmanagement software.  Quintus filed a registration statement inconnection with the Mustang acquisition on March 28, 2000.\nOn November 15, 2000, its first anniversary as a publicly\ntraded company, Quintus announced that it was reviewing previouslyfiled financial statements.  The price of Quintus shares fell from$6.00/share to $2.97/share before trading was halted by NASDAQshortly after noon, representing a one-day (or less) price drop ofjust over 50%.  On November 22, 2000, Quintus announced the resultsof a financial audit, which revealed that Quintus had overstatedrevenue on several occasions.  The truth regarding Quintus’sfinancial condition continued to emerge over the next few monthsand NASDAQ delisted Quintus stock on February 16, 2001.  After twodays of over-the-counter trading, the price of Quintus common stocksank to $0.14 on February 22, 2001, when Quintus filed for Chapter11 bankruptcy.\nA flurry of class actions alleging securities fraud wereCase 3:00-cv-04390-VRW   Document 13   Filed 12/05/06   Page 2 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n3filed in this court and ultimately consolidated.  Doc #71.  The\ncourt designated the law firm of Weiss & Yourman (now Weiss &Lurie) as lead counsel pursuant to a competitive selection process. See In re Quintus Sec Litig\n, 148 F Supp 2d 967 (ND Cal 2001). \nFollowing two rounds of motions to dismiss, the court designatedRoman Reznik as lead plaintiff.  Doc #201.  \nThe first amended consolidated class action complaint,\nDoc #215 (CAC), alleges that false and misleading statements ofmaterial fact appeared in the Quintus IPO registration statement,the Mustang registration statement and various periodic financialreports.  Accordingly, the CAC asserts claims under sections 11,12(a)(2) and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933 (the “1933 Act”) aswell as claims under sections 10(b), 14(a)(9) and 20(a) of theSecurities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “1934 Act”).  Id ¶¶291-357.\nThis litigation is only one current in Quintus’s wake. \nAs noted, Quintus initiated a Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceeding inthe United States District Court for the District of Delaware. Additionally, various shareholder actions were filed in Californiaand Texas state courts.  Thus, the proposed settlement presentlyunder consideration is part of a global settlement to beadministered by the Chapter 11 trustee.  \nOn July 7, 2006, the court preliminarily approved the\nproposed settlement and certified the class.  Doc #269.  The courtordered that notice of the pending settlement and final approvalhearing be mailed to potential class members on July 25, 2006.  Doc#273.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: This court case is a consolidated securities fraud class action involving Quintus Corporation, which provided e-Customer Relationship Management (eCRM) solutions. The plaintiffs alleged that Quintus made false and misleading statements about its financial condition during an initial public offering and a merger. The court granted final approval for a $10.1 million class action settlement and awarded attorney fees, concluding that the settlement was fair and reasonable given the circumstances, including Quintus's bankruptcy proceedings.\n   \n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the proposed class action settlement of $10.1 million was fair, reasonable, and adequate for the class members, and whether the request for attorney fees and reimbursement of expenses was justified.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court approved the class action settlement and the plan of allocation, stating that the settlement was fair, reasonable, and adequate. It also approved the attorney fees and reimbursement of expenses, emphasizing the low lodestar multiplier, which indicated reasonable attorney compensation.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine a company that sold really cool software went public, and people rushed to buy its stock. Later, it turned out the company had lied about how much money it was making. The stock price crashed, and everyone who invested was unhappy. They filed a lawsuit saying, \"You tricked us!\" After years of court battles, a settlement was reached where the company agreed to pay $10.1 million to the people who lost money. The judge looked at the deal and said, \"This seems like a fair way to help those investors get some of their money back,\" and gave a thumbs up. The lawyers who worked really hard on the case also got paid a reasonable fee from the settlement.",

During the class period, Quintusprovided “e-Customer Relationship Management” or “eCRM” solutions,primarily through its “eContact” software.  Quintus grew through aseries of acquisitions in 1997 through 1999.  \nAs part of an initial public offering completed November\n15, 1999, Quintus sold 5.175 million shares of Quintus common stockat $18/share.  Consistent with those heady times, the stock pricesoon reached $55/share. On February 28, 2000, Quintus announcedits intent to acquire Mustang.com, which developed corporate e-mailmanagement software.  Quintus filed a registration statement inconnection with the Mustang acquisition on March 28, 2000.\nOn November 15, 2000, its first anniversary as a publicly\ntraded company, Quintus announced that it was reviewing previouslyfiled financial statements.  The price of Quintus shares fell from$6.00/share to $2.97/share before trading was halted by NASDAQshortly after noon, representing a one-day (or less) price drop ofjust over 50%.  On November 22, 2000, Quintus announced the resultsof a financial audit, which revealed that Quintus had overstatedrevenue on several occasions.  The truth regarding Quintus’sfinancial condition continued to emerge over the next few monthsand NASDAQ delisted Quintus stock on February 16, 2001.

Doc #71.  The\ncourt designated the law firm of Weiss & Yourman (now Weiss &Lurie) as lead counsel pursuant to a competitive selection process. See In re Quintus Sec Litig\n, 148 F Supp 2d 967 (ND Cal 2001). \nFollowing two rounds of motions to dismiss, the court designatedRoman Reznik as lead plaintiff.  Doc #201.  \nThe first amended consolidated class action complaint,\nDoc #215 (CAC), alleges that false and misleading statements ofmaterial fact appeared in the Quintus IPO registration statement,the Mustang registration statement and various periodic financialreports.  Accordingly, the CAC asserts claims under sections 11,12(a)(2) and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933 (the “1933 Act”) aswell as claims under sections 10(b), 14(a)(9) and 20(a) of theSecurities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “1934 Act”).  Id ¶¶291-357.\nThis litigation is only one current in Quintus’s wake. \nAs noted, Quintus initiated a Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceeding inthe United States District Court for the District of Delaware. Additionally, various shareholder actions were filed in Californiaand Texas state courts.  Thus, the proposed settlement presentlyunder consideration is part of a global settlement to beadministered by the Chapter 11 trustee.  \nOn July 7, 2006, the court preliminarily approved the\nproposed settlement and certified the class.  Doc #269.  The courtordered that notice of the pending settlement and final approvalhearing be mailed to potential class members on July 25, 2006.  Doc#273.  Over 20,000 notice letters were mailed to potentialsettlement class members and shareholders of record.  Doc #277 at¶5.  Not a single class member objected to the settlement orCase 3:01-cv-00262-VRW   Document 17   Filed 12/05/06   Page 3 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n4requested exclusion from the class settlement in response to the\nnotice letter.  Id at ¶7-8.  Similarly, no objection was raised atthe final settlement approval hearing on December 5, 2006.\nII\nThe proposed settlement agreement provides that\ndefendants will pay $10.1 million in cash into a common fund to bedistributed to class members. \nThe question currently before the court is whether this\nsettlement should be approved.  “The court must approve anysettlement, voluntary dismissal, or compromise of the claims,issues, or defenses of a certified class.”  FRCP 23(e)(1)(A).  Thecourt bears in mind the Ninth Circuit’s “strong judicial policythat favors settlement, particularly where complex class actionlitigation is concerned.”  Class Plaintiffs v City of Seattle\n, 355\nF2d 1268, 1276 (9th Cir 1992).  While no class member has objected,the court must still review the proposed settlement.  Manual forComplex Litigation (Fourth) §21.635 (“Even if there are no or fewobjections or adverse appearances before or at the fairnesshearing, the judge must ensure that there is sufficient record asto the basis and justification for the settlement”).\nThe court may approve a settlement “only after a hearing\nand on finding that the settlement * * * is fair, reasonable andadequate.”  FRCP 23(e)(1)(C).  A final approval hearing was held onDecember 5, 2006.  The Ninth Circuit has set forth the followingfactors for courts considering approval of class actionsettlements: Case 3:01-cv-00262-VRW   Document 17   Filed 12/05/06   Page 4 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n5(1) the strength of the plaintiffs’ case; (2) the risk,\nexpense, complexity, and likely duration of furtherlitigation; (3) the risk of maintaining class actionstatus throughout the trial; (4) the amount offered insettlement; (5) the extent of discovery completed and thestate of the proceedings; (6) the experience and views ofcounsel; (7) the presence of a governmental participant;and (8) the reaction of the class members to the proposedsettlement. \nChurchill Village v General Electric\n, 361 F3d 566, 575 (9th Cir\n2004).  These factors overwhelmingly support approval of the classsettlement.  The court discusses the settlement evaluation factorsthat are relevant in this case.  Id at 576 n7.\nThis settlement follows six years of protracted\nlitigation, discovery and negotiation.  Further litigation wouldrequire plaintiffs to survive motions for summary judgment and, ifsuccessful, present their case to a jury.  The considerable riskand cost associated with further litigation is enhanced byQuintus’s pending bankruptcy litigation.  This court noted early inthese proceedings that “plaintiffs are going to have troublefinding deep pockets in this case.”  Doc #85 at 37.  This globalsettlement divides the limited resources of a bankrupt corporationamong the many litigants suing Quintus.  Doc #276 at ¶ 6.  Much ofthe remaining value to be apportioned among the litigants is fromQuintus’s directors and officers liability insurance policies.  Thesettlement class, however, is receiving the “lion’s share” of theinsurance coverage.  Doc #276 at ¶46.  Weighing the risks and costsof further litigation, the court concludes that this settlement isadvisable.\nThe settlement amount, $10.1 million, closely resembles\nthe $9,996,000 settlement predicted by the Haas Study\n referenced by\nthis court in its previous order.  Quintus , 148 F Supp 2d at 985. Case 3:01-cv-00262-VRW   Document 17   Filed 12/05/06   Page 5 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n6This proposed settlement’s settlement/potential investor loss (PIL)\nratio of 16.83% marginally exceeds the average class actionsecurities litigation settlement/PIL ratio of 16.66%.  MukeshBajaj, Sumon C Mazumdar & Atuya Sarin, Securities Class Action\nSettlements , 43 Santa Clara L Rev 101, 116 tbl 11 (2003). \nAchieving the average settlement/PIL ratio despite having tocompete with Quintus’s bankruptcy estate for remaining resourcesindicates the fairness of this settlement to class members.\nFollowing the hearing, plaintiffs’ counsel expressed\nconcern that courts’ use of studies to predict recovery at theoutset of litigation may tend to cap recovery at that level.  Whilethe court does not discount that concern, it warrants mention thatthe Haas study data reflect a range of litigation results.  Anyindividual case may differ and differ significantly from theaverage or median results.  In any event, the obstacles to agreater recovery in this case were substantial.  Given thosedifficulties, a recovery within the average range may wellrepresent an achievement that is greater than average.  \nFinally, the absence of any objections or requests for\nexclusion among a class of this size demonstrates the overallreasonableness of this settlement.  \nThe risk and cost of further litigation, the settlement\namount and the silence of class members provide powerful evidencethat the settlement is fair, reasonable and adequate.  Accordingly,plaintiffs’ motion for final approval of the class actionsettlement is GRANTED.////Case 3:01-cv-00262-VRW   Document 17   Filed 12/05/06   Page 6 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n7III\nPlaintiffs also seek final approval of the plan of\nallocation of the settlement fund.  Doc #274.  The plan ofallocation operates as follows: \nTo the extent there are sufficient funds in the Net\nSettlement Fund, each Authorized Claimant will receive anamount equal to the Authorized Claimant’s claim.  If,however, the amount in the Net Settlement Fund is notsufficient to permit payment of the total claim of eachAuthorized Claimant, then each Authorized Claimant shallbe paid the percentage that each Authorized Claimant’sclaim bears to the total of the claims of all AuthorizedClaimants.  A claim will be computed as follows: theclaim shall be equal to the amount paid for shares ofQuintus common stock purchased or acquired by SettlementClass members during the Settlement Class Period, less:(a) the amount realized from the sale of any such sharesduring the Settlement Class Period or through February22, 2001, or $0.14 per share, whichever is greater; or(b) the number of any such shares held at the close ofbusiness on February 22, 2001, multiplied by $0.14 (theclosing price of Quintus stock on February 22, 2001).\nDoc #277 Ex A at 10.  The plan of allocation was fully described innotice letters to potential class members and no objections weresubmitted to the court or raised at the hearing.\nThe court has discretion to approve a plan of allocation\nthat is fair and reasonable.  In re Heritage Bond Litigation\n, 2005\nUS Dist LEXIS 13555 at *38 (CD Cal 2005).  “A plan of allocationthat reimburses class members based on the extent of their injuriesis generally reasonable.”  Id (quoting In re Oracle Securities\nLitigation , 1994 US Dist LEXIS 21593 at *1 (ND Cal 1994)).  Because this plan provides proportional reimbursement and\nno class member objected, the court concludes the plan ofallocation is fair and reasonable.  Accordingly, the motion forfinal approval of the plan of allocation is GRANTED.Case 3:01-cv-00262-VRW   Document 17   Filed 12/05/06   Page 7 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n8IV\nLead plaintiff and his counsel seek an award of attorney\nfees and expenses totaling $1,141,978.40.  Doc #275 at 16.  Thisamount includes attorney fees of $817,500, expenses of $150,000,reimbursement of fees and expenses of bankruptcy counsel of$162,478.40 and reimbursement of $12,000 to the lead plaintiff. Id.  The fees and expenses sought amount to 11.3% of the totalsettlement amount.\nThe court preliminarily approved an award of attorney\nfees and expenses in its July 7, 2006, order.  Doc #269 at 21. This request differs by including $15,096.40 of additional fees andexpenses of bankruptcy counsel and $12,000 in reimbursement to leadplaintiff.  The court anticipated such an increase in the amountsought for bankruptcy counsel.  Id.  Lead plaintiff, however, seeksreimbursement for 80 hours of his time at a rate of $150/hour forthe first time.  Doc #276 Ex 5 at ¶¶2-3.  The court is authorizedto reimburse lead plaintiff for reasonable costs and expensesrelated to the representation of the class, including lost wages. 15 USC §78u-4(a)(4).  As a registered securities principal and theprincipal of RAMA Financial, lead plaintiff’s request forcompensation is reasonable.  Doc #276 Ex 5 at ¶3.\nThese minor increases in the amount requested do not\ndisturb the court’s prior conclusion that “the amount of attorneyfees (including those incurred by bankruptcy counsel) is relativelymodest in relation to the total class recovery.”  Doc #269 at 21. This court, however, “rejects reliance solely on a comparison ofthe percentage fee requested here with other percentage awards orwith a so-called benchmark percentage.”  In re HPL Technologies,Case 3:01-cv-00262-VRW   Document 17   Filed 12/05/06   Page 8 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n9Inc Sec Litig , 366 F Supp 2d 912, 914 (ND Cal 2005).

Doc #201.  \nThe first amended consolidated class action complaint,\nDoc #215 (CAC), alleges that false and misleading statements ofmaterial fact appeared in the Quintus IPO registration statement,the Mustang registration statement and various periodic financialreports.  Accordingly, the CAC asserts claims under sections 11,12(a)(2) and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933 (the “1933 Act”) aswell as claims under sections 10(b), 14(a)(9) and 20(a) of theSecurities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “1934 Act”).

Similarly, no objection was raised atthe final settlement approval hearing on December 5, 2006.\nII\nThe proposed settlement agreement provides that\ndefendants will pay $10.1 million in cash into a common fund to bedistributed to class members. \nThe question currently before the court is whether this\nsettlement should be approved.  “The court must approve anysettlement, voluntary dismissal, or compromise of the claims,issues, or defenses of a certified class.”  FRCP 23(e)(1)(A).  Thecourt bears in mind the Ninth Circuit’s “strong judicial policythat favors settlement, particularly where complex class actionlitigation is concerned.”  Class Plaintiffs v City of Seattle\n, 355\nF2d 1268, 1276 (9th Cir 1992).  While no class member has objected,the court must still review the proposed settlement.  Manual forComplex Litigation (Fourth) §21.635 (“Even if there are no or fewobjections or adverse appearances before or at the fairnesshearing, the judge must ensure that there is sufficient record asto the basis and justification for the settlement”).\nThe court may approve a settlement “only after a hearing\nand on finding that the settlement * * * is fair, reasonable andadequate.”  FRCP 23(e)(1)(C).  A final approval hearing was held onDecember 5, 2006.  The Ninth Circuit has set forth the followingfactors for courts considering approval of class actionsettlements: Case 3:00-cv-04343-VRW   Document 13   Filed 12/05/06   Page 4 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n5(1) the strength of the plaintiffs’ case; (2) the risk,\nexpense, complexity, and likely duration of furtherlitigation; (3) the risk of maintaining class actionstatus throughout the trial; (4) the amount offered insettlement; (5) the extent of discovery completed and thestate of the proceedings; (6) the experience and views ofcounsel; (7) the presence of a governmental participant;and (8) the reaction of the class members to the proposedsettlement. \nChurchill Village v General Electric\n, 361 F3d 566, 575 (9th Cir\n2004).  These factors overwhelmingly support approval of the classsettlement.  The court discusses the settlement evaluation factorsthat are relevant in this case.  Id at 576 n7.\nThis settlement follows six years of protracted\nlitigation, discovery and negotiation.  Further litigation wouldrequire plaintiffs to survive motions for summary judgment and, ifsuccessful, present their case to a jury.  The considerable riskand cost associated with further litigation is enhanced byQuintus’s pending bankruptcy litigation.  This court noted early inthese proceedings that “plaintiffs are going to have troublefinding deep pockets in this case.”  Doc #85 at 37.  This globalsettlement divides the limited resources of a bankrupt corporationamong the many litigants suing Quintus.  Doc #276 at ¶ 6.  Much ofthe remaining value to be apportioned among the litigants is fromQuintus’s directors and officers liability insurance policies.  Thesettlement class, however, is receiving the “lion’s share” of theinsurance coverage.  Doc #276 at ¶46.  Weighing the risks and costsof further litigation, the court concludes that this settlement isadvisable.\nThe settlement amount, $10.1 million, closely resembles\nthe $9,996,000 settlement predicted by the Haas Study\n referenced by\nthis court in its previous order.  Quintus , 148 F Supp 2d at 985.

MukeshBajaj, Sumon C Mazumdar & Atuya Sarin, Securities Class Action\nSettlements , 43 Santa Clara L Rev 101, 116 tbl 11 (2003). \nAchieving the average settlement/PIL ratio despite having tocompete with Quintus’s bankruptcy estate for remaining resourcesindicates the fairness of this settlement to class members.\nFollowing the hearing, plaintiffs’ counsel expressed\nconcern that courts’ use of studies to predict recovery at theoutset of litigation may tend to cap recovery at that level.  Whilethe court does not discount that concern, it warrants mention thatthe Haas study data reflect a range of litigation results.  Anyindividual case may differ and differ significantly from theaverage or median results.  In any event, the obstacles to agreater recovery in this case were substantial.  Given thosedifficulties, a recovery within the average range may wellrepresent an achievement that is greater than average.  \nFinally, the absence of any objections or requests for\nexclusion among a class of this size demonstrates the overallreasonableness of this settlement.  \nThe risk and cost of further litigation, the settlement\namount and the silence of class members provide powerful evidencethat the settlement is fair, reasonable and adequate.  Accordingly,plaintiffs’ motion for final approval of the class actionsettlement is GRANTED.////Case 3:00-cv-04343-VRW   Document 13   Filed 12/05/06   Page 6 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n7III\nPlaintiffs also seek final approval of the plan of\nallocation of the settlement fund.  Doc #274.  The plan ofallocation operates as follows: \nTo the extent there are sufficient funds in the Net\nSettlement Fund, each Authorized Claimant will receive anamount equal to the Authorized Claimant’s claim.  If,however, the amount in the Net Settlement Fund is notsufficient to permit payment of the total claim of eachAuthorized Claimant, then each Authorized Claimant shallbe paid the percentage that each Authorized Claimant’sclaim bears to the total of the claims of all AuthorizedClaimants.  A claim will be computed as follows: theclaim shall be equal to the amount paid for shares ofQuintus common stock purchased or acquired by SettlementClass members during the Settlement Class Period, less:(a) the amount realized from the sale of any such sharesduring the Settlement Class Period or through February22, 2001, or $0.14 per share, whichever is greater; or(b) the number of any such shares held at the close ofbusiness on February 22, 2001, multiplied by $0.14 (theclosing price of Quintus stock on February 22, 2001).\nDoc #277 Ex A at 10.  The plan of allocation was fully described innotice letters to potential class members and no objections weresubmitted to the court or raised at the hearing.\nThe court has discretion to approve a plan of allocation\nthat is fair and reasonable.  In re Heritage Bond Litigation\n, 2005\nUS Dist LEXIS 13555 at *38 (CD Cal 2005).  “A plan of allocationthat reimburses class members based on the extent of their injuriesis generally reasonable.”  Id (quoting In re Oracle Securities\nLitigation , 1994 US Dist LEXIS 21593 at *1 (ND Cal 1994)).  Because this plan provides proportional reimbursement and\nno class member objected, the court concludes the plan ofallocation is fair and reasonable.  Accordingly, the motion forfinal approval of the plan of allocation is GRANTED.Case 3:00-cv-04343-VRW   Document 13   Filed 12/05/06   Page 7 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n8IV\nLead plaintiff and his counsel seek an award of attorney\nfees and expenses totaling $1,141,978.40.  Doc #275 at 16.  Thisamount includes attorney fees of $817,500, expenses of $150,000,reimbursement of fees and expenses of bankruptcy counsel of$162,478.40 and reimbursement of $12,000 to the lead plaintiff. Id.  The fees and expenses sought amount to 11.3% of the totalsettlement amount.\nThe court preliminarily approved an award of attorney\nfees and expenses in its July 7, 2006, order.  Doc #269 at 21. This request differs by including $15,096.40 of additional fees andexpenses of bankruptcy counsel and $12,000 in reimbursement to leadplaintiff.  The court anticipated such an increase in the amountsought for bankruptcy counsel.  Id.  Lead plaintiff, however, seeksreimbursement for 80 hours of his time at a rate of $150/hour forthe first time.  Doc #276 Ex 5 at ¶¶2-3.  The court is authorizedto reimburse lead plaintiff for reasonable costs and expensesrelated to the representation of the class, including lost wages. 15 USC §78u-4(a)(4).  As a registered securities principal and theprincipal of RAMA Financial, lead plaintiff’s request forcompensation is reasonable.  Doc #276 Ex 5 at ¶3.\nThese minor increases in the amount requested do not\ndisturb the court’s prior conclusion that “the amount of attorneyfees (including those incurred by bankruptcy counsel) is relativelymodest in relation to the total class recovery.”  Doc #269 at 21. This court, however, “rejects reliance solely on a comparison ofthe percentage fee requested here with other percentage awards orwith a so-called benchmark percentage.”  In re HPL Technologies,Case 3:00-cv-04343-VRW   Document 13   Filed 12/05/06   Page 8 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n9Inc Sec Litig , 366 F Supp 2d 912, 914 (ND Cal 2005).  Instead, the\ncourt employs a lodestar cross-check to determine thereasonableness of the requested attorney fees.\n“Three figures are salient in a lodestar calculation: (1)\ncounsel’s reasonable hours, (2) counsel’s reasonable hourly rateand (3) a multiplier thought to compensate for various factors.” Id at 919.  In performing a cross-check, the court calculates theimplied multiplier to determine its reasonableness.  Lead counselhas spent more than 5,000 attorney hours in this matter, most ofthem by senior attorneys.  Doc #275 Ex 1.  Applying the Laffey\nmatrix hourly rates, as adjusted for Los Angeles and cost of livingincreases, lead counsel calculates its lodestar as $1,976,262.50. Id at 12 and Ex 1.  The requested attorney fees of $817,500, lessthan half the lodestar, provide an implied lodestar multiplier of0.414.  Id at 13.  This multiplier is indeed reasonable, indicatingclass members obtained a significant discount on market attorneyrates.  Notably, competitive selection of class counsel producedthis low loadstar ratio or negative multiplier.  Quintus\n, 148 F\nSupp 2d 967.  Despite any statutory limitation on use ofcompetitive selection, see In re Cavanaugh\n, 306 F3d 726 (9th Cir\n2002), this provides further evidence that courts may look to thecompetitive selection cases in determining a reasonable level offees and costs.  See In re Cabletron, Inc Securities Litigation\n,\n2006 US Dist LEXIS 75188 (D NH 2006).\nThe requested attorney fees and expenses are reasonable\ncompensation for the value provided to the class.  This is furtherevidenced by the lack of class member objections to thepreliminarily approved attorney fees and expenses included in theCase 3:00-cv-04343-VRW   Document 13   Filed 12/05/06   Page 9 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n10\nclass notice.\nAccordingly, the application for award of attorney fees\nand reimbursement of expenses is GRANTED.\nIT IS SO ORDERED.\n                                   \nVAUGHN R WALKERUnited States District Chief JudgeCase 3:00-cv-04343-VRW   Document 13   Filed 12/05/06   Page 10 of 10",

    "summary": "1. **Summary:**\n   The case involves a securities fraud class action against Quintus Corporation, which inflated its revenues in financial statements. After declaring bankruptcy, Quintus faced numerous lawsuits which were consolidated into a class action. A settlement agreement involved Quintus paying $10.1 million to affected shareholders, and the court approved this settlement along with the allocation plan and attorney fees. The case highlights that Quintus was initially involved in artificial intelligence software focusing on \"e-Customer Relationship Management\" solutions during the relevant class period.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue:**\n   Whether the proposed class action settlement, including the allocation plan and attorney fees, is fair, reasonable, and adequate under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(e).\n\n3. **Court's Holding:**\n   The court granted final approval of the class action settlement, deciding that the settlement amount of $10.1 million, the allocation plan, and the requested attorney fees and expenses were fair, reasonable, and adequate. The settlement was deemed beneficial due to the risks, costs, and complexities of further litigation in light of Quintus's bankruptcy status.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation:**\n   Imagine a company that makes software to help businesses manage customer relationships. The company told everyone they were making a lot of money, so people bought lots of their stock. But later, it turned out they were not making as much money as they claimed. Their stock price crashed, and they went bankrupt. Lots of folks who bought the stock were upset and said the company tricked them. They all got together and filed a big lawsuit to get their money back. The company agreed to pay $10.1 million to settle the fight. The court liked this plan and agreed with the lawyers, who worked hard on the case, to get paid for their efforts.",

A claim will be computed as follows: theclaim shall be equal to the amount paid for shares ofQuintus common stock purchased or acquired by SettlementClass members during the Settlement Class Period, less:(a) the amount realized from the sale of any such sharesduring the Settlement Class Period or through February22, 2001, or $0.14 per share, whichever is greater; or(b) the number of any such shares held at the close ofbusiness on February 22, 2001, multiplied by $0.14 (theclosing price of Quintus stock on February 22, 2001).\nDoc #277 Ex A at 10.

Lead plaintiff, however, seeksreimbursement for 80 hours of his time at a rate of $150/hour forthe first time.  Doc #276 Ex 5 at ¶¶2-3.  The court is authorizedto reimburse lead plaintiff for reasonable costs and expensesrelated to the representation of the class, including lost wages. 15 USC §78u-4(a)(4).  As a registered securities principal and theprincipal of RAMA Financial, lead plaintiff’s request forcompensation is reasonable.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: This case is a consolidated securities fraud class action concerning Quintus Corporation, which went bankrupt after being publicly traded for one year. The plaintiffs alleged that Quintus overstated its financial condition in various statements and reports, leading to financial losses when the true conditions emerged. The court approved a $10.1 million settlement as well as reimbursement for attorney fees and expenses, noting the settlement's fairness given Quintus's limited resources due to bankruptcy.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the proposed settlement of the securities fraud class action is fair, reasonable, and adequate for the class members who purchased Quintus stock.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court granted final approval of the class action settlement and the plan of allocation, finding that the settlement was fair, reasonable, and adequate. It also approved the requested attorney fees and expenses.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine you bought stock in a company that said it was making lots of money, but later you find out they weren't telling the truth and the company went bankrupt. A lot of people who bought stock with you got together to sue the company for misleading them. They agreed on a way to settle and get some money back, even if it wasn't all the money they lost. The judge checked the deal to make sure it was fair and decided that it was a good way to handle the situation, allowing the settlement to go through and approving the lawyers' payment.",

For the reasons discussed below, finalapproval of the class settlement and plan of allocation is GRANTEDand the application for award of attorney fees and reimbursement ofexpenses is GRANTED.Case 3:01-cv-00093-VRW   Document 9   Filed 12/05/06   Page 1 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n2I\nWhen Quintus was incorporated in 1984, its business was\nartificial intelligence software.  During the class period, Quintusprovided “e-Customer Relationship Management” or “eCRM” solutions,primarily through its “eContact” software.  Quintus grew through aseries of acquisitions in 1997 through 1999.  \nAs part of an initial public offering completed November\n15, 1999, Quintus sold 5.175 million shares of Quintus common stockat $18/share.  Consistent with those heady times, the stock pricesoon reached $55/share. On February 28, 2000, Quintus announcedits intent to acquire Mustang.com, which developed corporate e-mailmanagement software.  Quintus filed a registration statement inconnection with the Mustang acquisition on March 28, 2000.\nOn November 15, 2000, its first anniversary as a publicly\ntraded company, Quintus announced that it was reviewing previouslyfiled financial statements.  The price of Quintus shares fell from$6.00/share to $2.97/share before trading was halted by NASDAQshortly after noon, representing a one-day (or less) price drop ofjust over 50%.  On November 22, 2000, Quintus announced the resultsof a financial audit, which revealed that Quintus had overstatedrevenue on several occasions.  The truth regarding Quintus’sfinancial condition continued to emerge over the next few monthsand NASDAQ delisted Quintus stock on February 16, 2001.  After twodays of over-the-counter trading, the price of Quintus common stocksank to $0.14 on February 22, 2001, when Quintus filed for Chapter11 bankruptcy.\nA flurry of class actions alleging securities fraud wereCase 3:01-cv-00093-VRW   Document 9   Filed 12/05/06   Page 2 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n3filed in this court and ultimately consolidated.  Doc #71.  The\ncourt designated the law firm of Weiss & Yourman (now Weiss &Lurie) as lead counsel pursuant to a competitive selection process. See In re Quintus Sec Litig\n, 148 F Supp 2d 967 (ND Cal 2001). \nFollowing two rounds of motions to dismiss, the court designatedRoman Reznik as lead plaintiff.  Doc #201.  \nThe first amended consolidated class action complaint,\nDoc #215 (CAC), alleges that false and misleading statements ofmaterial fact appeared in the Quintus IPO registration statement,the Mustang registration statement and various periodic financialreports.  Accordingly, the CAC asserts claims under sections 11,12(a)(2) and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933 (the “1933 Act”) aswell as claims under sections 10(b), 14(a)(9) and 20(a) of theSecurities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “1934 Act”).  Id ¶¶291-357.\nThis litigation is only one current in Quintus’s wake. \nAs noted, Quintus initiated a Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceeding inthe United States District Court for the District of Delaware. Additionally, various shareholder actions were filed in Californiaand Texas state courts.  Thus, the proposed settlement presentlyunder consideration is part of a global settlement to beadministered by the Chapter 11 trustee.  \nOn July 7, 2006, the court preliminarily approved the\nproposed settlement and certified the class.  Doc #269.  The courtordered that notice of the pending settlement and final approvalhearing be mailed to potential class members on July 25, 2006.  Doc#273.  Over 20,000 notice letters were mailed to potentialsettlement class members and shareholders of record.  Doc #277 at¶5.  Not a single class member objected to the settlement orCase 3:01-cv-00093-VRW   Document 9   Filed 12/05/06   Page 3 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n4requested exclusion from the class settlement in response to the\nnotice letter.  Id at ¶7-8.  Similarly, no objection was raised atthe final settlement approval hearing on December 5, 2006.\nII\nThe proposed settlement agreement provides that\ndefendants will pay $10.1 million in cash into a common fund to bedistributed to class members. \nThe question currently before the court is whether this\nsettlement should be approved.  “The court must approve anysettlement, voluntary dismissal, or compromise of the claims,issues, or defenses of a certified class.”  FRCP 23(e)(1)(A).  Thecourt bears in mind the Ninth Circuit’s “strong judicial policythat favors settlement, particularly where complex class actionlitigation is concerned.”  Class Plaintiffs v City of Seattle\n, 355\nF2d 1268, 1276 (9th Cir 1992).  While no class member has objected,the court must still review the proposed settlement.  Manual forComplex Litigation (Fourth) §21.635 (“Even if there are no or fewobjections or adverse appearances before or at the fairnesshearing, the judge must ensure that there is sufficient record asto the basis and justification for the settlement”).\nThe court may approve a settlement “only after a hearing\nand on finding that the settlement * * * is fair, reasonable andadequate.”  FRCP 23(e)(1)(C).  A final approval hearing was held onDecember 5, 2006.  The Ninth Circuit has set forth the followingfactors for courts considering approval of class actionsettlements: Case 3:01-cv-00093-VRW   Document 9   Filed 12/05/06   Page 4 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n5(1) the strength of the plaintiffs’ case; (2) the risk,\nexpense, complexity, and likely duration of furtherlitigation; (3) the risk of maintaining class actionstatus throughout the trial; (4) the amount offered insettlement; (5) the extent of discovery completed and thestate of the proceedings; (6) the experience and views ofcounsel; (7) the presence of a governmental participant;and (8) the reaction of the class members to the proposedsettlement. \nChurchill Village v General Electric\n, 361 F3d 566, 575 (9th Cir\n2004).  These factors overwhelmingly support approval of the classsettlement.  The court discusses the settlement evaluation factorsthat are relevant in this case.  Id at 576 n7.\nThis settlement follows six years of protracted\nlitigation, discovery and negotiation.  Further litigation wouldrequire plaintiffs to survive motions for summary judgment and, ifsuccessful, present their case to a jury.  The considerable riskand cost associated with further litigation is enhanced byQuintus’s pending bankruptcy litigation.  This court noted early inthese proceedings that “plaintiffs are going to have troublefinding deep pockets in this case.”  Doc #85 at 37.  This globalsettlement divides the limited resources of a bankrupt corporationamong the many litigants suing Quintus.  Doc #276 at ¶ 6.  Much ofthe remaining value to be apportioned among the litigants is fromQuintus’s directors and officers liability insurance policies.  Thesettlement class, however, is receiving the “lion’s share” of theinsurance coverage.  Doc #276 at ¶46.  Weighing the risks and costsof further litigation, the court concludes that this settlement isadvisable.\nThe settlement amount, $10.1 million, closely resembles\nthe $9,996,000 settlement predicted by the Haas Study\n referenced by\nthis court in its previous order.  Quintus , 148 F Supp 2d at 985. Case 3:01-cv-00093-VRW   Document 9   Filed 12/05/06   Page 5 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n6This proposed settlement’s settlement/potential investor loss (PIL)\nratio of 16.83% marginally exceeds the average class actionsecurities litigation settlement/PIL ratio of 16.66%.  MukeshBajaj, Sumon C Mazumdar & Atuya Sarin, Securities Class Action\nSettlements , 43 Santa Clara L Rev 101, 116 tbl 11 (2003). \nAchieving the average settlement/PIL ratio despite having tocompete with Quintus’s bankruptcy estate for remaining resourcesindicates the fairness of this settlement to class members.\nFollowing the hearing, plaintiffs’ counsel expressed\nconcern that courts’ use of studies to predict recovery at theoutset of litigation may tend to cap recovery at that level.  Whilethe court does not discount that concern, it warrants mention thatthe Haas study data reflect a range of litigation results.  Anyindividual case may differ and differ significantly from theaverage or median results.  In any event, the obstacles to agreater recovery in this case were substantial.  Given thosedifficulties, a recovery within the average range may wellrepresent an achievement that is greater than average.  \nFinally, the absence of any objections or requests for\nexclusion among a class of this size demonstrates the overallreasonableness of this settlement.  \nThe risk and cost of further litigation, the settlement\namount and the silence of class members provide powerful evidencethat the settlement is fair, reasonable and adequate.  Accordingly,plaintiffs’ motion for final approval of the class actionsettlement is GRANTED.////Case 3:01-cv-00093-VRW   Document 9   Filed 12/05/06   Page 6 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n7III\nPlaintiffs also seek final approval of the plan of\nallocation of the settlement fund.  Doc #274.  The plan ofallocation operates as follows: \nTo the extent there are sufficient funds in the Net\nSettlement Fund, each Authorized Claimant will receive anamount equal to the Authorized Claimant’s claim.  If,however, the amount in the Net Settlement Fund is notsufficient to permit payment of the total claim of eachAuthorized Claimant, then each Authorized Claimant shallbe paid the percentage that each Authorized Claimant’sclaim bears to the total of the claims of all AuthorizedClaimants.  A claim will be computed as follows: theclaim shall be equal to the amount paid for shares ofQuintus common stock purchased or acquired by SettlementClass members during the Settlement Class Period, less:(a) the amount realized from the sale of any such sharesduring the Settlement Class Period or through February22, 2001, or $0.14 per share, whichever is greater; or(b) the number of any such shares held at the close ofbusiness on February 22, 2001, multiplied by $0.14 (theclosing price of Quintus stock on February 22, 2001).\nDoc #277 Ex A at 10.  The plan of allocation was fully described innotice letters to potential class members and no objections weresubmitted to the court or raised at the hearing.\nThe court has discretion to approve a plan of allocation\nthat is fair and reasonable.  In re Heritage Bond Litigation\n, 2005\nUS Dist LEXIS 13555 at *38 (CD Cal 2005).  “A plan of allocationthat reimburses class members based on the extent of their injuriesis generally reasonable.”  Id (quoting In re Oracle Securities\nLitigation , 1994 US Dist LEXIS 21593 at *1 (ND Cal 1994)).  Because this plan provides proportional reimbursement and\nno class member objected, the court concludes the plan ofallocation is fair and reasonable.  Accordingly, the motion forfinal approval of the plan of allocation is GRANTED.Case 3:01-cv-00093-VRW   Document 9   Filed 12/05/06   Page 7 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n8IV\nLead plaintiff and his counsel seek an award of attorney\nfees and expenses totaling $1,141,978.40.

The court is authorizedto reimburse lead plaintiff for reasonable costs and expensesrelated to the representation of the class, including lost wages. 15 USC §78u-4(a)(4).

Doc #201.  \nThe first amended consolidated class action complaint,\nDoc #215 (CAC), alleges that false and misleading statements ofmaterial fact appeared in the Quintus IPO registration statement,the Mustang registration statement and various periodic financialreports.

Thecourt bears in mind the Ninth Circuit’s “strong judicial policythat favors settlement, particularly where complex class actionlitigation is concerned.”  Class Plaintiffs v City of Seattle\n, 355\nF2d 1268, 1276 (9th Cir 1992).  While no class member has objected,the court must still review the proposed settlement.  Manual forComplex Litigation (Fourth) §21.635 (“Even if there are no or fewobjections or adverse appearances before or at the fairnesshearing, the judge must ensure that there is sufficient record asto the basis and justification for the settlement”).\nThe court may approve a settlement “only after a hearing\nand on finding that the settlement * * * is fair, reasonable andadequate.”  FRCP 23(e)(1)(C).  A final approval hearing was held onDecember 5, 2006.  The Ninth Circuit has set forth the followingfactors for courts considering approval of class actionsettlements: Case 3:00-cv-04300-VRW   Document 14   Filed 12/05/06   Page 4 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n5(1) the strength of the plaintiffs’ case; (2) the risk,\nexpense, complexity, and likely duration of furtherlitigation; (3) the risk of maintaining class actionstatus throughout the trial; (4) the amount offered insettlement; (5) the extent of discovery completed and thestate of the proceedings; (6) the experience and views ofcounsel; (7) the presence of a governmental participant;and (8) the reaction of the class members to the proposedsettlement. \nChurchill Village v General Electric\n, 361 F3d 566, 575 (9th Cir\n2004).  These factors overwhelmingly support approval of the classsettlement.  The court discusses the settlement evaluation factorsthat are relevant in this case.  Id at 576 n7.\nThis settlement follows six years of protracted\nlitigation, discovery and negotiation.  Further litigation wouldrequire plaintiffs to survive motions for summary judgment and, ifsuccessful, present their case to a jury.  The considerable riskand cost associated with further litigation is enhanced byQuintus’s pending bankruptcy litigation.  This court noted early inthese proceedings that “plaintiffs are going to have troublefinding deep pockets in this case.”  Doc #85 at 37.  This globalsettlement divides the limited resources of a bankrupt corporationamong the many litigants suing Quintus.  Doc #276 at ¶ 6.  Much ofthe remaining value to be apportioned among the litigants is fromQuintus’s directors and officers liability insurance policies.  Thesettlement class, however, is receiving the “lion’s share” of theinsurance coverage.  Doc #276 at ¶46.  Weighing the risks and costsof further litigation, the court concludes that this settlement isadvisable.\nThe settlement amount, $10.1 million, closely resembles\nthe $9,996,000 settlement predicted by the Haas Study\n referenced by\nthis court in its previous order.  Quintus , 148 F Supp 2d at 985. Case 3:00-cv-04300-VRW   Document 14   Filed 12/05/06   Page 5 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n6This proposed settlement’s settlement/potential investor loss (PIL)\nratio of 16.83% marginally exceeds the average class actionsecurities litigation settlement/PIL ratio of 16.66%.  MukeshBajaj, Sumon C Mazumdar & Atuya Sarin, Securities Class Action\nSettlements , 43 Santa Clara L Rev 101, 116 tbl 11 (2003). \nAchieving the average settlement/PIL ratio despite having tocompete with Quintus’s bankruptcy estate for remaining resourcesindicates the fairness of this settlement to class members.\nFollowing the hearing, plaintiffs’ counsel expressed\nconcern that courts’ use of studies to predict recovery at theoutset of litigation may tend to cap recovery at that level.  Whilethe court does not discount that concern, it warrants mention thatthe Haas study data reflect a range of litigation results.  Anyindividual case may differ and differ significantly from theaverage or median results.  In any event, the obstacles to agreater recovery in this case were substantial.  Given thosedifficulties, a recovery within the average range may wellrepresent an achievement that is greater than average.  \nFinally, the absence of any objections or requests for\nexclusion among a class of this size demonstrates the overallreasonableness of this settlement.  \nThe risk and cost of further litigation, the settlement\namount and the silence of class members provide powerful evidencethat the settlement is fair, reasonable and adequate.  Accordingly,plaintiffs’ motion for final approval of the class actionsettlement is GRANTED.////Case 3:00-cv-04300-VRW   Document 14   Filed 12/05/06   Page 6 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n7III\nPlaintiffs also seek final approval of the plan of\nallocation of the settlement fund.  Doc #274.  The plan ofallocation operates as follows: \nTo the extent there are sufficient funds in the Net\nSettlement Fund, each Authorized Claimant will receive anamount equal to the Authorized Claimant’s claim.  If,however, the amount in the Net Settlement Fund is notsufficient to permit payment of the total claim of eachAuthorized Claimant, then each Authorized Claimant shallbe paid the percentage that each Authorized Claimant’sclaim bears to the total of the claims of all AuthorizedClaimants.  A claim will be computed as follows: theclaim shall be equal to the amount paid for shares ofQuintus common stock purchased or acquired by SettlementClass members during the Settlement Class Period, less:(a) the amount realized from the sale of any such sharesduring the Settlement Class Period or through February22, 2001, or $0.14 per share, whichever is greater; or(b) the number of any such shares held at the close ofbusiness on February 22, 2001, multiplied by $0.14 (theclosing price of Quintus stock on February 22, 2001).\nDoc #277 Ex A at 10.  The plan of allocation was fully described innotice letters to potential class members and no objections weresubmitted to the court or raised at the hearing.\nThe court has discretion to approve a plan of allocation\nthat is fair and reasonable.  In re Heritage Bond Litigation\n, 2005\nUS Dist LEXIS 13555 at *38 (CD Cal 2005).  “A plan of allocationthat reimburses class members based on the extent of their injuriesis generally reasonable.”  Id (quoting In re Oracle Securities\nLitigation , 1994 US Dist LEXIS 21593 at *1 (ND Cal 1994)).  Because this plan provides proportional reimbursement and\nno class member objected, the court concludes the plan ofallocation is fair and reasonable.  Accordingly, the motion forfinal approval of the plan of allocation is GRANTED.Case 3:00-cv-04300-VRW   Document 14   Filed 12/05/06   Page 7 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n8IV\nLead plaintiff and his counsel seek an award of attorney\nfees and expenses totaling $1,141,978.40.  Doc #275 at 16.  Thisamount includes attorney fees of $817,500, expenses of $150,000,reimbursement of fees and expenses of bankruptcy counsel of$162,478.40 and reimbursement of $12,000 to the lead plaintiff. Id.  The fees and expenses sought amount to 11.3% of the totalsettlement amount.\nThe court preliminarily approved an award of attorney\nfees and expenses in its July 7, 2006, order.  Doc #269 at 21. This request differs by including $15,096.40 of additional fees andexpenses of bankruptcy counsel and $12,000 in reimbursement to leadplaintiff.  The court anticipated such an increase in the amountsought for bankruptcy counsel.  Id.  Lead plaintiff, however, seeksreimbursement for 80 hours of his time at a rate of $150/hour forthe first time.  Doc #276 Ex 5 at ¶¶2-3.  The court is authorizedto reimburse lead plaintiff for reasonable costs and expensesrelated to the representation of the class, including lost wages. 15 USC §78u-4(a)(4).  As a registered securities principal and theprincipal of RAMA Financial, lead plaintiff’s request forcompensation is reasonable.  Doc #276 Ex 5 at ¶3.\nThese minor increases in the amount requested do not\ndisturb the court’s prior conclusion that “the amount of attorneyfees (including those incurred by bankruptcy counsel) is relativelymodest in relation to the total class recovery.”  Doc #269 at 21. This court, however, “rejects reliance solely on a comparison ofthe percentage fee requested here with other percentage awards orwith a so-called benchmark percentage.”  In re HPL Technologies,Case 3:00-cv-04300-VRW   Document 14   Filed 12/05/06   Page 8 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n9Inc Sec Litig , 366 F Supp 2d 912, 914 (ND Cal 2005).  Instead, the\ncourt employs a lodestar cross-check to determine thereasonableness of the requested attorney fees.\n“Three figures are salient in a lodestar calculation: (1)\ncounsel’s reasonable hours, (2) counsel’s reasonable hourly rateand (3) a multiplier thought to compensate for various factors.” Id at 919.  In performing a cross-check, the court calculates theimplied multiplier to determine its reasonableness.  Lead counselhas spent more than 5,000 attorney hours in this matter, most ofthem by senior attorneys.  Doc #275 Ex 1.  Applying the Laffey\nmatrix hourly rates, as adjusted for Los Angeles and cost of livingincreases, lead counsel calculates its lodestar as $1,976,262.50. Id at 12 and Ex 1.  The requested attorney fees of $817,500, lessthan half the lodestar, provide an implied lodestar multiplier of0.414.  Id at 13.  This multiplier is indeed reasonable, indicatingclass members obtained a significant discount on market attorneyrates.  Notably, competitive selection of class counsel producedthis low loadstar ratio or negative multiplier.  Quintus\n, 148 F\nSupp 2d 967.  Despite any statutory limitation on use ofcompetitive selection, see In re Cavanaugh\n, 306 F3d 726 (9th Cir\n2002), this provides further evidence that courts may look to thecompetitive selection cases in determining a reasonable level offees and costs.  See In re Cabletron, Inc Securities Litigation\n,\n2006 US Dist LEXIS 75188 (D NH 2006).\nThe requested attorney fees and expenses are reasonable\ncompensation for the value provided to the class.  This is furtherevidenced by the lack of class member objections to thepreliminarily approved attorney fees and expenses included in theCase 3:00-cv-04300-VRW   Document 14   Filed 12/05/06   Page 9 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n10\nclass notice.\nAccordingly, the application for award of attorney fees\nand reimbursement of expenses is GRANTED.\nIT IS SO ORDERED.\n                                   \nVAUGHN R WALKERUnited States District Chief JudgeCase 3:00-cv-04300-VRW   Document 14   Filed 12/05/06   Page 10 of 10",

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: This court case involves a securities fraud class action lawsuit against Quintus Corporation, accused of making false statements related to its financial status. The lawsuit was filed on behalf of individuals who purchased Quintus stock between November 15, 1999, and November 15, 2000. During this period, Quintus was involved in the development of artificial intelligence (AI) and e-Customer Relationship Management (eCRM) software. The parties reached a $10.1 million settlement, which was approved by the court. \n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: The key legal issue in this case was whether Quintus Corporation committed securities fraud by overstating its revenue and providing misleading information in its financial statements, affecting investor decisions during its initial public offering (IPO).\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court approved the final settlement of $10.1 million for the class of affected shareholders and granted the application for attorney fees and reimbursement of expenses. The court found the settlement fair, reasonable, and adequate considering the complex litigation, the company's bankruptcy, and the allocation of limited resources to multiple litigants.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine buying a toy from a company because they said it was super popular and everyone loved it. Later, you find out the company lied about how many toys they actually sold. This case is like a group of people who bought that toy getting together to take the company to court for lying. The judge in this case said, \"Okay, the company needs to pay back some of the money to the people who bought the toy,\" and everyone agreed to the amount they would receive back. In this case, the company's toy was a kind of computer software, and the legal stuff was about what they should have told people who bought parts of their company (like the toy).",

    "summary": "1. **Summary:** This is a United States District Court case regarding a securities fraud class action involving Quintus Corporation, a company that provided AI-powered eCRM solutions. The case dealt with allegations of false and misleading statements in registration statements and financial reports related to Quintus's IPO and subsequent acquisition, leading to significant financial losses for shareholders. The court approved a $10.1 million settlement for class members, alongside attorney fees and expenses, ensuring fair distribution based on the degree of loss each suffered.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue:** The main legal issue involved whether false financial statements by Quintus constituted securities fraud, violating sections of the Securities Act of 1933 and Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which led to significant shareholder losses.\n\n3. **Court's Holding:** The court granted the final approval of the proposed $10.1 million settlement as fair, reasonable, and adequate for the class members, and approved the allocation plan and attorney fees, citing the challenges and risks of further litigation and the successful negotiation achieved despite the company's bankruptcy.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation:** Imagine a company that uses technology to help other companies manage their customer relationships tells everyone that their finances are great, encouraging people to invest by buying stocks. Turns out, they weren't truthful about their finances, and when the real numbers were revealed, the company's stock price crashed, and it went bankrupt. People who lost money sued, and the court approved a plan where the company pays $10.1 million to those who bought stocks during this time, while also covering the lawyers' fees, saying this was the best solution given the tough situation and the company's financial problems.",

The parties have reached a settlement and now seek finalapproval of the proposed settlement and the proposed plan ofallocation.  Doc #274.

For the reasons discussed below, finalapproval of the class settlement and plan of allocation is GRANTEDand the application for award of attorney fees and reimbursement ofexpenses is GRANTED.Case 3:00-cv-04771-VRW   Document 19   Filed 12/05/06   Page 1 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n2I\nWhen Quintus was incorporated in 1984, its business was\nartificial intelligence software.  During the class period, Quintusprovided “e-Customer Relationship Management” or “eCRM” solutions,primarily through its “eContact” software.  Quintus grew through aseries of acquisitions in 1997 through 1999.  \nAs part of an initial public offering completed November\n15, 1999, Quintus sold 5.175 million shares of Quintus common stockat $18/share.  Consistent with those heady times, the stock pricesoon reached $55/share. On February 28, 2000, Quintus announcedits intent to acquire Mustang.com, which developed corporate e-mailmanagement software.  Quintus filed a registration statement inconnection with the Mustang acquisition on March 28, 2000.\nOn November 15, 2000, its first anniversary as a publicly\ntraded company, Quintus announced that it was reviewing previouslyfiled financial statements.  The price of Quintus shares fell from$6.00/share to $2.97/share before trading was halted by NASDAQshortly after noon, representing a one-day (or less) price drop ofjust over 50%.  On November 22, 2000, Quintus announced the resultsof a financial audit, which revealed that Quintus had overstatedrevenue on several occasions.  The truth regarding Quintus’sfinancial condition continued to emerge over the next few monthsand NASDAQ delisted Quintus stock on February 16, 2001.  After twodays of over-the-counter trading, the price of Quintus common stocksank to $0.14 on February 22, 2001, when Quintus filed for Chapter11 bankruptcy.\nA flurry of class actions alleging securities fraud wereCase 3:00-cv-04771-VRW   Document 19   Filed 12/05/06   Page 2 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n3filed in this court and ultimately consolidated.  Doc #71.  The\ncourt designated the law firm of Weiss & Yourman (now Weiss &Lurie) as lead counsel pursuant to a competitive selection process. See In re Quintus Sec Litig\n, 148 F Supp 2d 967 (ND Cal 2001). \nFollowing two rounds of motions to dismiss, the court designatedRoman Reznik as lead plaintiff.  Doc #201.  \nThe first amended consolidated class action complaint,\nDoc #215 (CAC), alleges that false and misleading statements ofmaterial fact appeared in the Quintus IPO registration statement,the Mustang registration statement and various periodic financialreports.  Accordingly, the CAC asserts claims under sections 11,12(a)(2) and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933 (the “1933 Act”) aswell as claims under sections 10(b), 14(a)(9) and 20(a) of theSecurities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “1934 Act”).  Id ¶¶291-357.\nThis litigation is only one current in Quintus’s wake. \nAs noted, Quintus initiated a Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceeding inthe United States District Court for the District of Delaware. Additionally, various shareholder actions were filed in Californiaand Texas state courts.  Thus, the proposed settlement presentlyunder consideration is part of a global settlement to beadministered by the Chapter 11 trustee.  \nOn July 7, 2006, the court preliminarily approved the\nproposed settlement and certified the class.  Doc #269.  The courtordered that notice of the pending settlement and final approvalhearing be mailed to potential class members on July 25, 2006.  Doc#273.  Over 20,000 notice letters were mailed to potentialsettlement class members and shareholders of record.  Doc #277 at¶5.  Not a single class member objected to the settlement orCase 3:00-cv-04771-VRW   Document 19   Filed 12/05/06   Page 3 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n4requested exclusion from the class settlement in response to the\nnotice letter.  Id at ¶7-8.  Similarly, no objection was raised atthe final settlement approval hearing on December 5, 2006.\nII\nThe proposed settlement agreement provides that\ndefendants will pay $10.1 million in cash into a common fund to bedistributed to class members. \nThe question currently before the court is whether this\nsettlement should be approved.  “The court must approve anysettlement, voluntary dismissal, or compromise of the claims,issues, or defenses of a certified class.”  FRCP 23(e)(1)(A).  Thecourt bears in mind the Ninth Circuit’s “strong judicial policythat favors settlement, particularly where complex class actionlitigation is concerned.”  Class Plaintiffs v City of Seattle\n, 355\nF2d 1268, 1276 (9th Cir 1992).  While no class member has objected,the court must still review the proposed settlement.  Manual forComplex Litigation (Fourth) §21.635 (“Even if there are no or fewobjections or adverse appearances before or at the fairnesshearing, the judge must ensure that there is sufficient record asto the basis and justification for the settlement”).\nThe court may approve a settlement “only after a hearing\nand on finding that the settlement * * * is fair, reasonable andadequate.”  FRCP 23(e)(1)(C).  A final approval hearing was held onDecember 5, 2006.  The Ninth Circuit has set forth the followingfactors for courts considering approval of class actionsettlements: Case 3:00-cv-04771-VRW   Document 19   Filed 12/05/06   Page 4 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n5(1) the strength of the plaintiffs’ case; (2) the risk,\nexpense, complexity, and likely duration of furtherlitigation; (3) the risk of maintaining class actionstatus throughout the trial; (4) the amount offered insettlement; (5) the extent of discovery completed and thestate of the proceedings; (6) the experience and views ofcounsel; (7) the presence of a governmental participant;and (8) the reaction of the class members to the proposedsettlement. \nChurchill Village v General Electric\n, 361 F3d 566, 575 (9th Cir\n2004).  These factors overwhelmingly support approval of the classsettlement.  The court discusses the settlement evaluation factorsthat are relevant in this case.  Id at 576 n7.\nThis settlement follows six years of protracted\nlitigation, discovery and negotiation.  Further litigation wouldrequire plaintiffs to survive motions for summary judgment and, ifsuccessful, present their case to a jury.  The considerable riskand cost associated with further litigation is enhanced byQuintus’s pending bankruptcy litigation.  This court noted early inthese proceedings that “plaintiffs are going to have troublefinding deep pockets in this case.”  Doc #85 at 37.  This globalsettlement divides the limited resources of a bankrupt corporationamong the many litigants suing Quintus.  Doc #276 at ¶ 6.  Much ofthe remaining value to be apportioned among the litigants is fromQuintus’s directors and officers liability insurance policies.  Thesettlement class, however, is receiving the “lion’s share” of theinsurance coverage.  Doc #276 at ¶46.  Weighing the risks and costsof further litigation, the court concludes that this settlement isadvisable.\nThe settlement amount, $10.1 million, closely resembles\nthe $9,996,000 settlement predicted by the Haas Study\n referenced by\nthis court in its previous order.

    "summary": "1. **Summary:** In the bankruptcy case of Celsius Network LLC, the U.S. Bankruptcy Court approved a settlement regarding the CEL Token, valuing it at $0.25 despite its higher trading price at the bankruptcy filing date. This decision resolved disputes over the valuation and ownership of digital assets, establishing them as part of the debtors' estates, and incorporated it into a larger Chapter 11 reorganization plan. The involvement of AI came into play when an expert relied on AI-generated reports for valuation, which the court ultimately excluded due to reliability concerns.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue:** Whether the CEL Token should be valued at $0.25 as part of the debtor's reorganization plan and who owns the digital collateral—Celsius's estate or the account holders.\n\n3. **Court's Holding:** The court approved the valuation of the CEL Token at $0.25, considering it fair and reasonable amidst questions of its intrinsic and speculative values. It also held that ownership of collateral pledged under the loan terms transferred to Celsius, meaning it belonged to the debtor's estate.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation:** The court had to decide how much each CEL Token was worth for people who had them when Celsius went bankrupt. Some wanted each token to be worth what they were trading for at the time, but the court decided it was fair to set a lower value because the market was too chaotic to trust. Additionally, the court confirmed that Celsius owned the digital assets clients used as collateral, after some clients thought they still owned them. An expert tried to use a robot's help to make his point, but the court said, \"Nope, that robot's report isn't reliable enough to use.\"",

THE CEL TOKEN  SETTLEMENT  \nA. Background on t he CEL Token   \nThe CEL Token (“CEL” or “CEL Token”)  was a utility token native to the Celsius \nNetwork .  A utility token is a “form of cryptographic token[] whose primary purpose is to allow \nusers to consume the platform’s (smart contract) services.”  ( CEL Token  Brief ¶ 25, citing \nSamuel Häfner, Blockchain Platform Design under Market Frictions: Decentralization, Service Provision, and Block Rewards  (September 4, 2023).)  The CEL Token provided its owners with \nvarious benefits on the Celsius network, most notably discounts on loan interest rates and increased rewards in Celsius’ Earn Program.  ( CEL Token  Brief ¶ 6.)  Celsius launched the CEL \nToken in Q4 2017, and commenced a private presale for its initial coin offering (including presale, the “ICO”) , offering CEL at $0.20/Token.  ( Id. ¶ 7.)  In Q1 2018, Celsius conducted the \ncrowdsale portion of the ICO, offering CEL at $0.30/Token.  ( Id.)   \nThough its rewards and utilities were tied to the Celsius Network, it was an “ERC -20” \ntoken, meaning it could be deployed on the Ethereum blockchain and thus sent to any address, wallet, exchange, or other software compatible with this form of token.  ( Initial Galka \nDeclaration  \n¶ 32.)  Users could thus buy and sell CEL Token s via decentralized exchanges, which fac iliate  \n \n2 Mr. Bronge filed a letter on the docket (ECF Doc. # 3954, amended by ECF Doc. # # 3955 , 3961) that \nproposed modifications to  paragraph 269  of the Confirmatio n Order .  In the alternative , he requested  that the Court \nexplain its reasons for overruling his objection.  The Court rejects the proposed modification.  T his Opinion  explains \nthe reasons .  \n22-10964-mg    Doc 4089    Filed 12/13/23    Entered 12/13/23 09:48:36    Main Document \nPg 4 of 235 \n direct  peer -to-peer transactions; centralized exchanges , where an entity (similar to a broker) \nsettle s transactions on an internal ledger; and over-the-counter (“OTC”) desks, where the desk \nacts as an intermediary between the parties .  (Id. ¶ 26.)   \nUsers could acquire CEL  by opting to receive interest on their Earn Account balances in \nCEL, by purchasing it from the Celsius OTC desk, or by purchasing it on a number of other \ncentralized and decentralized exchanges .  (Initial Galka Declaration  ¶¶ 39, 49, 51.)  On June 12, \n2022 (the “Pause D ate”), Celsius paused all trading activity on its platform.  ( Id. ¶¶ 127, 137).  \nAs a result, approximately 95% of CEL Token s in circulation were locked on the platform, while \nthe remaining 5% continued trading on third -party platforms.  ( Id. ¶¶ 67, 137.)  On the Pause \nDate, CEL traded at $0.28.  (Committee CEL Brief ¶ 34.)  Between the Pause Date and the \nPetition Date (J uly 13, 2022), CEL rose in price to $0.81.  ( Id. ¶ 3 5.) \nIn July 2023, various regulatory authorities made allegations of  securities fraud, \ncommodities fraud, wire fraud, conspiricy  to manipulate the price of the CEL Token  against \ncertain of the Debtors and the former C hief Executive O fficer, Alexander Mashinsky, and Chief \nRevenue Officer,  Roni Cohen-Pavon.  ( CEL Token  Brief ¶ 16.)  The Debtors reached settlements \nwith the regulatory authorities .  (Id. ¶ 17.)  The Debtors did not agree that CEL Token  was an \nunregistered security, but did stipulate to “facts that could reasonably lead a fact finder to determine that CEL Token  [was a securit y].”  (Id., citing July 18, 2023 Hr’g Tr. 32:11–13 \n(Debtors’ counsel describing the terms of their agreement with the SEC). ) \n1. The Valuation Dispute \nOne of the most contentious issues throughout thes e chapter 11 cases has been the \nvaluation of the CEL Token .  Some creditors immediately rallied against any return for CEL \nholders, describing the token  as “destined -to-be-worthless.”  ( See, e.g., July 21, 2022 Letter from \n22-10964-mg    Doc 4089    Filed 12/13/23    Entered 12/13/23 09:48:36    Main Document \nPg 5 of 236 \n Jonathan Rabroker (ECF Doc.  # 154); July 20, 2022 Letter from Immanuel Herrmann (ECF Doc. \n# 75) (arguing that the value of CEL Token  Deposit Claims should be “either entirely zeroed \nout” or “reduced in value by 90-95%.”)  Debtors initially filed a Plan proposing a value of $0.20 \nper CEL Token .  (See ECF Doc. # 2358.)   \nMany other creditors vigorously opposed this proposal, arguing for a valuation of at least  \n$0.81, the Petition Date price .  (See, e.g., June 26, 2023 Letter from Otis Davis (ECF Doc. # \n2872) (arguing that a lower valuation was “outright theft”); June 26, 2023 Letter from Marlowe \nBennett (ECF Doc. # 2874) (outlining reasons CEL Token  Deposit Claims should not be \nsubordinated); June 26, 2023 Letter from Madhu Kutty (ECF Doc. # 2895) (same). )   \nIn response to these letters and many others, Debtors engaged in negotiations with the \nCommittee and certain pro se parties, which culminated in the CEL Settlement.  ( CEL Token  \nBrief ¶ 18).   \n2. The Terms of the CEL Settlement and the Voting Results \nPursuant to the CEL Settlement, which is incorporated into the Plan, Claims and Causes \nof Action arising out of or related to the CEL Token  for, among other things, recharacterization \nand subordination, are settled according to the following terms: (i) first, except as provided in Article III.B.17 of the Plan, all CEL Token  Deposit Claims, other than Custody Claims that are \nCEL Token  Deposit Claims, shall be valued at $0.25/ CEL Token , and shall otherwise receive the \ntreatment associated with the program in which they were deployed; and (ii) second, all Claims on account of CEL Token  identified in the Schedule of Equitably Subordinated Claims w ill be \nsubordinated without distribution as provided in Article III.B.16 or Article III.B.17 of the Plan, as applicable.  (Confirmation Brief ¶ 95.)  All  Other CEL Token  Claims are classified as Class \n15 Section 510(b) Claims (which will not receive any distribution under the Plan).  ( Id.)   \n22-10964-mg    Doc 4089    Filed 12/13/23    Entered 12/13/23 09:48:36    Main Document \nPg 6 of 237 \n The CEL Settlement does not release Account Holders’ claims against third parties that \nmanipulated the price of CEL Token .  (CEL Token  Brief ¶ 18 .)  Lastly, the Confirmation  Order \nprovides that Account Holders who (1)  timely opted out of the Class Claim Settlement and (2) \nvoted to reject the Plan or abstained from voting on the Plan retain their rights to  resolve their \nclaims through the Claims allowance process.   (Confirmation  Order ¶ 262.)  \nThe CEL claims were not segmented as a separate class under the plan; rather, every vote \nin favor of the plan was counted as a vote for the CEL Settlement.  (Confirmation Brief ¶ 109.)  \nDebtors tabulated the votes of CEL Token  Holders within each Class to eval uate support for the \nCEL Settlement.  ( Id.)  The  acceptance rate of the Plan/CEL Settlement is 98.71% in number and \n95.93% in amount.  ( Amended Declaration of Brian Karpuk, ECF Doc. # 3574.)  \nB. Debtors and Committee Support of the CEL Settlement  \nThe Debtors briefed the basis for approving the CEL Settlement and the application of \nthe Iridium  factors thereto in the  CEL Token  Brief ( ECF Doc . # 3431) which relied on the \nFerraro Declaration (ECF Doc. # 3435).  Debtors further addressed the CEL Settlement in the  \nConfirmation Brief  and the Suppl emental  Memo ( Confirmation Brief ¶¶ 91 –109; Supplemental \nMemo ¶¶ 26 –29).   \nIn support of the CEL Settlement, the Committee submitted the Committee CEL Brief  \n(ECF Doc. # 3432) .  During the Confirmation Heari ng, the Debtors and the Committee further \nrelied on the expert testimony of Maxwell Galka  and Robert Campagna.  ( See Initial Galka \nDeclaration , ECF Doc. # 3580;  Supplemental Galka Declaration , ECF Doc. # 3659;  (and \ntogether, the “ Galka Reports ”); see also Initial Campag na Declaration , ECF Doc. # 3582;  \nSupplemental Campagna Declaration , ECF Doc. # 3653.)   \n22-10964-mg    Doc 4089    Filed 12/13/23    Entered 12/13/23 09:48:36    Main Document \nPg 7 of 238 \n The Debtors and the Committee argue  that the CEL Settlement satisfies the Iridium  \nfactors as  fair, reasonable, and in the best interests of the estate because it  (a) was \noverwhelmingly accepted by creditors, and ( b) avoids value -destructive litigation on (1) whether  \nthe CEL Token  a security , which could result in its complete subordination, and (2)  the intrinsic \nvalue of CEL , an issue which is “ notoriously time -intensive and expensive to litigate even under \nstraightforward circumstances .”  (CEL Token  Brief ¶¶ 2–3.)   They argue that in the first case, \nCEL was likely a security , and should be subordinated under Section 510(b) of the Bankruptcy \nCode ; and if it was not, it was a w orthless utility token of a defunct network.  ( Id. ¶¶ 25 –28.)  \nThey submit that a fair value is thus likely $0.00, but are “willing to compromise with the CEL \nholders  to provide them with a $0.25 recovery[].”  ( Committee CEL Brief ¶ 39.)  \nSpecifically, Mr. Galka’s testimony  establish es that at the P etition D ate, the market for \nCEL was dislocated, and thus (1) the market price at the Petition Date was an unreliable \nindicator of value , and (2) it would be  impossible to ascribe a specific value to CEL on the \nPetition D ate.  (See Galka Report s.)  Mr. Campagna’s testimony  establish es that the value of \nCEL must be at or under $0.34 to  satisfy the “ best interests ” test under section 1129(a), which \nthe CEL Settlement satisfies.  ( See Celsius Ex. 70 at 4–5; see also  October 4 , 2023 Hr’g Tr. \n123:7–24 (Campagna).)  \nC. Objections to the CEL Settlement  \nSpearheading the objections  to the CEL Settlement was  pro se  creditor Otis Davis, who \nobjected to the Galka Reports and maintained  that the CEL Token  should be valued at the \nPetition Da te price of $0.81, or some higher amount .  (See “Davis Objection ,” ECF Docket # \n3532; “Davis Opposition,” ECF Doc. # 3639; “Davis Statement,” ECF Doc. # 3769.)   He \nadvance d three main arguments: (1) that price of CEL was heavily influenced by “naked shorts” \n22-10964-mg    Doc 4089    Filed 12/13/23    Entered 12/13/23 09:48:36    Main Document \nPg 8 of 239 \n made by FTX; (2) that the market price of CEL on the Petition Date was  fair, and  the best \nindicator of  its value; and (3) that the market price of CEL prior to the collapse of  the TerraLuna \ncoin, a major dislocation event in the crypto market, was the best indicator of CEL’s  value.  \nMr. Davis argue d first that the “upwards price action” of CEL between the Pause and \nPetition Date was due to “illegal naked shorts” executed by FTX.  (Davis Objection at 1.)  In the \nsame paragraph, Mr. Davis then avers that “ ‘naked shorts’ are the purest form of downward price \nmanipulation.”  ( Id. at 2.)  Despite his extensive arguments that the price of CEL was influenced \nby this “purest form of price manipulation,” ( id. at 2), and without disputing the fact that 95% of \nthe volume of CEL Token  was locked following the Pause, Davis argues that the “free market \nactivity in such high volume  is the best expert witnes s of all as to what the pegged price should \nbe.”  (Davis Opposition ¶ 7.)  Following Mr. Galka’s testimony, Mr. Davis appeared to concede \nthat “a dislocation in the market can affect what would be a fair market value,” but argues that the best data from wh ich to measure the price of CEL was prior to the TerraLuna dislocation \nevent, when CEL was priced at $2.01.  (Davis Statement at 6.)   \nIn support of his objections, Mr. Davis  proffered  his own valuation expert, Hussein Faraj , \nwith a  corresponding expert report  (the “Report” or  “Faraj Report ,” ECF Doc. # 3752) .  Debtors \nand Committee moved to  exclude Mr. Faraj  as an expert witness , including his Report.  ( See \nECF Doc. # 3817.)   \nFor the reasons explained below, the C ourt GRANTS  the mo tion to exclude the Faraj \nReport, but DENIES  the motion to exclude Mr. Faraj’s testimony, which it will give such weight \nas the Court deems appropriate .  \n22-10964-mg    Doc 4089    Filed 12/13/23    Entered 12/13/23 09:48:36    Main Document \nPg 9 of 2310 \n 1. The Fara j Report is Excluded  \nRule 702 of the Federal Rules of Evidence (“Rule 702”), made applicable to these \nproceedings by Rule 9017 of the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure, provides that expert \ntestimony may be given by a qualified witness if: “ (a) the expert’s scientific, technical, or other  \nspecialized knowledge will help the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue; (b) the testimony is based on sufficient facts or data; (c) the testimony is the product of reliable principles and methods; and (d) the experts opinion reflects a reliabl e appli cation  of th e \nprinciples and methods to the facts of the case.”  F\nED. R. EVID. 702.  A properly submitted expert \nreport is a reflection of the  expert’s  own knowledge, experience, expertise and methods used.  It \nembodies their testimony, and communicates technical and detailed explanations to the finder of fact.  \nThe Faraj Report was not written by Mr. Faraj.  Alt hough Mr. Faraj directed and guided \nits creation, the 172-page Report, which was generated within 72 hours, was written by artificial intelligence at the instruction of Mr. Faraj.  By  his own testimony, a comprehensive human-\nauthored report would have taken over 1,000 hours to complete .  (See October 17, 2023 Hr’g Tr. \n47:24–48:2 (Faraj); Celsius Ex. 113 (“We completed the entire assessment within 72 hours.  In reality, this is usually a 6 -to-8 week job.”); October 17, 2023 Hr’g Tr. 48:3–5 (Faraj) (“Q. So you \ndid a 1,000-plus hour job in 72 in this case.  Is that your testimony?  A. That’s 100 percent corre ct.”); October 17, 2023 Hr’g Tr. 51:7–9 (Faraj) (“Q. Mr. Faraj, if it was going to be \ncomprehensive, 72 hours was not enough to generate this report, true?  A. Correct.”).)  In fact, it \ntook Mr. Faraj longer to read report than to generate it.  ( See October 17, 2023 Hr’g Tr. 46:4–6 \n(Faraj).)  The Court therefore separately evaluates the Faraj Report and the testimony of Mr. Faraj .  As discussed below, the Court will admit Mr. Faraj’s  oral testimony , giving it such weight \n22-10964-mg    Doc 4089    Filed 12/13/23    Entered 12/13/23 09:48:36    Main Document \nPg 10 of 2311 \n as is appropriate.   However , the Court finds that the Faraj R eport is unreliable and fails to meet \nthe standard  for admission . \nThe Faraj Report was not based on sufficient facts or data .  The Report contains almost \nno citations to facts or data underlying the majority of the methods, facts, and opinions set forth \ntherein.  ( See Faraj Dep. Tr. at 239:11–20.)   In preparing the report, Mr. Faraj did not review the \nunderlying source material for any  sources  cited, nor does he know  what his team did (or did not \ndo) to review and summarize those materials.  ( See October 17, 2023 Hr’g Tr. 83:16–84:22 \n(Faraj).)  The Report  contains no citations to the information on the CEL Token  itself, at times \nsuggesting that it is important to consider features that CEL Token  never had, such as \ngovernance rights.  ( See Faraj Report at 103 –104.)  \nThere were no standards controlling the operation of t he artificial intelligence  that \ngenerated the R eport.  The Report contained numerous errors, ranging from duplicated \nparagraphs to mistakes  in its description of the trading window selected for evaluation.  ( See \nOctober 17, 2023 Hr’g Tr. 51:17–19 (Faraj) (“Q. Do you agree with me, sir, that there are errors \nin your report, true?  A. I agree.”); October 17, 2023 Hr’g Tr. 51:20–22 (Faraj) (“Q. And in your view, it would be impossible to prepare a report in 72 hours without introducing errors, correct?  A. That’s true.”); October 17, 2023 Hr’g Tr. 51:23–53:11 (Faraj) (discussing the inclusion of a duplicated 92- word paragraph); October 17, 2023 Hr’g Tr. 57:12–14 (Faraj) (describing \nincorrect trade dates). ) \nThe Faraj R eport was not the product of  reliable  or peer -reviewed  principles and \nmethods .  Mr. Faraj used a “fair value” method that he personally developed.  ( See October 17, \n2023 Hr’g Tr. 67:17–19 (Faraj) (“Q. And that’s a method that you personally developed, correct?  A. Correct.”).)  That method is not widely accepted in valuing cryptocurrency; it has not been \n22-10964-mg    Doc 4089    Filed 12/13/23    Entered 12/13/23 09:48:36    Main Document \nPg 11 of 2312 \n peer tested; and no investment bank today publicly reports the “fair value” of any platform-\nspecific cryptocurrency token.  ( See October 17, 2023 Hr’g Tr. 67:20–69:5 (Faraj).)   It does not \ncite to any academic papers or sources for its descriptions of valuation methodologies or in support of its chosen methodology.  ( See Faraj Report at 103 –104.)   \nThe Court finds and concludes that the Report does not meet the standard set forth under \nRule 702.  Accordingly, t he Faraj Report  is excluded.  \n2. Faraj’s Live Testimony is Admitted  \nDaubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 509 U.S. 579 (1993) charges trial judges \nwith the responsibility of evaluating expert testimony to “protect juries from being bamboozled by technical evidence of dubious merit.”  New York v.

Where the expert will opine on a relevant issue,  and “the fact finder and the gatekeeper are the same, the court does not err in \nadmitting the evidence subject to the ability later to exclude it or disregard it.”  In re Salem , 465 \nF.3d 767, 777 (7th Cir. 2006).  Thus, in a bench trial, the court may  admit expert testimony, \nsubject to cross -examination , and determine how much weight, if any, to give to the expert's \nconclusions.  Victoria ’s Secret Stores Brand Mgmt. v. Sexy Hair Concepts, LLC , No. 07 Civ. \n5804, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 30458, at *17 n.3, (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 8, 2009) ( stating that “where a \nbench trial is in prospect, resolving Daubert questions at a pretrial stage is generally less efficient than simply hearing the evidence”). \nThe Confirmation Hearing was a bench trial, so admitting Faraj’s testimony did not run \nthe risk of confusing a jury .  In determining whether an expert has sufficient qualifications to \ntestify, courts in the Second Circuit look at “the totality of the witness” qualifications to ensure that the expert is proffering opinions within the confines of his or her expertise.  Napolitano v. \n22-10964-mg    Doc 4089    Filed 12/13/23    Entered 12/13/23 09:48:36    Main Document \nPg 12 of 2313 \n Synthes, Inc., 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 204087, at *3 (D. Conn. Apr. 9, 2014).  Rule 702 permits \ntestimony of experts qualified not only by education, but by knowledge, skil l and e xperienc e.  \nAlthough Mr. Faraj does not have formal degrees , he has years of experience in preparing \nresearch and development documents regarding various cryptocurrencies  and blockchain \ntechnologies  and was able to speak knowledgably on these topics .  (See October 17, 2023 Hr’g \nTr. 40:4–19; ;  id. at 41:20–25.)  The Court finds that Faraj has demonstrated sufficient \nknowledge in the field of cryptocurrency for the Court to consider his opinion.   \nNotably, on all the  relevant questions  before the Court —namely, those which shed light \non the value  of the CEL on the Petition Date —Faraj  agree s with Galka .  Both experts agree that \nthe value of CEL decreased between the Pause Date and the Petition Date.  (See October 17, \n2023 Hr’g Tr. 70:5–8 (Faraj)  (“Q. All right.  You would agree with me that the fair value of CEL \nToken decreased between the pause date, June 12th and the petition date July 13th, correct?  A. As a value, myself, I would agree with you.”) ; Supplemental Galka Declaration  ¶ 15.)   Both \nexperts agree that the market for CEL was dislocated during that period.  ( See October 17, 2023 \nHr’g Tr. 70:17–22 (Faraj)  (“Q. And you didn’t look at how much [the value of CEL ] decreased, \ncorrect? A. No, because I looked at that area and it was a dislocated market ”); Initial Galka \nDeclaration  ¶ 139.)   \nBoth experts agree that the  CEL Token  had no intrinsic value on the Petition Date.  ( See \nOctober 17, 2023 Hr’g Tr. 71:3–5 (Faraj) (“Q. As of the pet ition date, CEL also had no intrinsic \nvalue, correct?  A. I agree with you.”) ; Supplemental Galka Declaration  ¶ 19 .)  Both experts \nagree that on the P etition D ate, CEL retained only speculative value.  (See October 17, 2023 \nHr’g Tr. 71:11–14 (Faraj)  (“Q. And the only remaining value for the CEL Token  as of the \nPetition date is speculative value, correct?  A. I agree a hundred percent with that ”); \n22-10964-mg    Doc 4089    Filed 12/13/23    Entered 12/13/23 09:48:36    Main Document \nPg 13 of 2314 \n Supplemental Galka Declaration  ¶ 13 .)  And neither expert proffered an opinion on what that \nspeculative value was.  ( See October 17, 2023 Hr’g Tr. 74:25–75:2 (Faraj) (“Q. You didn’t put a \nprice on the speculative value for CEL Token  here, did you?  A. No, I didn’t.”); Supplemental \nGalka Declaration  ¶ 19.) \nAdmitting Mr. Faraj’s testimony would not result in any unfair prejudice to any parties.  \nThe Debtors and the Committee had the opportunity to depose Mr. Faraj prior to his live \ntestimony .  (See generally Faraj Dep. Tr.)  Any party who  wished to cross- examine Mr.  Faraj \nwas given the opportunity to do so during the Confirmation Hearing, and many pro se parties did so.  Accordingly, Mr. Faraj’s live testimony is admitted , and considered to the extent it sheds \nlight on th e relevant questions outlined above.   \nD. The CEL Settlement is Approved   \nThe Court, in considering the expert testimony of Mr. Galka and Mr. Faraj, finds that (1) \nthe CEL Token  had only speculative value as of the petition date, and (2) a valuation of $0.25 is \nwithin  (and indeed, likely on the higher end of ) the range of reasonableness of that speculative \nvalue.   For these reasons, explained in more detail below, the CEL Settlement as embodied in the \nPlan is APPROVED. \n1. CEL had Only Speculative Value as of the Petition Date \nThe Court finds that the $0.81 Petition Date price was not indicative of CEL’s value.  The \nDebtors have presented ample evidence that the market for CEL was severely dislocated on the Petition Date,  and both experts have testified convincingly to that effect .  The market  price was \nuntethered from the underlying value, and thus cannot serve as a reliable indicator therefor.   \nCEL was a utility token.   Its underlying value was based on the utilities it offered on the \nCelsius Network.  The price of CEL  at any given time reflected  (1) the value it possessed by \n22-10964-mg    Doc 4089    Filed 12/13/23    Entered 12/13/23 09:48:36    Main Document \nPg 14 of 2315 \n virtue of any  utility it offered its user, (2) the speculative value that any crypto asset  on the \nblockchain possesses, and (3) the influence of market fluctuations, whether from intentional \nprice manipulation  or other forces .  Upon the event of the Pause—rendering Account Holders \nunable to make use of any of CEL’s utilities—any  utility value  evaporated .  Thus, only \nspeculative value remained, buffeted by the chaotic market forces at play.  \nThe speculative value encompassed possibilities that a holder of Celsius may have \nconsidered  at the time : namely, “the prospect of Celsius restarting its business and utilizing the \nCEL Token  in that restarted business,” or even a second life as a “memecoin.” (Supplemental \nGalka Declaration  ¶ 13.)  Galka opines that any estimate thereof would be “pure conjecture” \ngiven the “ severe ” dislocation of the market.  ( Id. ¶¶ 13 –14.)  He believes that  on Petition  Date—\nroughly a month after the Pause Date—CEL was “likely worthless .”  (Id. ¶¶ 13 –14, 19.)  Faraj \nconcurs on both points.  ( See October 17, 2023 Hr’g Tr. 78:14–17 (Faraj) (“Q. In your view, it’s \nclose to impossible to differentiate between organic, legitimate price movements for a digital asset and movements based on manipulation, correct?  A. That’s correct ”); id. at 71:3–5 (Faraj) \n(“Q. As of the petition date, CEL also had no intrinsic value, correct?  A. I agree with you.”).)  Accordingly, the question before the Court is whether $0.25 is a reasonable settlement for any  \nremaining  value that CEL possessed on the Petition Date.  \n2. The CEL Settlement is R easonable  \nGiven that on the Petition Date  CEL only possessed speculative valu e, the Court finds \n$0.25 to be an eminently reasonable,  even generous, settlement.  \nTwo main  sources of speculative value were (1) A ccount Holders’ hope that CEL would \nsuccessfully reorganize and redeploy CEL, restoring its previous utilities, and (2) its value as deployed on other blockchains, as a “memecoin” or otherwise.  N either Galka nor Faraj was \n22-10964-mg    Doc 4089    Filed 12/13/23    Entered 12/13/23 09:48:36    Main Document \nPg 15 of 2316 \n willing  to opine on an exact estimate of that value .  (See October 17, 2023 Hr’g Tr. 74:25–75:2 \n(Faraj); Supplemental Galka Declaration  ¶ 19.)   No objecting party presented evidence that any  \nsource of speculative value, alone or in conjunction, could even approach , much less exceed , \n$0.25.  The post -petition history of the Debtors and of these cases, including the extensive \nevidence of fraud allegedly perpetrated by Alex Mashinsky and others (leading to a criminal \nindictment of Mashinsky, and SEC, CFTC and FTC enforcement actions against Celsius  and \nMashinsky)  demonstrates that attempting to place any speculative value on CEL on the Petition \nDate is completely unwarranted.  If the Celsius platform could not operate in the future, as in fact \nis the case, the CEL Token as a utility token on that platform would have no value.  Under the \nPlan overwhelming supported by Celsius creditors, the Celsius platform will not operate again.   \nAccordingly, t he Court finds that the $0.25 valuation of the CEL Token  to be eminently  fair and \nreasonable.   \nB. The Settlement Does Not Violate  Section 1129(a) of the Bankruptcy Code  \nMany creditors objected to the CEL Settlement on the grounds  that it violated s ection \n1129(a) of the Bankruptcy Code, the  so-called  “best i nterests  of the c reditors ” test.  Section \n1129(a) provides that a  dissenting creditor of an accepting class  must  “receive or retain under the \nplan on account of such claim or interest property of a value, as of the effective date of the plan, that is not less than the amount that such holder would so receive or retain if  the debtor were \nliquidated under  chapter 7 of this title  on such date .”  11 U.S.C. § 1129(a)(7)(A)(ii).  In other \nwords , such creditor is entitled to at least  the amount they would receive in liquidation.  \nA&M ’s liquidation analysis shows approximate reco veries of 67.0% under the NewCo  \nTransaction , 61.2% under the Orderly Wind Down (“OWD”) , and 47.4% under liquidation.  ( See \n22-10964-mg    Doc 4089    Filed 12/13/23    Entered 12/13/23 09:48:36    Main Document \nPg 16 of 2317 \n Celsius Ex. 70 at 4.)   Certain dissenting3 creditors  argued that under liquidation, they would be \nentitled to 47.4% of CEL’s Petition Date price of $0.81, for a recovery of approximately $0.38 \nper CEL Token .  (See, e.g., Objection Letter  from Dimitry Kirsano v, ECF Doc. # 3772, at 3 .)   \nThis is a mistaken assumption.  Whether under a chapter 11 plan or liquidation, creditors \nare entitled to the ir share of the  value  of the Debtor s’ Estates on the Petition Date.  That remains \ntrue even when , as seen here, the  value cannot be readily ascertained from the price.    \nThe relevant  comparison is thus  not between 47.4% of $0.81 and 61.2% of $0.25.  \nRather, the Court must find that  61.2%  of $0.25 (the OWD recovery , $0.1530)  is greater than  \n47.4% of the value of CEL  on the Petition Date .  The Court finds by a preponderance of the \nevidence that the value on the Petition Date did not exceed $0.25, and the CEL Settlement agrees \nto value each CEL Token  at that amount .  47.4% of $0.25 is $0.1185.  $0.1185 is less than \n$0.1530.  The best i nterests test is  satisfied.  \nThe Debtors further presented evidence regarding the “break -even point” at  which the \nbest i nterests  test would no longer be met .  For the NewCo Transaction , CEL would have to be  \nworth  36 cents , and for the Orderly Wind Down , CEL would have to be worth 34 cents.4  \n(See Celsius Ex. 70 ¶ 9; see also  October 4. 2023 Hr’g Tr. 123:7–24 (Campagna).)   This analysis \nis illustrated in Celsius Exhibit 70:  \n \n3  Some non-dissenting creditors raised this objecting, maintaining that they were dissenting creditors who \nhad voted to reject the Plan (s ee, e.g. , ECF Doc. # 3877), despite having accepted the Custody Settlement were thus \ndeemed to accept the Plan. The Court will nevertheless consider the objection.  \n4  Using the recovery percentages set forth in Celsius Ex. 70, to reach the NewCo recovery of $0.1675, CEL \nwould have to be worth $0. 3554  ($0.3554* 0.474 = $0.1675) , which rounds to $0.36 at the nearest cent.   However, t o \nreach the OWD reco very of $ 0.1530,  CEL would have to be worth only $0.3228 ( $0.3228*0. 612 = $0.1530), which \nrounds to $0.32 at the nearest cent, not $0.34.  The Court assumes that this is the result of truncating the number of \nsignificant f igures in the recovery percentages  illustrated by Exhibit 70.  \n22-10964-mg    Doc 4089    Filed 12/13/23    Entered 12/13/23 09:48:36    Main Document \nPg 17 of 2319 \n from voting on the Plan” to litigate these issues  through the Claims allowance process. \n(Confirmation  Order ¶ 262.) \nThe Court thus need not make a finding on whether CEL is a security, as that issue is not \nbefore the Court, and is preserved for any claimant who wishes to argue it.  \nII. THE COLLATERAL OWNERSHIP ISSUE  \nA. The Retail Borrower Settlement  \nDebtors also seek to effectuate, through the Plan, the settlement of the adversary \nproceeding brought by the Retail Borrower Ad Hoc Group and participating pro se  creditors as \nwell as claims held by Retail Borrowers ( the “Retail Borrower Settlement”).  (Plan, Art. I.126; \nConfirmation Brief ¶ 50 (g).)   \nThe Retail Borrower Settlement provides for, among other things, (i) in addition to any \nSet Off Treatment as provided for in the Plan, the option for holders of Retail Borrower Deposit \nClaims to elect to repay any obligations to Debtors in connection with advances made by \nDebtors relating to the Borrow Program prior to the Effective Date in exchange for an equivalent amount of BTC or ETH and (ii) priority in electing a preference to exchange equity in NewCo for cryptocurrency to be distributed to holders of claims under the at a 30% discount.  (Plan, Art. IV.B.7.) \nB. The Bronge Objection  \nOne of the principal objectors to the treatment of Retail Borrower Deposit Claims under \nthe Plan is Johan Bronge.  ( See “Bronge Response,” ECF Doc. # 3641, and “Bronge Objection,” \nECF Doc. # 3908.)  Mr. Bronge believes that version seven of the retain Loan Terms and \nConditions (“Version 7,” and subsequent Versions, “Version 8” and “Version 9”) did  not transfer \nownership of his digital assets to the Debtors.  (Bronge Response at 2; see also  Oct. 16, 2023 \n22-10964-mg    Doc 4089    Filed 12/13/23    Entered 12/13/23 09:48:36    Main Document \nPg 19 of 2320 \n Hr’g Tr. 48:12–16.)   Mr. Bronge objects to the Plan principally on the se grounds .  (See Bronge \nResponse at 2 .) \nThe Debtors do not dispute  that Mr. Bronge’s $62,000 retail loan made in April 2021 (the \n“Bronge Loan”) was governed under Version 7.5  (Supplemental Brief ¶ 16.)  However, the \nDebtor s argue that  Version 7 unambiguously transferred to the Debtors title  of the  digital assets \nthat a Retail Borrower transferred to the Borrow Program as collateral for  a retail loan .  (Id.)  \nThey cite to the f ollowing operative language :   \nIn consideration for the Loan, you grant Celsius the right , subject to applicable law, \nwithout further notice to you, to hold the Digital Assets provided as Collateral in \nCelsius’ name  or in another name, and to pledge, re -pledge, hypothecate, \nrehypothecate, sell, lend, or otherwise transfer or use any amount of such Digital \nAssets, separately or together with other property, with all attendant rights of \nownership, and for any period of time, and without retaining in Celsius’ possession and/or control a like amount of Digital Assets or any other monies or assets, and to use or invest such Digital A ssets at Celsius’ own risk.  \n(Id., citing Version 7 at 14, “Consent to Celsius’ Use of Your Digital Assets” (emphasis added) \n(the “Grant of Ownership Clause ”).)   \nVersion 5 of the General Terms of Use, which was the operative General Terms of Use at \nthe time Mr. Bronge agreed to Version 7 and was explicitly incorporated by reference,\n6 provides:  \n[N]otwithstanding the use of expressions such as “borrow,” “loan,” and “collate ral” \netc., which are used to reflect terminology adopted in the market for transactions of \nthe kind provided for pursuant to the Loan Agreement, title to the Digital Assets \nshall pass from you to CNL on the basis of an outright sale , subject to your right to \nrequest at a later date the delivery of equivalent (but not identical) Digital Assets to those sold to CNL.   \n(Id. ¶ 17, citing General Terms of Use, Version 5 at 8, “4. Nature of e -Services – B. Loans.” ) \nThis language bec ame more explicit in subsequent  versions of the General Terms of Use.  \nSpecifically, Version 8 of the General Terms of Use provides:  \n \n5  Mr. Bronge has four outstanding retail loans as of the Petition Date.  Excluding the Bronge Loan, the other \nthree are all governed by Version 9.   \n6  See, e.g. , Version 7 at 1 (“In addition, our Network Terms and Conditions . . . are incorporated into these \nLoan Conditions by reference.”); see also Docket No. 393, ¶¶ 10, 21; Ex. B -7 at 858.  \n22-10964-mg    Doc 4089    Filed 12/13/23    Entered 12/13/23 09:48:36    Main Document \nPg 20 of 2321 \n In consideration for . . . [Celsius] entering into any Loan agreement . . . you grant \nCelsius, subject to applicable law and for the duration of the period during which \nyou elect to utilize the Eligible Digital Assets. . . as collateral under the Borrow Service . . . all right and title to such Eligible Digital Assets , including \nownership rights. \n(Id. ¶ 18, citing General Terms of Use, Version 8 at 35, “13. Consent to Celsius’ Use of Digital \nAssets” ) (emphasis added).)  \nC. The Bronge Objection is Overruled  \nThe Court finds that the contract is clear and unambiguous, and therefore will give effect \nto the plain meaning of the contract’s terms and provisions .  For the avoidance of doubt, with \nrespect to any Account Holder who accepted the Plan and the Retail Borrower Settlement, the \nissue of their collateral ownership is not before the Court and therefore need not be decided.  (See Confirmation Orde r ¶ 269.)  The  Court finds that the digital assets pledged as collateral \nunder the Bronge Loan governed under Version 7 were property of the Debtors’ E states.  \nAccordingly, for reasons set forth in more detail below, t he Bronge Objection is OVERRULED.   \nThe contract clearly and unambiguously transferred ownership title of collateral to \nDebtors.  ( See General Terms of Use Version 5, “Consent to Celsius’ Use of Your Digital \nAssets” (including substantially similar language that Account Holders grant Debtors  “all \nattendant rights of ownership” and that Account Holders “may not be able to exercise certain rights of ownership”). )  The substantially similar Grant of Ownership Clause in Version 7 \nprovides, in equally unambiguous terms, that Debtors may exercise “ all attendant rights” in \ncollateral transferred to Debtors.  ( See Version 7 at 14, “Consent to Celsius’ Use of Your Digital \nAssets” (emphasis added) (the “Grant of Ownership Clause ”).) \nMr. Bronge erroneously relies on both Version 7’s inclusion of “Your” in the title \n“Consent to Celsius’ Use of Your Digital Assets” and “certain” in the clause “you may not be able to exercise certain rights of ownership” as evidence that he “still hold ow nership title” (sic) \n22-10964-mg    Doc 4089    Filed 12/13/23    Entered 12/13/23 09:48:36    Main Document \nPg 21 of 2322 \n but simply “may not exercise some [as opposed to all] property rights.”  (Bronge Response at 2.)  \nInterpreting the phrase “you may not be able to exercise certain  rights of ownership” as \noverriding the grant of ownership rights in the collateral renders the Grant of Ownership Clause superfluous.  The  Court has previously recognized in the Earn Opinion that “it is a bedrock \nprinciple of contract interpretation that courts should not adopt an interpretation of a contract that has the effect of rendering at least one clause superfluous or meaningless, but rather, to the extent possible, should seek to read contractual provisions in harmony.”  ( “Earn Opinion,”  ECF Doc. # \n1822 at 42.)  Accordingly, the Court applies  the plain meaning of the G rant of Ownership Clause \nto find that ownership of the collateral unambiguously transferred to Debtors. \nThe additional language in Version 8 and Version 9 pertaining to the transfer of \nownership in collateral is not evidence that the applicable language us ed in Version 7 is \nambiguous.  See Bennett Enters., Inc. v. Domino’s Pizza, Inc., 45 F.3d 493 (D.C. Cir. 1995) (holding that subsequent forms of a franchise agreement that “expressly set forth violation of the \ntax laws a reason for default” is not admissib le as evidence to show that the previous form, \nwhich only requires compliance with “all applicable laws,” is ambiguous).  The Grant of Ownership Clause is substantially consistent across V ersion s 7, 8, and 9 in granting Debtors all \nattendant rights of owne rship.   \nWhen adding that “Digital Assets posted as Collateral shall be the exclusive property of \nCelsius,” V ersion 8 and Version 9 also made specific reference to the section containing the \nGrant of Ownership Clause, making clear that the new language was  meant to reinforce and \nsupplement the Grant of Ownership Clause, not replace or otherwise render such clause ambiguous.  ( See V ersion 9 at 6, “Collateral” (“[Y]ou grant Celsius your explicit consent to use \nsuch Digital Assets in accordance with Section 20  below.”).)   \n22-10964-mg    Doc 4089    Filed 12/13/23    Entered 12/13/23 09:48:36    Main Document \nPg 22 of 2323 \n Neither  the revised nor additional language in Version 8 and V ersion 9 are evidence that \nVersion 7 is ambiguous or leads to a different result.  Accordingly, Mr. Bronge’s assets \ntransferred to the Borrow Program under Version 7 are property of the Debtors’ E states. \nIII. CO NCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court finds that (1) the CEL Settlement satisfies the best \ninterest s test, and (2) Mr. Bronge’s collateral pledged under Bronge Loan are  asset s of the \nDebtors’ E states.  \nA separate Order confirming the MODIFIED JOINT CHAPTER 11 PLAN OF CELSIUS \nNETWORK LLC AND ITS DEBTOR AFFILIATES has been entered.  \nDated:  November 9, 2023  \nNew York, New York  \n \n  Martin Glenn  \n MARTIN GLENN  \nChief United States Bankruptcy Judge \n \n22-10964-mg    Doc 4089    Filed 12/13/23    Entered 12/13/23 09:48:36    Main Document \nPg 23 of 23",

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: The court case involves a securities fraud class action against Quintus Corporation, a company engaged in artificial intelligence software and eCRM solutions, which became publicly traded in 1999. Following a significant drop in its stock prices due to overstated revenues and subsequent bankruptcy, the class action was consolidated, resulting in a proposed settlement of $10.1 million approved by the court, as well as an award for attorney fees and expenses. The AI aspect relates to Quintus's core business as an AI software provider, which is part of the background context rather than the central legal issue.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the proposed class settlement and allocation plan related to claims of securities fraud due to misleading financial statements should be approved as fair, reasonable, and adequate.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court granted final approval of the class settlement and the allocation plan, determining that the settlement was fair, reasonable, and adequate after considering several factors, including the risks of further litigation and the proportionality of the settlement to potential recovery.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine if you bought a toy from a company because they advertised it as the best on the market, but then you find out the company lied about how well it worked. Lots of people who bought the toy get together to tell the company they want their money back because they were tricked. After talking it over, they agree that the company will pay a certain amount of money to everyone who bought the toy. The judge looks at the deal and says, \"Yep, this seems fair,\" and then tells the people who did all the legal work that they can get paid for their time, too.",

During the class period, Quintusprovided “e-Customer Relationship Management” or “eCRM” solutions,primarily through its “eContact” software.  Quintus grew through aseries of acquisitions in 1997 through 1999.  \nAs part of an initial public offering completed November\n15, 1999, Quintus sold 5.175 million shares of Quintus common stockat $18/share.  Consistent with those heady times, the stock pricesoon reached $55/share. On February 28, 2000, Quintus announcedits intent to acquire Mustang.com, which developed corporate e-mailmanagement software.  Quintus filed a registration statement inconnection with the Mustang acquisition on March 28, 2000.\nOn November 15, 2000, its first anniversary as a publicly\ntraded company, Quintus announced that it was reviewing previouslyfiled financial statements.  The price of Quintus shares fell from$6.00/share to $2.97/share before trading was halted by NASDAQshortly after noon, representing a one-day (or less) price drop ofjust over 50%.  On November 22, 2000, Quintus announced the resultsof a financial audit, which revealed that Quintus had overstatedrevenue on several occasions.  The truth regarding Quintus’sfinancial condition continued to emerge over the next few monthsand NASDAQ delisted Quintus stock on February 16, 2001.

Doc #201.  \nThe first amended consolidated class action complaint,\nDoc #215 (CAC), alleges that false and misleading statements ofmaterial fact appeared in the Quintus IPO registration statement,the Mustang registration statement and various periodic financialreports.  Accordingly, the CAC asserts claims under sections 11,12(a)(2) and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933 (the “1933 Act”) aswell as claims under sections 10(b), 14(a)(9) and 20(a) of theSecurities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “1934 Act”).

Thecourt bears in mind the Ninth Circuit’s “strong judicial policythat favors settlement, particularly where complex class actionlitigation is concerned.”  Class Plaintiffs v City of Seattle\n, 355\nF2d 1268, 1276 (9th Cir 1992).  While no class member has objected,the court must still review the proposed settlement.  Manual forComplex Litigation (Fourth) §21.635 (“Even if there are no or fewobjections or adverse appearances before or at the fairnesshearing, the judge must ensure that there is sufficient record asto the basis and justification for the settlement”).\nThe court may approve a settlement “only after a hearing\nand on finding that the settlement * * * is fair, reasonable andadequate.”  FRCP 23(e)(1)(C).  A final approval hearing was held onDecember 5, 2006.  The Ninth Circuit has set forth the followingfactors for courts considering approval of class actionsettlements: Case 3:00-cv-04264-VRW   Document 14   Filed 12/05/06   Page 4 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n5(1) the strength of the plaintiffs’ case; (2) the risk,\nexpense, complexity, and likely duration of furtherlitigation; (3) the risk of maintaining class actionstatus throughout the trial; (4) the amount offered insettlement; (5) the extent of discovery completed and thestate of the proceedings; (6) the experience and views ofcounsel; (7) the presence of a governmental participant;and (8) the reaction of the class members to the proposedsettlement. \nChurchill Village v General Electric\n, 361 F3d 566, 575 (9th Cir\n2004).  These factors overwhelmingly support approval of the classsettlement.  The court discusses the settlement evaluation factorsthat are relevant in this case.  Id at 576 n7.\nThis settlement follows six years of protracted\nlitigation, discovery and negotiation.  Further litigation wouldrequire plaintiffs to survive motions for summary judgment and, ifsuccessful, present their case to a jury.  The considerable riskand cost associated with further litigation is enhanced byQuintus’s pending bankruptcy litigation.  This court noted early inthese proceedings that “plaintiffs are going to have troublefinding deep pockets in this case.”  Doc #85 at 37.  This globalsettlement divides the limited resources of a bankrupt corporationamong the many litigants suing Quintus.  Doc #276 at ¶ 6.  Much ofthe remaining value to be apportioned among the litigants is fromQuintus’s directors and officers liability insurance policies.  Thesettlement class, however, is receiving the “lion’s share” of theinsurance coverage.  Doc #276 at ¶46.  Weighing the risks and costsof further litigation, the court concludes that this settlement isadvisable.\nThe settlement amount, $10.1 million, closely resembles\nthe $9,996,000 settlement predicted by the Haas Study\n referenced by\nthis court in its previous order.  Quintus , 148 F Supp 2d at 985.

MukeshBajaj, Sumon C Mazumdar & Atuya Sarin, Securities Class Action\nSettlements , 43 Santa Clara L Rev 101, 116 tbl 11 (2003). \nAchieving the average settlement/PIL ratio despite having tocompete with Quintus’s bankruptcy estate for remaining resourcesindicates the fairness of this settlement to class members.\nFollowing the hearing, plaintiffs’ counsel expressed\nconcern that courts’ use of studies to predict recovery at theoutset of litigation may tend to cap recovery at that level.  Whilethe court does not discount that concern, it warrants mention thatthe Haas study data reflect a range of litigation results.  Anyindividual case may differ and differ significantly from theaverage or median results.  In any event, the obstacles to agreater recovery in this case were substantial.  Given thosedifficulties, a recovery within the average range may wellrepresent an achievement that is greater than average.  \nFinally, the absence of any objections or requests for\nexclusion among a class of this size demonstrates the overallreasonableness of this settlement.  \nThe risk and cost of further litigation, the settlement\namount and the silence of class members provide powerful evidencethat the settlement is fair, reasonable and adequate.  Accordingly,plaintiffs’ motion for final approval of the class actionsettlement is GRANTED.////Case 3:00-cv-04264-VRW   Document 14   Filed 12/05/06   Page 6 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n7III\nPlaintiffs also seek final approval of the plan of\nallocation of the settlement fund.  Doc #274.  The plan ofallocation operates as follows: \nTo the extent there are sufficient funds in the Net\nSettlement Fund, each Authorized Claimant will receive anamount equal to the Authorized Claimant’s claim.  If,however, the amount in the Net Settlement Fund is notsufficient to permit payment of the total claim of eachAuthorized Claimant, then each Authorized Claimant shallbe paid the percentage that each Authorized Claimant’sclaim bears to the total of the claims of all AuthorizedClaimants.  A claim will be computed as follows: theclaim shall be equal to the amount paid for shares ofQuintus common stock purchased or acquired by SettlementClass members during the Settlement Class Period, less:(a) the amount realized from the sale of any such sharesduring the Settlement Class Period or through February22, 2001, or $0.14 per share, whichever is greater; or(b) the number of any such shares held at the close ofbusiness on February 22, 2001, multiplied by $0.14 (theclosing price of Quintus stock on February 22, 2001).\nDoc #277 Ex A at 10.  The plan of allocation was fully described innotice letters to potential class members and no objections weresubmitted to the court or raised at the hearing.\nThe court has discretion to approve a plan of allocation\nthat is fair and reasonable.  In re Heritage Bond Litigation\n, 2005\nUS Dist LEXIS 13555 at *38 (CD Cal 2005).  “A plan of allocationthat reimburses class members based on the extent of their injuriesis generally reasonable.”  Id (quoting In re Oracle Securities\nLitigation , 1994 US Dist LEXIS 21593 at *1 (ND Cal 1994)).  Because this plan provides proportional reimbursement and\nno class member objected, the court concludes the plan ofallocation is fair and reasonable.  Accordingly, the motion forfinal approval of the plan of allocation is GRANTED.Case 3:00-cv-04264-VRW   Document 14   Filed 12/05/06   Page 7 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n8IV\nLead plaintiff and his counsel seek an award of attorney\nfees and expenses totaling $1,141,978.40.  Doc #275 at 16.  Thisamount includes attorney fees of $817,500, expenses of $150,000,reimbursement of fees and expenses of bankruptcy counsel of$162,478.40 and reimbursement of $12,000 to the lead plaintiff. Id.  The fees and expenses sought amount to 11.3% of the totalsettlement amount.\nThe court preliminarily approved an award of attorney\nfees and expenses in its July 7, 2006, order.  Doc #269 at 21. This request differs by including $15,096.40 of additional fees andexpenses of bankruptcy counsel and $12,000 in reimbursement to leadplaintiff.  The court anticipated such an increase in the amountsought for bankruptcy counsel.  Id.  Lead plaintiff, however, seeksreimbursement for 80 hours of his time at a rate of $150/hour forthe first time.  Doc #276 Ex 5 at ¶¶2-3.  The court is authorizedto reimburse lead plaintiff for reasonable costs and expensesrelated to the representation of the class, including lost wages. 15 USC §78u-4(a)(4).  As a registered securities principal and theprincipal of RAMA Financial, lead plaintiff’s request forcompensation is reasonable.  Doc #276 Ex 5 at ¶3.\nThese minor increases in the amount requested do not\ndisturb the court’s prior conclusion that “the amount of attorneyfees (including those incurred by bankruptcy counsel) is relativelymodest in relation to the total class recovery.”  Doc #269 at 21. This court, however, “rejects reliance solely on a comparison ofthe percentage fee requested here with other percentage awards orwith a so-called benchmark percentage.”  In re HPL Technologies,Case 3:00-cv-04264-VRW   Document 14   Filed 12/05/06   Page 8 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n9Inc Sec Litig , 366 F Supp 2d 912, 914 (ND Cal 2005).  Instead, the\ncourt employs a lodestar cross-check to determine thereasonableness of the requested attorney fees.\n“Three figures are salient in a lodestar calculation: (1)\ncounsel’s reasonable hours, (2) counsel’s reasonable hourly rateand (3) a multiplier thought to compensate for various factors.” Id at 919.  In performing a cross-check, the court calculates theimplied multiplier to determine its reasonableness.  Lead counselhas spent more than 5,000 attorney hours in this matter, most ofthem by senior attorneys.  Doc #275 Ex 1.  Applying the Laffey\nmatrix hourly rates, as adjusted for Los Angeles and cost of livingincreases, lead counsel calculates its lodestar as $1,976,262.50. Id at 12 and Ex 1.  The requested attorney fees of $817,500, lessthan half the lodestar, provide an implied lodestar multiplier of0.414.  Id at 13.  This multiplier is indeed reasonable, indicatingclass members obtained a significant discount on market attorneyrates.  Notably, competitive selection of class counsel producedthis low loadstar ratio or negative multiplier.  Quintus\n, 148 F\nSupp 2d 967.  Despite any statutory limitation on use ofcompetitive selection, see In re Cavanaugh\n, 306 F3d 726 (9th Cir\n2002), this provides further evidence that courts may look to thecompetitive selection cases in determining a reasonable level offees and costs.  See In re Cabletron, Inc Securities Litigation\n,\n2006 US Dist LEXIS 75188 (D NH 2006).\nThe requested attorney fees and expenses are reasonable\ncompensation for the value provided to the class.  This is furtherevidenced by the lack of class member objections to thepreliminarily approved attorney fees and expenses included in theCase 3:00-cv-04264-VRW   Document 14   Filed 12/05/06   Page 9 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n10\nclass notice.\nAccordingly, the application for award of attorney fees\nand reimbursement of expenses is GRANTED.\nIT IS SO ORDERED.\n                                   \nVAUGHN R WALKERUnited States District Chief JudgeCase 3:00-cv-04264-VRW   Document 14   Filed 12/05/06   Page 10 of 10",

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: This court opinion from the United States District Court for the Northern District of California involves a securities fraud class action lawsuit against Quintus Corporation. The case consolidates claims that Quintus made false and misleading financial statements, resulting in a significant financial loss for shareholders. The court approved a settlement of $10.1 million to be distributed among the class members, alongside the payment of attorney fees and expenses, following recognition of the company's AI-driven business dealings and associated financial misreporting during Quintus's growth period. The case involved artificial intelligence in that Quintus was an AI software company, which later offered e-Customer Relationship Management solutions.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: The primary legal issue centers on whether the proposed settlement of the securities fraud class action against Quintus Corporation is fair, reasonable, and adequate for the shareholders who suffered losses due to alleged financial misrepresentation.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court held that the settlement is fair, reasonable, and adequate. The settlement amount was approved along with the planned allocation of funds and associated attorney fees and expenses. The court emphasized the absence of objections from class members and the complexity and risks involved in continuing litigation as considerations favoring the settlement.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine if your favorite toy company said they had more money than they actually did because they used tricky math on their reports. People who bought the company’s stock based on that bad information lost lots of money when the truth came out, and the stock price crashed. So, a group of those people decided to sue the company to get back some of their money. In this case, everyone agreed on an amount that the company would pay to settle the fight, and the judge said, \"Well, since no one is complaining, and continuing to fight might be risky and expensive, this sounds like a good deal, so I approve.” That’s basically what happened here.",

Accordingly,plaintiffs’ motion for final approval of the class actionsettlement is GRANTED.////Case 3:01-cv-00932-VRW   Document 13   Filed 12/05/06   Page 6 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n7III\nPlaintiffs also seek final approval of the plan of\nallocation of the settlement fund.  Doc #274.  The plan ofallocation operates as follows: \nTo the extent there are sufficient funds in the Net\nSettlement Fund, each Authorized Claimant will receive anamount equal to the Authorized Claimant’s claim.  If,however, the amount in the Net Settlement Fund is notsufficient to permit payment of the total claim of eachAuthorized Claimant, then each Authorized Claimant shallbe paid the percentage that each Authorized Claimant’sclaim bears to the total of the claims of all AuthorizedClaimants.  A claim will be computed as follows: theclaim shall be equal to the amount paid for shares ofQuintus common stock purchased or acquired by SettlementClass members during the Settlement Class Period, less:(a) the amount realized from the sale of any such sharesduring the Settlement Class Period or through February22, 2001, or $0.14 per share, whichever is greater; or(b) the number of any such shares held at the close ofbusiness on February 22, 2001, multiplied by $0.14 (theclosing price of Quintus stock on February 22, 2001).\nDoc #277 Ex A at 10.  The plan of allocation was fully described innotice letters to potential class members and no objections weresubmitted to the court or raised at the hearing.\nThe court has discretion to approve a plan of allocation\nthat is fair and reasonable.  In re Heritage Bond Litigation\n, 2005\nUS Dist LEXIS 13555 at *38 (CD Cal 2005).  “A plan of allocationthat reimburses class members based on the extent of their injuriesis generally reasonable.”  Id (quoting In re Oracle Securities\nLitigation , 1994 US Dist LEXIS 21593 at *1 (ND Cal 1994)).  Because this plan provides proportional reimbursement and\nno class member objected, the court concludes the plan ofallocation is fair and reasonable.  Accordingly, the motion forfinal approval of the plan of allocation is GRANTED.Case 3:01-cv-00932-VRW   Document 13   Filed 12/05/06   Page 7 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n8IV\nLead plaintiff and his counsel seek an award of attorney\nfees and expenses totaling $1,141,978.40.  Doc #275 at 16.  Thisamount includes attorney fees of $817,500, expenses of $150,000,reimbursement of fees and expenses of bankruptcy counsel of$162,478.40 and reimbursement of $12,000 to the lead plaintiff. Id.  The fees and expenses sought amount to 11.3% of the totalsettlement amount.\nThe court preliminarily approved an award of attorney\nfees and expenses in its July 7, 2006, order.  Doc #269 at 21. This request differs by including $15,096.40 of additional fees andexpenses of bankruptcy counsel and $12,000 in reimbursement to leadplaintiff.  The court anticipated such an increase in the amountsought for bankruptcy counsel.  Id.  Lead plaintiff, however, seeksreimbursement for 80 hours of his time at a rate of $150/hour forthe first time.  Doc #276 Ex 5 at ¶¶2-3.  The court is authorizedto reimburse lead plaintiff for reasonable costs and expensesrelated to the representation of the class, including lost wages. 15 USC §78u-4(a)(4).  As a registered securities principal and theprincipal of RAMA Financial, lead plaintiff’s request forcompensation is reasonable.  Doc #276 Ex 5 at ¶3.\nThese minor increases in the amount requested do not\ndisturb the court’s prior conclusion that “the amount of attorneyfees (including those incurred by bankruptcy counsel) is relativelymodest in relation to the total class recovery.”  Doc #269 at 21. This court, however, “rejects reliance solely on a comparison ofthe percentage fee requested here with other percentage awards orwith a so-called benchmark percentage.”  In re HPL Technologies,Case 3:01-cv-00932-VRW   Document 13   Filed 12/05/06   Page 8 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n9Inc Sec Litig , 366 F Supp 2d 912, 914 (ND Cal 2005).  Instead, the\ncourt employs a lodestar cross-check to determine thereasonableness of the requested attorney fees.\n“Three figures are salient in a lodestar calculation: (1)\ncounsel’s reasonable hours, (2) counsel’s reasonable hourly rateand (3) a multiplier thought to compensate for various factors.” Id at 919.  In performing a cross-check, the court calculates theimplied multiplier to determine its reasonableness.  Lead counselhas spent more than 5,000 attorney hours in this matter, most ofthem by senior attorneys.  Doc #275 Ex 1.  Applying the Laffey\nmatrix hourly rates, as adjusted for Los Angeles and cost of livingincreases, lead counsel calculates its lodestar as $1,976,262.50. Id at 12 and Ex 1.  The requested attorney fees of $817,500, lessthan half the lodestar, provide an implied lodestar multiplier of0.414.  Id at 13.  This multiplier is indeed reasonable, indicatingclass members obtained a significant discount on market attorneyrates.  Notably, competitive selection of class counsel producedthis low loadstar ratio or negative multiplier.  Quintus\n, 148 F\nSupp 2d 967.  Despite any statutory limitation on use ofcompetitive selection, see In re Cavanaugh\n, 306 F3d 726 (9th Cir\n2002), this provides further evidence that courts may look to thecompetitive selection cases in determining a reasonable level offees and costs.  See In re Cabletron, Inc Securities Litigation\n,\n2006 US Dist LEXIS 75188 (D NH 2006).\nThe requested attorney fees and expenses are reasonable\ncompensation for the value provided to the class.  This is furtherevidenced by the lack of class member objections to thepreliminarily approved attorney fees and expenses included in theCase 3:01-cv-00932-VRW   Document 13   Filed 12/05/06   Page 9 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n10\nclass notice.\nAccordingly, the application for award of attorney fees\nand reimbursement of expenses is GRANTED.\nIT IS SO ORDERED.\n                                   \nVAUGHN R WALKERUnited States District Chief JudgeCase 3:01-cv-00932-VRW   Document 13   Filed 12/05/06   Page 10 of 10",

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: Andrew Perrong filed a lawsuit against QuoteWizard.com, LLC under the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA) for allegedly making unauthorized pre-recorded telemarketing calls using an automated system. Perrong claims he received an unsolicited call from an AI-generated \"Avatar\" without his consent, which he traced back to QuoteWizard after receiving a subsequent email from Geico referencing their \"partner site.\" The court denied QuoteWizard's motion to dismiss, finding the complaint sufficiently alleged potential TCPA violations and fulfilled procedural requirements.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the plaintiff’s allegations were sufficient to establish standing and a plausible claim for relief under the TCPA against QuoteWizard based on the receipt of unsolicited, automated telemarketing calls.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court denied QuoteWizard's motion to dismiss, concluding that Perrong's complaint adequately alleged a violation of the TCPA, and he sufficiently demonstrated standing by establishing a concrete injury traceable to QuoteWizard's business activities, with the possibility of redress through legal action.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine you got an annoying phone call from a robot voice trying to sell you something, which you didn’t ask for. A man named Andrew got such a call and tracked where it came from. He then sued the company (QuoteWizard) behind it, saying, \"Stop calling me like this! It’s illegal.\" QuoteWizard tried to get the court to throw out Andrew's complaint, but the judge said, \"Nope, Andrew's complaint is good enough to consider, so we’re not dismissing it.\"",

August   26  , 2020 \n \n \n      \n     Presently before the Court are Defendant’s Motion to \nDismiss pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. Nos. 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6) \nfor lack of standing and failure to state a plausible claim for \nrelief against them (Doc. No. 16), Plaintiff’s Response in \nOpposition (Doc. No. 17), and Defendant’s Sur-Reply in further \nsupport thereof.  (Doc. No. 18).  For the following reasons, the \nCourt will deny the Motion to Dismiss. \nFactual Background \n     This case was initiated by the plaintiff, Andrew Perrong, a \nPennsylvania resident against Quotewizard.com, LLC Case 2:20-cv-02506-JCJ   Document 19   Filed 08/26/20   Page 1 of 13(QuoteWizard), a Delaware limited liability corporation with its \nprincipal place of business in Seattle, WA, pursuant to the \nTelephone Consumer Protection Act, 47 U.S.C. Section 227 \n(“TCPA”).  In his Complaint, Plaintiff alleges that the TCPA, \nwhich renders it unlawful to “make any call (other than a call \nmade for emergency purposes or made with the prior express \nconsent of the called party) using an automated telephone \ndialing system or an artificial or pre-recorded voice … ,” was \nenacted to prevent nuisance telemarketing calls and that \nDefendant, a telemarketer, sent a pre-recorded message to him \nwithout consent.  (Pl’s Compl., paragraphs 1-3).  Plaintiff \nfurther avers that because telemarketing campaigns generally \nresult in the placement of “hundreds of thousands or even \nmillions” of calls to “potential customers en masse,” he \ntherefore is endeavoring to bring this action on behalf of a \nnationwide class of individuals who have received similar \nillegal calls “from or on behalf of Defendant.”  (Compl., para. \n3).  Plaintiff submits that this Court has federal question \njurisdiction over this matter pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Section 1331 \nand that venue is proper in this district as he resides here and \nthe telemarketing call to him was placed here. \n     As to the particulars of his own claim, Plaintiff alleges \nthat on April 17, 2020 at 3:02 p.m., he received one of these \nprohibited calls from an “Avatar,” which identified itself as Case 2:20-cv-02506-JCJ   Document 19   Filed 08/26/20   Page 2 of 13“Danny” with “Cheap Insurance Rates Online.”  (Compl., para. \n23).  Plaintiff responded to the prompts from the “Avatar”  in \nan effort to receive a follow-up call as he suspected that \n“Cheap Insurance Rates Online” was not the true company behind \nthe call.  (Compl., 30).  Plaintiff provided the Avatar with \nfalse vehicle information and a mis-transcribed name – “Andy \nTerrong,” and requested a follow-up to the call.  Plaintiff \navers that he provided this incorrect information so that if \nthere were a follow-up, he would be able to discern that the \npreliminary information was gathered during this particular \nphone call.  (Compl., para. 32).  Approximately three hours \nlater, Plaintiff received an email from Geico Insurance Company  \naddressed to Andy Terrong and stating that Geico had received \nhis information from its “partner site, QuoteWizard.”  (Compl., \npara. 34).  Plaintiff alleges that he has never submitted any \ninformation to QuoteWizard’s website.  (Compl., para. 35). \n     By his Complaint, Plaintiff claims that he, along with \npotentially “hundreds of thousands or even millions”1 of others       \nsuffered injury by being “temporarily deprived of the use of \ntheir phones because the phone line was tied up … and their \n \n1  Specifically, in paragraph 3, Plaintiff avers: “Because telemarketing \ncampaigns generally place calls to hundreds of thousands or even millions of \npotential customers en masse, the Plaintiff brings this action on behalf of \nproposed nationwide class of other persons who received illegal telemarketing \ncalls from or on behalf of Defendant.”           \n Case 2:20-cv-02506-JCJ   Document 19   Filed 08/26/20   Page 3 of 13privacy was improperly invaded,” and because the calls were \nfrustrating, obnoxious, annoying, a nuisance and disturbed their \nsolitude.  (Compl., para. 36).  Plaintiff therefore seeks to \nbring this action on behalf of a class of individuals impacted \nby pre-recorded calls from Defendant pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. \n23(b)(2) and/or (b)(3).  He seeks both injunctive relief \nprohibiting the defendant from placing telephone calls using a \npre-recorded voice and monetary damages in the amount of $500 \nfor each violation of the TCPA.  (Compl., para. 63).  In \nresponse, Defendant QuoteWizard moves to dismiss this matter in \nits entirety on the grounds that Plaintiff lacks standing and \nhis complaint fails to state a claim upon which relief may be \ngranted.  \nStandards Governing Motions to Dismiss \n     Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b) offers a variety of means by which a \nDefendant may seek dismissal of an action against it and motions \nto dismiss on the pleadings pursuant to Rule 12(b) are often \nconfused with one another. Mortensen v. First Federal Savings & \nLoan Assoc., 549 F.2d 884, 890 (3d Cir. 1977).  “The basic \ndifference among the various 12(b) motions is … that 12(b)(6) \nalone necessitates a ruling on the merits of the claim [and] the \nothers deal with procedural defects.”  Id, at 891.   Rule \n12(b)(6) permits dismissal of a complaint for “failure to state \na claim upon which relief can be granted” and “[t]he question is Case 2:20-cv-02506-JCJ   Document 19   Filed 08/26/20   Page 4 of 13not whether plaintiffs will ultimately prevail but whether the \ncomplaint was sufficient to cross the federal court’s threshold” \nrequiring that it contain “well-pled factual allegations which, \ntaken as true, are enough to raise a right to relief above the \nspeculative level.”  Renfro v. Unisys Corp., 671 F.3d 314, 320 \n(3d Cir. 2011)(quoting Skinner v. Switzer , 562 U.S. 521, 530, \n131 S. Ct. 1289, 1296, 179 L. Ed.2d 233 (2011) and Bell Atlantic \nv. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 556, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed.2d 929 \n(2007)).  In determining whether to grant a motion to dismiss, a \nfederal court must construe the complaint liberally, accept all \nfactual allegations in the complaint as true, and determine \nwhether, under any reasonable reading of the complaint, the \nplaintiff may be entitled to relief.  Cheney v. Daily News, \nL.P., No. 15-2251, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13183, 654 Fed. Appx. \n578, 580 (3d Cir. July 19, 2016); Phillips v. County of \nAllegheny, 515 F.3d 224, 233 (3d Cir. 2008).   \n     “The procedure under a motion to dismiss for lack of \nsubject matter jurisdiction is quite different” and a 12(b)(1) \nmotion may attack the complaint on its face (facial attack) or \nmay challenge the existence of subject matter jurisdiction quite \napart from the pleadings (factual attack).  Mortensen, 549 F.2d \nat 891.  As a facial attack questions the sufficiency of the \npleadings, “the court must only consider the allegations of the \ncomplaint and documents referenced therein and attached thereto, Case 2:20-cv-02506-JCJ   Document 19   Filed 08/26/20   Page 5 of 13in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.”  Gould \nElectronics, Inc. v. United States, 220 F.3d 169, 176 (3d Cir. \n2000).  When a defendant attacks subject matter jurisdiction “in \nfact” (meaning it disputes the existence of certain \njurisdictional facts alleged by the plaintiff), the Court is \nfree to weigh the evidence and satisfy itself whether it has \npower to hear the case.  Carpet Group International v. Oriental \nRug Importers Association, 227 F.3d 62, 69 (3d Cir. 2000), \noverruled in part on other grounds, Animal Science Products, \nInc. v. China Minmetals Corp., 654 F.3d 462 (3d Cir. 2011).  “In \nthat situation, ‘no presumptive truthfulness attaches to \nplaintiff’s allegations, and the existence of disputed material \nfacts will not preclude the trial court from evaluating for \nitself the merits of jurisdictional claims.’”  Id, at 70 \n(quoting Mortensen, supra, at 891).  A plaintiff bears the \nburden of demonstrating subject matter jurisdiction.  McNutt v. \nGeneral Motors Acceptance Corp., 298 U.S. 178, 183, 56 S. Ct. \n780, 782, 80 L. Ed.2d 1135 (1936); Lightfoot v. United States, \n564 F.3d 625, 627 (3d Cir. 2009).  And “named plaintiffs who \nrepresent a class ‘must allege and show that they personally \nhave been injured, not that injury has been suffered by other, \nunidentified members of the class to which they belong and which \nthey purport to represent.’” Lewis v. Casey, 518 U.S. 343, 357, \n116 S. Ct. 2174, 2183, 135 L. Ed.2d 606 (1996) (quoting Simon v. Case 2:20-cv-02506-JCJ   Document 19   Filed 08/26/20   Page 6 of 13Eastern Ky. Welfare Rights Organization, 426 U.S. 26, 40, 96 S. \nCt. 1917, 48 L. Ed.2d 450 (1976) and Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. \n490, 502, 95 S. Ct. 2197, 45 L. Ed.2d 343 (1975)).  \nDiscussion \n     As noted, Defendant moves to dismiss Plaintiff’s proposed \nclass action complaint on the grounds that it fails to (1) \nallege sufficient grounds to establish subject matter \njurisdiction on its face, and (2) to show that he has a \nplausible claim for relief against the defendant.  Turning first \nto Defendant’s motion under Rule 12(b)(1), we find that it is a \nfacial attack, the substance of which is Plaintiff’s alleged \nfailure to allege any connection between Defendant QuoteWizard \nand the purportedly illegal phone call placed to Plaintiff.  \nThus, according to Defendant, Plaintiff cannot establish the \nrequisite Article III standing to proceed further.   \n     “Article III of the Constitution limits the scope of the \nFederal judicial power to the adjudication of ‘cases’ or \n‘controversies.’”  In re Schering-Plough Corp., 678 F.3d 235, \n244 (3d Cir. 2012)(quoting Allen v. Wright, 468 U.S. 737, 750, \n104 S. Ct. 3315, 82 L. Ed.2d 556 (1984)).  In turn, “[t]he \ncourts have developed several justiciability doctrines to \nenforce the case-or-controversy requirement,” the most \nsignificant of which is the requirement that a “litigant have \n‘standing’ to invoke the power of a federal court.”  Id.  “The Case 2:20-cv-02506-JCJ   Document 19   Filed 08/26/20   Page 7 of 13plaintiff bears the burden of meeting the ‘irreducible \nconstitutional minimum’ of Article III standing by establishing \nthree elements:  \nFirst, the plaintiff must have suffered an injury in fact – \nan invasion of a legally protected interest which is (a) \nconcrete and particularized and (b) actual or imminent, not \nconjectural or hypothetical.  Second, there must be a \ncausal connection between the injury and the conduct \ncomplained of – the injury has to be fairly traceable to \nthe challenged action of the defendant, and not the result \nof the independent action of some third party not before \nthe court.  Third, it must be likely, as opposed to merely \nspeculative, that the injury will be redressed by a \nfavorable decision.   \n \nId,(quoting Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560-\n61, 112 S. Ct. 2130, 119 L. Ed.2d 351 (1992)).  Here, the \nlegally protected interest which Plaintiff submits was invaded \narises out of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, 47 U.S.C. \nSection 227 (TCPA), subsections (b)(1)(A)(iii) and (b)(1)(B), in \nparticular. Specifically, those subsections read as follows in \nrelevant part: \n (b)  Restrictions on use of automated telephone equipment. \n(1) Prohibitions.  It shall be unlawful for any person \nwithin the United States, or any person outside the \nUnited States if the recipient is within the United \nStates – \n \n(A) to make any call (other than a call made for \nemergency purposes or made with the prior \nexpress consent of the called party) using \nany automatic telephone dialing system or an \nartificial or prerecorded voice –  \n \n(iii) to any telephone number assigned to a \npaging service, cellular telephone service, Case 2:20-cv-02506-JCJ   Document 19   Filed 08/26/20   Page 8 of 13specialized mobile radio service, or other \nradio common carrier service, or any service \nfor which the called party is charged for \nthe call, unless such call is made solely to \ncollect a debt owed to or guaranteed by the \nUnited States;  \n \n         … \n \n(B) to initiate any telephone call to any \nresidential telephone line using an \nartificial or prerecorded voice to deliver a \nmessage without the prior express consent of \nthe called party, unless the call is \ninitiated for emergency purposes, is made \nsolely pursuant to the collection of a debt \nowed to or guaranteed by the United States, \nor is exempted by rule or order by the \nCommission under paragraph (2)(B).  \n      \n     Under Section 227(b)(3), a private right to initiate a \nlegal action in an appropriate court based on a violation of the \nstatute or any regulations promulgated thereunder is conferred \non “a person or entity” … “to enjoin such violation” … “or to \nrecover for actual monetary loss from such a violation, or to \nreceive $500 in damages for each such violation, whichever is \ngreater,” or both.  47 U.S.C. Section 227(b)(3)(A) – (C).  “To \nstate a cause of action under the TCPA, a plaintiff must allege \nthat (1) a call was made; (2) the caller used an Automatic \nTelephone Dialing System or artificial or prerecorded voice; (3) \nthe telephone number called was assigned to a cellular telephone \nservice” [or residential telephone line]; “and (4) the caller \ndid not have prior express written consent of the recipient.”  Case 2:20-cv-02506-JCJ   Document 19   Filed 08/26/20   Page 9 of 13Shelton v. National Gas & Electric, LLC, Civ. A. No. 17-4063, \n2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 59235, 2019 WL 1506378 at *25 (E.D. Pa. \nApril 5, 2019); Richardson v. Verde Energy USA, Inc., Civ. A. \nNo. 15-6325, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 175642 at *5 (E.D. Pa. Dec. \n19, 2016)(citing 47 U.S.C. Section 227(b)(1)(A)(iii) and 47 \nC.F.R. Section 64.1200(a)(1)).   \n     In application of all of the preceding principles to \nthe matter now before us, we find Plaintiff’s Complaint \nsufficiently alleges facts which, assumed to be true, \nestablish Article III standing and state a cause of action \nunder the TCPA against Defendant upon which relief could be \ngranted.  In particular, Plaintiff avers that his \nresidential telephone number is on the National Do Not Call \nregistry and he has never consented to the receipt of pre-\nrecorded, computer-generated telephone marketing calls but \nthat despite his registry, on April 17, 2020, he received a \npre-recorded call on that phone line from a computer-\ngenerated artificial intelligence-created Avatar called \n“Danny” from “Cheap Insurance Rates Online.”  (Pl’s Compl., \npara. 3, 26-29).  Plaintiff’s complaint further alleges \nthat, in the hope of learning the identity of the entity \nbehind the call, he interacted with the Avatar and, after \nconfirming his contact information, provided it with \ncertain, distinctive but false information: that he was the Case 2:20-cv-02506-JCJ   Document 19   Filed 08/26/20   Page 10 of 13owner of a 2010 Ford Explorer and that his name was “Andy \nTerrong.” (Compl., para. 30-32).  Plaintiff contends that \nhe did this because he feared that providing it with true \ndata would lead to the company initiating the call to deny \nthat it had ever been made and because he believed that the \ndistinctive mis-information which he supplied would make \nany follow-up contacts that he received traceable.  \n(Compl., para. 31-32).  Some three hours later, Plaintiff \navers that he did in fact receive an email solicitation \nfrom Geico Insurance Co. with the quote addressed to “Andy \nTerrong” and advising that it was contacting him because he \nhad provided his information to Geico’s “partner site, \nQuoteWizard.”  (Compl., para. 33-34).  The Complaint avers \nthat Plaintiff never provided any information to \nQuoteWizard’s website and that QuoteWizard is in the \nbusiness of selling leads to insurance agents and providing \nthose agents with potential customers and new business, \nthat to generate new leads, it relies on telemarketing and \nthat one of the telemarketing strategies used by Defendant \nis “the use of pre-recorded telemarketing calls to solicit \npotential customers either directly or via third party \nvendors which it retains to make telemarketing calls on its \nbehalf.”  (Compl., para. 22-24, 35).  Finally, Plaintiff \nalleges that he and other call recipients were harmed by Case 2:20-cv-02506-JCJ   Document 19   Filed 08/26/20   Page 11 of 13this and similar calls in that they were deprived of the \nlegitimate use of their phones, albeit temporarily, and \nbecause the calls were a nuisance, annoying, frustrating, \nobnoxious and disrupted their solitude.  (Compl., para. \n36). \n     We find that these allegations clearly comport with \nthe pleading requirements set forth in the TCPA and more \nclearly outlined in the Shelton and Richardson cases.  We \ntherefore find no merit whatsoever in Defendant’s argument \nthat the complaint fails to state a viable and factually \nplausible claim upon which relief may be granted and for \nthis reason, the motion to dismiss pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. \nP. 12(b)(6) is denied.   \n     We likewise find that the Complaint more than \nadequately alleges that Plaintiff, and potentially a class \nof similarly situated individuals, suffered an invasion of \ntheir legally protected interest as codified in the TCPA  \nand thus suffered a concrete and particularized, non-\nhypothetical injury in fact and that the complaint contains \nenough factual averments to make out a causal connection \nbetween the defendant identified here – QuoteWizard, and \nthe complained-of telephone solicitation such that the \nplaintiff’s injury can be said to be fairly traceable to \nQuoteWizard’s business activity.  Accordingly, the Case 2:20-cv-02506-JCJ   Document 19   Filed 08/26/20   Page 12 of 13requisite nexus between the April 17, 2020 call to \nPlaintiff and the Defendant’s action (as opposed to a third \nparty not before the Court) has been sufficiently pled.  \nThird, given that the relief sought by Plaintiff is that \nprescribed by the statute itself, we find that it is indeed \nlikely, as opposed to merely speculative, that the alleged \ninjury will be redressed by a favorable decision.  As a \nconsequence, Plaintiff has adequately alleged facts which, \ntaken as true, would confer standing to sue upon him \npursuant to Article III.  The motion to dismiss under Rule \n12(b)(1) is therefore also properly denied. \nConclusion \n For all of the above-stated reasons, Defendant’s \nMotions to Dismiss pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1) and \n(12(b)(6) are denied.   \n     An Order follows. \n  Case 2:20-cv-02506-JCJ   Document 19   Filed 08/26/20   Page 13 of 13",

    "summary": "1. **Summary:** This case involves the plaintiffs—League of Women Voters of New Hampshire and others—seeking a preliminary injunction against defendants, including Steve Kramer and associated companies, for distributing AI-generated robocalls impersonating President Biden before the New Hampshire Primary. The AI technology was used to create a deepfake audio to mislead voters. The plaintiffs allege violations of the Voting Rights Act and other laws, but the magistrate judge recommended denying the injunction due to lack of standing, inadequate demonstration of irreparable harm, and the vague and broad nature of the proposed injunction.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue:** Whether a preliminary injunction should be granted against the defendants to prevent them from generating and distributing AI-created robocalls impersonating others without consent and to ensure compliance with communication laws.\n\n3. **Court's Holding:** The magistrate judge recommends denying the preliminary injunction as the plaintiffs lack standing to seek the injunctive relief, have not shown they would suffer irreparable harm, and the proposed injunction is overly broad and vague, failing to comply with specific legal standards.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation:** Imagine you wanted to stop someone from using a fake voice program to make prank calls pretending to be a famous person. A group complained to the court asking for an emergency stop to these calls. The judge decided not to grant it because the group didn't show they'd be harmed in the future, their way of preventing it was too unclear, and they didn't have a direct enough reason to demand such a stop.",

Civil No.   24-cv-073-SM-TSM  \n \nSTEVE KRAMER, ET AL.  \n  \n \nREPORT AND RECOMMENDATION  \n This case arose from prerecorded telephone messages,  robocalls,  falsified through the use \nof artificial intelligence to sound like President Biden , that were sent to thousands of New \nHampshire potential voters on January 21, 2024, just before the New Hampshire Primary. \nPlaintiffs, the League of Women Voters of New Hampshire , the League of Women Voters of the \nUnited States , and three New Hampshire voters who received the robocalls, brought suit against \nSteve Kramer, who  devised the hoax and commissioned the creation of  the robocalls, and Voice \nBroadc asting  Corporation , Life Broadcasting  Corporation , and Lingo  Telecom, LLC, who \nprovided services to distribute  the robocalls, alleging  violations of federal and state law . Plaintiffs \nmove for a nationwide preliminary injunction  (doc. no. 71) to bar defendants from distributing \nfalsified communications and from distributing all mass communications that do not comply with \nstate and federal law.  \n Plaintiffs initiated this action in March 2024, alleging  claims that defendants violated the \nVoting Rights Act, the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, and New Hampshire Elections Laws, \nNH RSA 664:14 -a and 644:14 -b. Plaintiffs subsequently filed an amended complaint (doc. no. 65) \nin which they added Voice Broadcasting as a defendant. Default was entered against Kramer on  \nAugust 29, 2024 . Doc. no. 92.  Case 1:24-cv-00073-SM-TSM     Document 99     Filed 09/19/24     Page 1 of 15 \n2  Plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction1 and then filed an amended motion (doc. nos. \n47 and 71), and defendants (other than Kramer) moved to dismiss the lawsuit (doc. no. 79). The \nUnited States filed a “Statement of Interest,” pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 517, specifically addressing \nthe interpretation of Section 11(b) of the Voting Rights Act, 52 U.S.C. § 10307(b) . Doc.  no. 86. \nThe Coolidge -Reagan Foundation filed a motion to file an amicus brief  in support of the motion \nto dismiss . Doc. no. 97. \n Only plaintiffs’ amended motion for a preliminary injunction (doc. no . 71) is referred and \ncurrently before the undersigned magistrate judge  for a report and recommendation . See 28 U.S.C. \n§ 636(b)(1)(B) ; LR 72.1.  The court held a hearing on the motion on July 31, 2024. Before the \nhearing, the parties filed a stipulation of facts along with documents in support of and in opposition \nto the motion for a preliminary injunction. Doc. no. 87.  For the reasons that follow , the district \njudge should deny the motion for a preliminary injunction.  \n \nBACKGROUND  \nRobocalls  \n Steve Kramer is a political consultant who provided services , including automated calls,  to \npolitical campaigns.  Kramer previously  worked with Paul Carpenter to create false audio \nrecordings through artificial intelligence (“AI”) . In November 2023, Kramer  asked if Carpenter \ncould create an AI -generated voice recording of President Biden, and Carpenter said that he could. \nOn January 19, 2024 , just days before the New Hampshire Primary, Kramer provided a script to \nCarpenter, and Carpenter created an AI generated recording, mimicking President Biden’s voice, \nof the following message:  \n \n1 At the July 31, 2024 hearing, Plaintiffs orally withdrew the original motion for a preliminary \ninjunction (doc. no. 47), which should be terminated.  Case 1:24-cv-00073-SM-TSM     Document 99     Filed 09/19/24     Page 2 of 15 \n3 This coming Tuesday is the New Hampshire Presidential Preference Primary. \nRepublicans have been trying to push nonpartisan and Democratic voters to \nparticipate in their primary. What a bunch of malarkey. We know the value of \nvoting Democratic when our vote s count. It’s important that you save your vote for \nthe November election. We’ll need your help in electing Democrats up and down \nthe ticket. Voting this Tuesday only enables the Republicans in their quest to elect \nDonald Trump again. Your vote makes a dif ference in November, not this Tuesday.  \n \nDoc. no. 71-3, at 3  (“Fake Message”) .  \n Kramer needed a caller  identification  (“ID”)  number  for the Fake Message  to distribute it \nto New Hampshire voters , and he wanted to use the New Hampshire area code, 603 , to make it \nmore likely that the call would be answered . He decided to use the telephone number of Kathy \nSullivan, who was associated with President Biden’s campaign in New Hampshire , without her \npermission . He then contacted Voice Broadcasting on January 20 to set up a  robocall , using the \nFake Message , to be distributed to 25,000 numbers t he next evening, Sunday, January 21 , just two \ndays before the New Hampshire Primary . Id. at 7. Kramer instructed Voice Broadcasting to use \nKathy Sullivan’s telephone number as the caller ID for the Fake Message , and at Voice \nBroadcasting’s suggestion, agreed to add a last sentence to the Fake Message , by a different voice : \n“If you would like to be removed from future calls, please press two now. Call [personal cell phone \nof Kathy Sullivan] to be removed from future calls. ” Doc. no . 71-2, at 2.  \n Voice Broadcasting and Life Corporation are affiliated companies.  Voice Broadcasting \nused Life Corporation’s services and equipment to initiate  thousands of robocalls to telephone \nnumbers in New Hampshire. Life Corporation  also routed  calls to Lingo Telecom, which \noriginated several thousand calls. New Hampshire voters received 9,581 robocalls with the Fake \nMessage.2 Doc. no. 71-11, at 6.  \n \n2 In the FCC’s “Notice of Apparent Liability for Forfeiture ” against Lingo Telecom, the FCC \nattributes 9,581 robocalls with the Fake Message to the defendants. Plaintiffs assert that Lingo  \nTelecom  originated and provided A -level attestation to 13,235 robocalls, which is apparently based Case 1:24-cv-00073-SM-TSM     Document 99     Filed 09/19/24     Page 3 of 15 \n4 Impact of Robocalls on Plaintiffs  \n The three individual plaintiffs in this case, Nancy Marashio , James Fieseher , and Patricia \nGingrich , are registered voters in New Hampshire. They each received the Fake Message robocall \non January 21, 2024. Each individual plaintiff realized that the message was not from President \nBiden or his campaign and that the message was false. Each individual plaintiff voted in the \nPrimary despite having received the Fake Message  robocall . \n The organizational plaintiffs are the League of Women Voters of the United States and the \nLeague of Women Voters of New Hampshire . The y refer to themselves collectively as “the \nLeague,” and,  to the extent necessary, with suffixes of “US” and “NH”.  Doc. no. 71-1, at 17 -18. \nThe League asserts that its mission is “to encourage informed and active participation in the \ngovernment, increase understanding of major public policy issues, and influence public policy \nthrough education and advocacy.” Doc. 71-1, at 17. The League  also has a mission  “to encourage \ncitizens to register to vote, participate in elections, and engage with the civil process.” Id. \n The League -US states that in response to the Fake Message robocalls it changed its website  \nand created a new alert to inform voters about robocalls , which required diversion of staff  to make \nthose changes. The League -US also changed its “internal threat matrix” for inauthentic robocalls \nto the second -highest ranking on the threat scale. Id. at 17 -18. The League -US states generally that \nit “has expended, and continues to expend, resources providing additional guidance and training \nto staff to track inauthentic or deepfak e robocalls.” Id. at 18. The League -NH states that it is \nplanning to implement changes that will cost several hundred dollars and require more volunteer  \n  \n \non Lingo  Telecom ’s response to an FCC subpoena, but was not verified by the FCC. Doc.no. 71-\n11, at 9, n.59.  Case 1:24-cv-00073-SM-TSM     Document 99     Filed 09/19/24     Page 4 of 15 \n5 hours.  Notably, however, the League does not assert that the robocalls thwarted or otherwise \ninterfered with the organization’s mission.   \nConsequences of Robocalls for Defendants  \n The Fake Message  robocalls caused a significant amount of media coverage. Kramer \nacknowledged on February 25, 2024, that he orchestrated and sent the Fake Message robocalls. In \nMay, Kramer was indicted in four New Hampshire counties on 13 charges of felony voter \nsuppression and 13 charges of misdemeanor impersonating a candidate.  \n At the same time, the FCC investigated the Fake Message robocalls. On May 23, 2024, the \nFCC issued a “Notice of Apparent Liability for Forfeiture” to Lingo Telecom that proposed a \npenalty of $2,000,000 for violations of 47 C.F.R. § 64.6301(a) . Doc. no. 71-11, at 2. The next day, \nthe FCC issued a “Notice of Apparent Liability for Forfeiture” to Kramer that proposed a \n$6,000,000 penalty “ for perpetrating an illegal robocall campaign targeting potential New \nHampshire voters two days before the state’s 2024 Democratic Presidential Primary Election \n(Primary Election) in apparent violation of the Truth in Caller ID Act of 2009, which is codifi ed \nat section 227(e) of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (Communications Act), and [47 \nC.F.R.] § 64.1604 of our rules. ” Doc. no . 71-3, at 2. The FCC later entered a Consent Decree with \nLingo Telecom that requires Lin go Telecom  to pay a $1,000,000 civil penalty and “to implement \na robust compliance plan.” Doc. no. 91-1, at 2.  \n \nSTANDARD OF REVIEW  \n “A preliminary injunction is an ‘extraordinary’ equitable remedy that is ‘never awarded as \nof right.’” Starbucks Corp. v. McKinney , 144 S. Ct. 1570, 1576 (2024)  (quoting Winter v. Natural \nRes. Defense Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 24 (2008) ). The court will grant a motion for a preliminary \ninjunction only if the moving parties “make a clear showing that ‘[they are] likely to succeed on Case 1:24-cv-00073-SM-TSM     Document 99     Filed 09/19/24     Page 5 of 15 \n6 the merits, that [they are] likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief, that \nthe balance of equities tips in [their] favor, and that an injunction is in the public interest.’” Id. \n(quoting Winter , 555 U.S. at 20 ). Ordinarily, a  likelihood of success on the merits and irreparable \nharm are the most important factors. District 4 Lodge of the Int ’l Assoc. of Machinists & \nAerospace Workers Loc . Lodge 207 v. Raimondo , 40 F.4th 36, 39 (1st Cir. 2022) .  \n In addition, a preliminary injunction must be sufficiently  specific and  detailed to be \nenforceable.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(d) ; Axia NetMedia Corp v. Mass. Tech. Park Corp. , 889 F.3d 1, \n12-13 (1st Cir. 2018) .  “Although there is no bar against nationwide relief in federal district court \nor circuit court, such broad relief must be necessary  to give prevailing parties the relief to which \nthey are entitled.” California v. Azar , 911 F.3d 558, 582 (9th Cir. 2018) ; see also  Roe v. Dep ’t of \nDefense , 947 F.3d 207, 232 (4th Cir. 2020)  (holding district courts have equitable power to issue \nnationwide injunctions “extending relief to those who are similarly situated to the litigants ”).  \n \nDISCUSSION  \n Plaintiffs seek a  nationwide  preliminary injunction to enjoin the defendants from \nproducing , generating, and distributing AI -generated robocalls impersonating any person without \nthat person’s consent or permission and from distributing mass communications in violation of \nfederal or state law. Defendants Voice Broadcasting , Life Corporation , and Lingo Telecom all \nobject  to plaintiffs’ motion.  D efendants challeng e plaintiffs’ standing  and their showing of the \nelements necessary for a preliminary injunction . Lingo Telecom also challenges the scope of the \nproposed preliminary injunction . \nI. Standing for Injunctive Relief  \n Defendants contend that plaintiffs lack standing to seek preliminary injunctive relief. In \nsupport, they note that the individual plaintiffs realized that the Fake Message robocalls were false  Case 1:24-cv-00073-SM-TSM     Document 99     Filed 09/19/24     Page 6 of 15 \n7 and voted in the Primary  despite receiving the calls . For that reason, defendants contend that the \nindividual plaintiffs suffered no harm. They also contend that the League  suffered no harm  because \nthe organization s acted  in response to the Fake Message robocalls based on their mission . Lingo \nTelecom also contends that plaintiffs have not shown that their proposed injunction would redress \nany alleged  injury.  \n Under Article III of the United States Constitution, federal courts only have jurisdiction \nover “‘Cases’ and ‘Controversies’ — concrete disputes with consequences for the parties \ninvolved.” Loper Bright Enters. v. Raimondo , 144 S. Ct. 2244, 2257 (2024) .  A case or controversy \nexists , for purposes of standing,  when at least one plaintiff  establishes that he, she, or it “ has \nsuffered, or will suffer, an injury that is ‘concrete, particularized, and actual or imminent; fairly \ntraceable to the challenged action; and redressable by a favorable ruling. ’” Murthy v. Missouri , \n144 S. Ct. 1972, 1985 –86 (2024)  (quoting Clapper v. Amnesty Int ’l USA , 568 U.S. 398, 409 \n(2013) ). “[W] hen a plaintiff seeks prospective relief such as an injunction, the plaintiff must \nestablish a sufficient likelihood of future injury. ” Food & Drug Admin. v. All. for Hippocratic \nMed. , 602 U.S. 367, 381 (2024) . “By requiring the plaintiff to show an injury in fact, Article III \nstanding screens out plaintiffs who might have only a general legal, moral, ideological, or policy \nobjection .” Id. \nA. Individual Plaintiffs  \n The individual plaintiffs assert , for purposes of the motion for a preliminary injunction,  \nthat the Fake Message robocalls injured them  because “[t]he  loss of a vote is an actual, imminent, \nand severe injury.”3 Doc. no. 83, at 8. They state that “[t]he manipulation and intimidation alleged \n \n3 Although the individual plaintiffs are three different people, they do not distinguish among \nthemselves for purposes of showing standing.  Case 1:24-cv-00073-SM-TSM     Document 99     Filed 09/19/24     Page 7 of 15 \n8 due to the Defendants’ own actions interfered with the exercise of people’s right to vote in the \nNew Hampshire Primary.” Id. The individual plaintiffs further state that they “were harmed by \nreceiving threatening, intimidating, and coercive robocalls  – an injury plainly particular enough to \nconfer standing.” Id. at 9.  \n With respect to a likelihood of future injury to support injunctive relief, the individual \nplaintiffs argue that because defendants  have produced, generated , and distributed robocalls in the \npast, they are likely to continue that activity in the future. They point to evidence that Kramer has \nworked with Life  Corporation  on robocalls since 2010 and that Lingo  Telecom  has not stopped \nillegal robocalls in the past , despite citations . The circumstances , however,  have materially \nchanged since defendants produced, generated , and distributed the Fake Message robocalls . The \nnew circumstances undermine plaintiffs’ reliance on past actions  to show the likelihood that \ndefendants will injure the m in the future . \n Kramer is under indictment in four counties in New Hampshire for the Fake Message \nrobocalls. He is also the subject of an FCC “Notice of Apparent Liability for Forfeiture”  with a \ncivil penalty of $6,000,000. Life  Corporation  ended its relationship with Kramer, and plaintiffs \nprovided no evidence that Life  Corporation  will again accept contract work from Kramer , \nparticularly in light of his indictments and FCC liability . Lingo  Telecom  was the subject of an FCC \n“Notice of Apparent Liability for Forfeiture”  with a civil penalty of $2,000,000 that was resolved \nthrough a consent decree that requires payment of $1,000,000 and requires Lingo  Telecom  to \ncomply with laws relating to distributing robocalls. In addition, a  primary election was held in \nNew Hampshire on September 10, 2024, for state offices. Plaintiffs have not supplemented their \nmotion with evidence that defendants produced, generated, or distributed false messaging through \nrobocalls related to that election. The court is not aware of any such activity in the context of the Case 1:24-cv-00073-SM-TSM     Document 99     Filed 09/19/24     Page 8 of 15 \n9 recent primary election.  Given the current circumstances, plaintiffs have not shown a likelihood \nthat the defendants will produce, generate, and distribute false information through robocalls in \nthe future.  \n More importantly, the individual plaintiffs have not shown that they would be injured, even \nif defendants did produce, generate , and dis tribute  false information through robocalls. The \nindividual plaintiffs recognized that the Fake Message robocalls were false , and they voted despite \nreceiving the calls . Plaintiffs have not shown that they would likely be injured by a false message \nfrom defendants in the future, given their demonstrated ability to discern the falsity of the previous \nmessage and t he plainti ffs’ awareness of the possibility of false messaging  robocalls  in the future.  \n Despite their concern about the right to vote, t he individual plaintiffs  have not established \na likelihood that defendants will injur e them in the future  by interfering with their ability to vote . \nTherefore, the individual plaintiffs ha ve not established standing to pursue injunctive relief in this \ncase.  \nB. League - Organizational Standing  \n “Like an individual, an organization may not establish standing simply based on the \n‘intensity of the litigant’s interest’ or because of strong opposition to the [defendants’] conduct, . \n. .  no matter how longstanding the interest and no matter how qualif ied the organization. . . .’” \nAlliance , 602 U.S. at 394  (quoting Valley Forge  Christian College v. Am. United for Separation \nof Church & State, Inc. , 454 U.S. 464, 486 (1982) , and Sierra Club v. Morton , 405 U.S. 717, 739 \n(1972) ).  In addition, when the defendant has not caused a concrete injury, an organization cannot \nestablish standing based on its reaction to the defendant’s actions, that is, an organization “cannot \nspend its way into standing simply by expending money to gath er information and advocate against \nthe defendant’s action.” Id. Further, a diversion of organizational resources does not confer Case 1:24-cv-00073-SM-TSM     Document 99     Filed 09/19/24     Page 9 of 15 \n10 organizational standing. Id. Instead, the defendant’s actions must  have “directly affected and \ninterfered with [the plaintiff’s] core business activities.” Id. at 395 . \n The League  contend s that defendants’ Fake Message robocalls  caused harm because the \ncalls directly affected and interfered with the League’s core business “to encourage informed and \nactive participation in the government” and because the League “has been forced to divert human \nand other resources that would have gone into voter registration.” Doc. no. 83, at 10.  As to future  \ninjury, the League asserts that it “will be forced to continue these costly diversions to combat future \nillegal robocall campaigns.” Id. Thus, the League asserts that it suffered and will continue to suffer \nharm because defendants caused and will continue to cause the League to divert resources to \nrespond to false and misleading robocalls.   \n The Supreme Court , however, has held that harm arising from actions or costs incurred to \noppose the defendants’ actions does not support standing. Alliance , 602 U.S. at 394  (holding that \nmedical associations did not have standing to challenge the Food and Drug Administration’s \napproval of a drug, mifepristone, because their harm was “incurring costs to oppose FDA’s \nactions”) ; see also   Lawson v. Hargett , No. 24 -cv-538, 2024 WL 3867526, at *17 -*18 (M.D. Tenn. \nAug. 19, 2024)  (holding that the League of Women Voters of Tennessee lacked standing under \nAlliance  to challenge Tennessee voting laws based on harm that the  vagueness of the  laws made \nit more difficult to advise members and the public “how to participate in the democratic process”); \nCitizens Project v. City of Colorado Springs , No. 22 -cv-2365 -SKC -MDB, 2024 WL 3345229, at \n*5-*6 (D. Colo. July 9, 2024)  (holding that nonprofit advocacy organizations, including League \nof Women Voters of the Pikes Peak Region, lacked standing to challenge the timing of local \nelections, in part, because they were continuing to provide the same educational and outreach \nservi ces rather than new services). In contrast, actions that directly affect and interfere with an Case 1:24-cv-00073-SM-TSM     Document 99     Filed 09/19/24     Page 10 of 15 \n11 organization ’s core business and impair the organization’s ability to provide its services , such as \nwhen the defendant disseminates material misinformation to the organization that result s in the \norganization not being able to accurately  advise its customers , is harm that supports standing .  \nAlliance , 602 U.S. at 395  (discussing Havens Realty Corp. v. Coleman , 455 U.S. 363 (1982) ); see \nalso Get Loud Ark. v. Thurston , No. 24 -cv-5121, 2024 WL 4142754, at *13 ( W.D. Ark. Sept. 9, \n2024)  (holding that the “Wet Signature Rule” for voter registration injured the organization’s \nability to register voters, such as through online registration, which went beyond “indirect \npocketbook harm ”); League of Women Voters of Ohio v. LaRose , No. 23 -cv-02414, --- F. Supp. \n3d ---, 2024 WL 3495332, at *5 (N.D. Ohio July 22, 2024)  (holding League had standing to \nchallenge  state law that  prohibited assistance to disabled voters). Because the League failed to \nshow that defendants’ actions interfered with its core mission, it has not demonstrated that it \nsuffered the type of injury necessary to confer standing. Further, for the reasons discussed above \nin the context of the individual plaintiffs, the League has not shown a likelihood that it will be \nharmed in the future because of defendants’ actions.  \n Accordingly, t he district judge should deny the motion for a preliminary injunction because \nplaintiffs all lack standing to seek prospective injunctive relief in this case. Even if standing could \nbe established, however, plaintiffs have not shown that they will suffer i rreparable harm in the \nabsence of injunctive relief, and plaintiffs have not proposed a preliminary injunction that meets \nthe requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65 . Therefore, the district judge should deny \nthe motion on these bases  as well.  \nII. Irreparable Harm  \n The second requirement for a preliminary injunction is that plaintiffs will suffer irreparable \nharm in the absence of the proposed injunction .  Starbucks , 144 S. Ct. at 1576  . If plaintiffs “cannot Case 1:24-cv-00073-SM-TSM     Document 99     Filed 09/19/24     Page 11 of 15 \n12 demonstrate irreparable harm, [the court] need not discuss the other factors.” Together Employees \nv.

When “[m]oney damages would \nadequately resolve all of the alleged harms,” plaintiffs cannot show irreparable harm, even if \nplaintiffs did not allege and are not seeking money damages in the complaint. Id., at 9 & n.4.  \n Plaintiffs assert that “the Individual Plaintiffs have already been harmed by being subjected \nto Defendants’ attempted threats, intimidation, and coercion.” Doc. no. 71-1, at 29. In their reply, \nthey state that the “irreparable harm threatened here is the fundamental right to vote.” Doc. no. 83, \nat 22. Moreover, plaintiffs contend that the League will suffer irreparable harm “by being forced \nto divert resources away from its mission to defend against Defendants’ false and malicious \ntactics.” Doc. no. 71-1, at 30.  \n To the extent plaintiffs assert that defendants will cause them harm in the future in the \nabsence of injunctive relief, which is questionable under the current circumstances, they have not \nshown that any such harm would constitute irreparable  harm. The individual plaintiffs did not lose \ntheir fundamental right to vote and have not shown any likelihood that such a loss would happen \nin the future. They also have not sho wn that merely receiving the Fak e Message robocalls  \notherwise harmed them . To the extent the League would be forced to divert resources or incur \ncosts to counter the Fake Message robocalls, they have not shown those losses could not be \ncompensated with money damages.4 Further, as discussed above in the context of standing, they \nhave not shown a likelihood that the defendants will cause them harm in the future  due to changes \nin defendants’ circumstances in the aftermath of the robocalls . \n  \n \n4 If the League contends that its efforts to counter false messaging from defendants will harm \nothers because the League will be unable to put the required resources into its voter education \nmission, that harm is to third parties, not the League.  Case 1:24-cv-00073-SM-TSM     Document 99     Filed 09/19/24     Page 12 of 15 \n13  Because plaintiffs have not demonstrated irreparable harm absent an injunction, the district \njudge should deny the motion for a preliminary injunction  on that additional ground.  \nIII. Scope of Proposed Injunctive Relief  \n Lingo Telecom contends that plaintiffs’  proposed preliminary injunction cannot issue  for \nthe additional reasons that  it is overbroad and vague. Every injunction must, among other things, \n“[s]tate its terms specifically” and “describe in reasonable detail  – and not by referring to the \ncomplaint or other document  – the act or acts restrained or required.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(d)(1) (B) \n& (C). The requirements that an injunction be specific and include reasonable detail were \n“designed to prevent uncertainty and confusion on the part of those faced with injunctive  orders, \nand to avoid the possible founding of a contempt citation on a decree too vague to be understood.” \nSchmidt v Lessard , 414 U.S. 473, 476 (1974) .  In the instant case, plaintiffs’ proposed relief does \nnot fall within these parameters.  \n Plaintiffs propose a preliminary injunction with the following terms:  \n1. Defendants are enjoined until further order of this Court from producing, \ngenerating, or distributing AI -generated robocalls impersonating any person, \nwithout that person’s express, prior written consent.  \n \n2.  Defendants are enjoined until further order of this Court from distributing \nspoofed  telephone calls, text messages, or any other form of spoofed \ncommunication, without  the express, prior written consent of the individual or \nentity upon whose half the  communication is being sent.  \n \n3. Defendants are enjoined until further order of this Court from distributing \ntelephone  calls, text messages, or other mass communications that do not fully \ncomply with all  applicable state and federal laws or that are made for an \nunlawful purpose.  \n \nDoc. no.  71-31, at 1 -2. The proposed injunction does not include definitions of the terms used,  \nsome of which appear to be unclear or ambiguous, such as “AI -generated,” “spoofed ,” “applicable  \n  Case 1:24-cv-00073-SM-TSM     Document 99     Filed 09/19/24     Page 13 of 15 \n14 state and federal laws,” and “unlawful purpose.” The lack of definitions renders the proposed \ninjunction too vague to comply with Rule 65(d)(1) .  \n In addition, paragraph 2 precludes distribution “without the express, prior written consent \nof the individual or entity upon whose half the communication is being sent.” Even assuming \n“half” is a typographical error and means  behalf , paragraph 2 does not explain who that person \nmight be. It could be the person falsely p ortrayed in the communication,  or it could be  the person \nor entity who paid for the communication . Because the paragraph is not sufficiently specific or \ndetailed, it does not meet the requirements of Rule 65(d)(1).  \n Paragraph 3 simply requires the defendants to obey the law, without specifying what law \nor what requirements are mandated. As such, paragraph 3 also does not meet the specificity and \ndetail requirements of Rule 65(d)(1). Further, “obey the law” injunction s, even when the particular \nlaws are specified, are problematic because of their broad scope. See, e.g. , Brown v. Trs. of Boston \nUniv. , 891 F.2d 337, 361 (1st Cir. 1989) ; S.E.C. v. McLellan , No. 16 -cv-10874, --- F. Supp. 3d --\n-, 2024 WL 3030421, at *5  (D. Mass. June 17, 2024) ; see also  Am. Society for the Prevention of \nCruelty to Animals v. Animal & Plant Health Inspection Serv. , 60 F.4th 16, 22 (2d Cir. 2023) ; \nPrison Legal News v. Federal Bureau of Prisons , 944 F.3d 868, 883, n.22 (10th Cir. 2019) ; Walker \nv. City of Calhoun, Ga. , 682 F. App’x 721, 724 -25 (11th Cir. 2017) ; Perez v. Ohio Bell Tel. Co. , \n655 F. App ’x 404, 410 –11 (6th Cir. 2016) . Plaintiffs do not list the laws they intend to have \ndefendants obey, and as proposed, the injunction is not sufficiently specific to meet the \nrequire ments of Rule 65(d)(1).  \nIV. Summary  \n Plaintiffs  have not established standing to seek the prospective  injunctive relief  they seek, \nwhich precludes the proposed preliminary injunction. Additionally, plaintiffs have not established Case 1:24-cv-00073-SM-TSM     Document 99     Filed 09/19/24     Page 14 of 15 \n15 \nthat they would suffer future irreparable harm absent injunctive relief . Further , the plaintiffs’ \nproposed preliminary injunction does not meet the specificity and detail requirements of Rule \n65(d)(1).  \n \nCONCLUSION  \n For the foregoing reasons,  the district judge should deny plaintiffs’ amended motion for a \npreliminary injunction. Doc. no. 71. Any objections to this Report and Recommendation must be \nfiled within fourteen days of receipt of this notice. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 72(b)(2) . The fourteen -day \nperiod may be extended upon motion. Only those issues raised in the objection(s) to this Report \nand Recommendation are subject to review in the district court. See Sch.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: This court case involves a class-action lawsuit where the plaintiffs, Ron and Dorit Golan, accuse multiple defendants of violating the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA) and Missouri's Do Not Call Law by making unsolicited prerecorded calls to promote the film \"Last Ounce of Courage\" using the voice of Mike Huckabee. The defendants filed motions to dismiss the case, arguing the plaintiffs did not sufficiently allege that the defendants were responsible for these calls or that they were injured by the calls to establish standing.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged that the defendants initiated or were vicariously liable for the unsolicited calls in violation of the TCPA and Missouri's Do Not Call Law, and whether the plaintiffs have standing to sue based on the alleged injuries.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court held the defendants' motions to dismiss in abeyance, pending additional briefing on the issues of the plaintiffs' standing to bring the case and their qualifications to act as class representatives. The court is concerned about whether the plaintiffs suffered a distinct injury since they did not actually hear the message, which is necessary to establish standing.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: A family, the Golans, along with others, are suing some companies because they were annoyed by lots of prerecorded phone calls telling them to watch a movie. The law says you can't make these calls without asking people first, so the family is using this to sue. But the court isn't sure if the family was harmed enough by these calls since they didn't listen to the message and is asking for more information before deciding if the case can move forward. The court's decision was not based on robots or AI systems directly making or managing these calls.",

Leininger’s Motion to Dismiss” [ECF\nNo. 32]; and “Michael Dale Huckabee’s Motion to Dismiss” [ECF No. 36]. \nI. BACKGROUND\nOn October 3, 2012, Plaintiffs James Armbruster, Ron Golan, and Dorit Golan, on behalf\nof themselves and as representatives of a defined class, filed a putative class action petition in the\nTwenty-First Judicial Circuit, St. Louis County, Missouri, styled James Armbruster, Ron Golan\nand Dorit Golan v. Veritas Entertainment, LLC and Veritas Marketing Group, LLC , Cause No.\n12SL-CC03771 [ECF Nos. 1, 1-5 at 205].  The plaintiffs alleged the named defendants violated\nthe Telephone Consumer Protection Act (“TCPA”), 47 U.S.C. § 227 et seq., and 47 C.F.R. §\n64.1200(a), by making unsolicited pre-recorded calls to residential telephone lines.  \nPlaintiffs Ron Golan and Dorit Golan (collectively referred to as “Plaintiffs” or “Golans”)\nfiled an Amended Class Action Petition (“Amended Complaint”) in the state court on December\n4, 2013, styled Ron Golan and Dorit Golan v. Veritas Entertainment, LLC; Veritas MarketingCase: 4:14-cv-00069-ERW   Doc. #:  49   Filed: 04/04/14   Page: 1 of 20 PageID #: <pageID>2Group, LLC; Freeeats.com, Inc., d/b/a ccAdvertising; AIC Communications, LLC, d/b/a\nccAdvertising; Gabriel S. Joseph, III; Stephen Wayne Griffin; Mission City Management, Inc.;\nCourage 2012, LLC; James R. Leininger; Sixdi, Inc., d/b/a Sixdi; Bob Brewer; and Michael Dale\nHuckabee, a/k/a Mike Huckabee  [ECF Nos. 1, 1-3, 4], asserting the named defendants violated\nSection 227(b)(1)(B) of the TCPA, and Missouri’s Do Not Call Law, Missouri Revised Statutes\n§ 407.1095-407.1110.  On January 15, 2014, Defendant Mission City Management, Inc.\n(“Mission City”) filed a Notice of Removal to this Court, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331, 1332,\n1441, 1446 and 1453, alleging this Court has original jurisdiction over claims arising under the\nTCPA, and under the Class Action Fairness Act of 2005, 28 U.S.C. § 1332(d)(2), and (5),\nbecause the putative class contains at least 100 members, at least one member of the putative\nclass is a citizen of a state different from any defendant, and the amount in controversy exceeds\n$5,000,000, exclusive of interest and costs [ECF No. 1].  The proposed class consists of:  \nAll persons within the United States to whom Defendants (or some person on\nDefendants’ behalf), within four years of October 3, 2012, initiated one or more\ntelephone calls to such persons’ residential telephone lines using the recorded\nvoice of Mike Huckabee to deliver a message as part of the above-mentioned\ncampaign regarding the movie Last Ounce of Courage.\nWithin the proposed class is the following sub-class:\nAll Missouri residential subscribers registered on Missouri’s No Call List who\nreceived, within any twelve-month period after January 1, 2012, more than one\n“telephone solicitation” (as defined by Missouri Revised Statutes § 407.1095(3))\nby or on behalf of Defendants, using the recorded voice of Mike Huckabee as part\nof a campaign promoting Last Ounce of Courage. \n   \nDefendants Mission City and Courage 2012, LLC (“Courage 2012”) jointly filed a\nMotion to Dismiss on January 31, 2014, alleging Plaintiffs’ Amended Complaint failed to state a\nclaim against them, and asking the Court to dismiss, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure\n12 (b)(6), the claims as to them, with prejudice [ECF No. 21, 22].  On February 14, DefendantsCase: 4:14-cv-00069-ERW   Doc. #:  49   Filed: 04/04/14   Page: 2 of 20 PageID #: <pageID>3James R. Leininger (“Leininger”) and Michael Dale Huckabee (“Huckabee”) filed separate\nmotions, also moving the Court to dismiss with prejudice, Plaintiffs’ claims against them, for\nfailure to state a claim [ECF Nos. 32, 33, 36, 37].  With leave of Court, Plaintiffs submitted their\ncombined Response to all three Motions to Dismiss on February 28 [ECF No. 42].  Defendants\nfiled a combined Reply in support of their motions on March 14, 2014 [ECF No. 43].  \nDefendants Veritas Entertainment, LLC; Veritas Marketing Group, LLC; Stephen Wayne\nGriffin; AIC Communications, LLC; FreeEats.com, Inc.; and Gabriel S. Joseph III have filed\nAnswers to Plaintiffs’ Amended Complaint [ECF Nos. 23-25].\nOn April 1, 2014, Plaintiffs filed a “Motion for Leave to File Second Amended\nComplaint [ECF Nos. 45 through 45-3] and a “Motion to Certify Class as to Second Amended\nComplaint and to Stay Further Certification Briefing [ECF Nos. 46, 47].\nII. LEGAL STANDARD\nA. MOTION TO DISMISS\nA party may move under Rule 12(b)(6) to dismiss a complaint for “fail[ing] to state a\nclaim upon which relief may be granted.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6).  The purpose of a motion to\ndismiss is to test “the sufficiency of a complaint[.]”  M.M. Silta, Inc. v. Cleveland Cliffs, Inc. ,\n616 F.3d 872, 876 (8th Cir. 2010).  \n“To survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter,\naccepted as true, to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.”  Ashcroft v. Iqbal , 556\nU.S. 662, 678 (2009) (internal quotations and citation omitted).   “A claim has facial plausibility\nwhen the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference\nthat the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.”  Id.  Ordinarily, only the facts alleged in\nthe complaint are considered for purposes of a motion to dismiss; however, materials attached toCase: 4:14-cv-00069-ERW   Doc. #:  49   Filed: 04/04/14   Page: 3 of 20 PageID #: <pageID>4the complaint may also be considered in construing its sufficiency.  Reynolds v. Dormire , 636\nF.3d 976, 979 (8th Cir. 2011).  \nWhen ruling on a motion to dismiss, a court “must liberally construe a complaint in favor\nof the plaintiff[.]”  Huggins v. FedEx Ground Package Sys., Inc. , 592 F.3d 853, 862 (8th Cir.\n2010).  However, if a claim fails to allege one of the elements necessary to recovery on a legal\ntheory, that claim must be dismissed for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. \nCrest Constr. II, Inc. v. Doe , 660 F.3d 346, 355 (8th Cir. 2011).  “Threadbare recitals of a cause\nof action, supported by mere conclusory statements, do not suffice.”   Iqbal , 556 U.S. at 678;  Bell\nAtlantic v. Twombly , 550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007).  Although courts must accept all factual\nallegations as true, they are not bound to take as true “a legal conclusion couched as a factual\nallegation.” Twombly , 550 U.S. at 555 (internal quotations and citation omitted); Iqbal , 556 U.S.\nat 677-78.   \nB. THE TCPA\nIn the TCPA of 1991, Congress found that the use of the telephone to market goods and\nservices to homes was “pervasive due to the increased use of cost-effective telemarketing\ntechniques.”  Pub. L. No. 102-243, 105 Stat 2394 at § 2 (1991).  Additionally, Congress found\nthat unrestricted telemarketing could constitute an intrusive invasion of privacy, and that many\nconsumers were outraged over the proliferation of intrusive, nuisance calls to their homes from\ntelemarketers.  Id.  Congress further found that individuals’ rights needed to be balanced in way\nthat protected the privacy of individuals and permitted legitimate telemarketing practices.  Id. \nConsequently, Congress amended Title II of the Communications Act of 1934 by adding Section\n227 at the end of the Act, placing restrictions on the use of telephone equipment.  Pub. L. No.\n102-243, 105 Stat 2394 at § 3 (1991).  Case: 4:14-cv-00069-ERW   Doc. #:  49   Filed: 04/04/14   Page: 4 of 20 PageID #: <pageID>5In their Amended Complaint, Plaintiffs allege that the named defendants violated 47\nU.S.C. § 227(b)(1)(B).   Section 227(b)(1)(B) of the TCPA provides that it shall be unlawful for\nany person “to initiate any telephone call to any residential telephone line using an artificial or\nprerecorded voice to deliver a message without the prior express consent of the called party,\nunless the call is initiated for emergency purposes or is exempted by rule or order by the\nCommission under paragraph (2)(B).”  47 U.S.C. § 227 (b)(1)(B).  \nThe Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) is the agency granted law-making,\nlaw-enforcing, and interpretative authority over the TCPA.  See Chevron, USA, Inc. v. Natural\nRes. Def. Council, Inc. , 467 U.S. 837, 843-44 (1984); 47 U.S.C. §§ 227(b)(2), 227(c)(1),\n227(c)(2), 227(g)(3); 22 FCC Rcd. 19896 (Nov. 9, 2007); 20 FCC Rcd. 18272 (Nov. 23, 2005). \nOn May 9, 2013, upon referral of a case by the Sixth Circuit, the FCC issued a Declaratory\nRuling on the issue of “on behalf of ” liability under section 227(c) of the TCPA.  In the Matter\nof the Joint Petition filed by Dish Network, LLC, et al. , 28 F.C.C.R. 6574, 2013 WL 1934349\n(F.C.C. May 9, 2013).  In this ruling, the FCC also considered vicarious liability of sellers for\nviolations of 47 U.S.C. § 227(b).  Id.  Thus. this Court is able to consider the pending motions\nwith the benefit of the FCC’s guidance.   \n“[A] seller does not generally ‘initiate’ calls made through a third-party telemarketer\nwithin the meaning of the TCPA[.]” In the Matter of the Joint Petition filed by Dish Network,\nLLC, et al. , 28 F.C.C.R. at 6574.  Therefore, a seller is not directly liable for a TCPA violation\nunless it initiates call.  Id. at 6582.  Nor is an action taken for the benefit of a seller by a third-\nparty, without more, sufficient to trigger the liability of a seller under section 227(b).  Id. at 6593. \nIn addition to the TCPA’s provision making it unlawful, absent prior express consent by the call\nrecipient, for a person to initiate telephone calls to residential telephone lines using artificial orCase: 4:14-cv-00069-ERW   Doc. #:  49   Filed: 04/04/14   Page: 5 of 20 PageID #: <pageID>6prerecorded voices to deliver messages, the FCC’s do-not-call rules also make it unlawful for any\nperson or entity to initiate telephone solicitations to residential telephone subscribers who have\nregistered their telephone numbers with the national do-not-call registry.  In the Matter of the\nJoint Petition filed by Dish Network, LLC, et al. ,  28 F.C.C.R. at 6582-83.  The FCC has\nexempted certain categories of calls from its delivery restrictions on calls using an artificial or\nprerecorded voice, however, including, among others, calls not made for a commercial purpose,\nand calls made for a commercial purpose but without an advertisement or telemarketing message. \nSee 47 C.F.R. § 64.1200.   \nNevertheless, a seller that is not directly liable may be held vicariously liable under\nfederal common law principles of agency for violations of section 227(b) by a third-party\ntelemarketer.  In the Matter of the Joint Petition filed by Dish Network, LLC, et al. ,  28 F.C.C.R.\nat 6582-83.  A formal agency relationship is not required to establish a seller’s vicarious liability\nfor the illegal acts of a third-party telemarketer; plaintiffs can also employ principles of\nratification and apparent authority in pursuing TCPA claims.  Id. at 6586-87.  Federal common\nlaw is in accordance with the Restatement of Agency.  Opp v. Wheaton Van Lines, Inc. , 231 F.3d\n1060, 1064 (7th Cir. 2000).  Missouri agency law likewise mirrors the Restatement’s definition. \nSee State ex rel. Ford Motor Co. v. Bacon , 63 S.W.2d 641, 642 (Mo. 2002).  \na. Apparent Authority\n“[A]pparent authority to do an act is created as to a third person by written or spoken\nwords or any other conduct of the principal which, reasonably interpreted, causes the third person\nto believe that the principal consents to have the act done on his behalf by the person purporting\nto act for him.”  Pinkham v. Sara Lee Corp ., 983 F.2d 824, 830 (8th Cir. 1992) (quoting\nRestatement (Second) of Agency § 27 (1957)); see also Restatement (Third) Agency § 2.03Case: 4:14-cv-00069-ERW   Doc. #:  49   Filed: 04/04/14   Page: 6 of 20 PageID #: <pageID>7(apparent authority is the power held by agent or other actor to affect principal’s legal relations\nwith third parties when third party reasonably believes actor has authority to act on principal’s\nbehalf and belief is traceable to principal’s manifestations); Restatement (Third) Agency § 1.03\n(person manifests assent or intention through written or spoken words or other conduct).  \nIn its Declaratory Ruling, the FCC provided illustrative examples of evidence that could\ndemonstrate a telemarketer is a “seller’s authorized representative with apparent authority to\nmake the seller vicariously liable for the telemarketer’s section 227(b) violations.”  In the Matter\nof the Joint Petition filed by Dish Network, LLC, et al. , 28 F.C.C.R. at 6592.  The examples\nincluded evidence showing: 1) the seller allows the telemarketer access to information and\nsystems that normally would be within the seller’s exclusive control; 2) the ability by the\ntelemarketer to enter consumer information into the seller’s sales or customer systems; 3) the\nauthority by the telemarketer to use the seller’s trade name, trademark, and service mark; and 4)\nthe seller approved, wrote, or reviewed the telemarketing scripts.  Id.  The FCC also opined:\na seller would be responsible under the TCPA for the unauthorized conduct of a\nthird-party telemarketer that is otherwise authorized to market on the seller’s\nbehalf if the seller knew (or reasonably should have known) that the telemarketer\nwas violating the TCPA on the seller’s behalf and the seller failed to take effective\nsteps within its power to force the telemarketer to cease that conduct.\nId.  The FCC concluded, “At a minimum, evidence of these kinds of relationships . . . should be\nsufficient to place upon the seller the burden of demonstrating that a reasonable consumer would\nnot sensibly assume that the telemarketer was acting as the seller’s authorized agent.”\nb. Ratification\nRatification is “the affirmance by a person of a prior act that did not bind him but which\nwas done or professedly done on his  account, whereby the act, as to some or all persons, is given\neffect as if originally authorized by him.”  BE&K Const. Co. v. N.L.R.B. , 23 F.3d 1459, 1466 (8thCase: 4:14-cv-00069-ERW   Doc. #:  49   Filed: 04/04/14   Page: 7 of 20 PageID #: <pageID>8Cir. 1994) (quoting Serv. Emp. Union, Local 87 (W. Bay Maint.) , 291 NLRB 83, 1988 WL\n214072 (1988)).  Affirmance is either: “(a) a manifestation of an election by one on whose\naccount an unauthorized act has been done to treat the act as authorized, or (b) conduct by him\njustifiable only if there were such an election.”  BE&K Const. , 23 F.3d at 1466 (citing section 83\nof the Restatement (Second) of Agency).  “An affirmance of an unauthorized transaction can be\ninferred from a failure to repudiate it.”  Id. (quoting § 94 of the Restatement).  The Restatement\n(Third) of Agency defines ratification as “the affirmance of a prior act done by another, whereby\nthe act is given effect as if done by an agent acting with actual authority.”  Restatement (Third) of\nAgency § 4.01(1).  “A person ratifies an act by (a) manifesting assent that the act shall affect the\nperson’s legal relations, or (b) conduct that justifies a reasonable assumption that the person so\nconsents.”  Restatement (Third) of Agency § 4.01(2).  \nC. MISSOURI’S DO NOT CALL LAW\nThese defendants further argue the Amended Complaint’s allegations are insufficient as a\nmatter of law to assert Missouri Do-Not-Call claims against them.  Missouri’s Telemarketing\nNo-Call List statute provides:  \nNo person or entity shall make or cause to be made any telephone solicitation to\nany residential subscriber in this state who has given notice to the attorney\ngeneral, in accordance with rules promulgated pursuant to section 407.1101 of\nsuch subscriber’s objection to receiving telephone solicitations.  \nMo. Rev. Stat. 407.1098.\nIII. STATEMENT OF FACTS\nFor purposes of a Motion to Dismiss, the facts, as alleged in Plaintiffs’ Amended\nComplaint and contained in exhibits incorporated therein, are accepted as true.  Those legal\nconclusions “couched as a factual allegation” in a complaint, however, are not.  Defendants\ncorrectly assert the Amended Complaint impermissibly lumps defendants together and containsCase: 4:14-cv-00069-ERW   Doc. #:  49   Filed: 04/04/14   Page: 8 of 20 PageID #: <pageID>9conclusory statements, such as “Defendants worked in concert to design and implement a\ntelephone advertising campaign . . ..”  The Court sets forth the following recitation of the\npertinent facts, accepted as truly alleged in the Amended Complaint and its incorporated exhibits.\nThe plaintiffs filing this putative class action on behalf of themselves, and as\nrepresentatives of the defined class, are the Golans.  The Golans are individuals who reside in St.\nLouis County.  Mission City is a Texas corporation, and Courage 2012 is a Texas limited liability\ncompany.  Leininger is a manager of Mission City.  Huckabee is a radio talk show host and a\nformer Arkansas governor.  \nSince prior to January 16, 2010, the Golans have been the account holders of the\nresidential telephone number (636) 812-XXXX.  The Golan’s residential telephone number has\nbeen registered on the Missouri No Call List since January 16, 2010, and on the federal Do Not\nCall List since March 7, 2012.  The Golans never expressly consented to receiving telephone\ncalls to (636) 812-XXXX from any of the defendants named in the Amended Complaint.\nDefendant Stephen Wayne Griffin (“Griffin”) is President and Chief Executive Officer of\nVeritas Marketing (“Veritas Marketing”) and Veritas Entertainment, LLC (“Veritas\nEntertainment”).  Veritas Entertainment helped produced “Last Ounce of Courage,” a movie that\nopened nationwide in at least 1,400 theatres on or about September 14, 2012, and played at the\nWehrenberg Chesterfield Galaxy 14 theatre in Chesterfield, Missouri.  “Last Ounce of Courage”\nwas initially owned by Eastern Gate Films, LLC (“Eastern Gate”), which had started the movie,\nbut Eastern Gate later asked Veritas Entertainment to “come alongside and fix the film.”  Veritas\nEntertainment provided capital to fix the film in exchange for an equity interest in “Last Ounce\nof Courage.”  After investing money into the film, Griffin and his associated entities owned aCase: 4:14-cv-00069-ERW   Doc. #:  49   Filed: 04/04/14   Page: 9 of 20 PageID #: <pageID>10forty-nine percent interest in “Last Ounce of Courage.”  Mission City made an investment of\n$10,000,000 to market the movie.   \nIn 2012, Courage 2012 was formed.  Thereafter, Courage 2012, Mission City, and Veritas\nEntertainment owned the film.  “Last Ounce of Courage” was the only movie Veritas ever\nmarketed.  \nIn 2012, Leininger introduced Griffin to Gabriel S. Joseph, III (“Joseph”), the sole officer\nand director of FreeEats.com, Inc., d/b/a ccAdvertising, and the sole member of AIC\nCommunications, LLC, d/b/a ccAdvertising (collectively referred to as “ccAdvertising”). \nSubsequently, Joseph made a PowerPoint “pitch” to Griffin, concerning how to promote the\nmovie effectively, including the use of telemarketing.  Griffin and Joseph then engaged in a\nseries of discussions regarding a telemarketing campaign to promote “Last Ounce of Courage,”\nwith Griffin acting on behalf of Veritas Entertainment and Veritas Marketing.  \nLeininger also introduced Griffin to Huckabee, and, in June or July 2012, Griffin went to\nFlorida to screen “Last Ounce of Courage” to Huckabee at Huckabee’s home.  Leininger was\npresent at this meeting.  \nIn communicating by email to Griffin, Joseph once carbon-copied Leininger, noting,\n“[Leininger] can engage as needed.”  In email exchanges between Griffin and Joseph, Griffin\noften identified himself as the “President & CEO” of Veritas Entertainment, and used the email\naddress, sgriffin@veritashq.com .\nThe advertising campaign for “Last Ounce of Courage” included approximately 4 million\ntelephone calls to residential telephone numbers throughout many states in the United States and\n“Email to Text (ETT) Messages” to 30 million cell phones.  Defendants knew the telephone calls\nwould be recorded ahead of time and played when recipients, or their voice mail, picked up theCase: 4:14-cv-00069-ERW   Doc. #:  49   Filed: 04/04/14   Page: 10 of 20 PageID #:\n <pageID>11phone.  Joseph referred to telephone calls as “Artificial Intelligence Call[s]” or “AIC” calls. \nJoseph explained the technology functioned like a “logic tree,” in that the telephone call\nrecipient’s “yes” or “no” responses to questions would dictate the next prerecorded question.\nIn an August 31, 2012 email to Griffin, Joseph stated, “We need to start our ‘Artificial\nIntelligence Call’ (AIC) calls with or without a Celebrity Voice.”  Griffin initially was concerned\nwith the cost of a large-scale telephone-call campaign, informing Joseph in an August 31, 2012\nemail, “The money is just not there,” and “the only way I know how to pay for this is to go back\nto [Leininger].”  In this email, Griffin also stated, “I want people to go to see the movie your (sic)\nright we only have two weeks.  Getting a lot of info about people with a call to see the movie\ndoes not help me at this point.”\nccAdvertising prepared the initial suggested script for the “Last Ounce of Courage” AIC\ncalls.  This script included, among others, the following segments:\n1. Hello[,] this is Governor Mike Huckabee with a 45-second survey.  Do\nyou believe in American freedom and liberty?\n2.

Huckabee recorded the script on September 4, 2012,Case: 4:14-cv-00069-ERW   Doc. #:  49   Filed: 04/04/14   Page: 12 of 20 PageID #:\n <pageID>13using his own voice.  Huckabee knew the recording would be played for telemarketing purposes\nduring telephone calls to consumers. \nAfter learning, on September 5, 2012, that Huckabee had recorded the script, Griffin sent\nJoseph an email, stating, “[I] need to review the call.”  That same day, Joseph sent Brewer an\nemail, requesting information for targeting cities and states where the most theatres would be\nshowing the movie.  Brewer, using the email address bob.brewer@sixdi.com , responded on\nSeptember 5, stating, “Let’s go.  The Huckabee AIC call is approved.”\nOn September 6, Joseph sent Leininger a test call of the Huckabee call for “Last Ounce of\nCourage.”  Leininger liked the call, but wanted the script to be shorter, progressing from Segment\n2 to Segment 5, and skipping the questions in between, because Leininger “was anxious to get\npeople to the movie permission segment.”  Joseph made Leininger’s suggested changes.\nIn a September 7, 2012 email to Griffin and Brewer, ccAdvertising provided Griffin and\nBrewer with a user login and password for a secure information data directory, so that they could\naccess summary reports regarding the Huckabee calls made, including (a) the percentage of\nhomes where the calls reached live respondents or answering devices; (b) client call status,\nshowing how each call was registered by major category; (c) client segment status, showing by\npercentage levels how each live respondent answered each question; and (d) client response rate,\nshowing composite percentages of how many “Yes” or “No” questions were answered and by\nhow many respondents.  Neither Griffin, nor anyone from Veritas Marketing, ever logged on to\nccAdvertising’s secure data directory.\nInitially, ccAdvertising invoiced SixDi for its work on the “Last Ounce of Courage”\ncampaign.  Later, ccAdvertising’s invoices, including Invoice #4065, were sent to Griffin’s\nattention, and listed “Veritas Entertainment” in the bill-to section.  Veritas Entertainment orCase: 4:14-cv-00069-ERW   Doc. #:  49   Filed: 04/04/14   Page: 13 of 20 PageID #:\n <pageID>14Veritas Marketing paid ccAdvertising $248,500 for the 4 million AIC calls to residential\ntelephone numbers, and $30,000 for the 30 million ETT messages to cell phones.  ccAdvertising\nreceived by wire transfer, $100,000 on or about September 7, 2012; $100,000 on September 14,\n2012; and the final $78,500 during the first week of October 2012.\nIn a September 14, 2012 email to Griffin concerning payments, Joseph requested a reply\nindicating when he could expect the next $100,000 payment on the balance due.  He threatened\nto shut down the Huckabee AIC campaign if he did not hear from Griffin that morning, and\nstated, “[P]lease let me know if I need to engage [Leininger] in this to make sure he has provided\nyou the monies you need to pay ccAdvertising.”\nOn September 10 and 12, 2012, ccAdvertising, via telephone number 202-769-1087,\ninitiated telephone calls to the Golans’ residential telephone line, using Huckabee’s pre-recorded\nvoice to deliver a message encouraging the Golans to go see “Last Ounce of Courage.”  The\nGolans received two of the Huckabee calls, which left messages consisting of language from\nSegment 15 of the script on their answering machine: “This was a public survey call.  We may\ncall back later.”  The name showing on the Golan’s caller ID, corresponding to 202-769-1087,\nwas “2012FREERSRCH.”  \nWhen “lastouncethe movie.com” was typed as a Uniform Resource Locator (“URL”), the\nURL redirected the user to http://www.standusa.com/last-ounce-of-courage/ , which contained a\n“BUY TICKETS” link, as well as an “ABOUT VERITAS” link, http://www.standusa.com/looc -\nabout-veritas/.\nAfter the Huckabee calls were made to 4 million homes, ccAdvertising created a “Survey\nQuestionnaire,” which identified the purpose for the “survey” was “to identify those respondents\nwho believe in American freedom and liberty and who are interested in hearing more informationCase: 4:14-cv-00069-ERW   Doc. #:  49   Filed: 04/04/14   Page: 14 of 20 PageID #:\n <pageID>15about the movie “Last Ounce of Courage.”  According to this Survey Questionnaire, “1,018,609\nlive responses were detected.”  Regardless of whether recipients of the calls answered “yes” or\n“no” to Questions 1 and 2 in the script, recipients who did not hang up were presented with\nQuestion 5, in which Huckabee recommended they see “Last Ounce of Courage.”  \nJoseph and ccAdvertising obtained the telephone numbers called during the campaign\nfrom a database purchased from Axion Corporation more than a decade earlier.  This database\nprovided White Pages data in digital format.  Other than named defendants, none of the persons\nwho were called had indicated to any defendant, or anyone else, a desire to receive telephone\ncalls promoting “Last Ounce of Courage.”\nIV. DISCUSSION\nPlaintiffs allege the named defendants violated section 227(b)(a) (B) of the TCPA, which,\nwith certain exceptions, prohibits  persons from initiating calls to residential telephone lines\nusing a prerecorded voice to deliver a message without the called party’s prior express consent. \nPlaintiffs also claim the moving defendants are liable under Missouri’s Do Not Call law, because\nthey made, or caused to be made, the telephone solicitation to Plaintiffs’ residential lines, in that\nthe defendants all worked to “bring about” the prerecorded voice calls.  \nIn their Motion to Dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), the moving defendants claim\nPlaintiffs fail to allege facts to support their claims that these defendants violated the TCPA and\nMissouri’s Telemarketing No-Call List Act.  The moving defendants contend Plaintiffs have\nfailed to allege facts sufficient to show they made or “cause[d] to be made any telephone\nsolicitation to any residential subscriber in this state[,]” as required by the Missouri statute. \nMission City and Courage 2012 further contend the specific allegations regarding them, togetherCase: 4:14-cv-00069-ERW   Doc. #:  49   Filed: 04/04/14   Page: 15 of 20 PageID #:\n <pageID>16with Plaintiffs’ conclusory, general allegations concerning all the defendants, are insufficient as a\nmatter of law to assert TCPA claims against Mission City and Courage 2012.  \nAs to Plaintiffs’ TCPA claim, the moving defendants contend Plaintiffs fail to allege\nsufficient facts showing they either initiated the calls, or are vicariously liable for ccAdvertising’s\ncalls [ECF No. 22].  The moving defendants argue Plaintiffs’ theories of ratification, and\nimpermissible delegation of duty fail, claiming Plaintiffs did not raise them in their Complaint,\nand the Complaint’s allegations do not support either theory.  As well, the moving defendants\ncontend Plaintiffs fail to allege sufficiently their other theories of liability, including allegations\nsupporting the existence of a formal agency relationship.   \nThey contend the Amended Complaint fails to plead sufficient facts to support Plaintiffs’\napparent authority agency and ratification theories, and they more specifically argue the\nComplaint fails to plead sufficiently that they controlled the manner and means of the calls [ECF\nNo. 43].  As to Plaintiffs’ claims against Courage 2012, the defendants assert Plaintiffs, at most,\nhave alleged the entity owned the film, and they contend ownership does not make an owner\nliable, even assuming the owner financed the operations.  The moving defendants contend\nPlaintiffs’ claims against Mission City fail for the same reason, and they argue the TCPA does\nnot impose liability upon one who merely invests in a product. \nIn their combined response in opposition to the Motions to Dismiss filed by Mission City,\nCourage 2012, Leininger, and Huckabee, Plaintiffs claim the moving defendants “were\nintimately involved in the creation of the message and the timing of the calls” [ECF No. 42 at 2]. \nPlaintiffs contend “common sense,” and the Restatement (Third) of Agency, prevent parties from\navoiding liability for torts they orchestrate, but hire a third party to execute.  Plaintiffs assert the\nmoving defendants controlled the process and terms by which the violations occurred, and argueCase: 4:14-cv-00069-ERW   Doc. #:  49   Filed: 04/04/14   Page: 16 of 20 PageID #:\n <pageID>17defendants’ actions developed a principal-agent relationship with ccAdvertising that subjected\nthem to vicarious liability for the violations.  Specifically, as to Mission City and Courage 2012,\nPlaintiffs contend in their opposition that these two entities, through their principal, Leininger,\nfunded the calls, acquired Huckabee as the “celebrity voice” for the prerecorded calls, and hired\nccAdvertising as the marketer of the calls.  Plaintiffs contend Courage 2012, as owner of the\nfilm, is chargeable with its officers’ knowledge and participation in causing the calls to be made\non its behalf.  They claim Mission City, through its principal, Leininger, invested at least\n$10,000,000 to market “Last Ounce of Courage”; was informed of, and actively participated in\nthe marketing plan for the film; and reviewed and edited the final prerecorded voice scripts to be\nused in the calls.  Plaintiffs further argue that, even if Mission City and Courage 2012 did not\ngive actual authority to ccAdvertising to make the calls, the two entities and the other moving\ndefendants “ratified the wrongful acts by accepting the benefit of the wrongful advertising,\nwithout protest.”  Plaintiffs claim Mission City’s and Courage 2012’s acceptance of proceeds\nfrom the movie, without objecting to the calls having been made, constituted ratification of the\ncalls that were physically initiated by ccAdvertising, making them as liable as if ccAdvertising\nhad made the calls as their agent acting with actual authority.  \nKeeping in mind the standard for consideration of  dismissal motions, the Court’s review\nreveals issues of considerable concern that warrant holding any ruling in abeyance, pending\nadditional briefing by the parties.  Plaintiffs’ recently filed motions for leave to file a second\namended complaint and to certify the class as to the proposed amended complaint, make the need\nto address these threshold issues even more compelling.  \nThe most pressing concerns presented by the factual allegations raise the questions of\nwhether Plaintiffs suffered any injury sufficient to give them standing to bring this case in federalCase: 4:14-cv-00069-ERW   Doc. #:  49   Filed: 04/04/14   Page: 17 of 20 PageID #:\n <pageID>18court, and whether they are proper class representatives for this action.  Article III case-or-\ncontroversy standing is a question that must bear the Court’s sua sponte  scrutiny.  See FW/PBS,\nInc. v. Dallas , 493 U.S. 215, 231 (1990).  Plaintiffs allege these defendants and others violated\nthe Missouri Do Not Call Law, and Section 227(b)(1)(B) of the TCPA, a provision that makes it\nunlawful for a person “to initiate” a call to a residential line using an artificial or prerecorded\nvoice to deliver an unauthorized message, unless the call is initiated for any emergency purpose,\nor is exempted by the FCC.  47 U.S.C. § 227(b)(1)(B); Mo. Rev. Stat. §§ 407.1095-407.1110.  \nThe applicable FCC regulation exempts calls not made for a commercial purpose, and\ncalls made for a commercial purpose but without an advertisement or telemarketing message,\nfrom the TCPA’s prohibition on calls using an artificial or prerecorded voice.  See 47 U.S.C. §\n227(b)(1)(B) and (b)(2)(B); 47 C.F.R. § 64.1200.  The Amended Complaint’s allegations show\nthe moving defendants did not “initiate” the calls made to the Golans.  The Amended Complaint\nfurther reveals the two calls placed to the Golans’ telephone number reached only their\nanswering device, and the entirety of the message left on the device stated: “This was a public\nsurvey call.  We may call back later.”  Plaintiffs’ allegations show that the Golans had no\nknowledge of the contents of the message they now challenge individually and “on behalf of all\nothers similarly situated.”  Although the TCPA, in its effort to protect consumers’ privacy rights,\nprovides that a person who initiates calls with a prerecorded message may be liable, the statute\ndoes not show Congress expressed an intent to circumvent the Article III case-or-controversy\nstanding requirement, which requires a plaintiff to demonstrate a distinct and palpable injury\nwhen seeking a private remedy.  See Warth v. Seldin , 422 U.S. 490, 501 (1975).  Presumably, a\nplaintiff seeking redress must hear a message to ascertain whether it is made for a commercial\npurpose and contains an unsolicited advertisement.  It is difficult to discern how the Golans’Case: 4:14-cv-00069-ERW   Doc. #:  49   Filed: 04/04/14   Page: 18 of 20 PageID #:\n <pageID>19privacy rights were invaded by a message they did not hear, and of which they had no\nknowledge.  The Golans’ standing to bring a claim under Missouri’s Do Not Call Law, and\nability to act as class representatives under Missouri law, are likewise in issue, as the restrictions\nof Section 407.1107.3(1)-(3) apply to “telephone solicitations,” which, again, would require\nsome knowledge of a call’s message.   \nAs an initial matter, the Court notes Plaintiffs’ failure to raise ratification and delegation\nof duty in their Complaint is not an absolute bar to a possible recovery under those theories.  In\nsome circumstances, a party may obtain relief on a theory of recovery proved during trial, but not\nexpressly raised in the Complaint, provided that the theory is based on the same wrongful act\npleaded, and the opposing party has been afforded fair notice.  See Morgan Distrib. Co., Inc. v.\nUnidynamic Corp. , 868 F.2d 992, 995 (8th Cir. 1989).  For purposes of a motion to dismiss,\nhowever, the Court’s inquiry is whether Plaintiffs’ Complaint, liberally construed, alleges all of\nthe elements necessary to recover on a legal theory.  Huggins , 592 F.3d at 862; Crest Constr. II,\nInc., 660 F.3d at 355.  \nPlaintiffs, relying on the FCC’s declaratory ruling in In the Matter of the Joint Petition\nfiled by Dish Network , which analyzed the vicarious liability of sellers for violations of 47 U.S.C.\n§ 227(b), contend the moving defendants are vicariously liable for the actions of a third-party\ntelemarketer.  47 C.F.R. 64.1200(f)(9) defines “seller” as “the person or entity on whose behalf a\ntelephone call or message is initiated for the purpose of encouraging the purchase or rental of, or\ninvestment in, property, goods, or services, which is transmitted to another person.”  The\nAmended Complaint’s factual allegations and incorporated exhibits do not appear to support the\nproposition that any moving defendant qualifies as a “seller.”  The Court will order the parties toCase: 4:14-cv-00069-ERW   Doc. #:  49   Filed: 04/04/14   Page: 19 of 20 PageID #:\n <pageID>20\nbrief the issues discussed above, particularly, the jurisdictional issue of standing, and the named\nplaintiffs’ qualifications to act as class representatives.    \nAccordingly,\nIT IS HEREBY ORDERED  that  “Mission City Management, Inc.’s and Courage 2012\nLLC’s Motion to Dismiss” [ECF No. 21]; “James R.

    "summary": "**1. Summary:**  \nIn this case, the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Florida was tasked with determining the ownership of three social media accounts used to promote a company's products during its Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings. Vital Pharmaceuticals, the debtor, asserted ownership of these accounts, which were used predominantly for marketing its Bang energy drink products, while the former CEO, John H. Owoc, claimed personal ownership. The court determined that, owing to the pervasiveness of the accounts' use for company marketing purposes, they were the property of the estate.\n\n**2. Key Legal Issue:**  \nThe main legal issue was whether the social media accounts used primarily for promoting a company's products are property of the bankruptcy estate, despite claims of personal ownership by the company's former CEO who used them to cultivate his persona.\n\n**3. Court's Holding:**  \nThe court held that the social media accounts in question are property of the bankruptcy estate, as they were predominantly used for marketing Vital Pharmaceuticals' products and were integral to the company's business strategy. Consequently, the accounts must be turned over to the debtor, Vital Pharmaceuticals.\n\n**4. ELI5 Explanation:**  \nImagine you have a YouTube channel you use mainly to show off a brand of toys you made with your friends and sell online. You created this channel because you worked at the toy company, and lots of the videos are all about the toys. Now, if your company goes bankrupt, the question is: Who owns the channel?

The evolving use of social media for \nPeter D. Russin, Judge \nUnited States Bankruptcy Court_____________________________________________________________________________ORDERED in the Southern District of Florida on June 16, 2023.\nCase 23-01051-PDR    Doc 161    Filed 06/16/23    Page 1 of 342 \n business—and the growth of influencer marketing—has magnified the importance of \nwhat to date has been an obscure legal i ssue: How is ownership of the rights to a \nsocial media account determined?1  \nDetermining ownership of these rights has potentially significant \nconsequences because with the account go the followers, sometimes numbering in the \nmillions. Although the value of the rights to an account is difficult to assess, it may \nbe substantial given its direct product ma rketing potential. Thus, the determination \nof ownership may have a considerable impa ct on the outcome of a bankruptcy case, \nnot to mention in other legal contexts. But there is a dearth of legal guidance. \nTo understand the history of social media and its rapid evolution is to \nunderstand the need for regulation and standardization, including the issue of \nownership. The earliest social networking sites date back more than two decades with \nthe launch of SixDegrees.com (1997),2 Friendster (2001),3 and Myspace (2003).4 \n \n1 Describing a user’s interest in a social media account is difficult. With respect to some sites, such as \nTikTok and Twitter, a social media user’s right to us e the platform is defined as a “license.” But, in \nsome cases, such as Instagram, that right is not defined at all. For ease of reference, the Court will refer to “ownership of the rights to social media accounts” to encompass whatever rights a user has—\nwhether it be a license or otherwise—to access and use a social media account. \n2 Social Media , Encyclopedia Britannica, https://www.britannica.com/topic/social-media#ref1303882; \nsee also Gonzalez v.

In 2023, there are reportedly more than 4.75 billion social media users worldwide.\n7 \nAs the use of social media has evolved as  a means of social interaction, so too \nhas its use for business. Before the meteoric rise of Facebook, direct consumer \nengagement on a large scale had not been possible.8 Now, not only do social media \nsites monetize their content by allowing ads, but companies also use social media to affect buying habits through “a type of social media marketing that uses \nendorsements and product mentions from influencers—individuals who have a dedicated social following and are viewed as experts within their niche.”\n9 Social media \n \n5 Social Media , Encyclopedia Britannica, https://www.britannica.com/topic/Myspace; see also Myspace, \nWikipedia, https://en.wiki pedia.org/wiki/Myspace; The Evolution of Social Media: How Did it Begin, \nand Where Could it Go next , Maryville University, https://online. maryville.edu/blog /evolution-social-\nmedia/.  \n6 Myspace , Wikipedia, https://en.wi kipedia.org/wiki/Myspace; Facebook , Wikipedia, \nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook. \n7 Social Media , Wikipedia, https://en.wikipe dia.org/wiki/Social_media. \n8 Facebook , Encyclopedia Britannica, https://www.britannica.com/topic/Facebook. \n9 Evolution of Social Media , supra  note 5 (quoting What is influencer marketing: How to develop your \nstrategy , Sprout Social, https://sproutsocial.com/insi ghts/influencer-marketin g/ (Apr. 17, 2023)). \nCase 23-01051-PDR    Doc 161    Filed 06/16/23    Page 3 of 344 \n influencers “have perfected the art of self -commoditization, turning their personal \nimage or reputation (also known as their ‘brand’ or ‘persona’) and their recommendations into highly valuable tools.”\n10 In 2023, influencer marketing is \nprojected to be a $21.1 billion industry.11 \nVital Pharmaceuticals, along with its af filiates (“Vital”), the Debtors in this \nchapter 11 case, is attempting to sell it s business, which in large part is the \nmanufacture and sale of “Bang” produc ts, including Bang energy drink. Vital \nattributes much of its success to social me dia marketing. And it believes access to its \nsocial media accounts is necessary to maximize  the value of its assets. John H. “Jack” \nOwoc (Vital’s sole shareholde r and former Chief Executive Officer), however, claims \nto own the rights to three social media accounts that have been used to promote \nVital’s products. He claims those accounts cultivate and market his persona as an \n“explosive, high-intensity, unstoppable leader.” When Mr. Owoc worked for Vital as its CEO, ownership of the rights to these so cial media accounts was not an issue. But \nupon the companies’ dismissal of Mr. Owoc, he and Vital both laid claim to the accounts, resulting in the dispute presently before the Court.  \nVital moves for summary judgment, asking the Court to determine that it owns \nthe rights to the three accounts as a matter of law because the three accounts bear \nthe company’s name; have content that is associated with its business; and were \n \n10 Grace Greene, Comment, Instagram Lookalikes and Celebrity Influencers: Rethinking the Right to \nPublicity in the Social Media Age , 168 U.

Mr. Owoc, of course, opposes the \nrelief, asserting he owns the rights to the accounts. \nUnfortunately, given the rise of influencer marketing, the existing test for \ndetermining ownership of the rights to soci al media accounts is outdated. Perhaps it \nis time for Congress or state legislatures to adopt a statutory framework to regulate \nsocial media, including determination of ownership rights. But that has not happened yet.\n12 Until it does, the Court must fashion a standard that will allow it to fairly \nresolve this dispute.13  \n \n \n12 Nor has Congress or the states regulated the use of artificial intelligence, another area where the \nevolution of technology has outpaced the law, and regulation is needed to mitigate its risks. Matt \nO’Brien, ChatGPT Chief Says Artificial Intelligence Should be Regulated by a US or Global Agency , \nAssociated Press, May 16, 2023, https://apnews.co m/article/chatgpt-openai-ceo-sam-altman-congress-\n73ff96c6571f38ad5fd68b3072722790 (“The head of the artificial intelligence company that makes \nChatGPT told Congress . . . that government intervention will be critical to mitigating the risks of increasingly powerful AI systems.”). In preparing the introduction for this Memorandum Opinion, the \nCourt prompted ChatGPT to prepare an essay about the evolution of social media and its impact on \ncreating personas and marketing products. Along with the essay it prepared, ChatGPT included the following disclosure: “As an AI language model, I do not have access to the sources used for this essay \nas it was generated based on the knowledge stored in my database.” It went on to say, however, that \nit “could provide some general sources related to the topic of social media and its impact on creating personas and marketing products.” It listed five sources in all. As it turns out, none of the five seem to \nexist. For some of the sources, the author is a real person; for other sources, the journal is real. But all \nfive of the citations seem made up, which the Co urt would not have known without having conducted \nits own research. The Court discarded the information entirely and did its own research the old-\nfashioned way. Well, not quite old fashioned; it’s not like the Court used actual books or anything. But this is an important cautionary tale. Reliance on AI  in its present development is fraught with ethical \ndangers.   \n13 Perhaps owing the numerous ways in which property disputes arise in bankruptcy, bankruptcy \ncourts are often tasked with decidi ng novel issues of property law.

Analysis \nRelying primarily on In re CTLI, LLC ,49 Vital argues that social media \naccounts are property of the estate “when the content of the accounts is associated \nwith the debtor’s business and use of the a ccounts is ‘clearly to generate revenues for \nthe company.’”50 Here, Vital argues, there is no genuine dispute of material fact that \nthe CEO Accounts are associat ed with Vital’s business (t he names for each of the \nCEO Accounts include Vital’s brand name, “bangenergy”) and that the CEO Accounts were used to promote Vital’s products.  \nThe Owocs, however, argue that the facts of this case are distinguishable from \nthose in CTLI .\n51 In particular, they argue that Mr. Owoc has used the CEO Accounts \nto cultivate his colorful, public persona, which the Owocs contend is distinct from \nVital and has personal value.52 The Owocs also argue that summary judgment is \npremature. \nFor the reasons that follow, the Court disagrees that CTLI ’s test for \ndetermining ownership of the rights to so cial media accounts remains the appropriate \nstandard. Even so, the Court concludes th at (1) there is no genuine dispute of \nmaterial fact that Vital owns the rights to the CEO Accounts; and (2) summary judgment is not premature.  \n \n49 In re CTLI, LLC , 528 B.R. 359, 367 – 74 (Bankr.

Vital is entitled to judgment as a matter of law because the record \nevidence is indisputable the CEO Accounts were pervasively used \nto market Vital and its products. \n \nAlthough social media has been around for decades, how the court determines \nwhether social media accounts are property of a debtor’s bankruptcy estate under \nBankruptcy Code § 541 is a questi on few courts have examined.53 In fact, the only \ncourt that has decided the issue is the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas eight years ago in CTLI .  \n1. The standard for determining ownership of rights to social \nmedia accounts must move beyond  CTLI  given the \nevolution of social media. \n \nIn CTLI , the debtor operated a gun store and shooting range under the trade \nname “Tactical Firearms.” The bankruptcy court had to decide whether a Facebook \npage in the name of “Tactical Firearms” and a Twitter account with the handle “@tacticalfirearm” belonged to the debtor or its majority owner, Jeremy Alcede. The \nbankruptcy court concluded the Facebook pa ge and Twitter account belonged to the \ndebtor and were therefore property of the estate.\n54  \nAccording to the court in CTLI , creating a Facebook page and Twitter account \nhandle using the name of the business rais ed a presumption that the social media \n \n53 In re CTLI, LLC , 528 B.R. 359, 378 (Bankr.

Vital \ncontinues, though, to have a CEO position.  \nVital has established that use of the CEO Accounts for marketing Bang energy \nproducts is pervasive. Of the 284 recent so cial media posts that the Owocs introduced, \n95 (33.5%) are pure marketing posts promoting Bang energy drink,76 and another 111 \nposts (39.6%) include a Bang hashtag or imag es of Bang products, Bang apparel, or \nthe Bang logo.77 Put another way, 206 of the 284 social media posts (nearly 75%) \nexplicitly or implicitly market Bang prod ucts. And another 15% (bringing the total to \n90%) are subtle marketing of Bang products  in that they emphasize aspects of Mr. \nOwoc’s persona in a way that is virtually indistinguishable from Vital’s marketing \nstrategy (e.g., posts that contain workout or nutritional advice consistent with the \nasserted attributes of the Bang energy dr ink). In addition, the CEO Accounts contain \nlinks to Vital’s website; and the CEO Instag ram Account is identified on the label of \nthe Bang energy drink can. This evidence is more than enough to satisfy Vital’s \nburden as the moving party. \nThus, the burden shifted to the Owocs to demonstrate a genuine dispute of \nmaterial fact by providing enough record ev idence a reasonable jury could rely on to \nfind in their favor. The Owocs’ evidence centers around the a lleged use of the CEO \nAccounts to cultivate his persona. For summary judgment purposes, Vital has \n \n76 Decl. of John H. Owoc , Adv.

A ccording to Mr. Owoc, that persona is as \n“an avid fitness trainer, designer and prod ucer of fitness supplements, weight-lifter, \nmotivational speaker and writer.”78 While it is true that some of the posts include a \nmotivational quote or workout or nutritional  advice, the great majority of these posts \nalso include strategically placed Bang branded products. They are therefore the type \nof subtle marketing identified in CTLI , which favors a determination Vital owns the \nrights to the CEO Accounts. This is especia lly evident given that less than 10% of the \nposts to the CEO Accounts are purely pers onal in nature. And the Owocs failed to \nintroduce any record evidence that Mr. Owoc is a social media infl uencer, that he uses \nhis persona to market any non-Vital produc ts, or that he is paid to do so.  \nUltimately, this Court must decide whether the fact that Mr. Owoc has a \npersona , that some of the posts are consistent with that persona, and that 10% of the \nposts are of a purely personal nature, is enough for a reasonable jury to conclude that \nthe Owocs own the right to the CEO Accounts.  Given the indisputable record evidence \nthat use of social media has always been th e centerpiece of Vital’s marketing strategy; \nthe accounts were created by people who were working for Vital at the time; the CEO Accounts’ names include Vital’s brand name ; the posts that could be viewed as \ncultivating Mr. Owoc’s person a are subtle marketing of Vital’s brand and products; \nand promotion of Vital’s brand and products  is pervasive throug hout the posts (90% \nof the posts are explicit, implicit, or subtle marketing), the Court concludes a \nreasonable jury could not find for the Owocs .

Summary judgment is not premature. \nThe Owocs complain summary judgment is premature because they have not \nhad a chance to conduct discovery.79 This Court held a summary judgment hearing \nsix weeks after this proceeding was filed. Du ring that time, the Owocs had to respond \nto Vital’s request for injunctive relief. The parties have not yet exchanged initial disclosures or conferred on a scheduling or der. Under those circumstances, the Owocs \nsay it is “axiomatic” that they have not had a “meaningful opportunity” to conduct discovery.\n80  \nAs the court in In re Saks  explained, “Rule 56(d) provides a mechanism for \nprotecting a party against summary ju dgment when the party has not had a \nreasonable opportunity to take discovery.”81 Under Rule 56(d), this Court may defer \nconsideration of or deny summary judgment  if “a nonmovant shows by affidavit or \ndeclaration that, for specified reasons, it cannot present facts essential to justify its \nopposition” to a summary judgment motion.82 \n \n79 Defs.’ Resp. to Pls.’ Mtn. for Summ.

To be sure, six weeks is not a lot of time. \nBut the Owocs claim they need copies of  the employee handbook from Vital and \ncontracts with the various social media plat forms. All the Owocs ha d to do to obtain \nthose documents was serve one document pr oduction request on Vital and subpoenas \non the social media platforms. This is not a situation where the Owocs served \ndiscovery requests but have not yet receiv ed the responsive documents. The Owocs \nhave not served any discovery requests at all. \nThe Owocs’ request to defer consideratio n of Vital’s summary judgment motion \nfails for a more fundamental reason: they  do not “specifically demonstrate” how \npostponement will allow them to rebut Vital’s showing. In their summary judgment response, the Owocs allege that discover y will allow them to (1) investigate the \nfoundation for a statement in Vital’s support ing affidavit that the “vast majority” of \nthe 6,400 posts on the CEO Accounts promote Vital’s business and products; and (2) \n \n83 Smedley v.

Because the Owocs have failed to specifically \ndemonstrate how postponing summary judgment will allow them to rebut Vital’s \nshowing, the Court concludes summary judgment is not premature. IV. Conclusion \nGiven the overwhelming evidence in favor of Vital, the Court determines there \nis no genuine dispute of material fact and that Vital owns the rights to the CEO Accounts as a matter of law. By separate order, the Court will enter final judgment \nin favor of Vital on Counts I and II of its ad versary complaint declaring that the rights \nto the CEO Accounts are property of the esta te and ordering the Owocs to turn over \nthe CEO Accounts to Vital.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: The case involves a group of investors who claim they were defrauded by a purported AI-powered foreign exchange platform, RoFx.net. The plaintiffs allege that co-defendants, including ePayments Systems Ltd. (EPS), were involved in the fraudulent scheme. The court dismissed the case against EPS, citing a lack of personal jurisdiction since EPS's alleged involvement didn't demonstrate purposeful activities in Florida and failed to establish a concrete connection to the fraud conspiracy within the state. AI is involved here as the allure for the platform's forex operations, claimed to be powered by AI, which was allegedly part of the fraudulent representation to investors.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida has personal jurisdiction over ePayments Systems Ltd., a UK-based entity, based on its alleged involvement in RoFx.net’s fraudulent scheme.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court held that it lacks personal jurisdiction over EPS, concluding that the plaintiffs failed to establish sufficient facts showing EPS engaged in activities purposefully directed at Florida, or that EPS was a co-conspirator in actions that had a nexus to Florida.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine you are playing a game of tag, and someone from far away gets accused of cheating in the game. To call them out, you need to prove they were playing by coming to your playground and tagging people there.

    "full_text": "United States District Court \nfor the \nSouthern District of Florida \nRyan Birmingham and others, \nPlaintiffs, \nv.\n \nROFX.net and others, Defendants.\n ) \n) \n) \n) \n) ) Civil Action No. 21-23472-Civ-Scola \nOrder on Motion to Dismiss \nT his matter is before the Court upon the motion to dismiss filed by \nDefendant ePayments Systems Ltd. (“EPS”). (ECF No. 94.) The Plaintiffs are a group of investors who say they were defrauded by a web of actors tied to RoFx.net (“RoFx”). RoFx, they say, held itself out to be a foreign exchange platform motored by artificial intelligence that turned out to be nothing more than a sham. The Defendants are over forty individuals and entities said to be part of RoFx’s scheme. \nAmong them is EPS, a money transmitter based out of the United \nKingdom. (See Am. Compl. ¶ 133, ECF No. 64.) RoFx paid EPS a fee for receiving certain deposits as “directed by the RoFx Operators.” ( Id. at ¶¶ 133-\n39). The Plaintiffs assert seven counts against EPS: (1) RICO enterprise under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c); (2) RICO conspiracy under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d); (3) conspiracy to commit fraud; (4) aiding and abetting fraud; (5) conspiracy to commit conversion; (6) aiding and abetting conversion; and (7) unjust enrichment\n.  \nEPS challenges the Plaintiffs’ amended complaint on multiple grounds \nbut most importantly argues that the Court lacks personal jurisdiction over it. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(2). The Court agrees and grants EPS’s motion on that basis. (ECF No. 94.)  \n1. Legal Standard\n“A plaintiff seeking the exercise of personal jurisdiction over a \nnonresident defendant bears the initial burden of alleging in the complaint \nsufficient facts to make out a prima facie case of jurisdiction.” United Techs. Corp. v. Mazer, 556 F.3d 1260, 1274 (11th Cir. 2009). A federal court’s exercise \nof personal jurisdiction must: “(1) be appropriate under the state long-arm statute and (2) not violate the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment[.]” Id.  Case 1:21-cv-23472-RNS   Document 140   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/26/2022   Page 1 of 5 \n2. Florida’s Long-Arm Statute \nThe Plaintiffs say the Court has personal jurisdiction over EPS pursuant \nto Florida Statutes § 48.193(1)(a)(2). (Opp. 4, ECF No. 5.) That provision does \nnot require the “tortfeasor’s physical presence in Florida[.]” Horizon Aggressive Growth, L.P. v. Roths tein-Kass, P.A., 421 F.3d 1162, 1168 (11th Cir. 2005) \n(cleaned up). In conspiracy cases, it “can support personal jurisdiction over any alleged conspirator where any other co-conspirator commits an act in Florida in furtherance of the conspiracy, even if the defendant over whom personal jurisdiction is sought individually committed no act in, or had no relevant contact with, Florida.” Mazer, 556 F.3d at 1281-82.  \nFor the Court to assert personal jurisdiction on such grounds, though, \nthe Plaintiffs must allege viable facts from which the Court can reasonably infer that EPS was a co-conspirator. In other words, that EPS entered into a “conspiracy either engineered in Florida or [one] pursuant to which a tortious act in furtherance was committed in Florida.” See id.  at 1283.  \nThey do not. According to the Plaintiffs, EPS “would receive funds from \nRoFx customers and route the illicit funds as directed by the RoFx Operators—with little or no scrutiny. In return, [EPS] would receive an ‘affiliate fee.’” (Am. Compl. ¶ 135.) The crux of EPS’s involvement seems to be that it “received funds from RoFx customers totaling at least €34,997 and $7,500 among 11 \ntransactions.” ( Id. ¶¶ 137-38, 203.b.) These statements do not allow a \nreasonable inference that EPS conspired with RoFx. Although RoFx may have used EPS to further its own aims, the amended complaint falls short of establishing that EPS played a “conscious role” within RoFx’s conspiracy by “agree[ing] to conceal the flow of illicit proceeds from the RoFx Scheme.” (Opp. 5.) \nThe Eleventh Circuit’s analysis in Mazer is instructive. 556 F.3d at 1282. \nThere, the court found that personal jurisdiction was not warranted over a foreign corporation accused of stealing a competitor’s corporate records. Id. The \nMazer plaintiff pointed to the fact that the foreign corporation’s managing director traveled to Florida during the time period in which the corporate records were stolen. Id.  Citing this overlap in time, the plaintiff posited that the \nforeign corporation’s managing director was involved in a conspiracy to steal the records. Id. However, the Eleventh Circuit found that this theory “require[d] \ntoo great a speculative leap.” Id. In fact, it noted that the complaint could yield \n“other inferences,” as can the amended complaint here. \nAlthough the Plaintiffs say their amended complaint details “EPS’s \nconscious role” within RoFx’s scheme (Opp. 5), it does not. (See Am. Compl.  Case 1:21-cv-23472-RNS   Document 140   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/26/2022   Page 2 of 5¶¶ 128-29, 135-39, 229.) The amended complaint merely spells out the \nmultiple ways in which RoFx used EPS. Beyond the points discussed above, the Plaintiffs also point the Court to paragraph 229 of the amended complaint, where they say that Plaintiff Roman Leonov received an email from RoFx operators representing EPS to be its “brokerage subdivision.” (Am. Compl. ¶ 229.) But again, this only avers how RoFx used EPS. \nThe fact of the matter is that the Plaintiffs ask the Court to make an \ninferential leap as to EPS’s awareness of its role in RoFx’s scheme. The Plaintiffs point to the fact that RoFx used a shell entity to wire funds to EPS after RoFx customers forwarded funds to it individually. ( Id. ¶¶ 137-39.) This, \nthey say, is proof that EPS “knew its role receiving customer funds [would be] redundant and unnecessary if the transactions were [actually] legitimate, and that EPS was being paid merely to obfuscate the flow of funds for illicit transactions.” (Opp. 12.) The Plaintiffs also cite to “EPS’s apparent cessation of performing money laundering transactions in or around July 2019, [which] timed concurrently with RoFx Operators’ activation of [additional shell companies.]” ( Id.) Additionally, they point to the fact that the United Kingdom \nControl Authority suspended EPS for lapses in its anti-money laundering systems. ( Id. at 3.) Taken together, these points certainly could indicate a \nconspiracy but concluding that they should be seen together requires an inferential leap too far.  \nConclusory allegations concerning the existence of a conspiracy are \n“insufficient to establish a prima facie case of personal jurisdiction[.]” Snow v. DirecTV, Inc., 450 F.3d 1314, 1318 (11th Cir. 2006). The Plaintiffs’ factual allegations do not raise a reasonable inference that EPS was in cahoots with RoFx. The allegations instead much more readily allow for the reasonable inference that RoFx exploited EPS to further its purported scheme. To be sure, EPS was a money transmitter that advertised itself to businesses generally. (Am. Compl. ¶ 133.)  The fact that EPS charged RoFx a fee for its services is proof of a business relationship, not a conspiracy. Against this backdrop, the Plaintiffs cannot rely on EPS’ purported participation in a conspiracy with RoFx as the basis for personal jurisdiction under Section 48.193(1)(a)(2). \nThe Plaintiffs also rely on Horizon, 421 F.3d 1162, to argue that personal \njurisdiction is appropriate because EPS produced an injury in Florida. (Opp. 5, \n6.) In that decision, the Eleventh Circuit found that Florida courts recognize \npersonal jurisdiction over out-of-state defendants that “produce an injury in \nFlorida.” Horizon, 421 F.3d at 1168. It upheld personal jurisdiction “over an out-of-state auditing company that  .  .  .  telephonically contacted a Florida-based partnership and electronically accessed its computer files.” Id. at 1164. \nThat ruling involved factors not present here: first , the existence of these out-Case 1:21-cv-23472-RNS   Document 140   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/26/2022   Page 3 of 5of-state communications geared toward Florida, and second, a “connexity” \nbetween the out-of-state communication and the cause of action itself “such that the cause of action would depend upon proof of either the existence or the content of any of the communications into Florida.” See i d. at 1168 (cleaned \nup). Absent such communications geared toward Florida and any “connexity” between those communications and the Plaintiffs’ cause of action against EPS, the Court finds the Plaintiffs’ reliance on Horizon unavailing. Accordingly, \npersonal jurisdiction under Florida’s long-arm statute fails. \n3. Due Process Under the Fourteenth Amendment \nThe Court’s assertion of personal jurisdiction over EPS would also not \ncomport with the Fourteenth Amendment’s Due Process Clause. The Eleventh Circuit applies a three-part test when analyzing whether an exercise of specific jurisdiction comports with due process. It considers: “(1) whether the plaintiff's claims arise out of or relate to at least one of the defendant's contacts with the forum; (2) whether the nonresident defendant purposefully availed himself of the privilege of conducting activities within the forum state, thus invoking the benefit of the forum state’s laws; and (3) whether the exercise of personal jurisdiction comports with traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.” Tavakoli v. Doronin, No. 18-21592-CIV, 2019 WL 1242669, at *10 (S.D. Fla. Mar. 18, 2019) (Altonaga, J.) (citing Louis Vuitton Malletier, S.A. v. Mosseri , \n736 F.3d 1339, 1355 (11th Cir. 2013) (cleaned up)).  \nAbsent from the amended complaint is any mention of particular \ninstances in which EPS purposefully targeted Florida consumers, communicated with persons in Florida, or otherwise “purposefully availed” itself of the privilege of conducting business in the state. The Plaintiffs mention EPS’ direct receipt of client funds but they do not specify if any such clients were Florida-based. (See Am. Compl. ¶¶ 137-38.) Although the Plaintiffs rely on Tavakoli  to impute others’ Florida contacts onto EPS, the Court finds that case \ndistinguishable. There, unlike here, the plaintiffs pled the relevant defendant’s participation in concrete events that took place in Florida to further a conspiracy. See Tavakoli , 2019 WL 1242669 at *10 (“Eliasch traveled to Miami \nfor the April 22, 2014 Board meeting, stayed with Doronin at his Miami residence for three to four days around the date of the meeting, had dinner with Doronin in Miami to discuss matters related to Aman Resorts prior to the \nmeeting, and then participated in the PHRGL Board meeting in Miami.”)  \nThe Tavokoli  court imputed the above defendant’s Florida onto a foreign \nco-defendant corporate entity that had no Florida contacts of its own. See id. at \n*11-*12. But importantly, there was an immediate connection between the \ncorporate entity and the defendant with the Florida contacts—he owned 100% Case 1:21-cv-23472-RNS   Document 140   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/26/2022   Page 4 of 5of it. See Tavakoli , 2019 WL 1242669 at *3. By contrast, RoFx and EPS are \nseparate entities. Nowhere does the amended complaint allege the existence of \nFlorida contacts undertaken by any of EPS’s principals to allow for the sort of \nimputed contacts found in Tavakoli . Thus, the Plaintiffs fail to show how EPS \n“purposefully availed” itself of Florida either directly or imputably.  \nLast, the Plaintiffs suggest that the Court should invoke Federal Rule of \nCivil Procedure 4(k)(2) as a basis for asserting personal jurisdiction over EPS. \n“But courts rarely invoke jurisdiction under Rule 4(k)(2).” Noble House, LLC v. \nUnderwrit ers at Lloyd’s, London, 2021 WL 896219, at *5 (S.D. Fla. Mar. 3, \n2021) (Singhal, J.). Further, the Plaintiffs have not put forth any evidence that \nEPS “is not subject to jurisdiction in any state’s courts of general jurisdiction,” \nwhich is required to invoke the rule. Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(k)(2)(A).   \nAccordingly, the Court grants EPS’s motion (ECF No. 94) for want of \npersonal jurisdiction.  \nDone \nand ordered at Miami, Florida, on May 26, 2022. \n________________________________ \nRobert N.

BACKGROUND  \nThis case arises out of a business relationship between the parties.  O&O \n1–3, ECF No. 152.  Defendants  developed a software platform that used artificial \nintelligence to analyze mergers, acquisitions, and other investment opportun ities \n(the “Software” ).  Id.  In the summer of 2018, the parties negotiated and entered \ninto an agreement  which provided for the sale of the Software to Stratesphere , \nLLC.  Id.  The parties ’ relationship soured and, eventually, Plaintiffs filed this \nlawsuit, asserting several claims against Defendants.  See, e.g. , Compl., ECF \nNo. 4.  Defendants also assert multiple  counterclaims against Plaintiffs.  See, \ne.g., Ans., ECF No. 6.   \n The parties moved for summary judgment on several claims and \ncounterclaims.  ECF Nos. 140 & 143.  The O&O addressed only the fraudulent \ninducement claim.  O&O, ECF No. 152.  The Court concluded that there was no \ngenuine dispute  of material fact as to any element of Defendants’ fraudulent \ninducement claim  and, therefore,  the Court gr anted summary judgment to \nDefendants on that claim.  Id.  Defendants had indicated that , if they were \nsuccessful on the fraudulent inducement claim, they would seek to rescind the \nparties ’ contract.  Id.  Thus, the Court concluded it would be prudent to see if \nDefendants still sought recission before the Court addressed the contract-based claims.  Id .  The Court scheduled a teleconference with the parties to discuss \nnext steps; a few days before that conference, Plaintiffs moved the Court to Case: 2:20-cv-02972-MHW-CMV Doc #: 159 Filed: 05/05/23 Page: 2 of 7  PAGEID #: <pageID>Case No. 2:20 -cv-2972  Page 3 of 7 \n reconsider the O&O  or, in the alternative, to certify a question to the Supreme \nCourt of Ohio .  Id.; ECF No. 153.   \nII. MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION  \nUnder Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(b), court s may reconsider an \ninterlocutory order  at any time prior to entry of final judgment.   Rodriguez v. \nTenn. Laborers Health & Welfare Fund, 89 F. App ’x 949, 959 (6th Cir. 2004).   \nReconsideration of an interlocutory order is appropriate where there is:  “(1) an \nintervening change of controlling law; (2)  new evidence available; or (3)  a need to \ncorrect a clear error or prevent manifest injustice. ” Louisville/Jefferson Cty. Metro \nGov’t v. Hotels.com, L.P., 590 F.3d 381, 389 (6th Cir. 2009)  (internal quotation \nmarks and citations omitted).  Motions for reconsideration are “not intended to re-\nlitigate issues previously considered by the Court or to present evidence that \ncould have been raised earlier .”  Premier Dealer Servs., Inc. v. Allegiance \nAdm’rs, LLC, No. 2:18 -CV-735, 2022 WL 1166231, at *1 (S.D. Ohio Apr. 20, \n2022)  (internal citations marks and citations omitted).  “ Generally, a manifest \ninjustice or a clear error of law requires unique circumstances, such as injunctive relief scenarios or superseding factual scenarios. ”  McWhorter v. ELSEA, Inc., \nNo. 2:00 -cv-473, 2006 WL 3483964, at *2 (S.D. Ohio Nov. 30, 2006) ( citing \ncases).   \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 59(e) “enables a district court to ‘rectify its \nown mistakes in the period immediately following ’ its decision. ”  Banister v. \nDavis, 140 S. Ct. 1698, 1703 (2020) (quoting White v. New Hampshire Dep’t of Case: 2:20-cv-02972-MHW-CMV Doc #: 159 Filed: 05/05/23 Page: 3 of 7  PAGEID #: <pageID>Case No. 2:20 -cv-2972  Page 4 of 7 \n Emp’t Sec., 455 U.S. 445, 450 (1982)).   To grant a motion filed under Rule 59(e), \nthere must be “(1)  a clear error of law; (2)  newly discovered evidence; (3)  an \nintervening change in controlling law; or (4)  a need to prevent manifest injustice. ”  \nLeisure Caviar, LLC v. U.S. Fi sh & Wildlife Serv., 616 F.3d 612, 615 (6th Cir. \n2010) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  \nPlaintiffs argue that reconsideration is warranted due to a need to correct a \nclear error or prevent manifest injustice.2   \nWorking backwards, there is  no need to prevent  manifest injustice here.  \nPlaintiffs ’ motion does little more than rehash the issues presented on summary \njudgment.  Plaintiffs cannot use a motion under Rule 54(b) or 59(e) as an \nopportunity to re -litigate arguments that could have been —or actually were —\nraised earlier.  Premier Dealer Servs., Inc. , 2022 WL 1166231, at *1  (citation \nomitted).  There  is no “manifest injustice ” in declining to give Plaintiffs  a second \nbite at the apple.  Cf. McGrew v. Zaring Homes, Inc., 78 F.3d 584 (Table) (6th \nCir. 1996) (“The district court was not required to give [the plaintiff] a second ‘ bite \nat the apple ’ and grant the motion for reconsideration. ”).  Thus, there is no \n“manifest injustice ” that would warrant recons ideration here.  \n \n2 To whatever extent Plaintiffs argue that reconsideration is warranted due to new \nevidence—namely, the documents attached to Plaintiffs ’ reply (the “ Documents ”)—that \nargument is unavailing.  “ New evidence”  is evidence that was not previously available or \ndiscoverable.  See  CGH Transport, Inc. v. Quebecor World, Inc. , 261 Fed. App ’x 817, \n823 (6th Cir. 2008) ; cf. Louisville/Jefferson Cty. Metro Gov’t , 590 F.3d at 389.  Here, \nPlaintiffs represent that the Documents date from March 2018 and were produced in \ndiscovery.  Reply 8, ECF No. 156.  Thus, the Court sees no reason Plaintiffs could not \nhave presented the Documents on summary judgment and, therefore, reconsideration \nbased on newly discovered evidence is unwarranted.   Case: 2:20-cv-02972-MHW-CMV Doc #: 159 Filed: 05/05/23 Page: 4 of 7  PAGEID #: <pageID>Case No. 2:20 -cv-2972  Page 5 of 7 \n Plaintiffs ’ arguments that the Court committed clear error are likewise \nunavailing.  The  main thrust of their argument is, essentially, that the Court \nmisinterpreted or misapplied the relevant caselaw in the O&O  and that a correct \ninterpretation would have resulted in a different —and more Plaintiffs -friendly —\noutcome.   However, at bottom, this  “clear error ” argument  simply repackages \nPlaintiffs ’ arguments on summary judgment  and is better directed in an appeal as \nopposed to a motion for reconsideration.   As just explained, “[m]otions for \nreconsideration are not intended to re -litigate issues previously considered by the \nCourt.”  Premier Dealer Servs., Inc., 2022 WL 1166231, at *1 (internal quotation \nmarks and citations omitted).  In sum, Plaintiffs ha ve not demonstrated that the \nCourt committed clear error in the O&O.  Nor, after its own reflection, does the \nCourt find any such error.   \nFor these reasons, the motion for recons ideration is DENIED.  \nIII. MOTION TO CERTIFY A QUESTION TO THE SUPREME COURT OF \nOHIO  \nPlaintiffs move to certify the following question to the Supreme Court of \nOhio: Does a contractual reliance disclaimer preclude a party from claiming \njustifiable reliance on alleged representations not included in the contract?  \nThe Supreme  Court of Ohio provides in its Rule of Practice 9.01 that it \n“may answer a question of law certified to it by a court of the United States. ”  The \nRule “is invoked if the certifying court, in a proceeding before it, issues a  \ncertification order finding there is a question of Ohio law that may be Case: 2:20-cv-02972-MHW-CMV Doc #: 159 Filed: 05/05/23 Page: 5 of 7  PAGEID #: <pageID>Case No. 2:20 -cv-2972  Page 6 of 7 \n determinative of the proceeding and for which there is no controlling precedent in \nthe decisions of this Supreme Court. ”  Ohio S.Ct.Prac.R. 9.01.  Wheth er to certify \na question to a state court “rests in the sound discretion of the federal court.”   \nLehman Bros. v. Schein , 416 U.S. 386, 391 (1974).  “Certification is most \nappropriate when the question is new and state law is unsettled, but the federal courts generally will not trouble our sister state courts every time an arguably \nunsettled question of state law comes across our desks.”  City of Columbus, Ohio v. Hotels.com L.P., 693 F.3d 642, 654 (6th Cir. 2012)  (question marks and \ncitation omitted).  Further , “certification is disfavored where a plaintiff files in \nfederal court and then, after an unfavorable judgment, seeks refuge in a state \nforum.”  Id . (cleaned up).  \nHere, Plaintiffs  request certification for the first time after receiving the \nCourt ’s decision on summary judgment .  In doing so, Plaintiffs seek “another bite \nat the apple, which is not the function of the certification process.”  Gascho v. Global Fitness Holdings, LLC , 918 F. Supp. 2d 708, 713 (S.D. Ohio 2013).   The \nappropriate time fo r Plaintiffs to seek certification was “ before a District Court \nresolves the issue, not after receiving an unfavorable ruling. ”  Geronimo v. \nCaterpillar, Inc ., 440 F. App ’x 442, 449 (6th Cir. 2011) (internal citations and \nquotations omitted).   Thus , Plaint iffs should have submitted their  questions for \ncertification at a previous stage in the case, and the m otion is not now well taken .  \nAccordingly, the motion to certify a question to the Supreme Court of Ohio is DENIED.

CONCLUSION  \nFor these reasons, Plaintiffs’ motion is DENIED; Defendant s’ motion to file \na sur -reply is DENIED.  The parties are ORDERED  to appear for a \nteleconference at 10:30 a.m.  on May 11, 2023.   \nThe Clerk shall terminate ECF Nos. 153 and 157.  \nIT IS SO ORDERED.  \n       \n___/s/ Michael H.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: The Plaintiff, Hanan Alomran, filed a pro se complaint against Marriott Vacations Worldwide Corporation, alleging fraudulent inducement and other claims relating to a misrepresented buy-back program for Marriott Trust Points purchased at a sales presentation. The court dismissed the complaint, primarily because the plaintiff, being pro se, could not represent a class under the Class Action Fairness Act (CAFA), and failed to establish federal jurisdiction due to lack of diversity and absence of a federal question. Notably, the case does not involve AI, machine learning, or automated systems.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: The key legal issue is whether the court has subject matter jurisdiction over the case, given the plaintiffs’ inability to represent a class as pro se litigants under CAFA and the lack of federal questions or complete diversity.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court granted Marriott’s Motion to Dismiss, ruling that the plaintiffs could not establish subject matter jurisdiction under CAFA without legal representation, lacked federal question jurisdiction, and did not meet the requirements for diversity jurisdiction. The plaintiffs were given the option to amend their complaint or pursue their state law claims in Florida state court.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine you go to a hotel presentation and buy some reward points because the presenter promises that the hotel will buy them back anytime if you want. Later, you find out the buy-back option doesn't exist and you can't sell your points back. You try to sue the hotel on behalf of others with similar issues, but because you're not a lawyer and there's no federal involvement, the court tells you that you can't represent others in this suit. The court says you should either hire a lawyer or file the case in a state court where it's better suited.",

[D.E.  6]. Plaintiffs have filed a \nresponse [D.E. 11], to which Marriott has replied. [D.E . 15]. The Motion, therefore, is \nripe for disposition. After careful review of the briefing and relevant authorities, and \nfor the reasons set forth below, Marriott’s Motion is GRANTED .1 \n \n   \n \n1 The Undersigned is the presiding consent Judge on this case, as no party timely \nrequested reassignment . [D.E. 10]. Case 1:25-cv-22276-EGT   Document 41   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/18/2025   Page 1 of 72 \n I. BACKGROUND2 \nThis case arises out of Plaintiffs’ purchase of a timeshare, which ostensibly has \ngone awry.  The Complaint alleges that on July 21, 2022, Plaintiffs attended a \nMarriott sales presentation, facilitated by co -Defendants Jonathan Cabrera and \nJames Martinez. Subsequently, Plaintiffs purchased Marriott “Trust Points,” under \nthe impression that Marriot t would buy back the points if Plaintiffs desired , and \nexecuted an agreement with Marriott . \nA week later, on July 27, 2022, Mr. Cabrera informed Plaintiff that there was \nan error in the paperwork, and asked Plaintiffs to return to the premises to re -sign. \nPlaintiffs complied, and signed that agreement.  \nOn April 7, 2025, Plaintiffs contacted Marriott to invoke the buy -back program.  \nIn response, Plaintiffs were informed that their only option would be to sell the Trust \nPoints on the open market, or to transfer title back to Marriott.  After contacting Mr. \nMartinez, he informed Plaintiffs that the buy -back program does not exist, and the \nexecutive (presumably Mr. Cabrera) who  told Plaintiffs that it did exis t, was no longer \nwith Marriott. Th e alleged misrepresentation  of the buy -back program , argues \nPlaintiffs, constitutes a systemic direction from management to fraudulently induce \ntimeshare agreements.  \nConsequently, o n May 19, 2025 , Plaintiffs filed this pro se Complaint. They \nallege claims of: (1) fraudulent inducement, (2) negligent misrepresentation, (3) \npromissory estoppel (or alternatively, breach of contract), (4) violations of the Florida \n \n2 The Court presents the facts as alleged in the Complaint, accepting all factual \nallegations as true.  Case 1:25-cv-22276-EGT   Document 41   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/18/2025   Page 2 of 73 \n Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act (“FDUTPA”), and (5) unjust enrichment. \nPlaintiffs also seek to represent a class, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \n23(a).  \nIn the pending Motion, Marriott move to dismiss the Complaint in its entirety, \nor alternatively to compel arbitration, for several reasons, including: (1) lack of subject matter jurisdiction, (2) the presence of a binding arbitration clause, (3) \nimproper v enue, (4) that the Complaint is a shotgun pleading, and (5) failure to state \na claim(s).  \nII. ANALYSIS  \nWe will first assess Marriott’s contention that the Court lacks subject matter \njurisdiction. On that score, Marriott argue s that Plaintiffs do not allege a squarely \nfederal claim, nor does complete diversity exist. Plaintiffs only pleaded avenue for  \nfederal  jurisdiction, Marriott argues, is their reference to the Class Action Fairness \nAct (“CAFA”). But because Plaintiffs are proceeding pro se, Plaintiffs waived the right \nto a class action in the parties’ contract, and Plaintiffs otherwise fail to state a cl aim, \nMarriot argues that CAFA does not confer subject matter jurisdiction.  \nIn response, Plaintiffs do not argue that they plead ed any federal claims, nor \ndo they argue that they plead ed complete diversity. Rather, Plaintiffs argue that, \nnotwithstanding their pro se status, CAFA confers subject matter jurisdiction.  \nA. CAFA Jurisdiction  \nWe agree with Marriott that, under CAFA, a pro se plaintiff cannot proceed as \na class representative. “Courts have repeatedly held that a pro se plaintiff ‘ cannot be Case 1:25-cv-22276-EGT   Document 41   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/18/2025   Page 3 of 74 \n an adequate class representative ’ or litigate on behalf of others. ” Dorival v. Sec'y of \nDHS , No. 19 -10210 -CV, 2020 WL 13548094, at *1 (S.D. Fla. Feb. 5, 2020), report and \nrecommendation adopted , 2020 WL 13548095 (S.D. Fla. Feb. 24, 2020) ). Here,  that is \nprecisely what Plaintiffs seek to do. In their pursuit,  the pro se Plaintiffs do not \ndemonstrate why this case should be distinct from the litany of cases in which a pro \nse plaintiff was barred from representing a class. See, e.g., Bass v. Benton , 408 F. \nApp'x 298, 299 (11th Cir. 2011) (“Because Tacy [who was proceeding pro se] may not \nrepresent the plaintiffs in a class action suit, the district court properly dismissed \nTacy's § 1983 complaint.”) ; Johnson v. Brown, 581 F. App'x 777, 781 (11th Cir. 2014) \n(“Johnson filed this action pro se and does not appeal the district court's subsequent \ndenial of his request for the appointment of counsel. As a pro se litigant, Johnson \ncannot bring an action on behalf of his fell ow orthodox Muslim inmates .”); In re \nTaylor, Bean, & Whitaker Mortg. Corp. , No. 3:09 -BK-7047- JAF, 2011 WL 5245420, at \n*2 (Bankr. M.D. Fla. Oct. 24, 2011)  (citing Wallace v. Smith , 145 F. App'x 300, 302 \n(11th Cir.  2005) ) (“As an initial matter, pro se litigants may not represent a class.  … \nPlaintiffs will be permitted to file an amended complaint; however, they will only be \npermitted to bring claim(s) on behalf of themselves. ”); Wall v. Sw. Airlines , No. 6:21 -\nCV-1008- PGB -DCI, 2021 WL 8201960, at *3 (M.D. Fla. Oct. 28, 2021)  (striking \ncomplaint  for lack of subject matter jurisdiction  because the pro se plaintiffs sought \nto represent a class, and finding “that the prohibition against pro se litigants \nrepresenting the interest of others applies before a court addresses certification ”); \nDavis v. Johnson , No. 1:15 -CV-4137- TWT -JKL, 2016 WL 3360568, at *2 (N.D. Ga. Case 1:25-cv-22276-EGT   Document 41   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/18/2025   Page 4 of 75 \n Apr. 22, 2016), report and recommendation adopted , 2016 WL 3349343 (N.D. Ga. \nJune 15, 2016) ) (“In its motion to dismiss, the government argues that Davis, as a pro \nse non -lawyer, may not represent other individuals in a class action.  Courts have not \nallowed pro se litigants to serve as class representative in class actions because they \ncannot fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class under Fed. R. Civ. P. \n23(a)(4). Thus, to the extent that Davis was attempting to initiate a class action under  \nRule 23, he may not serve as a class representative for others. ”). \nPlaintiffs do argue that, for purposes of this Motion to Dismiss, their lack of \ncounsel is curable at a later stage. But in support, Plaintiffs cite to several fictional \ncases, presumably produced from an artificial intelligence search engine.  Outside of \nthis imaginary support, Plaintiffs provide no other authority for how CAFA confers \nsubject matter jurisdiction despite Plaintiffs’ pro se status.  And we known of none. \nThe Court ’s subject matter jurisdiction cannot be founded on speculation or good fa ith \nintentions.  See Taylor v. Appleton , 30 F.3d 1365, 1366 (11th Cir. 1994) (\"(A) court \nmust first determine whether it has proper subject matter jurisdiction before \naddressing the substantive issues.\").  \nAccordingly, Plaintiffs cannot proceed under CAFA without being represented \nby counsel , and therefore, CAFA does not confer subject matter jurisdiction in this \ncase. \nB. Federal Question Jurisdiction  \n“The presence or absence of federal -question jurisdiction is governed by the \n‘well-pleaded complaint rule, ’ which provides that federal jurisdiction exists only Case 1:25-cv-22276-EGT   Document 41   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/18/2025   Page 5 of 76 \n when a federal question is presented on the face of the plaintiff's properly pleaded \ncomplaint. ” Caterpillar Inc. v. Williams, 482 U.S. 386, 392  (1987) . Outside of the \nCAFA assertion, each of Plaintiffs’ claims are brought under Florida law  and do not \nraise a substantial question of federal law . Indeed, Plaintiffs’ state law claims raise \nquestions of fraud, negligence, breach of contract, unjust enrichment and FDUTPA, \nnone of which (as pleaded) raise any questions of federal law.  \nThus, there exists no federal question jurisdiction. See D unlap v. G&L Holding \nGrp., Inc. , 381 F.3d 1285, 1297 –98 (11th Cir. 2004)  (“We conclude that the district \ncourt improperly exercised subject matter jurisdiction over state -law claims that \nneither raised a substantial federal question nor were completely preempted by \nfederal law. ”). \nC. Diversity Jurisdiction  \nNor does complete diversity exist. “ Diversity jurisdiction requires complete \ndiversity; every plaintiff must be diverse from every defendant. ” Triggs v. John \nCrump Toyota, Inc. , 154 F.3d 1284, 1287 (11th Cir. 1998) . As Marriott points out (in \nan uncontested manner),  and as Plaintiffs allege in their own Complaint [D.E. 1 at \n¶¶ 2, 3],  Marriott’s principal place of business is in Florida  and Mr. Alyaqout is a \ncitizen of Florida . Consequently, because Defendant -Marriott and Plaintiff -Alyaqout \nare residents of the same state (as pleaded) , complete diversity is lacking  under 28 \nU.S.C. § 1332.  See McConico v. Cochran Firm , 581 F. App'x 838 (11th Cir. 2014)  \n(“Diversity did not exist here. In his complaint, the plaintiff, McConico, alleged \nAlabama citizenship for himself and four of the named individual defendants. He also Case 1:25-cv-22276-EGT   Document 41   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/18/2025   Page 6 of 77 \n alleged that the defendant -corporation, The Cochran Firm, had its principal place of \nbusiness in, and is therefore a citizen of, Alabama. Due to the lack of complete \ndiversity, the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction. The district court did \nnot err in dismissing the case. ”). \nAccordingly, because we lack subject matter jurisdiction, Marriott’s Motion  to \nDismiss  is granted. Plaintiffs, however, have leave to amend their complain t. Within \n14 days of this Order, Plaintiffs may (1) retain counsel prior to filing their Amended Complaint , if they wish to proceed under CAFA, and/or (2) plead a cognizable claim \nunder federal law, if such a claim can be plead ed in good faith.  Alternatively, \nPlaintiffs may wish to re -file their state law claims in  Florida  state court  and forego \nany attempts at establishing a basis for federal jurisdiction . \nIII. CONCLUSION  \nFor the reasons set forth above, Marriott’s Motion [D.E. 6] is GRANTED. \nPlaintiffs’ Complaint is dismissed without prejudice; an Amended Complaint must be \nfiled within 14 days of this Order, unless Plaintiffs no longer seek  federal jurisdiction . \nDONE and ORDERED in Chambers at Miami, Florida this  18th day of \nAugust, 2025.  \n/s/ Edwin G.

Summary: The plaintiffs filed a lawsuit against the developers of Michigan's Unemployment Insurance Agency's automated system, MiDAS, which allegedly falsely detected fraud in unemployment claims without adequate human oversight or proper notification to the claimants. The court denied the defendants' motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, finding that the plaintiffs sufficiently established standing, as their injuries from the fraud determinations were fairly traceable to the defendants' involvement with the automated system.\n\n2. Key Legal Issue: Whether the plaintiffs have Article III standing to sue due to their alleged injuries being fairly traceable to the automated fraud detection system (MiDAS) developed and implemented with the assistance of the defendants, despite the claims not being fully processed or adjudicated by the system.\n\n3. Court's Holding: The court held that the plaintiffs adequately demonstrated an injury-in-fact that was fairly traceable to the defendants' actions. The motion to dismiss on the grounds of subject matter jurisdiction was denied, allowing the procedural due process claim against the defendants to proceed.\n\n4. ELI5 explanation: Imagine a robot was built to catch people cheating on their homework, but it made a lot of mistakes. Some people got in trouble unfairly because the robot said they cheated without properly checking if they really did. The people who got in trouble sued the people who helped build the robot. The court said these people could continue with their lawsuit because they showed that their troubles were connected to the robot's mistakes, which the builders helped create.",

Honorable David M. Lawson  FAST ENTERPRISES LLC, CSG GOVERNMENT SOLUTIONS, STEPHEN GESKEY,  SHEMIN BLUNDELL, DORIS MITCHELL, DEBRA SINGLETON, and SHARON  MOFFET-MASSEY,     Defendants. __________________________________________/   \nOPINION AND ORDER DENYING MOTIONS BY FAST  \nENTERPRISES LLC AND CSG GOVERNM ENT SOLUTIONS TO DISMISS \nFOR WANT OF SUBJECT MATTER JURISDICTION \n \n The five named plaintiffs have commenced this putative class acti on to recover damages \nallegedly caused by the State of Michigan’s Unemployment Insurance Agency’s (UIA) \nimplementation of an automated system to detect  and punish individuals who submitted fraudulent \nunemployment insurance claims.  They say that they  are victims of the system’s many failures: it \nlacked human oversight, it detected fraud by cert ain claimants where none existed, it provided \nlittle or no notice to the accused claimants, it failed in many inst ances to allow administrative \nappeals, and it assessed penalties and forfeitures ag ainst individuals who we re blameless.  Their \namended complaint listed twelve counts against th e companies and individuals whom they believe \ncontributed to the State’s implementation of th e flawed fraud-adjudication system.  The case has \nbeen whittled down through motion practice and an interlocutory app eal, and now only one Case 2:17-cv-10657-DML-RSW   ECF No. 495, PageID.<pageID>   Filed 12/21/20   Page 1 of 28-2- \n procedural due process claim re mains.  The defendants have f iled a second round of motions to \ndismiss, raising for the first time that the Court lacks subject matter  jurisdiction over the dispute.   \n  Defendants FAST Enterprises LLC and CS G Government Solutions argue that the \nplaintiffs cannot establish Article III standing because (1 ) they failed to dem onstrate an injury-in-\nfact because their claims were not  entirely adjudicated by the Michigan Integrated Data Automated \nSystem (MiDAS); (2) their alleged injuries are not fairly traceable to the corporate defendants; and \n(3) plaintiffs Patti Jo Cahoo, Kristen Mendyk, and Kh adija Cole are precluded from bringing their \nclaims because they failed to disclose their prop erty interests in this cause of action during their \nrespective bankruptcy proceedings.   The plaintiffs adequately have established standing.  Although the plaintiffs’ fraud cases \nmay not entirely have been auto-adjudicated by MiDAS, the UIA determined that each of the \nplaintiffs committed fra ud by applying the UIA’s logic trees, which mandated a finding of fraud \nwhenever a plaintiff fail ed to respond to a MiDAS-issued ques tionnaire.  Moreover, each plaintiff \nsufficiently demonstrated that th e UIA did not provide adequate notice of the plaintiffs’ fraud \ndeterminations and subsequent efforts to coll ect on their debts.  And because FAST and CSG \nworked hand-in-hand with the UIA in develo ping and managing the Mi DAS system (which \nincluded the deficient notice procedures), the plai ntiffs’ alleged injuries are fairly traceable to \nthem.  The record requires further factual de velopment on the accrual dates for the due process \nclaims of plaintiffs Cahoo, Cole and Mendyk vis- à-vis their bankruptcy filings, and there is \ninsufficient information to rule out ratification by a potential real  party in interest under Federal \nRule of Civil Procedure 17(a)(3).  The motions will be denied.     Case 2:17-cv-10657-DML-RSW   ECF No. 495, PageID.<pageID>   Filed 12/21/20   Page 2 of 28-3- \n I.  Background \n The facts of the case are well known to the pa rties and have been discussed in previous \nopinions issued by this Court and the court of appeals.  See Cahoo v. SAS Inst. Inc. , 322 F. Supp. \n3d 772, 785-89 (E.D. Mich. 2018), aff’d in part, rev’d in part and remanded sub nom.  Cahoo v. \nSAS Analytics Inc. , 912 F.3d 887 (6th Cir. 2019).  The dispute focuses on an automated fraud \ndetection computer application that the UIA implemented somet ime around 2013 known as \nMiDAS, which stands for the Mi chigan Integrated Data Automated System.  MiDAS was \ndeveloped to search for discrepancies in the records of unemployment compensation recipients, \nautomatically determine whet her the claimants committed fraud, and execute collection \nproceedings, which included intercepting tax refu nds and garnishing wages.  Auto-adjudication is \na process that starts with the automated generation of a flag, then leads to the automated generation of questionnaires, then to an automated dete rmination based on logic trees, followed by an \nautomated generation of a notice of fraud deter mination, then automated collection activity.   \n MiDAS, by no means a marvel of artificial  intelligence, operated on automated “logic \ntrees.”  It adjudicated fraud in  “stages,” which included “cre ated,” “opened,” “pending fact \nfinding,” “determination issued,” and “issue closed.”   If the word “batch” appeared next to any \nstage, it signified that MiDAS ha d changed the status automatical ly.  A human could perform any \nof these stages, except for the ge neration of the fraud questionnaire .  But human involvement could \nonly be established if a staff me mber edited the file, which coul d be seen in the system.   \n When MiDAS detected some discrepancy between employer-paid wages and employee-\nclaimed eligibility, it au tomatically issued  questionnaires to the clai mant.  Failure to respond \ntimely to a questionnaire (10 da ys for “green” claimants and 14 days for those corresponding via \npaper) resulted in a default determination that the claimant knowingly and intentionally Case 2:17-cv-10657-DML-RSW   ECF No. 495, PageID.<pageID>   Filed 12/21/20   Page 3 of 28-4- \n misrepresented or concealed inform ation to receive benefits unlaw fully.  When a claimant did \nrespond to the questionnaire, MiDAS’s programming,  based on its logic trees, found intentional \nfraud whenever a claimant chose certain multiple-c hoice options on the form, even if she indicated \nthat she did not intentionally  provide false information.  MiDAS had no programming that \npermitted it to determine whether a claimant intentionally misled the UIA or concealed \ninformation.    MiDAS made an automated fraud determination, usually at night, base d on the UIA’s logic \ntrees.  Staff members could also make the fraud determinations based on the same logic trees.  In either instance, the case would be staged from “pending adjudication” to  “determination issued” \nto “issue closed,” and the name of whoever made the decision would appear  beside the stages on \nthe “Nonmonetary Issue” screen.  MiDAS woul d then automatically issue a notice of \ndetermination.    Once a default fraud determination was made , MiDAS automatically issued three notices: \na primary “Notice of Determination” (Form 13 02), which explained why the UIA believed it \noverpaid (e.g., a claimant quitting a job voluntarily ) but not its reasoning for why it believed the \nplaintiff’s alleged misrepresentation was intentional; another “Notice of Determination” (also Form 1302), which generally informed the claimant that his or her actions misled or concealed information to obtain benefits a nd announced that benefits were terminated on any active claims; \nand a “List of Overpayments,” which demanded pa yment of actual benefits overpaid as well as a \nstatutory penalty for fraudulent mi srepresentation of two-to-four times that amount, depending on \nwhether the value of improper pa yments equaled or exceeded $500.  Confusingly, the first two \nnotices have the same title and same fo rm numbers, but different contents.   Case 2:17-cv-10657-DML-RSW   ECF No. 495, PageID.<pageID>   Filed 12/21/20   Page 4 of 28-5- \n  The primary determination notices indicated that claimants were entitled to appeal a \ndetermination of fraud to an Admin istrative Law Judge (ALJ) within 30 days.  But the notices did \nnot inform claimants about their ab ilities to file late appeals for good cause.  And because of errors \nin notifying claimants, many cla imants did not become aware of their assessments until after the \nappeal deadlines passed.   If a claimant did not appeal the determinati on within 30 days, MiDAS automatically issued \na letter (Form 1088) demanding that  the claimant pay restitution, a penalty, and accrued interest.  \nIf a claimant failed to pay the charges voluntarily, MiDAS issued ta x refund intercepts to the IRS \nand State of Michigan.  And if intercepting a claimant’s tax re turns did not satisfy the claimant’s \ndebt, the UIA then garnished his or her wages.    In August 2015, the UIA deactivated MiDAS’s auto-adjudication processes relating to \nclaimant fraud.  In a lawsuit br ought against UIA personnel, this Court found flaws in the State’s \nrobo-fraud-detection system and eventually appr oved a settlement agreement in which the State \nagreed, among other things, to suspend all coll ection activity under the au tomated system and to \nreview determinations of claimant fraud that had been reached while it was using the auto-adjudication function.  See Zynda v. Arwood , 175 F. Supp. 3d 791 (E.D. Mich. 2016).  Later, \nMichigan enacted new legislation that prohibits  fraud determinations ba sed solely on computer-\nidentified discrepancies.    The plaintiffs allege that th e defendants worked together with  the state to design, maintain, \noperate, and implement the robo-fra ud-detection and adjudication system.  As a consequence of \nthe inherent flaws built into the system, the plain tiffs contend, the defendants, operating as state \nactors, have taken property from them through the automated system that labeled them fraudsters, Case 2:17-cv-10657-DML-RSW   ECF No. 495, PageID.<pageID>   Filed 12/21/20   Page 5 of 28-6- \n and then assessed and collected fines and penaltie s, all without notice a nd an opportunity to be \nheard.  \nA. FAST \n FAST Enterprises, LLC, a software company, contracted with the St ate of Michigan on \nAugust 29, 2011, to “design, configure and implem ent its GenTAX comme rcial-off-the-shelf” \nsoftware for the UIA’s use in administering  unemployment insurance, including fraud \ninvestigation, overpayments, coll ections, and tax intercepts.  FAST’s involvement with MiDAS \nwas substantial.  It contracted to configur e “almost all aspects of ” MiDAS and train UIA \nemployees on how to use the system.  It also agreed to develop the templates of all MiDAS \ncorrespondence, including questionnaires and de termination notices, a nd ensured that the \ntemplates complied with “Federal an d State law delivery requirements.”  \n The UIA provided FAST with business rules, or logic trees, to implement in the system. \nThe logic trees broke down the various ways on e may be determined to have misrepresented \nmaterial information, such as by  failing timely to answer a qu estionnaire.  Although FAST coded \nthe software, UIA witness Clayton Tierney made clea r that the functi ons of the software (i.e., the \nlogic trees) were controlled exclusively by th e UIA.  Moreover, although FAST’s contract \nobligated it to develop the temp lates for MiDAS correspondence, UI A witnesses test ified that “no \nCSG, FAST, or SAS employees were involved in determining the content or crafting the language \nof those notices or questionna ires sent to claimants.”   \nB. CSG \n The State first retained CSG, a consulting co mpany from Chicago, to he lp devise a request \nfor proposal for the development of MiDAS.  Around February 2010, CSG contracted with the \nState to run and administer th e project control office, which was responsible for overseeing the Case 2:17-cv-10657-DML-RSW   ECF No. 495, PageID.<pageID>   Filed 12/21/20   Page 6 of 28-7- \n implementation of MiDAS.  CSG’s responsibilities grew and it eventu ally played two roles for the \nUIA — one as an advisor, the other as a project manager. \n1.  Advisory Role \n CSG assisted the State with improving its fraud detection and ove rpayment collection \nactivities by analyzing the UIA’s cu rrent practices, researching othe r state practices, and devising \nshort- and long-term solutions to  meet the UIA’s goals.   CSG played an advisory role; the UIA \nhad exclusive authority to set su ch policies and procedures and ne ver delegated that authority to \nCSG.  CSG was not responsible fo r determining the algorithms or logic trees that the UIA intended \nfor the MiDAS software.    In its advisory role, CSG developed the UIA’s income-spr eading policy — it  recommended \nthat the UIA “prorate earnings” to “establish a ny resulting overpayment” “[w]hen there is no \nemployer response and [a] claimant  does not provide credible earn ings informatio n.”  It also \nrecommended that the UIA “[r]everse the current Ag ency culture where staff is reluctant to render \na fraud determination because it is viewed as to o punitive on the claimant.”  For example, CSG \nsuggested that the UIA u pdate its fraud questionnai re (Form 1070) to  reduce the available answers \nthat resulted in findings of non- fraudulent activity (like asking  claimants whether overpayments \nresulted from a mistake).  However, CSG also recommended that the UI A clarify the wording on \nits questionnaire by (1) changing the title to make  clear that the inquiry related to fraud; (2) \nexplaining in bold text that the claimant’s employer provided suff icient information warranting a \nfinding of overpayment; and (3) including the potential amount of  overpayment, penalties, and \ndisqualifications based on th e information available.   \n  The UIA eventually developed a new fraud questionnaire (Form 1713), but contrary to \nCSG’s recommendations, it did not include any new, clarifying language, nor did it provide factual Case 2:17-cv-10657-DML-RSW   ECF No. 495, PageID.<pageID>   Filed 12/21/20   Page 7 of 28-8- \n information about the fraud allega tions, as the previous questionnair es did.  Rather, the new form \nincluded potentially incriminatory multiple-choice an swers designed to elicit binary answers that \nreadily could be processed by MiDAS for automa ted fraud determinations.  And unlike the old \nquestionnaire, and in contrast to CSG’s reco mmendations, the new Form 1713 did not inform \nclaimants that failing to respond would result in a fraud determina tion.  CSG Fraud Audit \nRecommendations, ECF No. 434-1, PageID.25327 (“Th e form could be redesigned so that the \nclaimant is not under the impression that comp letion of the form is voluntary”).    \n CSG did not recommend that the UIA rely  on purely an automated decision-making \nsystem; rather, it suggested that MiDAS develop recommended decisions subject to review by an \nexaminer.  “If the examiner elects to render a deci sion that is contrary to  the decision recommended \nby the system, the issue will be pended and routed to a manager for approval.”  CSG Fraud Audit Recommendations, ECF No. 434-1, PageID.25327.   \n2. Project Management \n After the UIA chose FAST to develop MiDAS , the UIA relied on CSG for on-site project \nmanagement services through the Project Control Office that CSG established.  According to the \ncontract, CSG’s Project Control Office was required to “support the State — and the State’s \napplication development and impl ementation vendor — in meeting the timely deliver y of quality \ninformation technology services for all stakeholders of the UI Syst em Modernization Project.”  It \nwas also understood that the System Integration Project team would be “comprised of both CSG’s \nProject Management Office and the State of Michigan [Depar tment of Technology] and UIA \nStaff.”  The contract made CSG “responsible for utilizing and mentoring these State staff” and \nmaintaining “continuous liaison with . . . the St ate Senior Project Managers [and] Executive \nSponsor.”    Case 2:17-cv-10657-DML-RSW   ECF No. 495, PageID.<pageID>   Filed 12/21/20   Page 8 of 28-9- \n  As project manager, CSG wa s responsible for “performing schedule, scope and technical \ncontrol tasks over all aspects of  the project.”  CSG agreed to  provide “independent oversight, \nmonitoring, and reporting on activities and metric s critical for on-time delivery of quality \ntechnology services that meet th e needs of the UIA and DIT.”  CSG also was responsible for \n“creating and maintaining de tailed . . . [p]roject plans and sc hedules that support project scope, \ncosts, milestones, and deliverables” during th e project development.  UIA manager Clayton \nTierney explained that CSG primar ily helped ensure that the proj ect remained on schedule and on \nbudget, and that MiDAS implemented th e UIA’s requested functionality.   \n John Walsworth, the CEO of CSG, explaine d that although CSG led many administrative \naspects of MiDAS, it ultimately had no decision- making power to set agency policy, establish \nparticular algorithms or logic trees in the software , or operate the software at any time.  He also \nmaintains that “CSG did not have  any role in determining the compliance of State [unemployment \ninsurance] policies or the MiDAS system with stat e or federal law;” “those  decisions were made \nby the State.”   \nC.  The Plaintiffs \n1. Patti Jo Cahoo \n  Patti Jo Cahoo collected une mployment benefits from January  12 through June 29, 2013.  \nShe chose to forego written notices on her bene fit account (“going green”) and directed the UIA \nto provide her with email alerts.  She understood th at it was her obligation to check her email and \nthe UIA’s website, MiWAM, for correspondence from the UIA.    Shortly after Cahoo went “green,” her form er employer, Randstad Employment Solutions, \nprotested her eligibility, allegi ng that she voluntarily quit.  On May 2, 2014, a UIA examiner, \n“robinson12,” reviewed Cahoo’s file  and opened a fraud case.  That  caused the MiDAS system to \npost a fraud questionnaire on Ca hoo’s MiWAM account and send he r an email no tifying her to Case 2:17-cv-10657-DML-RSW   ECF No. 495, PageID.<pageID>   Filed 12/21/20   Page 9 of 28-10- \n check her account.  Cahoo alleges that she “was unaware of th e posting and did not respond.”  \n More than one year later, the UIA usi ng MiDAS determined th at Cahoo committed fraud \nbased on her failure to respond, and MmiDAS gene rated two notices of de termination, both dated \nMay 27, 2015.  Her Primary Notice of Determinati on explained that she “quit [her] job with \nRandstad Employment Solutions on January 11, 2013 due to other pers onal reasons,” and that her \n“leaving was voluntary and not a ttributable to the employer. ”  Her Secondary Notice of \nDetermination accused her of “i ntentionally misle[ading] and/or  conceal[ing] information to \nobtain benefits [she] was not enti tled to receive.”  Attached to the secondary notice was a list of \noverpayments charging Cahoo $34,475.00 total:  $7,095.00 in principal and $28,380.00 as a \npenalty.    Cahoo contends that she was also unaware of the fraud de termination and did not hear \nabout the determination until she filed for bankrupt cy “months later.”  But her deposition testimony \ncontradicts that position, as she indicates that she may have had at least some notice.  She \ncalculated in her head that she might have  owed $12,000 including the 100% penalty, which she \nmentioned to her attorney, who suggested that she may have to  seek Chapter 13 bankruptcy \nprotection.  That prompted her to check her credit report, wher e she discovered the true amount \nowed.  She conceded that the fraud questionnaire  and notices of determination were posted on her \nMiWAM account.  She also admitted to deleting periodically UIA notificati ons sent to her email \naddress and neglecting to read  UIA letters posted on her MiWA M account because she was not \nseeking benefits after 2013.    On September 22, 2016, Cahoo filed for Chapte r 7 bankruptcy; she received a discharge \non January 15, 2017.  In her bankruptcy petition, she di d not list her claim in this case but included \nher UIA debts in her schedule of liabilities.  On January 4, 2017, the UIA filed an adversary Case 2:17-cv-10657-DML-RSW   ECF No. 495, PageID.<pageID>   Filed 12/21/20   Page 10 of 28-11- \n complaint, opposing the discharge of the UIA debt based on Cahoo’s alleged fr aud.  But around \nFebruary 3, 2017, Cahoo received a redeterminat ion of her fraud case following the court \napproved-settlement with the State in Zynda v. Arwood .   \n The UIA’s designated 30(b)(6) witness, Kevi n Smith, reviewed Cahoo’s file and opined \nthat UIA examiners were involved in Cahoo’s fraud determination and that a UIA claims examiner \ntook the actions that led to the determination.  However, he “di dn’t see [the] stag ing screen” for \nCahoo’s intentional misrep resentation case.    \n2. Kristen Mendyk \n Kristen Mendyk received unemployment benefits from July 2, 2011 to March 31, 2012.  She chose to receive correspondenc e from the UIA by mail.  Based on  an employer protest, the \nUIA investigated her for fraud in 2012 and ag ain in 2013.  The UIA sent her two fraud \nquestionnaires, one on July 20, 2012 (pre-MiDAS) and the other on November 4, 2013.  The UIA \nsent the questionnaires to the address Mendyk provided in Saint Charles, Michigan.  But she \nalleges that she never received the questionnaires because she no longer lived at the address when \nthey were sent.     Mendyk never responded to the UIA’s fraud questionnaires.  In November 2013 and \nJanuary 2014, the UIA adjudicated three claims of  fraud against her, all opened by “wisemans 1” \nand adjudicated by “batch.”  The fraud determinati ons also went to the Saint Charles, Michigan \naddress on November 4 and 12, 2013, and January  15, 2014.  Mendyk no longer lived there at the \ntime.    On February 25, 2014, the UIA sent a mont hly delinquency statem ent charging Mendyk \n$32,748, consisting of $9,355.00 in overpayment, $22,702.00 in penalty charges, and $691.15 in interest.  MiDAS then seized Mendyk’s tax re turns and garnished her wages between May 2014 Case 2:17-cv-10657-DML-RSW   ECF No. 495, PageID.<pageID>   Filed 12/21/20   Page 11 of 28-12- \n and July 2016, collectin g a total of $5,983.71 from her.  Mendyk alleges that she did not learn \nabout the fraud determinations unt il she attempted to file a nother claim in 2017.  But she \nacknowledged that she was obligated  to keep her address current wi th the UIA and conceded that \nshe committed the misrepresentation alleged.  Bu t she maintained that she did not intend to \nmisrepresent her wages, and that she mista kenly reported an incorrect amount.    \n The UIA eventually reconsidered Mendyk’s dete rmination in response to a Department of \nLabor’s review of MiDAS auto-adjudications.  On October 12, 2016, a UI A employee mailed her \na redetermination notice, but it was returned as undeliverable.  Between December 30, 2014, and \nOctober 12, 2016, several letters that the UIA sent  to Mendyk were returned and marked “return \nto sender,” or “not deliverable as addressed,” including a 2014 le tter attempting to collect $30,080 \nand the 2016 redeterm ination notice.   \n Mendyk filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy on De cember 16, 2016, to which the UIA filed a \ncomplaint in opposition.  Although she included her UIA debts on her schedule of liabilities, she \ndid not list the cause of action she asserts in th is case.  She was represented by counsel in her \nbankruptcy case and discussed this  action with him.  On Febr uary 28, 2017, Mendyk informed her \nChapter 13 trustee of her potential due process claim, which the trus tee authorized her to pursue.  \nHowever, she entered into a consent judgment with the UIA on April 12, 2017, in which she admitted to the alleged fraud and agreed to pay $6,793.70.    The UIA’s designated 30(b)(6) witness, Ka therine Potter, review ed Mendyk’s file and \nopined that a UIA examiner made Mendyk’s fraud de terminations.  Curiously, she did not address \nthe fact that “batch” appears next to each stage change from “pending adjudication” to \n“redetermination issued” and from “redeterminati on issued” to “issue clos ed,” which occurred Case 2:17-cv-10657-DML-RSW   ECF No. 495, PageID.<pageID>   Filed 12/21/20   Page 12 of 28-13- \n within the span of several sec onds, and which were well beyond ordinary business hours (between \n8:00 p.m. and 1:00 a.m.).   \n3. Khadija Cole \n Khadija Cole received unemployment bene fits from March 1 th rough June 28, 2014 and \nopted for email corresponden ce with the UIA.  The UIA apparent ly suspected that she failed to \ndisclose vacation pay for the week of March 1, 2014, despite that she repeatedly certified that she \nwas not receiving such pay.  The UIA sent he r a fraud questionnaire on October 3, 2014.  The UIA \nalso detected earning discrepancies for the week s of April 5 to June 28, 2014, and on February 12, \n2015, MiDAS issued another questionnaire inquiring about unreported wages.   The UIA sent the \nquestionnaires to her MiWAM account, and sh e received an emai l to check it.   \n Cole never responded to the questionnair es, and on October 16, 2014 and February 26, \n2015, MiDAS determined that Cole commit ted fraud.  MiDAS issued corresponding \nredetermination notices to her MiWAM account.  \n Both of Cole’s fraud cases were opened by UIA employees, but “batch” (MiDAS) updated \nthe stages of the cases from “pending adjudication,” to “issue closed” within seconds for each case.  \nThe first case concerned vacation pay during one week in March 2014;  Cole alleges that the second \ncase was flagged improperly based on MiDAS’s “i ncome spreading” programming.  As evidence, \nshe points to the UIA’s “Notice of Redetermin ation” issued on Febr uary 27, 2015, which found \nthat she received exactly $733.45 in wages every week between April 5 and June 28, 2014.  MiDAS also issued a list of overpayments, st ating that it overpaid exactly $362.00 each week \nbetween April 5 and June 28, 2014, and charging  her $24,530, consisting of $4,706 in principal \nand $18,824.00 in penalty fees.   Case 2:17-cv-10657-DML-RSW   ECF No. 495, PageID.<pageID>   Filed 12/21/20   Page 13 of 28-14- \n  Cole insists that she never received any ema il, a fraud questionnaire, a fraud determination, \nor any notice of the fraud charges against her whatso ever.  She testif ied that she first learned about \nthe fraud determination when she received a statement of debt by mail from UIA around the \nsummer of 2016.  The UIA ultimately assessed $4 ,950 in principal and $19,346 in penalties.   \n On October 3, 2016, Cole filed for Chapter 13  bankruptcy.  In her petition, she included \nher UIA debts on her schedule of lia bilities but did not list  her cause of action in this case as an \nasset.  She was represented by counsel during her bankruptcy proceedings and discussed this \nlawsuit with him.  While her bankruptcy was pending, Cole admitted to committing fraud and \nentered into a consent judgmen t with the UIA on March 29, 2017.  Her bankruptcy proceedings \nappear to be ongoing.    Kevin Smith, the UIA’s designated 30(b)(6) witness who testified about both Cahoo’s and \nCole’s files, did not opine about the extent  of auto-adjudicatio n in Cole’s case.  \n4. Michelle Davison \n \n Michelle Davison received unemployment be nefits from May 25 through November 23, \n2013, and from March 22 through Ju ly 19, 2014.   She applied for her second round of employment \nbenefits on March 17, 2014, alleging that she was laid  off from her job.  She opted for regular mail \ncorrespondence and directed the UIA to contact her at an address on Leer da Street in Flint, \nMichigan.  She certifie d that she understood that she was responsible for reading the UIA \nHandbook, which set forth her oblig ation to update the UIA about  any address changes.  \n  Davison’s former employer proteste d her unemployment cl aim around March 2014, \ncontending that she voluntarily quit.  A UIA employee opened an  investigation on October 7, 2014, \nand the UIA sent a fraud questionnaire to Davi son’s designated address the following day.   Case 2:17-cv-10657-DML-RSW   ECF No. 495, PageID.<pageID>   Filed 12/21/20   Page 14 of 28-15- \n  Davison testified that she no longer was living at that addr ess, had never received the \nquestionnaire, and was unable to respond.  But he r recollection was quite foggy.  (“I was probably \nmoved by then, ‘cuz I – I don’t re member.  I don’t even  remember exactly when I moved out of \nthere. I think was probably gone by then.”).  On October 22, 2014, the UIA mailed a notice of \ndetermination to the Flint address stating that sh e was ineligible for benefits.  But the notice was \nreturned as undeliverable on November 11, 2014.    On December 29, 2014, Davison called the UIA to unlock her MiWAM account, and during that call she updated her address to reflec t that she lived on Saginaw Street in Flint, \nMichigan.  But the UIA never resent  the fraud questionnaire, nor did it  do anything to verify that \nDavison received it.    On January 15, 2015, the UIA issued another fraud determination to Davison’s updated \naddress and assessed $6,222 in principal and $740 in  penalties.  Davison alleges that she never \nreceived any correspondence and first learned about the fraud de termination from the IRS when \nthe UIA intercepted her 2015 federa l tax refund, although she does not st ate when that happened.   \nShe filed a late appeal of her fraud determination, after her Zynda  review, and prevailed on May \n8, 2017.    The UIA’s designated 30(b)(6) witness, Jessic a Hart, reviewed Davis on’s file and opined \nthat a UIA examiner made Davison’s fraud deter minations.  The term “bat ch” appears beside only \none entry in the relevant time period, which cha nged the stage of Davison’s case from “pending \nfact finding to pending adjudica tion.”  The names of UIA employe es appear beside every other \nentry.  \n \n   Case 2:17-cv-10657-DML-RSW   ECF No. 495, PageID.<pageID>   Filed 12/21/20   Page 15 of 28-16- \n 5. Hyon Pak \n  Hyon Pak received unemployment benefits  from September 24, 2011 through March 3, \n2012.  In September 2012, before implementing MiDAS, the UI A opened a fraud investigation \nand sent Pak three pre-MiDAS que stionnaires by mail on September 24.  The first two concerned \nemployer Express Services, a nd the third addressed Employ er Eagle Industries.   \n He responded to all three on September 26, 2012.  On October 8, 2012, Pak received two more pre-MiDAS fraud questionnaires, one regardi ng Express Services, the other regarding Eagle \nIndustries.  Believing they were duplicat es, he did not respond to them.   \n About a year later (and after MiDAS rolled out ), Pak chose to “go green” and provided the \nUIA with his email address.  His “Go Green” agr eement stated that it was his responsibility to \nmonitor his MiWAM account fo r any UIA correspondence.   \n  About one year after Pak went “green,”  on December 29, 2014, the UIA posted four fraud \ndeterminations on Pak’s MiWAM account, all of which involved MiDAS.  The system had gone \nback over two years to review Pak’s September 26, 2012 responses to the UIA’s questionnaires.  \nHowever, a staff member had to enter his respons es into MiDAS and open the fraud issues because \nthe old questionnaires prompted handwritten re sponses.  About four hours after the employee \nopened Pak’s cases, “batch” changed the stages from  “pending adjudication” to “issue closed.”  \nThe UIA issued determination notices that day, December 29, 2014.    Pak contends that he was unaware of the fraud determinations until 2016, when the UIA intercepted his federal tax ref und.  But during his deposition, he conceded that the UIA sent \nelectronic notices as he requeste d.  He maintained that he coul d not recall whether he saw the \nnotices on his MiWAM account but conceded th at someone (possibly his wife) accessed his Case 2:17-cv-10657-DML-RSW   ECF No. 495, PageID.<pageID>   Filed 12/21/20   Page 16 of 28-17- \n MiWAM account on December 29, 2014, and January 2, 2015 — the same day the UIA emailed \nhim to check his account.    He filed an untimely appeal in 2017, but the UIA eventually reversed Pak’s fraud determinations after it permi tted him to appeal again.   \n Defendants FAST and CSG contend in their moti ons to dismiss that these plaintiffs have \nnot established standing to sue them, as require d by Article III of the Constitution, and therefore \nthis Court has no jurisdiction over the case.   \nII.  Discussion \n A defendant may move under Federal Rule of  Civil Procedure 12(b) (1) to dismiss a case \n“for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.”  Cartwright v. Garner , 751 F.3d 752, 759 (6th Cir. 2014). \nThe issue of subject matter jurisdiction lurks in every federal case because the Constitution \nauthorizes federal courts to decide only “Cases” and “Controversies.” U.S. Const. art. III, § 2, cl. 1; Warth v. Seldin , 422 U.S. 490, 498 (1975). \nThe motion under Rule 12(b)(1) may be brought as a facial attack  — that is, a challenge to \nthe sufficiency of the complaint — or a factual attac k, as here — taking in evidence beyond the \npleadings. Cartwright , 751 F.3d at 759.  For the latter, courts have “wide discretion” to consider \naffidavits and documents “to arrive at the factua l predicate that subject-matter jurisdiction does or \ndoes not exist.”  Gentek Bldg. Prods., Inc. v. Sherwin-Williams Co ., 491 F.3d 320, 330 (6th Cir. \n2007). The Court also may take judici al notice of its own records.  See Fed. R. Evid. 201(b)(2 ); \nUnited States v. Doss , 563 F.2d 265, 269 n. 2 (6th Cir. 1977). The plaintiffs have the burden to \nprove the jurisdictional facts, Cartwright , 751 F.3d at 760, and all par ties have had the opportunity \nto present evidence on that issue. The Court “has the power to weigh [that] evidence and determine \nthe effect of that evidence on the co urt’s authority to hear the case.”  Id. at 759-60.  Although this Case 2:17-cv-10657-DML-RSW   ECF No. 495, PageID.<pageID>   Filed 12/21/20   Page 17 of 28-24- \n injuries are fairly traceable to CSG because it “co ntributed to the formatio n of the policies and the \nimplementation of the system” that po tentially violated their rights.  Ibid. \n Merely providing advice to a third party that voluntarily injures another is constitutionally insufficient to expose one to liab ility, whereas actively pa rticipating in the inju ry is sufficient.  \nCrawford , 868 F.3d at 457.  Under that rationale, CSG’s ro le as an advisor to the UIA, even though \nit urged the UIA to “[r]everse the current Agency cu lture where staff is reluctant to render a fraud \ndetermination because it is view ed as too punitive on the claimant ,” CSG Fraud Audit Report, ECF \nNo. 434-1, PageID.25320, may not be sufficient to expose it to liability.  In that regard, the UIA’s decision to accept the advice is refe rable to its “voluntary choice.”  Ibid.   \n But CSG did not just provide advice.  It migrated beyond advising when it acted as the onsite project manager for MiDAS.  CSG primarily served an administrative role, ensuring that the project stayed on budget and on time.  But it also “mento red” UIA staff and maintained \n“continuous liaison with  . . . the State Senior Project Mana gers.”  CSG Contract, ECF No. 425-4, \nPageID.19664.  And it supported FAST “in meeting th e timely delivery of  quality information \ntechnology services” for MiDAS’s stakeholders.  Ibid.  Some of its tasks also included conducting \ncost-benefit analyses, developing and mana ging project schedules,  facilitating team \ncommunications, and monitoring performance.     These actions amounted to active manageme nt and supervision by CSG.  And although \nCSG did not run MiDAS, it monitored the syst em’s performance and conducted cost-benefit \nanalyses. Doing so should have alerted it to the potentially unconstitutional adjudications and collection practices, and it certai nly learned about them in June  2015, when the Auditor General \npublished its report.  That may fall short of estab lishing proximate cause, but it satisfies the “fairly Case 2:17-cv-10657-DML-RSW   ECF No. 495, PageID.<pageID>   Filed 12/21/20   Page 24 of 28-25- \n traceable’ requireme nt for standing.  Allen, 468 U.S. at 751; Parsons , 801 F.3d at 71 4 (describing \n“fairly traceable” inquiry as “more than speculative but le ss than but-for” causation).   \nC.  Bankruptcy Filings \n FAST and CSG contend that plaintiffs Cahoo, Mendyk, and Cole do not own their causes \nof action because they f iled for bankruptcy before they co mmenced this case and their claims \nbelong to their respective bankruptcy estates.  They lack st anding to sue, say the defendants, \nbecause they are not the r eal parties in interest a nd they are judicially estopped from pursuing their \nclaims.    Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 17(a) provides  that an action “must be prosecuted in the \nname of the real party in interest.”  Fed. R. Ci v. P. 17(a).  However, “[t]he court may not dismiss \nan action for failure to prosecute in the name of the real party in interest until, after an objection, \na reasonable time has been allowed for the real part y in interest to ratify, join, or be substituted \ninto the action.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 17(a)(3). \n When an individual files for ba nkruptcy, a bankruptcy  estate is created, which consists of \n“all legal or equitable interests of  the debtor in property as of th e commencement of the case.” 11 \nU.S.C. § 541(a)(1).  The bankruptc y estate includes all causes of action that accr ued before the \nbankruptcy petition was file d, even if the debtor did not disclose it.  Auday v. Wet Seal Retail, Inc ., \n698 F.3d 902, 904 (6th Cir. 2012).  Thus, once a debtor  files a bankruptcy petition, the debtor “‘has \nno standing to pursue’ [a pre-petit ion cause of action] alone.”  Ibid. (quoting Bauer v. Commerce \nUnion Bank , 859 F.2d 438, 440-41 (6th Cir. 1988)).   \n To determine whether a cause of action is pre- petition, which belongs to the estate, or post-\npetition, which belongs to the debtor, the Sixt h Circuit applies the approach described in Segal v. \nRochelle , 382 U.S. 375, 380 (1966).  Under Segal , pre-petition assets are those that are Case 2:17-cv-10657-DML-RSW   ECF No. 495, PageID.<pageID>   Filed 12/21/20   Page 25 of 28-26- \n “‘sufficiently rooted in the pre- bankruptcy past’ of the debtor.”  Tyler v. DH Cap. Mgmt., Inc ., 736 \nF.3d 455, 461 (6th Cir. 2013) (quoting Segal , 382 U.S. at 380).  “Pre-p etition conduct or facts \nalone will not ‘root’ a claim in the past; there must be a pre-petition violation.”  Id. at 462.  The \nSixth Circuit made clear that “accrual for the purpo ses of § 541 is different from accrual for statute-\nof-limitations purposes” and that “the relevant bankruptcy-law question is when the claim is \nminimally actionable, not whether the claim is fully mature.”  Id. at 463, 464.  Thus, “all causes \nof action that hypothetically could have been brought  pre-petition are property of the estate.”   Ibid. \n(quoting Bd. of Trustees of Teamsters Loca l 863 Pension Fund v. Foodtown, Inc. , 296 F.3d 164, \n169 n. 5 (3d Cir. 2002)).    The issue ultimately boils down to when the causes of action for each plaintiff accrued \nrelative to when they filed for bankruptcy.  The plai ntiffs maintain that th eir claims did not accrue \nuntil they spoke to their civil rights lawyers in February 2017 — after they commenced their \nbankruptcy proceedings — and supposedly learned for the first time that they may have been \ndeprived of due process.   \n A section 1983 claim accrues “‘ when the plaintiff know s or has reason to know that the act \nproviding the basis of his or her injury has occurred.’”  D’Amborsio v. Marino , 747 F.3d 378, 384 \n(6th Cir. 2014) (quoting Cooey v. Strickland , 479 F.3d 412, 416 (6th Cir. 2007)).  “Courts \ndetermine the accrual date of a claim by asking ‘w hat event should have alerted the typical lay \nperson to protect his or her rights.’” Am. Premier Underwriters, Inc. v. Nat’l R.R. Passenger Corp. , \n839 F.3d 458, 461 (6th Cir. 2016) (quoting Roberson v. Tennessee , 399 F.3d 792, 794 (6th Cir. \n2005).  “In procedural-due-process cla ims . . . , a plaintiff’s  injury accrues at th e time that process \nwas denied because ‘the allegedly infirm  process is an injury in itself.’”  Ibid. (quoting  Nasierowski \nBros. Inv. Co. v. City of Sterling Heights , 949 F.2d 890, 894 (6th Cir. 1991) (finding that the Case 2:17-cv-10657-DML-RSW   ECF No. 495, PageID.<pageID>   Filed 12/21/20   Page 26 of 28-27- \n plaintiff’s injuries accrued when a local zoning council conven ed a critical session that departed \nfrom the required notice and co mment procedures, even though the council had not yet reached a \nfinal decision on the plaintiff’s deve lopment plans for his property)).  \n The factual record in this case is not de veloped sufficiently to determine when the \nplaintiffs’ claims accrued.  There may be circumstan ces with the individual plaintiffs that call into \nquestion whether they are the real party in interest  — or if not, whether they have or could become \nso by ratification of their claims  by their respective bankruptcy tr ustees — and whether they are \njudicially estopped from pressing their claims.  But those are merits questions that do not \nundermine subject matter  jurisdiction, which is the subject of th e present motion.  See Primax \nRecoveries, Inc. v. Gunter,  433 F.3d 515, 518–19 (6th Cir. 2006) (“ ‘Clarity would be facilitated \n. . . if courts and litigants used the label ‘jurisdi ctional’ not for claim-proc essing rules, but only for \nprescriptions delineating the cla sses of cases (subject-matter jurisd iction) and the persons (personal \njurisdiction) falling with in a court’s adjudicatory  authority.’”) (quoting Eberhart v. United States,  \n546 U.S. 12, 16 (2005) (per curiam), and citing Kontrick v. Ryan,  540 U.S. 443, 453 (2004)).  \nIII.  Conclusion \n The plaintiffs sufficiently have demonstrated  an injury-in-fact (fraud determinations based \non the rigid application of the UI A’s rigid logic trees coupled with inadequa te notice procedures) \nthat is fairly traceable to FAST’s and CSG’s conduct.  Although the defendants make colorable \narguments that Cahoo and Cole are not the real part ies in interest of, or are judicially estopped \nfrom bringing, their claims, the fact ual record is not complete to establish conclusively that their \nclaims are pre-petition or no longer belong to them.   \n Case 2:17-cv-10657-DML-RSW   ECF No. 495, PageID.<pageID>   Filed 12/21/20   Page 27 of 28-28- \n  Accordingly, it is ORDERED  that the motions by defendant s CSG and FAST to dismiss \nfor want of subject matter ju risdiction (ECF No. 297, 313) are DENIED .   \n        s / D a v i d  M .

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: This court case involves a dispute between Wired Informatics, LLC, a software developer, and OmniMD Inc., its former client. Wired filed a lawsuit alleging various contractual breaches, while OmniMD counterclaimed with allegations of fraud and breach of implied warranties related to Wired's \"Invenio\" software, which OmniMD intended to use as an artificial intelligence engine. Wired's motion to dismiss the counterclaims was granted, but OmniMD is allowed to amend its complaint.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: The key issue is whether OmniMD sufficiently pleaded its counterclaims for fraud and breach of implied warranties regarding Wired’s AI-powered software product, Invenio, under the appropriate legal standards.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court dismissed OmniMD’s counterclaims due to insufficient pleading, particularly failing to meet the heightened requirements for fraud claims and not properly addressing the disclaimer of warranties in the contract. However, the court granted OmniMD the opportunity to file an amended complaint.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine you bought a magic tool that promised to help sort and organize your messy room, but it didn’t work as promised and you spent a lot of time trying to make it work. You complained, saying the seller lied about what the tool could do. The court looked at your complaint and decided you didn't explain clearly enough exactly how the seller's promises were false or which rules they broke in the signed agreement. The judge said your case can't go forward unless you fix this and try again.",

[ECF No. 1- 1 at 6–9].  \nOmniMD brought  counterclaims against Wired for fraud, breach of the implied warranties of \nfitness and merchantability, and breach of contract .  [ECF No. 4 (“Counterclaim Complaint” or \n“Counterclaim Compl.”)  ¶¶ 23 –36].  Currently pending before the Court is Wired ’s motio n to \ndismiss the Counterclaim Complaint pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6).  [ECF \nNo. 6].  For the reasons set forth below, Wired’s motion to dismiss [ECF No. 6] is GRANTED, \nand OmniMD may file an amended counterclaim complaint consistent  with this Order .   \nI. BACKGROUND  \nThe following facts are drawn from the Counterclaim Complaint, the well -pleaded \nallegations of which are taken are true for purposes of evaluating Wired’s motion to dismiss.  \nSee Ruivo v. Wells Fargo Bank, 766 F.3d 87, 90 (1s t Cir. 2014). Case 1:19-cv-10019-ADB   Document 11   Filed 07/30/19   Page 1 of 102 On September 17, 2017, Wired and OmniMD entered into a Master Software License and \nServices Agreement (“MSL”).  [Counterclaim Compl. ¶ 4].  The MSL granted OmniMD licenses \nto use Wired products as specified in one or more ordering documents, which would amend or \nsupplement the MSL.  [ Id. ¶¶ 5, 7].  The licenses would either be “Development” licenses, which \nwould allow the  use of Wired products in a development or testing environment, or “Production” \nlicenses  for using Wired products in a commercial or production environment.  [ Id. ¶ 6].  The \nMSL also provided for technical support to accompany licenses of Wired’s products.  [ Id. ¶ 8]. \nOn March 22, 2018, OmniMD ordered two Development licenses for a term of nine \nmonths for a product called “Invenio.”  [ Id. ¶ 9].  Omni MD intended to use Invenio “as an \nartificial intelligence engine to read and parse natural language in medical transcripts, [to] \nselect[] vital medical information from those transcripts[,] and [to] transfer[] that information to \nspecific locations in standa rdized electronic health records . . .” for patients being treated by \nmedical professionals using OmniMD’s electronic health records  software .  [Id. ¶ 10].  Wired \nrepresented to OmniMD that Invenio was “ready to use,” and the parties anticipated that the \nnine-month term would be used to “fine -tune[] ,” test, and adapt Invenio for OmniMD’s expected \nusage .  [Id.]. \nAlso on March 22, 2018, OmniMD ordered nine Production licenses for Invenio for a \ntwelve -month term  to immediately follow  the expiration of the t erm of the Development \nlicenses.  [ Id. ¶ 11].  Before OmniMD placed its order for the Development and Production \nlicenses, Wired had represented to it that “the nine -month term of the Development licenses \nwould be a sufficient period of time for the Invenio artificial intelligence engine to ad apt” to the \nintegration with OmniMD’s electronic health records software.  [ Id. ¶ 12].   Case 1:19-cv-10019-ADB   Document 11   Filed 07/30/19   Page 2 of 103 Once it received the Development licenses, OmniMD tried unsuccessfully to integrate \nInvenio into its electronic health records software.  [ Id. ¶ 13].  During this time , Wired failed to \nprovide sufficient technical support, despite Omni MD notifying Wired that Invenio was not fit \nfor its intended purpose and was not merchantable.  [ Id. ¶¶ 16, 18–19].  After the nine -month \nterm ended and OmniMD had spent more than $17,500 in license fees, Invenio was “barely \nworking for only a small portion of functions”  that Wired had represented it could perform.  [ Id. \n¶ 10].  OmniMD determined that Invenio would need several more years of work before it would \nbe usable  and that it could not be incorporated into OmniMD’s electronic health records software \nat that time .  [Id. ¶¶ 10, 20].   OmniMD informed Wired that it was terminating the March 22, \n2018 order as well as the MSL.  [ Id. ¶¶ 20–21].  As a result of the time spent by OmniMD on \nunsuccessfully adapting Invenio for use with its electronic health records software, OmniMD  \nwas delayed in getting its own product to market .  [Id. ¶ 22].  \nOn November 19, 2018, Wired filed a complaint  in Suffolk County  Superior Court.  \n[ECF No. 1- 1 at 3–9].  OmniMD removed the action to this Court on January 3, 2019 and \nthereafter  filed an answer, affirmative defenses, and c ounterclaims on January 25, 2019.  [ECF \nNos. 1, 4].  On February 14, 2019, Wired file a motion  to dismiss the counterclaims, which \nOmniMD opposed on March 11, 2019.  [ECF Nos. 6, 10].   \nII. LEGAL STANDARD  \n On a motion to dismiss a counterclaim under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), \nthe Court must accept as true all well -pleaded facts, analyze those facts in the light most \nfavorable to the plaintiff -in-counterclaim ’s theory, and draw all reasonable inferences from those \nfacts in favor of the plaintiff -in-counterclaim .  See  United States ex rel. Hutcheson v. Blackstone \nMed., Inc., 647 F.3d 377, 383 (1st Cir. 2011).  While detailed factual allegations are not Case 1:19-cv-10019-ADB   Document 11   Filed 07/30/19   Page 3 of 104 required, a counterclaim complaint must set forth “more than labels and conclusions,” Bell Atl. \nCorp. v. Twombly , 550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007), and it must contain “factual allegations, either \ndirect or inferential, respecting each material element necessary to sustain recovery under some \nactionable legal theory,” Gagliardi v. Sullivan , 513 F.3d 301, 305 (1st Cir. 2008) (citations \nomitted).  The facts alleged must be sufficient to “state a claim to relief that is plausible on its \nface.”  A.G. ex rel. Maddox v. Elsevier, Inc., 732 F.3d 77, 80 (1st Cir. 2013) (quoting Twombly , \n550 U.S. at 570). \n When assessing the sufficiency of a counterclaim complaint, the Court first “separate[s] \nthe [pleading’s]  factual allegations (which must be accepted as true) from its conclusory legal \nallegations (which need not be credited).”  Id. (quoting Morales -Cruz v. Univ. of P.R., 676 F.3d \n220, 224 (1st Cir. 2012)).  Next, the Court “determine[s] whether the remaining factual content \nallows a ‘reasonable inference that the [ defendant -in-counterclaim]  is liable for the misconduct \nalleged.’”  Id. (quotin g Morales -Cruz , 676 F.3d at 224).  “[T]he court may not disregard properly \npled factual allegations, ‘even if it strikes a savvy judge that actual proof of those facts is \nimprobable.’”  Ocasio -Hernandez v. Fortuño- Burset , 640 F.3d 1, 12 (1st Cir. 2011) (quoting \nTwombly , 550 U.S. at 556). \nIII. DISCUSSION  \nA. Count I: Fraud  \nCount I alleges that OmniMD  relied to its detriment on Wired’s “false and misleading \nstatements regarding the quality, functionality, and readiness for incorporation into OmniMD’s \nelectronic health  records management software.”  [Counterclaim Compl. ¶ 24] .  Wired seeks  to \nhave Count I  dismissed on the ground that it was not pled with the particularity required by \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b).  [ECF No. 7 at 3–4].  I n response, OmniMD directs the Case 1:19-cv-10019-ADB   Document 11   Filed 07/30/19   Page 4 of 105 Court to ¶¶ 9–12 of the Counterclaim Complaint , which contain the following allegations: (i) \n“Wired had represented that [Invenio] was ready to use;” (ii) “[Invenio] was barely working for \nonly a small portion of functions that Wired had represented [it] would be able to perform;” (iii) \nthe parties contemplated that the nine -month period of the Development license would be used to \n“fine- tune[]” Invenio and “fully test[] and correctly adapt[]” it to OmniMD’s intended use; and, \n(iv) “Wired represented to OmniMD . . . that the nine -month term of the Development licenses \nwould be a sufficient  period of time” for Invenio to adapt to Omni’s intended use.  \n[Counterclaim Compl. ¶¶ 9–12] ; see [ECF No. 10 at 6].  \nRule 9(b) provides for a heightened pleading standard in fraud c ases and  requires that a \nparty alleging fraud “must state with particularity the circumstances constituting fraud  . . . .”  \nFed. R. Civ. P. 9(b).  This standard requires that a  party bringing  a fraud claim “must state ‘the \nwho, what, where, and when of the allegedly [misleading] representation’ with particularity.”  \nEzell v. Lexington Ins., 926 F.3d 48, 51 (1st Cir. 2019)  (quoting Kaufman v. CVS Caremark \nCorp., 836 F.3d 88, 91 (1st Cir. 2016)) .  Here, the limited factual allegations contained in the \nCounterclaim Complaint and described supra  fall short of what is required by Rule 9(b).  These \nallegations do not describe  with particularity the allegedly misleading representations by Wired \nand do not identify the “who, what, where, and when” of the misr epresentations.  For example, \nthe specific statements that are alleged to have been misleading are not described in any detail \nnor are the circumstances in which those statements were made.  Although the fraud claim \ncannot stand as pled, the allegation of fraud is not implausible, and the Court  will grant leave to \namend the pleading.  See  N. Am. Catholic Educ. Programming Found., Inc. v. Cardinale , 567 \nF.3d 8, 16 (1st Cir. 2009) (observing that where a court finds a deficiency under Rule 9(b), \n“leave to amend is often given, at least for plausible claims” ). Case 1:19-cv-10019-ADB   Document 11   Filed 07/30/19   Page 5 of 106 B. Counts II & III: Breach of Implied Warranty of Fitness and Breach of \nImplied Warranty of Merchantability \nCounts II and III assert that Wired’s Invenio product “was not fit for the purpose intended \nor prom ised.”  [Counterclaim Compl. ¶¶  28, 31].  The parties dispute whether the MSL is \ngoverned by the Uniform Commercial Code (“U.C.C.”) or common law.1  See [ECF No. 7 at 5; \nECF No. 10 at 7].  OmniMD contends that the determination of what law governs the MSL is a \nquestion of fact that precludes any resolution of these claims on a motion to dismiss.  [ECF No. \n10 at 7–8].2  Wired maintains that, under either theory, OmniMD’s claims must fail beca use any \nimplied  warranties wer e waived by the MSL.  [ECF No. 7 at 4–6].  The Court agrees.  \n The U.C.C., as adopted in New York,3 implies a warranty of fitness and merchantability \ninto contracts for the sale of goods.  See  N.Y. U.C.C.  Law §§ 2 -314, 2- 315.  U.C.C. § 2-315 \nprovides that “ [w]here the seller at the time of contracting has reason to know any particular \npurpose for which the goods are required and that the buyer is relying on the seller’s skill or \njudgment to select or furnish s uitable goods, there is unless excluded or modified . . . an implied \nwarranty that the goods shall be fit for such purpose.”  N.Y.  U.C.C.  Law §  2-315.  Similarly, \n                                                 \n1 The Court finds it unnecessary at this time to adjudicate the question of whether the MSL is a \ncontract predominantly for the sale of goods or services but observes that “[g]enerally software is \nconsidered a ‘good.’”  See  Architectronics, Inc. v. Control Sys., Inc., 935 F. Supp. 425, 432 \n(S.D.N.Y. 1996) ; Schroders, I nc. v. Hogan Sys., Inc., 522 N.Y.S.2d 404, 406 (Sup. Ct. 1987) \n(“[A]lthough the parties’ agreement . . . did not involve a sale of computer hardware, but simply \na licensure of software, the arrangement should nevertheless be construed to fall within the \nprovisions of U.C.C. Article 2.” ). \n2 OmniMD further asserts that “Wired nevertheless expressly made . . . warranties by words and \nconduct.”  [ECF No. 10 at 8].  This argument is outside the scope of the Counterclaim \nComplaint, which does not plead a cause of  action for breach of an express warranty.  See  \n[Counterclaim Compl. ¶¶ 27–32].  \n3 The MSL contains a valid choice of law provision that designates New York law for disputes \narising out of the contract.  See [ECF No. 4- 1 at 19 (“ The construction, interpretation and \nperformance of [the MSL]  shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the \nState of New York  . . . .”) ]. Case 1:19-cv-10019-ADB   Document 11   Filed 07/30/19   Page 6 of 107 U.C.C. § 2- 314 states that “ [u]nless excluded or modified . . . a warranty that the goods sha ll be \nmerchantable is implied in a contract for their sale if the seller is a merchant with respect to \ngoods of that kind.”  N.Y.  U.C.C.  Law § 2-314. \nThese provisions may be disclaimed, however, and U.C.C. §§ 1- 201(b)(10)  and 2-316 \nprovide the parameters o f valid  disclaimers.  See N.Y.  U.C.C.  Law §§ 1 -201(b)(10), 2 -316.  \nSection 2 -316 of the U.C.C. permits a contracting party to exclude the implied warranty of \nmerchantability from a written contract so long as the language “mention[s] merchantability” and \nis “conspicuous.”  N.Y.  U.C.C.  Law § 2-316.  The implied warranty of fitness also may be \nexcluded from a written contract if “the exclusion [is] by a writing and conspicuous.”  Id.  The \nU.C.C.  defines “conspicuous” as “so written, displayed, or presented that a reasonable person \nagainst which it is to operate ought to have noticed it” a nd notes that “[w]hether a term is \n‘conspicuous’ or not is a decision for the court.”  N.Y.  U.C.C.  Law §§ 1 -201(b)(10); cf.  \nCommc’ns Grps., Inc. v. Warner Commc’ns, Inc., 527 N.Y.S.2d 341, 346 (Civ. Ct. 1988) \n(explaining that the words “merchantability,” “ fitness,” “disclaimer,” “as is,” “warranty,” “all \nfaults,” or “other commonly understood language must be set forth in the contract, specifically \nand conspicuously, to call attention to the exclusion of warranties and make plain that there is no \nimplied wa rranty in order to validate the exclusion of implied warranties”).  “The question of \nwhether a particular disclaimer is conspicuous, and hence valid, is a question of law to be \ndetermined by the court.”  Carbo Indus. Inc. v. Becker Chevrolet Inc., 491 N.Y.S.2d 786, 789 \n(App. Div. 1985).  \nHere, the warranty disclaimers in the MSL are valid and preclude any claim of a breach \nof an implied warranty.  The MSL states  in a section entitled “Limitations” :  \nEXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY STATED HEREIN, LICENSOR DOES NOT \nGUARANTEE THAT THE PROGRAMS WILL PERFORM ERROR -Case 1:19-cv-10019-ADB   Document 11   Filed 07/30/19   Page 7 of 108 FREE OR UNINTERRUPTED OR THAT LICENSOR CAN CORRECT \nEACH AND EVERY ERROR. THE WARRANTIES IN THIS SECTION 9 \nARE GIVEN IN LIEU OF ALL OTHER WARRANTIES AND \nCONDITIONS. THERE ARE NO OTHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED \nWARRANTIES O R CONDITIONS, INCLUDING THE IMPLIED \nWARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A \nPARTICULAR PURPOSE.  \n \n[ECF No. 4- 1 at 13].  This section expressly references  the words  “merchantability,” “fitness,” \nand “warranty.”  [ Id.].  It specifically disclaims both the implied warranty of merchantability and \nthe implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose.  [ Id.].  The disclaimer is written in all \ncapital letters and bolded , which clearly sets it apart from other portions of the MSL and supports \na conclusion that the disclaimer is conspicuous or “so written, displayed, or presented that a \nreasonable person ought to have noticed it.”  See N.Y.  U.C.C.  LAW § 1-201(b)(10) ; [ECF No. 4-\n1 at 13] ; see also  Victor v. Mammana , 422 N.Y.S.2d 350, 351 (Sup. Ct. 1979) (“ Capital letters, \nlarge print, contrasting type or color and black border are [U.C.C.]  and court acknowledged \nmethods of making a message conspicuous in a form . . . .”) .  Therefore,  under the U.C.C., the \nwarranty disclaimer contained in the MSL is valid an d precludes any claim that an implied \nwarranty was breached.  \nIf the contract were deemed a contract predominantly for services rather than goods and \nthe U.C.C. did not apply, OmniMD would not have a cause of action for breach of the implied \nwarranties of m erchantability or fitness  because the same implied warranties  do not apply to \nservices contracts .  See Word Mgmt. Corp. v. AT&T Info. Sys., Inc., 135 A.D.2d 317, 321 (App. \nDiv., 1988); see also  Milau Assoc. v. North Ave. Dev. Corp., 42 N.Y.2d 482, 485–86 (1977).  \nAccordingly, because OmniMD is unable to sustain a claim for breach of implied warranties \nunder any legal framework,  the Court dismisses those claims without leave to replead.  Case 1:19-cv-10019-ADB   Document 11   Filed 07/30/19   Page 8 of 109 C. Count IV: Breach of Contract  \nCount IV alleges that Wired breached the MSL “because its Invenio product did not \nperform as represented.”  [Counterclaim Compl. ¶ 34].   Omni MD specifies in its briefing that its \nbreach of contract counterclaim is based on the following allegations: (i) “W ired’s product \nInvenio was defective;” (ii) “Wired represented that its product would work with OmniMD’s \napplications;” (iii) “defects in Wired’s product prevented that product from working as \nrepresented by Wired” despite OmniMD performing its obligations  under the MSL; (iv) “Wired \nalso failed to provide support to OmniMD.”  [ECF No. 10 at 10 (citing Counterclaim Compl. \n¶¶ 10, 12, 14–16)].  Wired argues that Count IV should be dismissed because this allegation is \nconclusory and does not identify any contra ctual provision that was allegedly breached.  [ECF \nNo. 7 at 6]. \nAs an initial matter, if the MSL is governed by the U.C.C., OmniMD cannot maintain a \nbreach of contract action  based on an allegedly defective product without first establishing that \nany “non -conformity” of the product “substantially impair[ed]” its value and that OmniMD \neffectively revoked its acceptance of the goods.   See N.Y. U.C .C. Law § 2- 608.  With respect to \nnon-conformity of the Invenio product , OmniMD would need to contend with the provision of \nthe MSL that states that Wired “ DOES NOT GUARANTEE THAT THE PROGRAMS \nWILL PERFORM ERROR -FREE OR UNINTERRUPTED OR THAT [WIRED] CAN \nCORRECT EACH AND EVERY ERROR.”  [ECF No. 4- 1 at 13].  Regarding  services \nprovided in conjunction with the product, OmniMD would need to address the limited service \nwarranty in the MSL, which provides that the warranty “is valid for a period of ninety days from \nperformance of the applicable Services” and that “[OmniMD’ s] exclusive remedy and [Wired’s] \nentire liability under these Services warranties shall be for [Wired] to re -perform any non-Case 1:19-cv-10019-ADB   Document 11   Filed 07/30/19   Page 9 of 1010 conforming portion of the Services within a reasonable period of time . . . .”  [ECF No. 4- 1 at \n12–13].  Without these essential a llegat ions concerning nonconformity of the goods  under the \nterms of the MSL , the claim fails.  \nIf the MSL is  instead a services contract  governed by common law, to assert a breach of \ncontract counter claim, OmniMD must allege “(1) the existence of a contract , (2) [its] \nperformance under the contract, (3) [Wired’s] breach of the contract, and (4) resulting damages.”  \nPalmetto Partners, L.P. v. AJW Qualified Partners, LLC , 921 N.Y.S.2d 260, 264 (N.Y. App. Div. \n2011).  “ To plead these elements ‘a plaintiff must identify what provisions of the contract were \nbreached as a result of the acts at issue.’”  Ellington Credit Fund, Ltd. v. Select Portfolio \nServicing, Inc., 837 F. Supp. 2d 162, 189 (S.D.N.Y. 2011) (quoting Wolff v. Rare Medium, \nInc., 171 F. Supp. 2d 354, 358 (S.D.N.Y. 2001)) ; see also  Ullman v. Med. Liab. Mut. Ins., 73 \nN.Y.S.3d 845, 847 (N.Y. App. Div. 2018); Reznick v. Bluegreen Resorts Mgmt., Inc., 62 \nN.Y.S.3d 460, 462 (N.Y. App. Div. 2017).  OmniMD’s failure to identify what provisions of  the \ncontract were breached is fatal to its claim.  \nBecause under either legal theory, the defect alleged in Count IV  may be remedied by an \namended pleading, the Court grants OmniMD leave to do so. \nIV. CONCLUSION \nAccordingly , Wired’s motion to dismiss [ECF No. 6] is GRANTED.  OmniMD has leave \nto file an a mended counterclaim c omplaint consistent with this Order within 30 days . \nSO ORDERED.         \n             \nJuly 30, 2019  /s/ Allison D.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: This bankruptcy court case involves Augustus Intelligence, Inc., a company that aimed to develop AI solutions but faced financial difficulties leading to bankruptcy. Litigation Trustee Brian Ryniker filed claims on behalf of Augustus and certain investors against defendant Kevin Washington, primarily centering on a breach of contract involving a $50 million investment deal that Washington never funded. The court dismissed the claims due to a lack of jurisdiction for the Assigned Investor Claims and the contract being unenforceable due to its fraudulent nature.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: The enforceability of a contract used in a scheme to defraud investors and whether the court has jurisdiction over third-party claims post-confirmation of a bankruptcy plan.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court dismissed the breach of contract claim against Washington, ruling that the Seed Agreement used to defraud investors was unenforceable. The court also dismissed the Assigned Investor Claims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction since they were third-party claims not directly related to the bankruptcy estate.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine a company, Augustus, which works on super-smart computer programs, went bankrupt. Some people, led by Brian, tried to sue a man named Kevin because he promised but didn't give $50 million to help Augustus get back on its feet. The court said Brian can't sue Kevin for two main reasons: one, they don't have the power to make decisions on certain claims Brian presented because they're like side arguments not directly tied to Augustus's bankruptcy; two, the promise for money was all part of a sneaky plan to trick other people into giving money, and since it was a trick, it's not a real promise the court can look at.",

The goal of these discussions was “to develop an infrastructure revenue model focused on cryptocurrency mining, with a key component of the plan being Augustus securing the rights to CW Mining’s below- market power purchasing agreement for the two datacenters.”\n9  \nHaupt developed a detailed business plan in which Haupt would provide artificial intelligence to conduct the cryptocurrency mining, while Washington would provide the rights to the data centers and a significant cash contribution.  To achieve these plans , Haupt set a goal to raise  over \n$80 million  in new capital  for Augustus.\n10 \nHaupt’s strategy for attracting interest in outside investors was to present Washington as \nthe lead investor in Augustus.11  Washington is the son of a billionaire and Haupt believed that \nan investment from him would carry great weight with other possible investors due to his status.\n12  To that end, Haupt proposed that Washington invest $50 million first, so Haupt could \nshow the other investors that Washington was committed.  Washington, however, was reluctant  \nto invest first, as he did not want to bear the risk of an investment of this scale without substantial support from other investors.\n13   \nHaupt and Washington eventually worked through this impasse by agreeing  to a plan  in \nwhich  Washington would execute a written, unconditional subscription agreement detailing the \nterms of a $50 million  investment by Washington, and Haupt would use that agreement to raise \nat least $30 million in funds from outside investors.  Since the subscription agreement could not \n \n9 Id. at 9.  \n10 Id. \n11 Complaint at 9.  \n12 Id. at 8.  \n13 Id. at 10. \nCase 23-50370-TMH    Doc 74    Filed 03/26/25    Page 3 of 154 \n contain any financing contingency, Haupt and Washington agreed to house that condition in a \nsecret, verbal side deal (the “Side Deal ”).14 \n On November 25, 2018, the parties  executed a Series Seed Preferred Stock Investment \nAgreement  (the “ Seed Agreement ”) which provided that Washington would purchase over half \na million shares of Series Seed preferred stock of Augustus for just over $50M, made up of $20 million  in cash and $30 million  in the form of data center interests .\n15   \n Immediately after signing the Seed Agreement, Haupt and Washington traveled across Europe together for the purpose of meeting with prospective Augustus investors.  At these meetings, Washington was introduced as the lead investor, who committed to investing over $50 million in Augustus.  When requested, Haupt, with Washington’s knowledge and consent, provided copies of the Seed Agreement as proof of Washington’s investment.  Neither Haupt nor Washington disclosed the existence of the Side Deal to the potential investors.   \nAfter these in -person meetings, the Investors each executed separate subscription \nagreements, some in the United States and some in Europe, and wired their investments to Augustus.  At the time they made their investments, each of the Investors believed Augustus had secured $50 million from its lead investor, Washington.\n16  By early 2019, Augustus had raised \n$30 million from the Investors, plus $60 million in promised subscriptions at a $250 million pre-money valuation.   \nIn anticipation of closing on the Seed Agreement and implementing its bitcoin mining \nbusiness plan, Augustus hired dozens of new employees and expensive software engineers at a cost of millions of dollars.  However, Washington never paid the $50 million and the Seed \n \n14 Id. at 10. \n15 Id. at 11 -12. \n16 Id. at 14. \nCase 23-50370-TMH    Doc 74    Filed 03/26/25    Page 4 of 155 \n Agreement never closed.17  The newly hired employees were fired and bad press about Augustus \nfollowed.   \nOn April 24, 2021, Augustus filed a voluntary petition for relief under chapter 11 \n(subchapter V) of the Bankruptcy Code.   \nOn May 3, 2022, the Debtor filed its plan of reorganization.18  The Plan provided for the \ntransfer of all the Debtor’s assets, including causes of action, to the Litigation  Trust to be \npursued by the Trustee for the benefit of the Litigation  Trust beneficiaries, including creditors \nand equity holders. In addition, the Plan contained a procedure whereby Augustus’ non-insider \nequity holders could elect to assign their Assigned Litigation Claims to the Trustee to be pursued.

Del.  2016)  (quoting 28 \nU.S.C. § 157).  “ Cases falling under the first three categories are typically referred to as core \nproceedings, whereas proceedings ‘related to’ a case under title 11 are designated as non- core \nproceedings.”  Id.  at 621.   The Third Circuit has held that a matter is “core” if it “invokes a \nsubstantive right provided by title 11 or if it is a proceeding that, by its nature, could arise only in the context of a bankruptcy case.”  In re Marcus Hook Dev. Park, Inc., 943 F.2d 261, 267 (3d Cir. 1991) (quoting Beard v. Braunstein, 914 F.2d 434, 444 (3d Cir. 1990); s ee also 28 U.S.C. § \n157(b)(1)(B)  (setting  forth  non- exhaustive  list of  the types  of matters  that are considered  “core”  \nproceedings).  \nCase 23-50370-TMH    Doc 74    Filed 03/26/25    Page 6 of 157 \n  “Distinctions between ‘arising under,’ ‘arising in’ (both core) and ‘related to’ (non- core) \nproceedings are not relevant to a determination of subject matter jurisdiction when the \nproceeding has been filed before plan confirmation.”  In  re Penson Worldwide, Inc. , 587 B.R.  6, \n12 (Bankr.  D. Del.  2018).  “ Post-confirmation, however, bankruptcy jurisdiction over non- core \nproceedings narrows; it exists only if there is ‘a close nexus to the bankruptcy plan or \nproceeding.’  In contrast, in core proceedings the close nexus test does not apply; bankruptcy \njurisdi ction remains the same as  it was pre -confirmation.”  Penson, 587 B.R. at 12.  As the \nparties here agree that the claims at issue in Defendant’s Motion are not “core” matters, \njurisdiction over them turns on whether the “close nexus” test is satisfied.  See Resorts Int’l Fin., \nInc. v. Price Waterhouse & Co. (In re Resorts Int’l., Inc.) , 372 F.3d 154, 166- 67 (3d Cir. 2004)  \n(after a plan of reorganization has been confirmed, “the essential inquiry” to determine whether a \nBankruptcy Court has jurisdiction over non- core proceedings is “whether there is a close nexus \nto the bankruptcy plan or proceeding.”) .    \n“At the post -confirmation stage, the claim must affect an integral aspect of the \nbankruptcy process –there must be a close nexus to the bankruptcy plan or proceeding.”  In re \nResorts Int'l, Inc., 372 F.3d 154, 167 (3d Cir. 2004).  “To a certain extent, litigation trusts by \ntheir nature maintain a connection to the bankruptcy even after the plan has been confirmed.”  Id.  \n“The question is how close a connection warrants post -confirmation bankruptcy jurisdiction.”  \nId.  “Matters that affect the interpretation, implementation, consummation, execution, or \nadministration of the confirmed plan will typically have the requisite close nexus.”  Id.   “Under \nthose circumstances, bankruptcy court jurisdiction would not raise the specter of ‘unending \njurisdiction’ over continuing trusts.”  \n \nCase 23-50370-TMH    Doc 74    Filed 03/26/25    Page 7 of 158 \n B. Analysis \nThe Trustee makes several arguments in support of jurisdiction.  First, he argues that this \nCourt’s continued jurisdiction over this matter was expressly contemplated by the parties and \nprovided for in the Plan and the Confirmation Order.21  This argument is not persuasive.  \nRetention of jurisdiction provisions within a plan alone are insufficient to grant subject matter \njurisdiction because “neither the bankruptcy court nor the parties can write their own \njurisdictional ticket.”  Resorts Int’l Fin., Inc. v. Price Waterhouse & Co. (In re Resorts Int’l., \nInc.), 372 F.3d 154, 161 (3d Cir. 2004).  In other words, “[i]f there is no jurisdiction under 28 \nU.S.C. § 1334 or 28 U.S.C. § 157, retention of jurisdiction provisions in a plan of reorganization \nor trust agreement are fundamentally irrelevant.”  Id.  Bankruptcy courts may give effect to such \nprovisions only where there is subject matter jurisdiction underlying the action.  Id.   Thus, where \nthe matter falls within the “related to” category of jurisdiction, retention of jurisdiction \nprovisions are effective only where the dispute shares the requisite close nexus to the \nbankruptcy. \nThe Trustee acknowledges that the provisions do not themselves confer jurisdiction but \nargues that they provide proof of a close nexus, citing the AstroPower  decision, where the Court \nheld that the retention of jurisdiction provision’s inclusion of the specific cause of action at issue \ndemonstrated a close nexus between the claim and the bankruptcy case.   AstroPower Liquidating \nTr. v. Xantrex Tech., Inc. (In re AstroPower Liquidating Tr.) , 335 B.R. 309, 325 (Bankr. D. Del. \n \n21 See Plan §6.4 (providing “[t]he Bankruptcy Court shall retain jurisdiction of this case with regard to the \nfollowing matters: . . . (v) to adjudicate any cause of action which may exist in favor of the Debtor, \nincluding preference and fraudulent transfer causes of action and Assigned Litigation Claims; and (vi) to \nhear any other matter not inconsistent with the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code”); Confirmation Order \n¶ 30 (“[t]he Court will retain jurisdiction over the Chapter 11 Case, all matters arising out of or related to \nthe Chapter 11 Case and the Plan, the matters set forth in Article XIV of the Plan, and other applicable \nprovisions of the Plan, including jurisdiction to . . . e) adjudicate any Cause of Action, including \nAvoidance Actions and Assigned Litigation Claims”).   \nCase 23-50370-TMH    Doc 74    Filed 03/26/25    Page 8 of 159 \n 2005).  But AstroPower  is distinguishable on its facts.  There, as the Court noted, the Plan \n“specifically describe[d] an action over which the Court had ‘related to’ jurisdiction pre-\nconfirmation and expressly provide[d] for the retention of such jurisdiction to liquidate that \nclaim for the benefit of the estate's creditors[.]” Id.   Here,  however, unlike the claims at issue in \nAstroPower , the Assigned Investor Claims are neither claims over -which the Court had pre-\nconfirmation jurisdiction, nor claims that will be liquidated for the benefit of the estate’s \ncreditors.   They are instead third-party claims never subject to this Court’s jurisdiction, which \nwill be liquidated for the benefit of only those equity holders who assigned them.  In other \nwords, the Assigned Investor Claims are claims by non-debtors against non-debtors.  As the \nThird Circuit has made clear, “bankruptcy jurisdiction will not extend to a dispute between non-\ndebtors unless the dispute creates ‘the logical possibility that the estate will be affected.’”  In re \nResorts Int'l, Inc., 372 F.3d 154, 165 (3d Cir. 2004) (quoting In re Federal –Mogul Global, Inc., \n300 F.3d 368, 380 (3d Cir.2002)).  The dispute at the center of the Assigned Investor Claims \ndoes not.   \nThe Trustee disagrees, noting that in the event any proceeds aris e from a combination of \nboth Assigned Investor Claims and Estate Claims  the Plan provides that such proceeds would be \nshared by all creditors.22  But th e fact that the Plan provides for this remote contingency is not \nenough.  Even in the event of such a scenario, the logical outcome would be that the proceeds \nwould be allocated along claim lines .  In other words, the Investors would still likely be the only \nones to receive proceeds arising from the Assigned Investor Claims and the only proceeds likely \nto be allocated to the creditor body as a whole are those arising from  Estate Claims.  Thus, even \n \n22 See Plan  at 3-8. \nCase 23-50370-TMH    Doc 74    Filed 03/26/25    Page 9 of 1510 \n under the “combination proceeds” scenario, the dispute at the center of the  Assigned Investor \nClaims is not one that will affect the estate in its entirety.  \nFor these reasons, the Motion is granted with respect to Counts II through VIII for lack of \nsubject matter jurisdiction.   \nII. Failure to State a Claim  \nA.   Legal Standard  \nA motion to dismiss pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) serves to test \nthe sufficiency of the complaint, and a court’s role is to determine whether the plaintiff is entitled \nto offer evidence in support of its claims. Semerenko  v. Cendant Corp., 223 F.3d 165, 173 (3d \nCir. 2000); Paul v. Intel Corp. (In re Intel Corp. Microprocessor Antitrust Litig.) , 496 F. Supp. \n2d 404, 407 (D. Del. 2007) (citing Kost v. Kozakiewicz , 1 F.3d 176, 183 (3d Cir. 1993)). To \nsurvive a motion to dismiss, a plaintiff must allege well- pleaded facts with sufficient detail to \n“state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.” Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly , 550 U.S. 544, \n570 (2007); Fowler v. UPMC Shadyside , 578 F.3d 203, 210 (3d Cir. 2009) ( citing Ashcr oft v. \nIqbal , 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009)).  \nThe Third Circuit has adopted a two- part analysis that courts must employ when deciding \na motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim. Fowler , 578 F.3d at 210. “First, the factual and \nlegal elements of a claim should be separated” with the reviewing court accepting “all of the complaint’s well- pleaded facts as true, but . . . disregard[ing] any legal conclusions.” Id . at 210-\n11. Next, the reviewing court must “determine whether the facts alleged in the complaint are sufficient to show that the plaintiff has a ‘plausible claim for relief.’” Id . (quoting Iqbal , 556 U.S. \nat 679); Gellert v. Coltec Indus., Inc. (In re Crucible Materials Corp.) , Nos. 09- 11582 & 11-\n53885, 2012 WL 5360945, at *3 (Bankr. D. Del. Oct. 31, 2012). “The plausibility standard is not akin to a ‘probability requirement,’ but it asks for more than a sheer possibility that a defendant \nCase 23-50370-TMH    Doc 74    Filed 03/26/25    Page 10 of 1511 \n has acted unlawfully.” Iqbal , 556 U.S. at 679. “Where the well -pleaded facts do not permit the \ncourt to infer more than the mere possibility of misconduct, the complaint has alleged—but it has \nnot 'show[n]'—'that the pleader is entitled to relief.’” Id. at 679 (quoting Fed. R. Civ. Proc. 8(a)(2)). This “plausibility” determination will be “a context- specific task that requires the \nreviewing court to draw on its judicial experience and common sense.” Id. \nB. Analysis  \nWith the dismissal of the Assigned Investor Claims, only one claim remains against \nDefendant Washington.  In Count I, the Trustee asserts a claim for breach of contract arising out of Washington’s failure to provide the $50 million consideration contemplated by the Seed Agreement.  Washington raises several arguments as to why the Trustee has failed to state a \nclaim for breach of contract, but I need only reach the first: that the contract is  unenforceable.  \nWashington argues that the Trustee’s breach of contract claim is barred by the doctrine of in \npari delicto .  “In pari delicto, Latin for ‘in equal fault,’ is a general rule that courts will not \nextend aid to either of the parties to a criminal act or listen to their complaints against each other but will leave them where their own act has placed them.”  Geronta Funding v. Brighthouse Life Ins. Co., 284 A.3d 47, 64 (Del. 2022) (internal citations omitted).  A separate concept , but one \nthat often overlaps wit h in pari delicto is  the principle  that agreements made for the purpose of \nperpetrating a fraud  are unenforceable.  15 C\nORBIN ON CONTRACTS § 85.1 (2025) (noting that it \nis an “accepted tenet of contract law” that bargains made for the purpose of defrauding third \npersons “contradict[] public policy and cannot be enforced).  While the parties refer to the two \nconcepts interchangeably, it is the latter that is mostly clearly applicable here.   \n Though the precise argument  varied in form across the briefing and at oral argument, the \ncrux of Washington’s position  is that because the Debtor was  alleged to be at least equally  \nCase 23-50370-TMH    Doc 74    Filed 03/26/25    Page 11 of 1512 \n responsible for the fraudulent scheme to use the Seed Agreement to lure investors, the Trustee \n(who stands in the shoes of the Debtor) is now barred from enforcing it.  I agree.     \nThe Trustee alleges in the Complaint that the primary purpose of  the Seed Agreement \nwas to  convince  prospective investors that Washington was already committed to invest $50 \nmillion, even though, pursuant to parties’ the Side Agreement, he  was not :         \n27.  In order to be able to convince outside investors to invest in Augustus, Haupt \nneeded to present Washington, the son of a billionaire, as the lead investor in \nAugustus. The key to his fundraising efforts was to show that Washington had \nentered into an iron- clad subscription agreement where he committed to invest in \nAugustus. \n \n28. However, unbeknownst to Haupt at the time, Washington was not in a position to contribute the datacenters to Augustus as he did not have management control over CW Investment Partners and CW Mining. Further, [Washington’s counsel] , \nJoon Hur (“ Hur”) [ ], indicated that Washington did not want to bear the risk of an \ninvestment of this scale without substantial support from other investors . \n 29. Haupt advised Washington and his attorneys that several wealthy individuals located in the United States and Europe were interested in investing in Augustus, and that Washington’s $50 million investment was key to securing these additional \ninvestments.   \n 30. In screenshots of WhatsApp Message sent on November 22, 2018 between Hur and Augustus’ general counsel, Ramsey Taylor (“ Taylor ”), Haupt previously \nindicated that he did not want any conditions attached to Washington’s investment, stating “[o]bviously we are working on the other $30 million but we have to show other investors our lead investor, Kevin!.” Haupt also wrote: “ I just want to show \nthem [“the Contract we have with Kevin”] so they give the final signature and we \ncan start putting the funds from their side into Augustus Intelligence .” Upon \ninformation and belief, the deal between Haupt and Washington nearly fell apart over the issue of who would commit first to invest: Washington or Haupt’s outside investors. \n \n   * * * *   \n 45. [ ] Haupt and Washington attended breakfast and lunch meetings with prospective investors, including the Augustus Investors, to discuss the prospect of investing in Augustus. At these meeting, Washington was introduced as the lead investor, having comm itted to invest over $50 million in Augustus. When \nrequested, Haupt, with Washington’s full knowledge and consent, provided copies \nof the KW Seed Agreement as proof of Washington’s investment. Neither Haupt \nCase 23-50370-TMH    Doc 74    Filed 03/26/25    Page 12 of 1513 \n nor Washington informed the prospective investors at these meetings about the Side \nDeal when making these representations.  \n \n46.  After these in -person meetings, the Augustus Investors each executed separate \nsubscription agreements, some in the United States and some in Europe, and wired their investments to Augustus in the United States. At the time they made their \ninvestments, each of the Augustus Investors believed Augustus had secured $50 \nmillion from its lead investor, Washington. They relied on this representation as it \nwas critical to their decision to invest.  \n 47. Upon information and belief, Washington never intended to close on his obligations under the KW Seed Agreement because he was counting on the \nexistence of the Side Agreement, which, while unenforceable, would have been material to a reasonably prudent investor, such as  the Augustus Investors, when \nmaking a decision whether or not to invest in Augustus. No prudent investor, including the Augustus Investors, would have made a decision to invest had the existence of the Side Agreement been disclosed to them in advance.\n23 \n \nThese allegations demonstrate that  the Seed Agreement was  not just incidental to  the alleged \nfraud, it was the cornerstone  of the entire plan .  This is perhaps most apparent in a single \nallegation, which states:   \nHaupt and Washington agreed to a plan where Washington would execute a written, unconditional subscription agreement agreeing to invest $50 million in cash and in-kind assets into Augustus, and Haupt would use that agreement to raise at least $30 million in additional funds from outside investors. Since the subscription agreement could not contain any financing contingency, Haupt and Washington agreed to house that condition in a secret, verbal side deal [ ].\n24 \n \nThe only reasonable conclusion to be drawn from these alleged facts is that the Seed Agreement \nwas entered into for the purpose of perpetrating a fraud and is therefore an illegal contract .      \n “[C]ourts generally will not enforce an illegal contract based upon ‘the elementary \nprinciple that one who has himself participated in a violation of law cannot be permitted to assert in a court of justice any right founded upon or growing out of the illegal transaction.’”  Sender v. Simon, 84 F.3d 1299, 1307 (10th Cir. 1996) (quoting Gibbs & Sterrett Mfg. Co. v. Brucker , 111 \n \n23 Complaint ¶¶ 27 – 47. \n24 Complaint ¶ 31.  \nCase 23-50370-TMH    Doc 74    Filed 03/26/25    Page 13 of 1514 \n U.S. 597, 601 (1884)).  The facts of the Sender  case are remarkably similar  to those alleged here .  \nThere, the bankruptcy trustee asserted claims against investors in a limited partnership to recover \ndistributions received by the investors that exceed ed their contributions  and were therefore in \nviolation of the partnership agreement.  The investors moved for summary judgment on the grounds that the partnership agreement  was unenforceable because the partnership  was created as \npart of an illegal P onzi scheme.   The Court agreed : \nThough the Debtor  Partnerships were not illegal per se, it is beyond peradventure \nthey were created and operated in furtherance of a fraudulent and illegal \ninvestment scheme. To the extent HSA L.P. was created as a vehicle to further the Ponzi scheme and u tilized to give the scheme a veneer of legitimacy, it was in \nutter complicity with Mr. Donahue's fraud.  HSA L.P., acting through Mr. Donahue and HIA Inc., fraudulently induced the participation of Mr. Simon and the Baker Partnership in the scheme by misre presenting both the true nature of the \nHedged Investments fund and the partnership's role in perpetuation of the fraud. In other words, with regard to its interactions with Mr. Simon and the Baker Partnership, HSA L.P.'s purpose was an illegal one. It furt hered this illegal \npurpose by fraudulently inducing Mr. Simon and the Baker Partnership to execute the partnership agreements.  \n \nMr. Sender, standing in the shoes of HSA L.P., now seeks to enforce the partnership agreements against Mr. Simon and the Baker Partnership. Following the suggestions of our fellow jurists, this court will not aid in the enforcement of an agreement that was  fraudulently procured in furtherance of an illegal \npurpose.  See Merrill , 77 Bankr. at 857;  Tri-Q, 404 P.2d at 498. That Mr. Sender \nacts as a trustee in bankruptcy cannot lend strength to the partnership's position.  \n \nSender v. Simon, 84 F.3d 1299, 1307 (10th Cir. 1996) .   \n This analysis applies with equal force to the facts of this case. The facts alleged in the \nComplaint make clear that the Seed Agreement was a tool created to lend legitimacy to an d offer \nassurances about an  otherwise risky investment proposal .  While the Trustee argues  that the \nunderlying transaction here, unlike the Ponzi scheme in Sender , was not illegal, this does nothing \nto alter the analysis .  The unwillingness  of courts to enforce illegal contracts is not limited to \ncontracts that are illegal on their face:  \nCase 23-50370-TMH    Doc 74    Filed 03/26/25    Page 14 of 1515 \n A bargain may be illegal by reason of the wrongful purpose of one or both of the \nparties making it. This is true even though the performances bargained for are not \nin themselves illegal and even though in the absence of the illegal purpose the bargain would be valid and enforceable. A party who makes such a bargain in \nfurtherance of his wrongful purpose cannot enforce it….  \nTri-Q, Inc. v. Sta- Hi Corp., 63 Cal. 2d 199, 404 P.2d 486, 498 (Cal. 1965)  (quoting 6A Corbin \non Contracts § 1518, at 744 (1962)).  Here, even assuming the Seed Agreement, standing alone, \nis lawful, the fact that it was allegedly used by the Debtor in furtherance of a fraud  compels the \nconclusion that  the Debtor is barred from enforcing the agreement as a matter of  public policy.  \n For these reasons, Count I of the Complaint is also dismissed.   The parties shall confer and submit an appropriate form of order under certification of \ncounsel.     \nDated:  March 26, 2025     ____________________________________ \n       John T.

Highline Innovation Investments Partnership, LLC accused Biolert of misrepresenting that their system utilized machine learning and artificial intelligence for improved detection accuracy, which was a crucial factor in their investment decision. The court denied the defendants' motion to dismiss, allowing Highline's claims, which include fraud and breach of implied warranty, to proceed.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether Highline's claims of fraud and misrepresentation, regarding Biolert's technology allegedly using AI and machine learning, were sufficiently pleaded to survive a motion to dismiss.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court denied the defendants’ motion to dismiss, finding that Highline's allegations were sufficiently detailed to move forward at this stage of litigation, and also rejected the defendants' arguments related to Highline's capacity to sue and claims under the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: This case is about a company, Highline, that wanted to buy technology from another company, Biolert. Highline says Biolert tricked them and made the technology sound way cooler, saying it used advanced computer AI to help people with epilepsy. When Highline found out this might not be true, they wanted to back out and get their money back.

Having reviewed the motion, the response s, and the \napplicable law, the Court finds that the motion should be  DENIED. \nBACKGROUND \n This contractual dispute aris es out of the  international acquisition of intellectual property \nrights  pertaining to seizure alert techn ology. Defendant Biolert , Ltd (“Biolert”) is an Israeli entity \nthat developed the “Biolert System,” “the industry’s first actionable seizure alert system that uses off-the-shelf wearable technology—making the system accessible to anyone living with epileps y” \n(Dkt.  #20 ¶  10). Defendants Guy Wilnai, Ruben Kuzniecky, Uri Kramer, and Hezy Shalev are \nalleged to collectively be the majority shareholders of Biolert (Dkt. #20 ¶ 13). In early 2018, \nBiolert began holding discussions with prospective Australian invest ors about merging Biolert into \na publicly- listed entity on the Australian Securities Exchange (Dkt. #20 at ¶ 15). O ne of those Case 4:21-cv-00615-ALM     Document 46     Filed 08/12/22     Page 1 of 12 PageID #: \n<pageID>2 investors was Plaintiff Highline Innovation Investments Partnership, LLC (“Highline”).  \nTo encourage investor participation, Biole rt prepared a PowerPoint presentation (the “June \n2018 Presentation”)  representing “that Biolert’s proprietary software algorithm utilized ‘Machine \nlearning/Artificial Intelligence (AI)’  for personalized analytics, false alarm[, and] seizure \ndetection” (Dkt . #20 ¶ 20). The use of AI technology—or “machine learning”—was incredibly \nattractive to investors because it allowed the software’s algorithm to be “adaptive so its behavior \ncan change (by deriving new and important insights) over time based on new data obtained from users of the software” (Dkt. #20 ¶ 21). More s pecifically:  \n[B]y gathering user movement data which would then be analyzed by machine \nlearning, Biolert was confirming to investors that its software was able to better recognize and adapt to user  movements that were not epileptic seizures (thereby \ndecreasing false alarms) and movement s that were epileptic seizures (thereby \nincreasing seizure detection accuracy)  \n (Dkt. #20 ¶ 22). Without this AI technology, the Biolert System’s extremely low rate of false \nalarms —which was represented as less than .01 percent  per day —would not have been possible \n(Dkt. #20 ¶ 26). The Presentation also represented that Biolert had conducted a study with the \nEpilepsy Foundation of Texas ( the “EFTX” ).\n1 The study s howed that the Biolert system had a \nninety- five percent success rate in accurately  detecting seizures , which —according to the June \n2018 Presentation —earned Biolert a national endorsement from the EFTX.   \n On December 1, 2018, the American Epilepsy Society (“AES”) hosted its annual \nconference in New Orleans, LA. The AES conference, which is touted as the largest of its kind, “showcases the latest research, products, services and technology related to epilepsy and other neurology- related disorders to investor s and members of the epilepsy community” (Dkt. #20 \n \n1 EFTX “is one of the largest of the fifty state affiliates of the Epilepsy Foundation, which is the nationwide epilepsy \numbrella organization that provides community services, public education, advocacy, seizure first aid training, and \nresearch funding for  more than 3.4 million individuals in the United States that suffer from epilepsy” (Dkt. #20 ¶ 23).  Case 4:21-cv-00615-ALM     Document 46     Filed 08/12/22     Page 2 of 12 PageID #: \n<pageID>3 at ¶ 28). Here, Biolert again prepared a presentation (the “AES Presentation”) for potential \ninvestors (Dkt. #20 at  ¶ 28). In the AES presentation, Biolert showcased its use of “Machine \nlearning / Artificial Intelligence (‘AI’) for personalized analytics, false alarm & seizure detection” \n(Dkt. #20 at  ¶ 29). Biolert also again represented that the Biolert S ystem had a seizure detection \naccuracy rate of ninety -five percent  (Dkt. #20 at  ¶ 28). \n In January  2019, Biolert and Highline began negotiations for Highline to license or acquire \nthe Biolert System (Dkt. #20 at  ¶¶ 32 –33). During negotiations , Highline was provided with, \namong other things, the June 2018 Presentation and the AES Presentation (Dkt. #20 at  ¶ 33). \nSubsequently, on February 11, 2019, Highline entered  a contract with Biolert (the “Term Sheet”) \n(Dkt. #20 at  ¶ 35). Under the Term Sheet , the parties’  agreed that Highline would acquire Biolert’s \npatent rights and technology rights , defined as nonpubl ic information, trade secret, know -how, and \nconfidential information , in exchange for certain consideration (Dkt. #27 at p. 5). \nHowever, Highline  alleges that it eventually learned Biolert’s claims in the June 2018 \nPresentation  and AES Presentation  concerning the accuracy and ingenuity of the Biolert System \nwere misrepresentations (Dkt. #20 at  ¶ 38). For instance, Highline alleges it discovered the Biolert \nSystem  “never utilize d artificial intelligence, machine learning, or any adaptive algorithms” \n(Dkt.  #20 at  ¶ 39). Consequently, Highline alerted Biolert of its intention not to proceed with the \nacquisition of Biolert’s  intellectual property assets and formally demanded  the return of \nconsideration paid by Highline under the Term Sheet  (Dkt. #20 at  ¶ 43). \nOn November 16, 2021, Highline sued Defendant s for the following causes of action: \ncommon law fraud; fraud by non- disclosure; fraud in the inducement; lifting the corporate veil; \nnegligent misrepresentation; various violations of the Texa s Deceptive Trade Practices Act \n(“DTPA”) ; and breach of the implied warranty of merchantability  (Dkt. #20). On  November 30, Case 4:21-cv-00615-ALM     Document 46     Filed 08/12/22     Page 3 of 12 PageID #: \n<pageID>4 2021, Defendants filed the present motion (Dkt. #27). On December 14, 2021, Highline filed its \nresponse (Dkt. # 31). On December 21, 2021, Defendants filed a reply (Dkt. #32). \nLEGAL STANDARDS  \nI. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6)  \n The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure require that each claim in a complaint include a “short  \nand plain statement  . . . showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.”  F ED. R. CIV. P. 8(a)(2).  Each \nclaim must include enough factual allegations “to raise a right to relief above the speculative level.”  \nBell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly , 550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007).   \n A Rule 12(b)(6) motion allows a party to move for dismissal of an action when the \ncomplaint fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.  FED. R. CIV. P. 12(b)(6).  When \nconsidering a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), the Court must accept as true all well -pleaded \nfacts in the plaintiff’s complaint and view those facts in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.  Bowlby v. City of Aberdeen , 681 F.3d 215, 219 (5th Cir. 2012).  The Court may consider “the \ncomplaint, any docume nts attached to the complaint, and any documents attached to the motion to \ndismiss that are central to the claim and referenced by the complaint.”  Lone Star Fund V (U.S.), L.P. v. Barclays Bank PLC , 594 F.3d 383, 387 (5th Cir. 2010).  The Court must then determine \nwhether the complaint states a claim for relief that is plausible on its face.  “A claim has facial \nplausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the [C]ourt to draw the reasonable \ninference that the defendant is liable for t he misconduct alleged.”  Gonzalez v. Kay , 577 F.3d 600, \n603 (5th Cir. 2009) (quoting Ashcroft v. Iqbal , 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009)).  “But where the well -\npleaded facts do not permit the [C]ourt to infer more than the mere possibility of misconduct, the \ncompl aint has alleged —but it has not ‘show[n]’ —‘that the pleader is entitled to relief.’”  Iqbal , \n556 U.S. at 679 (quoting F\nED. R. CIV. P. 8(a)(2)).   Case 4:21-cv-00615-ALM     Document 46     Filed 08/12/22     Page 4 of 12 PageID #: \n<pageID>5 In Iqbal , the Supreme Court established a two- step approach for assessing the sufficiency \nof a complaint in th e context of a Rule 12(b)(6) motion.  First, the Court should identify and \ndisregard conclusory allegations, for they are “not entitled to the assumption of truth.”  Iqbal , 556 \nU.S. at 664.  Second, the Court “consider[s] the factual allegations in [the complaint] to determine \nif they plausibly suggest an entitlement to relief.”  Id.  “This standard ‘simply calls for enough facts to raise a reasonable expectation that discovery will reveal evidence of the necessary claims or elements.’”  Morgan v. Hubert , 335 F. App’x 466, 470 (5th Cir. 2009) (citation omitted).  This \nevaluation will “be a context -specific task that requires the reviewing court to draw on its judicial \nexperience and common sense.”  Iqbal , 556 U.S. at 679. \nThus, “[t]o survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, \naccepted as true, to ‘state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.”’  Id.  at 678 (quoting \nTwombly , 550 U.S. at 570).   \nII. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b)  \n Rule 9(b) states, “[i]n alleging fraud or mistake, a party must state with particularity the \ncircumstances constituting fraud or mistake.  Malice, intent, knowledge, and other conditions of a person’s mind may be alleged generally.”  F\nED. R. CIV. P. 9(b).   \nRule 9(b)’s particularity requirement generally means that the pleader must set forth the \n“who, what, when, where, and how” of the fraud alleged.  United States ex rel. Williams v. Bell Helicopter Textron, Inc., 417 F.3d 450, 453 (5th Cir . 2005).  A plaintiff pleading fraud must \n“specify the statements contended to be fraudulent, identify the speaker, state when and where the statements were made, and explain why the statements were fraudulent.”  Herrmann Holdings Ltd. v. Lucent Techs. Inc., 302 F.3d 552, 564–65 (5th Cir. 2002).  The goals of Rule 9(b) are to “provide[] defendants with fair notice of the plaintiffs’ claims, protect[] defendants from harm to Case 4:21-cv-00615-ALM     Document 46     Filed 08/12/22     Page 5 of 12 PageID #: \n<pageID>6 their reputation and goodwill, reduce[] the number of strike suits, and prevent[] pl aintiffs from \nfiling baseless claims.”  U.S. ex rel. Grubbs v. Kanneganti , 565 F.3d 180, 190 (5th Cir. 2009) \n(citing Melder v. Morris , 27 F.3d 1097, 1100 (5th Cir. 1994)).  Courts are to read Rule 9(b)’s \nheightened pleading requirement in conjunction with Rule 8(a)’s insistence on simple, concise, \nand direct allegations.  Williams v. WMX Techs., Inc ., 112 F.3d 175, 178 (5th Cir. 1997).  However, \nthis requirement “does not ‘reflect a subscription to fact pleading.’”  Grubbs , 565 F.3d at 186.   \nFailure to com ply with Rule 9(b)’s requirements authorizes the Court to dismiss the \npleadings as it would for failure to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6).  United States ex rel. Williams v. McKesson Corp., No. 3:12- CV-0371- B, 2014 WL 3353247, at *3 (N.D. Tex. July 9, 2014) \n(citing Lovelace v. Software Spectrum, Inc ., 78 F.3d 1015, 1017 (5th Cir. 1996)).  \nIII. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(f)  \nRule 12(f) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides “the court may strike from a \npleading an insufficient defense or any re dundant, immaterial, impertinent, or scandalous matter.”  \nF\nED. R. CIV. P. 12(f). The Court has the authority to act on its own or pursuant to a “motion made \nby a party either before responding to the pleading or, if a response is not allowed, within 21 days after being served with the pleading. F\nED. R. CIV. P. 12(f) (1–2). The Fifth Circuit has stated that \nmotions to strike are generally disfavored. See Kaiser Aluminum & Chem. Sales, Inc. v. Avondale Shipyards , 677 F.2d 1045, 1058 (5th Cir. 1982). They are viewed with disfavor and infrequently \ngranted, both because striking portions of pleadings is a drastic remedy and because it is often sought by a movant simply as a dilatory tactic. See Bailey Lumber & Supply Co. v. Georgia- Pacific \nCorp., 2010 WL 1141133, at *4–5 (S.D. Miss. Mar. 19, 2010) (citing FDIC v. Niblo, 821 F. Supp. 441 (N.D. Tex. 1993)). Although motions to strike are disfavored and infrequently granted, striking certain allegations can be appropriate when they have no possible relation to the Case 4:21-cv-00615-ALM     Document 46     Filed 08/12/22     Page 6 of 12 PageID #: \n<pageID>7 controversy and may cause prejudice to one of the parties. Jefferson Parish Consol. Garbage Dist. \nNo. 1 v. Waste Mgmt. of La., 2010 WL 1731204, at *5 (E.D. La. Apr. 28, 2010) (citing Boreri v. \nFiat S.p.A., 763 F.2d 17, 23 (1st Cir. 1985); B erry v. Lee, 428 F. Supp. 2d 546, 563 (N.D. Tex. \n2006); McInerney v. Moyer Lumber & Hardware, Inc. , 244 F. Supp. 2d 393, 401 (E.D. Pa. 2002)). \nThe Court possesses considerable discretion in ruling on a motion to strike. Bailey , 2010 WL \n1141133, at *4–5 (ci ting Niblo , 821 F. Supp. at 449). \nIV. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15  \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(a) governs a party’ s request to amend its pleading \nbefore a scheduling order ’s deadline to amend passes. F ED. R. CIV. P. 15(a).  Rule 15(a) provides \nthat a party may amend its pleading once without seeking leave of court or the consent of the \nadverse party at any time before a responsive pleading is served. Id. After a responsive pleading \nis served, “a party may amend only with the opposing party’ s written  consent or the court ’s \nleave.” Id. Rule 15(a) instructs the court to freely give leave when justice so requires.”  Id. The rule \n“evinces a bias in favor of granting leave to amend.”  Jones  v. Robinson Prop. Grp., L.P., 427 F.3d \n987, 994 (5th Cir. 2005) (quoting Lyn -Lea Travel  Corp. v. Am. Airlines,  Inc., 283 F.3d 282, 286 \n(5th Cir. 2002)). But leave to amend “is not automatic.”  Matagorda Ventures,  Inc. v. Travelers  \nLloyds  Ins. Co., 203 F. Supp. 2d 704, 718 (S.D. Tex. 2000) (citing Dussouy  v. Gulf Coast  Inv. \nCorp., 660 F.2d 594, 598 (5th Cir. 1981)). Whether to grant leave to amend “lies within the sound \ndiscretion of the district court.”  Little  v. Liquid Air Corp., 952 F.2d 841, 845–46 (5th Cir. 1992). \nA district court reviewing a motion to amend pleadings under Rule 15(a) considers five factors: \n(1) undue delay; (2) bad faith or dilatory motive; (3) repeated failure to cure deficiencies by \nprevious amendments; (4) undue prejudice to the opposing party; and (5) futility of  amendment.  Case 4:21-cv-00615-ALM     Document 46     Filed 08/12/22     Page 7 of 12 PageID #: \n<pageID>8 Smith  v. EMC , 393 F.3d  590, 595 (5th Cir. 2004) (citing Foman v. Davis , 371 U.S. 178, 182 \n(1962)) . \nANALYSIS  \nI. Dismissal Under Rule 12(b)(6)   \nDefendants  request dismissal of this matter under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) \nfor a multitude of reasons. Defendants first argue that Highline lacked capacity to initiate this \nlitigation because Highline’s corporate privileges were forfeited at the time  this suit was filed. \nDefendants  next assert four statutory reasons why Highline’s DTPA claim should be dismissed: \n(1) the claim is barred under Texas Business and Commerce Code § 17.49(f)  “because Highline’s \nlawsuit arises out of a non- residential transaction exceeding $100,00.00 in total consideration \nwhere Highline was represented by legal counsel” (Dkt. #27 at p. 3); (2) the claim is barred under \nTexas Business and Commerce Code § 17.49(g)  because “Highline’s lawsuit arises out of a non -\nresidential tran saction  or set of transactions related to the same project exceeding $500,000.00 in \ntotal consideration” (Dkt. #27 at p. 3); (3) the claim is barred under Texas Business and Commerce Code § 17.45(4)  because intellectual property is neither a “good” nor a “service” under the DTPA \n(Dkt. #27 at p. 15) ; and (4) limited liability companies are not included within the definition of \n“consumers”  that may bring suit under the DTP A. Finally, Defendants argue t hat Highline’s DTPA \nclaim and negligent misrepresentation claim are both barred by limitations because Highline failed to sue within two years of discovering Defendants’ allegedly fraudulent acts.  \nA. Highline’s Capacity to Sue  \nAs noted, Defendants’  first arg ument for dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) asserts that when  \nthis lawsuit was initiated  on November 16, 2021, Highline lacked the capacity to sue. Defendants \nclaim that Highline forfeited its corporate privileges on or around April 20, 2021, for failure to pa y Case 4:21-cv-00615-ALM     Document 46     Filed 08/12/22     Page 8 of 12 PageID #: \n<pageID>9 the Texas state franchise tax (Dkt. #27 at p. 10). Defendants  also offer evidence showing that on \nAugust 20, 2021, the Texas Secretary of State (the “SOS”) forfeited Highline’s corporate charter \n(Dkt. #27, Exhibit 1).  \n“The capacity of a corporation to b ring suit is determined by the law of the state where it \nis organized.” Texas Clinical Labs, Inc. v. Leavitt , 535 F.3d 397, 403 (5th Cir. 2008); see also FED. \nR. CIV. P. 17(b)(3) (providing that for all parties that are not individuals or corporations, the   \n“capacity to sue or be sued is determined  . . . by the law of the state where the court is located.”). \nAccordingly, the Court will look to Texas law to determine whether Highline had capacity to sue. Id. The Texas Tax Code states that a “taxable entity”—which includes limited liability \ncompanies —forfeits its right to sue if the entity fails to pay its state franchise taxes. See T\nEX. TAX \nCODE §§ 171.252(2) , 171.0002 (including “limited liability company” under the definition of \n“taxable entity”). “If the c orporate privileges of a corporation are forfeited . .  . the corporation shall \nbe denied the right to sue or defend in a court of this state.” Id. at § 171.252(1).  \nTexas law also provides for the revival of corporate privileges. How revival occurs depends  \non when the entity remedied the condition that caused it to forfeit its corporate privileges. If the entity “pays any tax, penalty, or interest due” before  the forfeiture of its charter, the Texas \nComptroller “shall revive” its corporate privileges. T\nEX. TAX CODE at § 171.258; see also, \ngenerally, YHR Mason Road Partners, LP v. 7- 7 Cleaners, Inc., No. 01- 18-00849- CV, 2020 WL \n716732, at *5–6 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] Feb. 13, 2020)  (discussing the differences \nbetween forfeiture of corporate privileges and forfeiture of a charter). But if the entity fails to “revive its forfeited privileges within 120 days after  the date that the privileges were forfeited ,” \nthe SOS may forfeit the entity’s corporate charter.  T\nEX. TAX CODE § 171.309 (emphasis added) . \n“The SOS effects a forfeiture by inscribing on the corporation’ s record the words ‘ Charter Case 4:21-cv-00615-ALM     Document 46     Filed 08/12/22     Page 9 of 12 PageID #: \n<pageID>10 Forfeited, ’ the date on which this inscription is made, and a citation to” the Texas Tax Code . YHR \nMason, 2020 WL 716732, at *5–6 (citing T EX. TAX CODE § 171.311) . \nOnce an entity’s corporate charter has been forfeited by the SOS, the entity may  be “entitled \nto have its charter revived, and to have its corporate privileges r evived, if:  \n(1) the corporation files each report that is required by this chapter and that is \ndelinquent;  \n(2) the corporation pays the tax, penalty, and interest that is imposed by this chapter \nand that is due at the time the request under Section 171.313 of this code to set aside \nforfeiture is made; and  \n(3) the forfeiture of the corporation’ s charter or certificate is set aside in a \nproceeding under Section 171.313 of this code.  \n \nId. (citing TEX. TAX CODE § 171.312) . If these conditions are satisfied , the SOS “shall set aside” \nthe forfeiture of the corporation’ s charter.  Id. If the SOS sets aside the forfeiture of the charter, the \nComptroller “shall revive” the corporate privileges of the corporation. T EX. TAX CODE § 171.314. \n“Once the corpor ation pays the delinquent taxes and is reinstated, the payment relates back and \nrevives the corporate rights that were forfeited.” Flameout  Design  and Fabrication, Inc. v. \nPennzoil  Caspian Corp., 994 S.W.2d 830, 839 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 1999, no pet.).  \nThis same revival process applies to limited liability companies. Marshall Feature Recognition, \nLLC v. Pepsi -Cola Co., No. 6:12- CV-00956, 2015 WL 5912672, at *1 (E.D. Tex. Sept. 28, 2015). \nThe Court finds that when this suit was filed  on November 16, 2021, Highline had capacity \nto sue. Highline’s charter was forfeited by the SOS. However, n either party disputes that \nHighline’s charter —and thus its authority to transact business in Texas —was reinstated by the \nSOS on December 1, 2021 ( see Dkt. #31, Exhibit 1). And under Texas law, once an entity recovers \nits charter by paying its delinquent taxes, the entity’s “right to sue or defend is revived,” and the \nentity “may sue or defend all causes of action, regardless of whether such causes of action arose before or during the time period of forfeiture.”  G. Richard Goins Constr. Co., Inc. v. S.B. Case 4:21-cv-00615-ALM     Document 46     Filed 08/12/22     Page 10 of 12 PageID #: \n<pageID>11 McLaughlin Assoc., Inc., 930 S.W.2d 124, 128 (Tex. App.—Tyler 1996). Indeed, “the \nreinstatement of its charter will relate back an d revive whatever rights the corpora tion had at the \ntime the suit was filed.” Marshall Feature Recognition, 2015 WL 5912672, at * 2 (citing M  & M \nConst r. Co., Inc. v. Great Am. Ins. Co., 747 S.W.3d 552, 555 (Tex. App. 1998) ); see also NexBank \nSSB v. Bank Midwest, N.A., No. 3:12- CV-1882, 2012 WL 4321750, at *2 (N.D. Tex. Sept. 21, \n2012) (“But even taking judicial notice of the fact that Bank Midwest was not in good standing as \nof the date it filed its counterclaims, this does not demonstrate that Bank Midwest currently is not in good standing[ ] [b]ecause a corporation’s rights can be reinstated, and because the reinstatement of rights is retroactive[.]”) (emphasis in original). Thus, when Highline recovered its charter, its right to sue related back to April 20, 2021—th e date Highline forfeited its corporate \nprivileges . Accordingly, the Court finds that Highline does not lack capacity to litigate this matter.  \nB. Other Arguments Under Rule 12(b)(6)  \nAs to Defendants’ other arguments for dismissal under  Rule 12(b)(6), the Court finds these \nclaims are better suited for summary judgment. Accordingly, dismissal pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) \nis not warranted at this time .  \nII. Dismissal Under Rule 12(b)( 9)  \nDefendants  next request dismissal of this matter under Fede ral Rule of Civil Procedure \n12(b)( 9). Specifically, Defendants allege that Highline did not meet the heightened pleading \nstandard under Rule 12(b)(9) for its claims of common law fraud, fraud by non- disclosure, fraud \nin the inducement, negligent misreprese ntation, and DTPA claims (Dkt. #27 at p. 21).   \nAfter reviewing the se claims as pleaded in the current compla int, the Court finds that \nHighline  has stated plausible claim s for relief. Accordingly, the Court finds dismissal is not \nwarranted under Rule 12(b) (9).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Case 4:21-cv-00615-ALM     Document 46     Filed 08/12/22     Page 11 of 12 PageID #: \n<pageID>12 III. Motion to Strike Under Rules 12(f) and (15)  \nAs an alternative to dismissal, Defendants request the Court strike the Amended Complaint \nunder Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(f) and 15 based on Highline’s alleged lack of capacity \nto sue under § 171.252 of the Texas Tax Code (Dkt. #27 at pp. 29–30). The Court has resolved this issue under its Rule 12(b)(6) analysis above. Accordingly, the Court finds no reasons to grant Defendants’ motion on this ground under Rules 12(f) and 15.  \nCONCLUSION \nIt is therefore ORDERED that Defendants Ruben Kuzkiecky’s, Guy Wilnai’s, and Hezy \nShalev’s Consolidated Motion to Dismiss Under Federal Rules of Procedure 12(b)(6) and 9(b) and, in the alternative, Motion to Strike Plaintiff’s First Amended Complaint Under  Federal Rules \nof Civil Procedure 12(f) and 15 (Dkt. #27) is  DENIED.  \nIT IS SO ORDERED.
