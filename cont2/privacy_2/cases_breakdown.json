Specifically, Clarifai allegedly took photographs from OKCupid and used them to train and develop its facial recognition technology by extracting and utilizing biometric information (such as facial geometry) from those images. The AI-driven facial recognition system and related demographic models were central to the plaintiff\u2019s claims under the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA), as the technology processed and stored biometric identifiers without informed consent. The court\u2019s opinion notes that Clarifai sold its AI-powered demographic model to a small number of Illinois customers, but found those limited sales insufficient to establish the minimum contacts necessary for personal jurisdiction in Illinois.",
